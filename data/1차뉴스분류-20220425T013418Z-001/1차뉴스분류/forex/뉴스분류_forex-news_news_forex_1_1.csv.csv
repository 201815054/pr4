0,2022-04-17T01:19:54+0000,"China's latest wave of Covid restrictions has forced millions of people — roughly three times as many as live in New York City — to stay home and undergo mass virus testing in the metropolis of Shanghai.As Covid cases began to spike in late February, Shanghai tried to control the outbreak with targeted, neighborhood lockdowns. But the city, a center for global transport, manufacturing, finance and trade, decided in late March to implement a two-stage lockdown that soon applied to all districts, generally forcing people not to leave their apartments.Most people outside China know that Shanghai is big, but few realize just how big economically. The following numbers indicate the scale of Shanghai as an economic center — and may hint at the cost of the lockdown.
Shanghai's official permanent resident population in 2020 was 24.9 million.That's slightly less than Australia's population of 25.7 million, per the World Bank.But it's only 1.8% of China's 1.41 billion people.In terms of U.S. states, Shanghai is between the size of Florida (pop. 21.8 million) and Texas (pop. 29.5 million).In terms of U.S. cities, Shanghai is three times the size of New York City (pop. 8.3 million) — the largest city in the United States.That means the 280,120 Covid contacts Shanghai has reported as of Thursday for the latest outbreak represent only 1.1% of the city's population.
Shanghai's GDP grew by 8.1% in 2021 to 4.32 trillion yuan ($680.31 billion).That GDP is slightly more than Sweden's ($660.92 billion) and less than Poland ($720.35 billion), according to the IMF.But Shanghai's GDP was only 3.8% of China's national GDP of 114.37 trillion yuan in 2021, according to official figures.
Shanghai sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River, one of the two main rivers in China.According to Bernstein:Shanghai is home to the world's busiest port, followed by Singapore.Shanghai's Pudong airport is the world's third-busiest cargo airport, behind Memphis, Tennessee, and Hong Kong.In all, Shanghai accounted for 7.3% of China's exports and 14.4% of imports in 2021, according to Citi.
According to Citi, Shanghai is China's:Most important semiconductor manufacturing center, home to SMIC, Hua Hong and Universal Scientific Industrial.Home to many auto producers: SAIC Motor, SAIC's joint companies with Volkswagen and GM, Nio, Tesla and Ford.Headquarters or a major center for multinational corporations' China operations: Apple, L'Oreal, Samsung Electronics, P&G, L'Oreal, LVMH, Nike, Panasonic, Philips, Johnson & Johnson and General Electric, among others.Base for ship producers: Jiangnan , Zhonghua and Waigaoqiao shipbuilding.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the world's third-largest by market capitalization, behind the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq as of the end of 2020, according to World Federation of Exchanges data cited by the exchange.U.S. mutual fund giant Vanguard announced in 2020 a plan to move its Asia headquarters to Shanghai from Hong Kong.Fidelity's China finance business is based in Shanghai, as is American billionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater China operations.
In Shanghai, official figures for 2021 show:Average disposable income of 78,027 yuan ($12,288) — more than double the nationwide average of 35,128 yuan ($5,531).Average consumer spending of 48,879 yuan — also double the national average of 24,100 yuan.U.S. wholesale chain Costco chose Shanghai for its first mainland China store in 2019.And as of last year, Shanghai was home to the most coffee shops in the country, with nearly 3 shops per 10,000 people, versus a ratio of about 2 for Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing, according to Meituan.

Shanghai is home to three of the top 20 universities in China, according to U.S. News and World Report.The number of foreigners living in Shanghai fell to 163,954 people in 2020, down by 21% versus a decade earlier, according to official censuses. The southern province of Guangdong is now home to the most foreigners in China, at more than 400,000.The overall number of foreigners in the country rose during those 10 years by about 40% to 1.4 million people — or about 0.1% of China's population.",,,,,

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal is asking citizens living abroad to deposit funds in domestic banks as part of efforts to ensure the financial system has enough liquidity and to preserve foreign exchange reserves, finance finister Janardan Sharma said on Saturday. 
Speaking to Reuters, he denied Nepal was facing an economic crisis despite the impact of soaring commodity prices as the tourist industry, a key source of revenues, struggles to recover after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nepal, wedged between China and India, this month imposed curbs on luxury goods imports to rein in capital outflows. Foreign exchange reserves fell over 18% to $9.6 billion as of mid-March from mid-July - enough for around six months imports.
By depositing their savings in Nepal, overseas Nepalis would continue to ""maintain their link as well as benefit from 6 to 7% interest"" offered by Nepali banks, Sharma said.
Sharma said the economy did not face a crisis and Nepal's situation could not be compared with Sri Lanka. That South Asian country is facing its worst economic crisis in decades and anti-government protests.
In Nepal, remittances by overseas workers, which constitute nearly a quarter of the economy and are crucial for external payments, fell 3.0% to $5.3 billion between mid-July to mid-March, compared with a 5% increase in the same period a year earlier.
Earnings from tourism, which fell sharply after the start of the pandemic in 2020, are slowly picking up, but remain well below pre-COVID levels.
Sharma said if 100,000 Nepali nationals living abroad deposited $10,000 each in Nepali banks it could go a long way to help Nepal overcome the current liquidity constrains.

Nepal has also decided to accept $659 million in aid from the United States and about $150 million in soft loan from the World Bank, Sharma said.
""The money to be received from the United States over five years is a (non-refundable) grant,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The euro plunged to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde were viewed as a sign that the ECB was in no rush to raise interest rates, in contrast with an aggressive monetary policy tightening effort by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The European single currency fell to $1.0758, the lowest level since April 2020. It was last down 0.53% at $1.0827.
Lagarde said there was no clear timeframe for when rates would start to rise, adding that it could be weeks or even several months after the end of the ECB's stimulus scheme.
""We'll deal with interest rates when we get there,"" she added.
The ECB on Thursday concluded its latest meeting with cautious steps to unwind support and avoided a hard schedule. It confirmed plans to cut bond purchases, commonly known as quantitative easing, this quarter, then end them at some point in the third quarter.
Against sterling, the euro slid to a one-month low and was last down 0.28% at 82.79 pence.
Lagarde's comments were in stark contrast to those of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.
“They could have taken a book from what Jerome Powell has done, and that is to be aggressive rhetorically. Ms. Lagarde did not seem disposed to do that. She was more concerned apparently, and maybe understandably, about the Ukraine war and its impact on Europe,"" he said.
In addition to pushing up gasoline prices, the Russia-Ukraine war, now in its second month, has led to a global surge in food prices as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities including wheat and sunflower oil.
""Frankly, given how uncertain conditions are at the moment, Lagarde's caution can be justified, but it is fair to say that markets were expecting a bit more sprinkle after the eventful March meeting,"" said Ima Sammani, FX market analyst at Monex Europe. 
In late afternoon trading, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six peers, rose 0.544% to 100.33 after earlier hitting 100.76, the highest level since April 2020.
The dollar extended gains after data showed U.S. retail sales increased in March, mostly boosted by higher gasoline and food prices.
The battered yen saw some respite, making a small recovery from a 20-year low hit against the dollar. In afternoon trading, it weakened 0.25% versus the greenback at 125.94 per dollar. 
More than three-quarters of Japanese firms say the yen has declined to the point of being detrimental to their business, a Reuters poll found. 
Other central banks tightened monetary policy, reinforcing expectations of higher interest rates globally.
The Bank of Korea surprised markets with a rate hike, while the Monetary Authority of Singapore also tightened policy, sending the Singapore dollar to its highest level since February. 
On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand both raised rates by 50 basis points, the largest hike for each in around 20 years. [CAD/]

4,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 02:06PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble weakened on Thursday, driven by expectations that Russia may relax its temporary capital control measures further, while stocks fell sharply as the country continued what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The Russian central bank is considering easing requirements for mandatory foreign currency revenue sales by export-focused companies, business daily Vedomosti reported, citing a central bank official.
Currently, Russian exporters are obliged to sell 80% of their forex revenues in the first three days after receiving it under a rule established by President Vladimir Putin in late-February to limit the rouble's volatility amid western sanctions. 
The rouble ended trading on Moscow Exchange 1.3% lower at 80.90, heading away from its strongest level since Nov. 11 of 71 it hit last week.
Against the euro, the rouble shed 0.7% to 87.00 after briefly sliding beyond the 90 mark in jittery trade.
The rouble eased this week after the central bank scrapped a 12% commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages and promised to lift a temporary ban on selling foreign exchange cash to individuals from April 18.
But the rouble retains support from export-focused companies that are still obliged to sell their forex revenues on the domestic market.
Russian companies are expected to increase offer of forex this month due to large tax payments, which opens the door for gains in the rouble to 75 to the greenback by end-April, Sberbank CIB said in a note.
On the bond market, yields on 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, declined to 10.49% on Thursday from an all-time high of 19.74 hit on March 21 when trading resumed.
Yields are now driven by expectations that the central bank will continue cutting rates this year after raising the key interest rate to 20% in an emergency move in late February, which was followed by a cut to 17% last week.
The central bank said it has not bought OFZs since March 23, adding that pricing on the OFZ market ""has a purely market nature.""
Russian actions in Ukraine remained in focus, along with a risk of new Western sanctions and expectations that the economy is heading for its sharpest contraction since 1994.
Inflation has already accelerated to its highest since February 2002, reaching 17.5% in annual terms as of April 8.

Russian stock indexes were down.
The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 5.6% to 941.05 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index ended the day 4.9% lower at 2,404.7 points.

LONDON (Reuters) -Short-dated euro zone bond yields and the single currency fell on Thursday as traders pared back rate hike bets after the European Central Bank refrained from switching to a more hawkish stance. 
Bond yields have marched higher in recent weeks as investors bet the ECB will raise rates sooner rather than later to curb euro zone inflation which, at 7.5%, is well above the bank's 2% target.
But the ECB concluded its latest meeting with cautious steps to unwind support and avoiding any firm pledge beyond the end of bond buys it had already laid out in March.
The lack of commitment pushed traders to trim rate hike bets. Money market futures moved to price in just over 60 bps worth of ECB hikes by December, versus the earlier 70 bps.
Futures dated to the ECB's July meeting price in around 15 bps worth of hikes, down from 20 bps earlier on Thursday. 
""Today's statement makes more than two hikes in 2022 almost impossible, whereas part of the market expected something like end of the (asset purchase programme) in June announced today and consequently possibly three hikes,"" said Louis Harreau, ECB watcher at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY). 
""So the communique kind of removes this extreme pricing.""
That pushed short-dated government bond yields, which are closely aligned with interest rate expectations, sharply lower.
Two-year German bond yields fell as much as 7 bps and briefly turned negative. By 1525 GMT they were down a basis point to 0.06%, versus 0.09% just before the ECB statement.
The reduction of rate hike bets also hurt the euro, which tumbled to a two-year low at $1.07580 and hit its lowest level versus sterling since March 7, at 82.75 pence.
Sources told Reuters following the meeting that the ECB could still hike rates in July but had chosen to keep options open given Ukraine-driven uncertainty.
Longer-dated government bond yields initially dropped less than shorter-dated ones, then rose along with U.S. Treasury yields, which surged after the U.S. session open. 
German 10-year yields, the benchmark for the euro area, were last 6 bps higher at 0.83%. 
That steepened Germany's yield curve as measured by the gap between 2- and 10-year yields to around 80 bps, the steepest since January 2019. 
The yield curve ""reflects that ECB is in no rush to tighten monetary policy despite inflation (being) elevated"", said Piet Christiansen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. 
Yield curves flattening in other markets like the United States have been seen as an indication that central banks might choke off growth in their bid to stamp out inflation. 
Germany's 30-year yield rose above 1% for the first time since late 2018. 
Italian 10-year yields after their earlier fall were up 11 bps to 2.49%. 

That underperformance pushed the risk premium over German debt briefly to around 169 bps, the highest in nearly a week.
In equities, Europe's broad STOXX 600 index extended gains and was last up 0.7%, also helped by a positive Wall Street open. A sub-index of euro zone banking stocks was almost 0.9% higher.

Investing.com -- The euro fell around half a cent against the dollar and Eurozone bond yields fell after the European Central Bank chose not to signal any meaningful change in its policy stance after its regular council meeting on Thursday. 
By 8:25 AM ET (1225 GMT), the EUR/USD was at $1.0885, flat on the day, having fallen from $1.0915 immediately before the bank announced its policy decisions to as low as $1.0865. As expected, it kept all its official rates unchanged. Eurozone 10-year bond yields were mostly down by 1 or 2 basis points.
The meeting was the last scheduled chance for eight weeks for the ECB to respond to an increasingly alarming overshoot in inflation, which hit 7.5% in March. That's the highest since the single European currency was created in 1999, while for many individual member states of the Eurozone, inflation is now running at its highest in 30 years or more.
The ECB said that the economic data released since its last meeting had confirmed its intention to end net bond purchases in the third quarter. However, with an eye on the huge uncertainty for the Eurozone economy created by the war in Ukraine, the bank said that its future policy ""will depend on the incoming data and the Governing Council’s evolving assessment of the outlook.
""In the current conditions of high uncertainty, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. the Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfill the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to contribute to safeguarding financial stability.""
The ECB defines price stability as an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term. "

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar weakened in early European trade Thursday, retreating from a two-year high as the rally in U.S. bond yields paused for breath, ahead of a highly-anticipated European Central Bank meeting.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% lower at 99.595, falling back from Wednesday's intraday peak of 100.52, its highest since May 2020.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield traded at 2.684% early Thursday, retreating from Tuesday’s high of 2.836% as weaker than expected U.S. core consumer inflation reined in some expectations of more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening to combat inflation later in the year.
USD/JPY fell 0.3% to 125.28, with the unloved yen receiving some respite from the falling yields, making a small recovery from a 20-year low hit overnight.
Still, most attention Thursday will be on the European Central Bank meeting later in the day, to see whether the policymakers feel the need to combat record inflation levels even in the face of a potential war-induced recession.
As it stands the ECB plans to end its emergency bond buying at some point in the third quarter, with interest rates going up ""some time"" after that.
“The central bank is widely expected to deliver a more hawkish message as the Eurozone now faces record-high inflation. A hawkish shift to the ECB policy outlook could be expressed in adjusting the monthly purchases to conclude the program by June to start hiking rates in the second half,” said independent financial expert Kevin Beckman. 
“In this scenario, EUR/USD could find some demand around long-term lows and witness a solid bounce, especially as the USD looks overbought.”
EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.0918, extending gains made in the previous session.
GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3142, continuing to gain after climbing 0.9% on Wednesday, the biggest daily percentage gain since June 2021, after British consumer price inflation leapt to its highest level in three decades in March.
USD/CAD dropped 0.2% to 1.2543 the day after the Bank of Canada raised rates by 50 basis points, its largest hike in around 20 years, in order to combat inflation running at a three-decade high.
USD/TRY edged higher to 14.6000, with Turkey’s central bank expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 14% at Thursday’s policy-setting meeting despite inflation surging past 60%.
This would be the fourth meeting in a row that the central bank has decided against raising interest rates after, under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it halted a series of rate cuts at the end of last year.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -The euro's share of world currency reserves has been depressed for years as negative euro zone interest rates and bond yields have spurred huge bond outflows. But these dynamics are reversing, and the euro is catching the eye of reserve managers again.
The International Monetary Fund's latest composition of official foreign exchange reserves (COFER) data indicates that central banks increased their euro holdings by as much as $70 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.
That was the most in over three years, according to HSBC.
The COFER report does not capture the financial market tremors sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February and heavy economic sanctions imposed by Western nations on Moscow. 
They included the freezing of almost half of Russia's $640 billion stash of foreign reserves, prompting intense debate over the future of reserves, the U.S. dollar's status as global currency king, and the outlook for other currencies' share of reserves.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist David Adams notes that reserve managers use three broad investment criteria to determine their allocations: liquidity, returns, and safety. All three boxes could soon be ticked for the euro.
The share of negative-yielding euro zone bonds is rapidly shrinking and European Central Bank interest rates could be positive by the end of the year; liquidity will increase when the ECB begins reducing its balance sheet; and the Russia-Ukraine war could spur more issuance of top-rated joint bonds in the euro zone. 
""If the ECB is beginning to normalize policy ... that will improve liquidity and raise returns for investors, including reserve managers,"" said Adams.
The current share of euro holdings in the $12.05 trillion of 'allocated' or currency-known central bank FX reserves is 20.64%. The peak was 28% in late 2009, and the low was just under 17% in late 2000. 
The euro's share of FX reserves has been remarkably steady in recent years. From the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2021, it was locked in a narrow range between 20.07% and 21.29%. Indeed, it only rose above 21% in one of these 18 quarters.
EURO RESILIENCE?
In that five-year period the dollar's share of global FX reserves has fallen almost five percentage points to a 25-year low of 58.81%. 
For the euro, this can be looked at in two ways: central banks cooled on the dollar but shunned the euro in favor of other currencies; or, the euro has proved more resilient than the dollar to central bank FX reserves diversification. 
But there is a lot of ground to make up following the slump in euro holdings after the ECB went from 'ZIRP' to 'NIRP' - from zero interest rate policy to negative interest rate policy - in June 2014. The euro's share of world FX reserves fell by some 5 percentage points over a two-year period at the time. 
According to Tradeweb, the value of euro-denominated negative-yielding government debt on its bond trading platform peaked at almost 7 trillion euros - some 75% of the near-9 trillion sovereign euro bond market - in late 2020.
But at the end of last month, the amount of negative-yielding debt had fallen to 2.07 trillion euros, the lowest since at least 2016 when Tradeweb first started compiling the data.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) put the cumulative net outflow from euro zone fixed income markets since 2014 at almost 3 trillion euros. 
""A reversal of these persistent outflows could have important implications for the euro,"" wrote Goldman strategist Zach Pandl last month when he and his team raised their euro forecast to a bullish and out-of-consensus $1.20 over 12 months and $1.30 by the end of 2024. The euro was at $1.09 on Wednesday. 
The reversal appears to be underway.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, after falling overnight against the pound and the euro in particular. U.S. yields hit pause on their recent rally, offering some relief to the Japanese yen.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.18% to 99.733 by 11:58 AM ET (3:58 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.35% to 125.22.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.15% to 0.7460, with Australian employment data showing that the employment change was 17,900, the full employment change was 20,500, and the unemployment rate was 4% in March 2022.
The NZD/USD pair gained 0.40% to 0.6822.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.3668 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 1.3435.
Investors now await the European Central Bank’s latest policy decision, due later in the day.
""At the beginning of the week I was saying everything followed from the ongoing grind higher in U.S. yields, equities were off, the dollar was soaring, and now because of what's happening in Treasuries, everything has reversed,"" National Bank of Australia global head of FX strategy Ray Atrrill told Reuters.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was 2.7120%, and steadily rose earlier in the month thanks to bets on more aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening.
The pound rose to its highest point in a week against the dollar, after gaining 0.9% on Wednesday, the biggest daily percentage gain since June 2021. The U.K. producer price index input grew 19.2% year-on-year, and 5.2% month-on-month, while the consumer price index grew 7% year-on-year and 1.1% month-on-month, in March 2022.
Alongside the slowdown in U.S. yields, Attrill said part of the moves could be explained by higher-than-expected U.K. consumer price index numbers, ""the money is flirting with the idea that the Bank of England could do 50 basis points in May, though we don't expect that"".
The market was positioned for a hint that the ECB might draw a line under its quantitative easing program in the second quarter of 2022 rather than the third, he added.
""The risk is they are going to follow the path in terms of becoming overtly less dovish.""
The Bank of Korea surprised markets as it hiked its interest rate to 1.5% in its policy decision. The Monetary Authority of Singapore also tightened its monetary policy, with the Singapore dollar gaining about 0.5% to a one-week high on the dollar. The Korean won, meanwhile, edged up 0.16%.
The Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) also hiked their interest rates a day earlier, to 1% and 1.5% respectively.
The dollar weakened 0.6% against its Candian counterpart on Wednesday but gained against the New Zealand dollar as the RBNZ said in its post‑meeting statement that the peak cash rate remains unchanged due to concerns about the global outlook."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased back from a nearly two-year high on Wednesday as the euro reversed course and turned positive ahead of a policy-setting meeting at the European Central Bank on Thursday. 
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar fell to 99.888, after climbing early in the day to 100.52, the highest since May 2020. It has gained nearly 3% so far this month and was on track for its biggest monthly rise in nine months.
The dollar index fell 0.449%, with the euro up 0.54% to $1.0884.
""The dollar has just been on quite a tear for weeks now, and I think the run up to the ECB tomorrow (Thursday) is providing a convenient excuse for the market to book some profit in the dollar's gains,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
The Japanese yen also pared losses against the dollar, which had soared to a nearly 20-year high against the yen at one point on Wednesday as aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve contrasted sharply with the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy. 
The yen weakened 0.19% versus the greenback at 125.61 per dollar. 
Although the market is not anticipating any interest rate changes from the ECB at Thursday's meeting, market participants will be looking for a more hawkish tone from ECB President Christine Lagarde that could tee up a rate hike later in the year. 
Money markets are pricing in about 70 basis points of interest rate tightening by December.
It is likely that markets are pricing in hawkish sentiment from the ECB at the upcoming meeting, but that tone will do little to keep pace with the aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve's approach to inflation, Manimbo said. 
""Even a hawkish ECB isn't likely to change the narrative of the Fed raising rates at a far faster pace than Europe,"" Manimbo added. 
Data showing U.S. producer prices in March surging 11.2% on a year-on-year basis, the largest increase since 12-month data were first calculated in November 2010, reinforced market expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates by half a percentage point at next month's policy meeting.
""The United States economy seems to be isolated enough and showing enough signs of inflation that the Fed is going to continue maintaining a very, very hawkish line and acting on it, and by doing so, of course, improving the dollar value,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading, at Monex USA in Washington.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar rallied after the Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised interest rates by half a percentage point - its biggest single move in more than two decades. The central bank also promised more rate hikes to battle soaring inflation.
The Canadian dollar rose 0.56% versus the greenback at C$1.26 per dollar.
Bitcoin last rose 4.65% to $41,368.19.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday after the release of red-hot inflation data, while the euro traded near a five-week low on fears that the war in Ukraine may continue for some time to come.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 100.485.
The release of the U.S. consumer price index lived up to expectations, as prices rose 8.5% in March compared with a year ago, the highest rate since 1981, boosted by the soaring cost of gasoline.
However, the core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, fell short of estimates, landing at 6.5%. This raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve might not need to be as aggressive in the second half of this year as some had originally expected.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield traded at 2.765% early Wednesday, compared with an over-three-year peak of 2.836% before the inflation data.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0818, just above a new five-week low following Russian President Vladimir Putin vowing to continue the invasion, stating that peace talks with Ukraine were “at a dead end”.
The war in Ukraine has weighed heavily on sentiment in Europe, with the German ZEW economic research institute stating Tuesday that its economic sentiment index fell to -41.0 points from -39.3 in March. 
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, and has the difficulty of balancing soaring consumer prices with these pressures on growth. Although little in the way of rate hikes are expected at this meeting, money markets are pricing in about 70 basis points of interest rate tightening by December.
GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2986 after data showed U.K. inflation climbing to its highest in over 30 years in March, with the annual rate of consumer inflation climbing to 7.0%, up 1.1% in month-on-month terms.
The Bank of England has lifted interest rates at its last three meetings, to above the levels seen pre-pandemic, but so far this has done little to impact the growing cost-of-living crisis in the country.    
USD/JPY rose 0.6% to 126.14, with the yen unloved as the Bank of Japan has repeatedly intervened to keep benchmark bond yields around zero, in direct contrast to most of the yields of rival countries’ debt.
NZD/USD fell 0.7% to 0.6800 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted its official cash rate by 50 basis points to 1.5%, adding that ""the committee agreed that their policy ‘path of least regret’ is to increase the OCR by more now, rather than later, to head off rising inflation expectations. It is appropriate to continue to tighten monetary conditions at pace.""
USD/CAD traded flat at 1.2643 ahead of Wednesday’s policy-setting meeting of the Bank of Canada. The central bank is widely expected to hike interest rates by a half-percentage point, becoming the first in the Group of Seven to lift rates that aggressively to combat inflation running at a three-decade high.

Investing.com -- The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with the euro stuck at a five-week low as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of ending anytime soon. Investors also digested the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ)’s biggest interest rate hike in 22 years.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 100.250 by 11:39 PM ET (3:39 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.16% to 125.56. The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7462 while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.6847.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.3653, with China will release its latest trade data later in the day. The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.3009.
The RBNZ hiked its interest rate to 1.5% after it's meeting on Wednesday, saying that ""the committee agreed that their policy ‘path of least regret’ is to increase the OCR by more now, rather than later, to head off rising inflation expectations. It is appropriate to continue to tighten monetary conditions at pace.""
“The RBNZ’s decision to accelerate its hiking cycle shows it is willing to move decisively to get a hand on surging inflation,” Capital Economics economist Ben Udy told Bloomberg.
“We expect it to hike the OCR to 3% by the end of 2022.”
The Bank of Canada will hand down its own policy decision later in the day, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Korea following on Thursday.
In Europe, hopes for a resolution to the war in Ukraine dimmed after Russian President Vladimir Putin described peace negotiations are ""a dead-end situation"" overnight. The euro, which is sensitive to concern about the war's economic impact, fell to $1.0821 and remained near that level in early Asia trade.
The U.S. dollar also cooled a recent rally as investors digested Tuesday’s inflation data from the U.S. and hoped that price pressures have peaked.
The data showed that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 8.5% year-on-year in March, its highest level since late 1981. The CPI rose 1.2% month-on-month, while the core CPI rose 6.5% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month.
The inflation data provided relief to the bond market and lowered U.S. yields, giving the yen a brief boost. However, as the CPI figure was the highest since late 1981 and the Fed looks to quicken the pace of interest rate hikes, the dollar’s fall was small."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The dollar rebounded on Tuesday after digesting slightly softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data, while the euro extended losses ahead of a policy-setting meeting at the European Central Bank. 
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday that there were some signs of “welcome” cooling in the latest inflation readout, but emphasized that the central bank is still proceeding with a series of interest rate hikes, as well as an effort to trim its balance sheet. 
""I'll be looking to see whether we continue to see moderation in the months ahead,"" Brainard told the Wall Street Journal in an interview, referring to inflation in the ""core"" goods category.
The U.S. Consumer Price Index showed that prices rose 8.5% in March compared with a year ago, boosted by the soaring cost of gasoline but tempered by a moderation in prices of used cars and trucks. The core CPI fell short of estimates, landing at 6.5%.
Brainard’s comments highlighted that the Fed “is not pivoting at this point,” providing an assurance for the greenback after a morning of choppy trading, said Bipan Rai, head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto. 
“The path of least resistance is still for tighter policy, and also for an aggressive unwind of the balance sheet, and as a result of that, I think the dollar is stabilizing a little bit,” he said. 
The dollar index rose 0.26%, with the euro down 0.51% to $1.0828.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields eased to 2.727%, after reaching 2.793% on Monday, the highest since January 2019. 
The inflation numbers initially suggested the Fed might not need to be as aggressive in the second half of this year as some had originally expected, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
“While this doesn't change anything that the Fed will do over the next couple of meetings, it does support the idea that maybe they won't have to be as aggressive with tightening policy later on in the year, and that's why we saw the dollar drop somewhat following the initial reaction,” said Moya. 
The euro declined Tuesday as markets shifted their attention to the ECB policy meeting due later this week, with money markets pricing in about 70 basis points of interest rate tightening by December.
“The big focus for the ECB this week is whether or not the timeline to remove accommodative policy settings has shrunk, given the fact that the chorus of voices on the governing council have become more hawkish,” said Rai.
Investors will likely look for any indication that the ECB will wind down its asset purchase program, which could tee up a rate hike in September, Rai said. 
Still, any rebounds in the euro will likely be limited due to the Russian war against Ukraine, said Moya. In addition to pushing up gasoline prices, the war, now in its second month, has led to a global surge in food prices as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities including wheat and sunflower oil.
“There's just this overall belief that until you have a resolution with the war in Ukraine, their economic outlook is really going to be a big question mark, and that's not necessarily going to be good for flows for the euro,” said Moya.

14,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s dollar has scope to make up ground against some of its biggest commodity-related peers if the country’s central bank provides an appropriate shot of hawkishness this week.
While the currency has received some support from higher oil and resource prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war, it has lagged the likes of the Australian dollar and the Norwegian krone, and some analysts reckon that the so-called loonie remains unduly weak. This Wednesday’s Bank of Canada meeting, which is widely expected to deliver a half-point interest rate hike, could well prove a catalyst for fresh moves higher.
“The Canadian dollar is still undervalued, so at some point that should adjust,” said Brad Bechtel, a strategist at Jefferies LLC. He predicts that the currency will rally as the BOC “continues to become more and more hawkish.” 
The market has shown some signs of increased positivity over the past month, with the currency up close to 1% against its U.S. counterpart. Short-term option skews have become less bearish for the loonie, while futures market positioning data last week showed leveraged funds shifting to their least negative stance since mid-February.
Ahead of this week’s key decision, some observers have begun to bolster their projections for where they see the local currency ending this year, with Barclays Plc predicting it will go to around C$1.22 per U.S. dollar from Monday levels of around C$1.26.
Expectations for what the Bank of Canada might choose to do on monetary policy have climbed sharply along with the recent ramp up in rhetoric south of the border at the Federal Reserve. A half-point increase at this week’s BOC meeting is seen as close to certain, and the market is now pricing in more than 2 percentage points of hikes by the end of 2022. But inflation concerns globally remain in flux and all eyes will be on BOC Governor Tiff Macklem for further signs of perceived hawkishness.
Bank of America Corp. sees Macklem implementing a “potentially brisk” pace of tightening which would provide “persistent support” to the Canadian dollar in the months ahead, according to a Monday note from analysts Carlos Capistran and Ben Randol.
Other potential tailwinds for the Canadian dollar include the fact that it’s relatively far away geographically from the ongoing war in Ukraine and its comparatively muted response so far to higher commodity prices -- at least when lined up versus its counterparts in Norway and Australia.
Against the big dollar, though, the picture is perhaps more uncertain. With war fears still intermittently driving haven flows and a Federal Reserve that’s seemingly ever-more-hawkish, the obstacle of the mighty greenback remains a large one to overcome.
This dynamic is evident in the U.S.-Canadian dollar options market. One-week risk reversals -- a measure of positioning and sentiment that incorporates the timing of this week’s BOC gathering -- have become less bullish for the greenback. But those at the one-month tenor -- which cover the next Fed meeting -- are distinctly more greenback positive.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The weak yen was once a cause for celebration for Japanese companies, as they could sell cars and cameras cheaper abroad and enjoyed fatter profits when earnings were brought home.
These days, it's not so straightforward. 
    After years of bolstering overseas production and supply chains, Japan's manufacturers now see less benefit from a softer currency, company officials and economists say. 
    In fact, the economic pain from a weaker yen has become stark now, as the recent yen sell-off has sharply lifted commodities costs in a blow to household spending. It also shows how the steady move to overseas production is slowly changing the dynamics of the world's no.3 economy.
WHAT'S CHANGED FOR JAPANESE COMPANIES?
Almost a quarter of Japanese manufacturers' production is carried out overseas, according to the latest trade ministry data. That compares to around 17% a decade ago and less than 15% two decades ago.
Around two-thirds of the cars that Japanese makers sell annually are now made abroad, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.
    Two decades ago, cars made overseas accounted for less than 40% of sales. 
Companies are also moving away from the manufacture-and-export model of old as technology has changed their businesses. Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd, for example, is increasingly focused on providing digital solutions to customers globally rather than just hardware.
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE RISK?
The weakness in the yen has driven up the cost of fuel and other commodities for manufacturers at home. Critically, it is also hitting household spending and consumer confidence in the domestic market - adding to the pain for a creaking economy.
A December survey of nearly 7,000 companies by data and research firm Tokyo Shoko Research found that almost 30% of companies said a weak yen was a negative for their business, while 5% said it was a positive. The remaining 65% said it was neither a negative or a positive.
Those that said the weak yen was negative on average cited a rate of 107 yen to the dollar as preferable - a level considerably stronger than the 125.75 hit on Tuesday.
The weak yen drives up the cost of acquiring businesses overseas, although that could be less of a concern for many cash-rich Japanese firms. At the same time, the weak yen makes Japanese companies cheaper targets for foreign buyers. 
WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR COMPANIES?
Many manufacturers, including automakers, say that one of the benefits of producing more in local markets is less sensitivity to currency swings.
Even though there may be concerns about producing in certain markets - such as China - it seems unlikely that the trend toward offshore production will reverse in any meaningful way soon.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp has been working to reduce the impact of the yen on its earnings, a spokesperson said, without giving details. Within the company, the weak yen was not necessarily viewed as a benefit, the spokesperson said, adding the higher cost of raw materials was one demerit.
For retailers, the weak yen has been painful, as it drives up costs, including for energy and food. Budget clothing retailer Shimamura Co Ltd said recently it would have to increase the price of some of its items by an unprecedented 3-4%.
WHAT DO POLICYMAKERS SAY?
The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, has repeatedly said that while the weak currency can squeeze households and retailers, the benefits to the economy https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/boj-keep-rates-low-strong-not-weak-yen-still-kurodas-enemy-no-1-2022-04-01 outweigh the negatives.
But he looks increasingly alone in his emphasis on the positive, as government officials have increased their warnings against excessive yen declines. 
Some of Kuroda's former finance ministry colleagues now see the weak yen as a sign of Japan's fading economic power. 
Earlier this month he said the yen's recent moves were ""somewhat rapid"", his strongest warning yet on the currency's move, although he followed that by emphasising the benefits of a weaker yen.
HOW LOW CAN IT GO?
That's anyone's guess. The yen's rapid decline - last month it fell more than 5% versus the dollar, its biggest monthly drop since November 2016 - has taken some in the markets by surprise. 

Japan's former top currency diplomat Eisuke Sakakibara told Reuters last month that the government should intervene in the currency or raise interest rates to defend it if it weakens beyond 130 to the dollar.
Weakening beyond 130 ""could cause problems"" said Sakakibara, known as ""Mr. Yen"" for masterminding several currency interventions to soften the yen in the 1990s.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar surged higher in early European trade Tuesday, supported by high U.S. bond yields ahead of the release of the latest consumer inflation data, which should cement a rapid pace of tightening by the Federal Reserve.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 100.155, just below last week's near two-year high of 100.19.
The dollar has been supported of late by the expectation that the U.S. central bank will continue to tighten monetary policy after lifting its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in March, but at a more rapid rate to combat soaring inflation.
This has resulted in the yield on benchmark 10-year notes climbing to 2.836% earlier in the session, its highest since December 2018, before steadying. If Tuesday's early advance holds, it will be the eighth straight session of gains for benchmark yields.
These expectations of hefty interest rate increases are likely to be underpinned by the latest consumer price data, at 8:30 GMT (1230 GMT). The March release is expected to show a gain of 8.4% after a 7.9% gain in February, up 1.2% on the month, while the core data, which excludes food and energy prices, is seen up 6.6% on the year and 0.5% on the month.
Also of interest will be comments from Fed Vice Chair nominee Lael Brainard later in the session. Last week Brainard said the Fed could start reducing its balance sheet as soon as May at a rapid pace. 
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 125.72, near its June 2015 peak of 125.86, while a move past that level would take the dollar to its highest against the yen since 2002.
While expectations are strong that the Fed will hike aggressively this year, the Bank of Japan has repeatedly intervened to keep benchmark bond yields around zero.
USD/CNY edged slightly lower to 6.3680, softening after earlier reaching a two-week high as some COVID restrictions were eased in Shanghai.
“Asia itself was potentially caught in a pincer movement of higher U.S. interest rates and slowing China growth which slightly lower oil prices were not offsetting,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA. “We can expect more Asian currency weakness ahead as the region's central banks tinker with tightening monetary policy. Those pressures may well magnify in May as the FOMC rolls up its sleeves and gets to work.”
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0867, handing back some of the gains seen Monday after Emmanuel Macron won the first round of the French presidential election, just beating far-right challenger Marine Le Pen.
The single currency still remains under pressure from the war in Ukraine, with the sanctions put in place to penalize Russia continuing to play havoc with commodity prices, and thus inflation.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and has the difficulty of balancing soaring consumer prices, with German CPI climbing to 7.3% on the year in March, against pressure on growth from the Ukraine conflict. 
GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3009, despite Britain's unemployment rate falling to 3.8% in the three months to February, down from the previous reading of 3.9% and below its 4.0% level in early 2020, shortly before COVID-19 cases first swept Europe."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese policymakers warned on Tuesday against any rapid moves in the foreign exchange market, underscoring the importance of stability as authorities kept a wary watch on the yen after it slumped to six-year lows against the dollar.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told parliament's lower house that stability in currencies is important and any rapid moves are undesirable, keeping up warnings against the yen's depreciation that boosts the cost of living.
Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki echoed the concern, adding that Japan will communicate closely with the United States and other countries to respond to currency moves appropriately, signalling the prospect of joint action, although investors saw no imminent chance of currency intervention.
The Japanese currency broke beyond 125 yen on Monday due to widening interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States, as bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will accelerate tightening contrasted with the Bank of Japan's commitment to keep in place its ultra-easy monetary settings.
""The government is closely watching currency moves, including the recent yen weakening, and its impact on the Japanese economy with a sense of urgency,"" Suzuki said.
He noted the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies have agreed to have exchange rates set by markets, to closely consult on action in the currency market and have acknowledged that excess volatility and disorderly moves can have adverse effects on economic and financial stability.
""Based on the G7 agreement, we'll respond appropriately while closely communicating with currency authorities of the United States and others,"" Suzuki said.
Despite the comments, investors see little chance of immediate action by Japanese currency authorities, especially as long as policymakers maintain that the current yen weakness is good for Japan, said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno has occasionally attempted to talk up a weak yen, while Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda hasn't shown any serious concerns about the current downturn in the currency. 
A weak yen tends to boost exporters' earnings, while lifting the cost of imports for the resource-deficient Japanese economy, squeezing household incomes and importers' bottom line. 
Over the past decade or so, the benefits to exporters from a weak yen have lessened as many Japanese manufacturers have moved overseas.

""Japanese authorities are not yet escalating warning against the weak yen,"" Karakama said, adding that the currency's further descent beyond 130 yen to the dollar towards 140 could be a trigger.
""If that becomes political issues by further fuelling oil and other price hikes, policymakers may be prompted into action.""

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, climbing back above the 100 mark. The U.S. currency was supported by high yields ahead of inflation data due later in the day, which also heightened expectations of tighter monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.13% to 100.055 by 11:47 PM ET (3:47 AM GMT). The index tested a near two-year high of 100.19 that it hit during the previous week.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 125.43.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.7426 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6825.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3702. The dollar gained overnight on the offshore Chinese yuan, hitting a two-week high of 6.390 in early Asian trading.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 1.3024.
The dollar also continued its gains against the yen and was very near the overnight intraday high of 125.77 and a June 2015 high of 125.86. Although Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki on Tuesday declined to comment on specific prices in foreign exchange markets, he said excess volatility and disorderly movements could have an adverse effect on the economy and financial stability.
The dollar's strength ""was most apparent against JPY and CNH, currencies of economies with a dovish central bank,"" CBA analysts said in a morning note.
CBA also expects very high U.S. inflation will reinforce expectations of aggressive Fed tightening. As a 50-basis point rate hike was not yet fully priced in for each of the next two Fed meetings, it expects further gains for the dollar.
""We expect the dollar to stay bid and lift to the pandemic high of 103 pts in the coming months,” said the note.
Investors now await the U.S. consumer price index, due later in the day.
U.S. longer-term yields also continued an upward trend, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes hitting 2.836%, its highest since December 2018. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond also rose to 2.86%, its highest since May 2019.
Meanwhile, the euro gave up its gains from Monday, after incumbent French President Emmanuel Macron beat rival Marine Le Pen in the first round of presidential voting on Apr. 10. The single currency last traded at $1.087 and was not far from its Friday close.
""The bottom line, then, is that we are where we were before the vote,"" Rabobank analysts said in their own note.
""Macron looks set to return to office following the runoff Apr. 24 vote but the scale of his victory is likely to be far smaller than when he was seen as an upstart five years ago and likely slim enough that the political earthquake that would be a Le Pen victory cannot be entirely discounted.""
Easing oil prices also limited gains for the commodity-linked Australian and New Zealand dollars. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand  will also hand down its policy decision on Wednesday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held just below two-year highs against a basket of currencies on Monday, still supported by higher U.S. Treasury yields, while the euro rallied after French leader Emmanuel Macron beat far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in the first round of presidential voting.
U.S. Treasury yields have soared on expectations of more aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve, boosting the greenback. Benchmark 10-year note yields reached 2.793% on Monday, the highest since January 2019.
But the euro looked set to snap a seven-day losing streak against the U.S. currency, rising 0.14% to $1.0889. The U.S. dollar index was last at 99.92, after reaching 100.19 on Friday, the highest since May 2020.
“There was maybe a bit of a relief rally, but it’s going to be hard for the euro to really get more upside traction until the event risk fully passes,” said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
Macron will face Le Pen in what promises to be a tightly fought French presidential election runoff on April 24.
The dollar gained further against the yen, which reached its weakest level since mid-2015. The Japanese currency has deteriorated as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has stayed more dovish than increasingly hawkish peers such as the Fed.
“What we’ve heard from the BOJ so far has been very consistent that they’re not concerned about this move (in the yen) and, if anything, they’re comfortable with the move,” said Nelson. “Given the way rates are moving, the attractiveness of selling the yen and earning a positive rate of interest on that trade, that’s going to continue to be a one-way bet for I think quite a while.”
The dollar gained 0.94% to 125.45 yen.
The next major economic focus in the United States will be consumer price data for March due on Tuesday. 
Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian and Australian dollars and Norwegian krone weakened as oil prices slipped. 
The dollar gained 0.39% against the loonie to $1.2621 Canadian dollars, and 1.13% against the Norwegian currency to 8.8105 krone. The Aussie slipped 0.40% to $0.7429.
China's yuan weakened against the dollar on investor concern over capital outflow and currency depreciation pressure after benchmark yield differentials turned negative between the Asian economic powerhouse and the United States.
Yields on China's 10-year government bonds fell below U.S. Treasury yields for the first time in 12 years as investors prepared for more monetary easing on the mainland and a widening divergence between the U.S. and Chinese economies. 
The Russian rouble weakened sharply in jittery trade, reversing some of the previous week's gains, after the central bank relaxed temporary capital control measures.
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin fell to three-week lows, and was last down 3.78% at $40,541. Ether fell 5.26% to $3,034.

20,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 11:20AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The rouble weakened sharply on Monday, reversing some of the previous week's gains, after Russia relaxed temporary capital control measures aimed at limiting a drop in the currency.
Shares in Rosbank, a Russian subsidiary of French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), jumped 40% after SocGen said it would quit Russia and take a 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) income hit from selling Rosbank to Interros Capital, a firm linked to Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin.
By 1500 GMT, the rouble had lost more than 4% of its value in jittery trade, sliding to 79.45 to the dollar, and was down 4.5% to 86.45 against the euro.
During the trading session on Moscow Exchange, the rouble fell to 82.0950 against the dollar, from the 71 roubles hit on Friday which was its strongest since Nov. 11.
Late on Friday the central bank said it would scrap a 12% commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages from April 11 and lift a temporary ban on selling foreign exchange cash to individuals from April 18.
""The central bank gave markets a unequivocal signal that a further rouble strengthening was undesirable,"" said Vladimir Evstifeev, an analyst at Zenit Bank.
The decision to scrap the 12% commission on FX operations means speculators will be able to trade again, Alor Brokerage said, adding market players were tending to lock in even small profits.
The rouble retains support from the obligatory conversion of 80% of FX revenues by export-focused companies as well as from high interest rates, even though the central bank unexpectedly cut its key rate from 20% to 17% last week.
ITI Capital analysts said Russia receives about $1.4 billion a day in export revenues and the rouble could firm further, given Russian capital controls and shrinking imports.
The central bank's cut supported Russian OFZ government bonds. The finance ministry said at the weekend that it wouldn't borrow on local or foreign debt markets this year.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov also said Russia would take legal action if the West tried to force it to default on its sovereign debt.

Yields on 10-year OFZs, which move inversely with their prices, fell to 10.45% on Monday. That was their lowest since Feb. 21, three days before Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine, triggering unprecedented Western sanctions against Russia. 
On the stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index fell 5.8% to 1,017.4 points and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index shed 1% to 2,566.6 points, with losses limited by the rouble's slide.

Continuing a multi-year effort to reduce exposure to the U.S. currency, the central bank cut the share of dollars in reserves to 10.9% as of Jan. 1 from from 21.2% a year earlier. But euro holdings rose to 33.9% from 29.2%, the central bank said.
Yuan holdings rose to 17.1% from 12.8% a year earlier, while gold was down slight at 21.5%. 
The U.S. and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, including limits on the central bank’s reserves. Russian officials said the restrictions froze about half of its $642 billion in reserves. 
“This extraordinary, shock situation will lead to large-scale changes,” Nabiullina said in her report. “The difficult process of adapting to the new conditions will inevitably lead to a contraction in GDP but the Russian economy will be able to return to a growth trajectory.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday, helped by continued strength of U.S. bond yields, while the euro received support from incumbent Emmanuel Macron’s lead after the first round of French presidential elections.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 99.987, continuing to show strength after gaining around 1% last week.
The dollar has received the benefit from a hawkish Federal Reserve, which lifted interest rates by 25 basis points at its March meeting and looks set to continue hiking as the year progresses.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who is on the hawkish side of the debate, stated late last week that the central bank needs to raise the federal funds rate by another 3 percentage points by year's end.
The benchmark 10-year yield rose again Monday, adding another seven basis points to top 2.77%, as traders positioned for this shift.
“Few central banks will be able to match the pace of Fed tightening this year and the dollar should stay strong – especially against the low yielders of the Japanese yen and the euro,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
USD/JPY rose 0.8% to 125.36, with the yen suffering as the Bank of Japan holds yields near zero, in direct contrast to the Fed’s stance.
However, EUR/USD edged higher to 1.0880, receiving support from the results of the first round of the French presidential election, with incumbent Emmanuel Macron polling the highest number of votes.
Macron will face off against far-right challenger Marine Le Pen on April 24. Opinion polls suggest the race will be very tight, but Macron's strong start gave some confidence to markets that are wary about Le Pen's protectionism, even as she no longer backs discontinuing the euro.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, and has the difficulty of balancing soaring consumer prices against pressure on growth from the war in Ukraine. 
The more hawkish members of the group have been pressing for the central bank to promptly rein in its accommodative policies, but while the central bank could give more details about a wind-down in asset purchases, it’s unlikely to provide any explicit hints about hikes. 
GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.2993, falling after growth in the U.K. economy slowed more sharply than expected in February, as gross domestic product rose by 0.1%, down from 0.8% growth in January.
AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7429, falling to a three-week low as iron ore prices dropped, while USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3727 on the back of China’s producer price index growing 8.3% year-on-year, with the world’s second-largest economy having to deal with the inflationary pressures from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its latest Covid-19 outbreak."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with the euro starting the week off strong as incumbent Emmanuel Macron led in the first round of voting in the French presidential election. Other moves were small as investors await central bank policy decisions in Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and South Korea.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.13% to 99.882 by 11:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.45% to 124.88.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.7441 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.6829.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.3717.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3016.
The euro briefly climbed as high as $1.0955 amid thin trading at the Asian session open. The single currency also gained against the pound and the yen.
With 88% of votes counted, Macron garnered 27.41% and his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen was next with 24.9%, with the pair next contesting a runoff vote on Apr. 24. Macron's strong start gave some confidence to markets that are wary about Le Pen's protectionism, even as she no longer backs discontinuing the euro.
However, gains were capped as investors await the European Central Bank (ECB)’s policy decision, due on Thursday.
""It's a patchy bit of support,"" Westpac strategist Imre Speizer told Reuters, with investors also grappling with an ECB unlikely to sound as aggressive as Federal Reserve in heading off inflation.
""I think that the biggest story of the two central banks being quite different is probably quite supportive of the dollar in the longer run,"" he added.
The dollar index topped the 100-mark for the first time in nearly two years on Friday but fell back down during the Asian session.
The ECB has been in the unenviable position of balancing rising inflation against the pressure on economic growth from the war in Ukraine as it prepares to hand down its policy decision on Thursday. Although the central bank is widely expected to provide more details about a winddown in asset purchases, it may not give any further explicitly hawkish signals.
The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hand down their policy decisions on Wednesday. Interest rate swaps pricing indicates a more than 90% chance that both central banks hike interest rates by 50 basis points. However, this leaves the Canadian and New Zealand dollars vulnerable should the hikes be smaller.
The New Zealand dollar wobbled downward on Monday, while the Canadian dollar held steady at C$1.2583 against its U.S. counterpart.
The Bank of Korea will also hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar also eased, with gains in commodity currencies beginning a further retreat as export prices fall."
24,"<span>Apr 09, 2022 10:35AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia, hit by Western sanctions, has called on the BRICS group of emerging economies to extend the use of national currencies and integrate payment systems, the finance ministry said on Saturday.
Sanctions have cut Russia off from the global financial system and from nearly half of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $606.5 billion in early April.
On Friday, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told a ministerial meeting with BRICS, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, that the global economic situation had worsened substantially due to the sanctions, the ministry's statement said.
The new sanctions also destroy the foundation of the existing international monetary and financial system based on the U.S. dollar, Siluanov said.
""This pushes us to the need to speed up work in the following areas: the use of national currencies for export-import operations, the integration of payment systems and cards, our own financial messaging system and the creation of an independent BRICS rating agency,"" Siluanov said.
International payment cards Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard suspended operations in Russia in early March and Russia's biggest banks have lost access to the SWIFT global banking messaging system. 
Russia set up its own banking messaging system, known as SPFS, as an alternative to SWIFT. Its own card payment system MIR began operating in 2015. 
They were part of Moscow's efforts to develop homegrown financial tools to mirror Western ones, to protect the country in case penalties against Moscow were broadened. 

The finance ministry said BRICS ministers have confirmed the importance of cooperation in efforts to stabilise the current economic situation.
""The current crisis is man-made, and the BRICS countries have all necessary tools to mitigate its consequences for their economies and the global economy as a whole,"" Siluanov said.

25,"<span>Apr 09, 2022 02:05AM ET</span>","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - S&P on Saturday lowered Russia's foreign currency ratings to ""selective default"" on increased risks that Moscow will not be able and willing to honor its commitments to foreign debtholders. 
Facing waves of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Russia could face its first sovereign external default in over a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in rubles this week, even though the payment was due in dollars.
S&P said in a statement it understood that Russia had made coupon and principal payments on dollar-denominated Eurobonds in rubles on Monday.
""We currently don't expect that investors will be able to convert those ruble payments into dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts, or that the government will convert those payments within a 30-day grace period.""
Sanctions on Russia are likely to be further increased in the coming weeks, the agency said, ""hampering Russia's willingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions of its obligations to foreign debtholders.""
Russia's finance minister on Thursday said the country will do everything possible to pay its creditors, but investors in Russia's international bonds face an increasingly uncertain path to recover their money should the country default..
S&P assigns a selective default rating when it believes the debtor has selectively defaulted on a specific issue or class of obligations but will continue to meet its payment obligations on other issues or classes of obligations in a timely manner.

Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. 
A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run-up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".

26,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 05:25PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia will relax temporary capital control measures aimed at limiting a drop in the rouble by allowing individuals to buy cash foreign currency and will also scrap commission for buying forex through brokerages, the central bank said on Friday.
The rouble has rebounded on the Moscow Exchange from record lows in March to levels seen before Feb. 24, when Russia started what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine, as capital control measures suffocated demand for forex.
The swift rebound in the rouble raised concerns about its economic and financial impact as analysts have warned that the volatile and strong rouble could pose a threat to Russian revenues from selling commodities abroad for foreign currency. 
The central bank said banks will be allowed to sell cash foreign currency to individuals from April 18 but only the notes they have received no earlier than on April 9.
The central bank is also scrapping its requirement for banks to limit the gap between prices at which they offer to buy and sell foreign exchange. But it recommended banks sell forex to import-focused companies at a rate of no more than two roubles above the market rate.
The central bank said individuals will be allowed to withdraw not only dollars but also euros from their accounts from April 11, but kept the maximum amount that can be withdrawn until Sept. 9 at the equivalent of $10,000.
The rouble's rapid recovery has raised doubts about the durability of its gains. Anyone who tries to buy foreign currency online at a bank in Russia or, illegally, at a foreign exchange booth, or who buys goods and services online denominated in foreign currencies will find the actual rate considerably worse.
The central bank also said it will scrap a 12% commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages, confirming earlier reports by Tinkoff Bank and Alfa Bank.
""We think this decision heralds the end to a head-turning rally in the rouble,"" CentroCreditBank analysts said.
In early March, when the rouble was falling sharply as the United States and European countries imposed sanctions against Russia for sending troops to Ukraine, the central bank introduced a 30% commission on buying forex for individuals. The commission has been later lowered to 12%.
Restrictions on buying forex together with the order for export-focused companies to convert 80% of their FX revenues helped the rouble regain ground. On Friday, the rouble hit its strongest level against the euro since June 2020 and jumped to a 2022 high to the dollar.
The move to scrap the commission along with the central bank's decision to cut its key rate to 17% should lower the rouble volatility, VTB Capital analysts said.

The Russian central bank unexpectedly cut its key rate from 20% on Friday and said future cuts were possible, as emergency steps had contained the risk to financial stability, brought deposits back to banks and helped limit the threat of inflation.
In March, consumer prices in Russia jumped 7.61%, staging their biggest month-on-month increase since January 1999.

27,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 04:41PM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long positioning on the U.S. dollar fell in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position slid to $14.13 billion for the week ended April 5, from $16.11 billion the previous week. U.S. dollar net long positioning declined for the first time in five weeks.
The U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, as well as Canadian and Australian dollars.
So far this year, the dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against six major currencies, has gained 4.4%, after a 6.3% gain in 2021.
The greenback has benefited all year from safe-haven flows during the war in Ukraine, as well as expectations of aggressive Federal Reserve tightening to control the surge in inflation.
U.S. rate futures have priced in an 85% chance of a 50 basis point hike at the May meeting, with roughly 220 basis points of cumulative hikes for 2022.
In cryptocurrencies, speculators reduced net short positioning on bitcoin to 244 contracts in the week ending April 5, compared with net shorts of 271 the week, CFTC data showed.
Bitcoin has stabilized above $40,000 after an up and down last couple of months, with the Ukraine war and soaring inflation as backdrop. The world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization has behaved more like a risk asset.
So far this year, bitcoin has fallen more than 7% versus the dollar. It was last down 1.5% at $42,822.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index on Friday posted its largest weekly percentage gain in a month, supported by the prospect of a more aggressive pace of Federal Reserve tightening to curb soaring inflation.
The index also advanced to 100 for the first time in nearly two years. It rose as high as 100.19, its highest since May 2020. It was last little changed on the day at 99.822, and up 1.3% on the week.
The greenback gained ground against a basket of six currencies over the past month, particularly versus the euro, which has been pressured by investor concerns about the economic costs of war in Ukraine and a potentially nail-biting presidential election in France.
Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said that ""the Fed's hawkish message on quantitative tightening, renewed sanction risks in Europe and the polling shift in favor of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen ahead of France's presidential election has put pressure on risk sentiment, especially in Europe.""
This week's release of the minutes of the Fed's March meeting showed ""many"" participants were prepared to raise rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months.
On the other side of the dollar's rally, the euro dropped to a one-month low of $1.0837. It last changed hands at $1.0853, down 0.3% on the day. The euro has fallen in seven straight sessions.
Meeting minutes from the European Central Bank published on Thursday suggested its policymakers are keen to act to combat inflation, but the euro zone has so far taken a more cautious tack than other central banks, weakening the euro.
""ECB minutes presented little in contrast to recent comments by policymakers, though the sense is that the bank is merely awaiting data over the coming months showing the impact of higher energy prices and the war in Ukraine to decide when to hike first - whether it's in Q3 or Q4,"" wrote Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto, in a research note. ""In either scenario, we don't anticipate more than 50 basis points in tightening from the ECB this year, which is only as much as the Fed is set to roll out in one meeting, next month."" 
A tightening election race in France between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Le Pen has added pressure on the euro, raising investor concerns about the future direction of the euro zone's second-biggest economy. Macron is still ahead in polls. 
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, hitting 124.67 yen, its highest in over a week and approaching last month's near seven-year high of 125.1. It was last up 0.3% at 124.355 and 1.5% higher on the week.
The yen has steadied this month after tumbling in March, but remains under pressure as the U.S. raises interest rates and the Bank of Japan intervenes in the bond market to keep rates low. 
Sterling lost ground versus the dollar, and was last down 0.3% at $1.3035.

29,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 10:07AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Six weeks after Russia sent troops into Ukraine, the rouble has staged an apparently extraordinary recovery, but all is not what it seems and the exchange rate used in everyday transactions is sometimes very different to the official one.
The rouble's swift rebound on the Moscow Exchange to levels seen before Feb. 24 is being touted in state media and by some government officials as evidence that authorities have got a firm grip on the country's finances despite being battered by the toughest Western sanctions ever. 
""Our economy appears to be resilient to Western sanctions, the rouble is firming visibly,"" a state TV presenter said on Friday.
The rouble rallied past 72 to the dollar on Friday, its strongest level so far this year, heading away from a record low of 121.52 it hit on March 10. Analysts polled by Reuters in late March expected the rouble to trade at 97.50 to the greenback in 12 months' time.

But anyone who tries to buy foreign currency online at a bank or, illegally, at a foreign exchange booth, or who buys goods and services online denominated in foreign currencies will find the actual rate considerably worse.
And the rouble's buying power has been sharply eroded as companies hike prices for goods, especially ones produced outside Russia whose future supply is in doubt due to the sanctions.
""I used to buy cans of Dutch-made baby formula for 2,500 roubles before Feb. 24,"" said Marina, a Moscow resident, with her newborn baby. ""Now the same can costs 4,500 roubles while boxes of kasha (a porridge-based drink for children) have gone up to 100 from 64 roubles for a 500-ml box."" 
Since Feb. 24, food prices have soared, taking the year-to-date increase in prices for cabbage and carrots to 85% and 54%, respectively, according to statistics service Rosstat.
Prices of imported goods jumped even higher, with prices for some foreign-made cars more than doubling.
High inflation has been the key concern among households for years as it dents living standards, a fall which will be aggravated by the deepest economic contraction since 2009, a Reuters poll suggests.
A survey by state polling agency VTsIOM from February showed that 64% of people in Russia had no savings.
Emergency capital controls helped the rouble rebound in Moscow where trading volumes dwindled compared to before the Kremlin started what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman has said the rouble has become a crucial target for Russia to defend, ""not so much because it's all important but because it's so clearly visible"". 
""So defending the rouble, never mind the real economy, makes sense as a propaganda strategy,"" Krugman said in an op-ed in the New York Times early this month.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has shrugged off Western allegations that the firming rouble does not reflect the actual economic situation.
RISKS OF STRONG ROUBLE
But the currency's official appreciation comes with risks. It makes selling commodities abroad for foreign currency less profitable since the revenues Russia ultimately gets from such exports are mostly rouble-denominated. 
That could put pressure on the already crisis-stricken budget at a time when Russia is cut off from global capital markets and has raised lending rates sharply.
""Further firming in the rouble will tear the budget apart,"" said Evgeny Suvorov, economist at CentroCreditBank, adding that rouble gains could deprive the budget of funds needed to support companies, banks and households.
In a sign that authorities are concerned about the rouble appreciation, something that surprised many experts, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that his ministry and the central bank were aiming to make the rouble more predictable.
Market volatility has spiked in recent weeks. The supply-demand balance was disrupted as authorities, seeking to cap losses in the rouble, obliged export-focused companies to convert 80% of their FX revenue into roubles, which became the main driving power for the once free-floating currency.
At the same time, demand for FX was artificially suppressed. Russia banned cash purchases of dollars and euros, introduced a 12% commission on buying foreign currency online, and set the maximum amount that an individual could withdraw from their bank account at $10,000 until Sept. 9.
""People grew cold towards forex due to commissions and restrictions on its withdrawal from the country,"" said Maxim Biryukov, senior analyst at Alfa Capital brokerage.
The finance ministry told Reuters that the recent sharp strengthening impacted oil and gas revenues but did not pose a risk to Russia's fiscal policy.
The central bank did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the rouble rate.
INFLATION ISSUE
In theory, a stronger rouble could help rein in inflation that is on track to spike to 24%, its highest since 1999, according to analysts polled by Reuters. The central bank targets 4%.
But consumer prices keep on rising due to disruptions to imports and a lack of foreign components, said Gazprombank economist Pavel Biryukov, who forecasts annual inflation at 27% in mid-2022. 
Despite remarkable rouble gains on the Moscow Exchange, banks are offering to sell dollars and euros at different rates. On Friday, the largest lender Sberbank was selling dollars and euros online for 79.8 and 85.1 roubles, respectively, compared to an official rate of 76.25 and 83.29. 
Some exchange offices are still selling cash forex for roubles despite the official ban, but at a different price.
Within a short walking distance of the Kremlin, an exchange office behind an unmarked door offered to sell cash dollars for 93 roubles and euros for 103 roubles on Thursday.

A man behind bulletproof glass in the office explained the gap between its prices and the rouble rate on the Moscow Exchange by ""the need to make some money"".
Russia's tourism industry also has a different exchange rates for those with enough money to holiday abroad. The euro-rouble conversion rate to buy trips to Turkey was at 85.5 on Friday, according to a Coral Travel agency in Moscow.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, trading at a two-year high and underpinned by the likelihood of sharp rises in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 99.920, its best level since May 2020.
The index is up 1.2% this week, in the wake of the release of the minutes of the Fed's March meeting, which showed ""many"" participants were prepared to raise interest rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months to combat inflation.
“The takeaway from the March Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes… was that the Federal Reserve seemed confident enough about growth and the labor market, but that inflation needed to be addressed—and fast,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
“It seems clear that the Fed would have opted to start the cycle with a 50bp hike were it not for the war in Ukraine.”
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is on the hawkish side of the debate, and he stated Thursday that the central bank needs to raise the federal funds rate by another 3 percentage points by year's end.
""I would like to get there in the second half of this year...We have to move,"" to get ahead of inflation running at triple the Fed's 2% target, Bullard said. ""We are talking about bigger moves than we have made in a long time.""
On the flip side, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0855, at a new one-month low, after the European Union agreed to a ban of Russian coal, starting from August, as punishment for alleged atrocities by Russian troops on Ukrainian civilians, something denied by Moscow.
Fears of a new Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine are growing, with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba calling for Western countries to provide his country with more sophisticated weapons at a meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization counterparts in Brussels on Thursday.
The accounts from the March meeting of the European Central Bank showed policymakers as keen to unwind stimulus, but the specter of a euro-area recession in the wake of Russia’s invasion could still cause the central bank to pause.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 124.09, climbing to its highest level in over a week and approaching last month's near seven-year high of 125.10.
GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3043, AUD/USD edged lower to 0.7477, while USD/CNY inched higher to 6.3626."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, hitting a one-month high against the euro as a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy supported the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 99.838 by 11:48 PM ET (3:48 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.04% to 123.97.
The AUD/USD pair was steady at 0.7479 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.6881.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3624 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3071.
The dollar index climbed as high as 99.904 in early Asia trading, its best level since May 2020. It is also up 1.2% for the week, which would be its biggest advance in one month. The Fed’s recent hawkish tone, reflected in the minutes from its latest meeting and a slew of policymakers speaking at separate events on Thursday, has also given the U.S. currency a boost.
""Recent gains in the dollar index seem fairly sustainable over the remainder of the month as markets settle on the idea of a much more aggressive Fed in the second quarter,"" Monex Europe Ltd. head of FX analysis Simon Harvey told Reuters.
""However, we believe further upside in the dollar is unlikely without a recalibration of the Fed’s terminal rate in markets. This is largely due to the limited upside in current Fed pricing based upon current fundamentals.""
Across the Atlantic, the euro fell to a new one-month low of $1.0856 in early Asian trading after the European Union moved towards banning Russian coal from August 2022 onwards. These are the latest sanctions that are being discussed or already imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The European Central Bank (ECB) is also grappling with inflation but ""while ECB members have sounded relatively hawkish to the recent inflation shock, providing EUR/USD with a modicum of support around the 1.09 handle, sustained pressure from European energy prices and calls for further sanctions on Russian energy exports to the eurozone suggest further declines in EUR/USD are likely,"" said Harvey.
Uncertainty in the French presidential election that begins on Apr. 10 is also hitting the euro. Incumbent Emmanuel Macron is currently ahead in the polls, but far-right candidate Marine Le Pen is also making gains.
The dollar also continued gaining against the Japanese yen, climbing to its highest level in over a week and testing a near seven-year high of 125.1 last hit in March 2022. Although the yen has steadied in the month to date after the previous month's tumble, pressure remains as the Bank of Japan intervenes in the bond market to keep interest rates low.

JOHANNESBURG/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Most emerging market currencies will continue to struggle against the mighty dollar over the coming year as the U.S. Federal Reserve finally delivers expected aggressive policy tightening, according to a Reuters poll of FX strategists.
Central banks in emerging market economies have been bracing for this for months by hiking their benchmark interest rates. But the actual moment when the Fed delivers half-point rate increases and rapid balance sheet reduction still matters.
Minutes from the Fed's March meeting showed officials had generally agreed to trim the central bank's balance sheet by $95 billion a month, providing a major boost to the greenback which was already riding high.
The latest Reuters poll of over 50 currency strategists showed nearly all developing market currencies would weaken over the coming 12 months. 
Even currencies which have been dragged higher by the ongoing commodity cycle and their respective central banks' policy tightening, like the Brazilian real and the South African rand, were forecast to give up about half of those gains in a year.
These currencies have gained about 18% and 9% respectively so far in 2022.
The Mexican peso - a classic emerging market foreign exchange hedge — is expected to lose more than three times its gains for this year in 12 months.
""In the face of imminent sharp Fed hikes and with U.S. yields moving rapidly higher, the resilience of EMFX remains somewhat surprising,"" noted Paul Meggyesi, head of FX strategy at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""A particular risk to EMFX is that as the Fed starts to deliver rate hikes, further upside in U.S. yields could be primarily driven more by real yields than breakeven inflation""
Meggyesi added this has historically been negative for emerging market currencies.
While most emerging market currencies have managed to escape the onslaught of the Fed's policy tightening relatively unscathed, the Russian rouble and the Turkish lira were notable exceptions.
The rouble, which fell by half in the past month and hit an all-time low of 150 per dollar after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, was expected to weaken over 15% to 94.2 per dollar in a year from 78.5 presently.
The Russian currency is driven by export-focused companies selling foreign currency and low activity of importers. But analysts warned the recent rouble rally won't last.
""(The recent gain) is not the true reflection of the fundamental situation in Russia. The economy is expected to contract very sharply and inflation is going to become more elevated, which over the longer term should be more consistent with a weaker rouble,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.
Hardman said the situation for the Turkish lira wasn't very different.
""They (the government) are intervening to support the lira but they're not going down the kind of draconian measures like capital controls we see in Russia.""
The lira, which weakened 44% last year, was forecast to plunge another 15% to 17.27 per dollar in a year as it grapples with rampant inflation that hit a 20-year high of 61.14% in March.

China's tightly controlled yuan was predicted to depreciate 1.4% to 6.45 per dollar in a year as analysts warned that a shrinking yield gap between Chinese and U.S. 10-year government bonds could trigger capital outflows.
Elsewhere in Asia, the Philippine peso and the Indian rupee were set to weaken between 1%-3%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar climbed to nearly two-year highs on Thursday, as investors digested hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, but wondered whether the currency's value already reflected further tightening moves.
The dollar index hit 99.823 on Thursday, the highest since late May 2020. It was last up 0.2% at 99.810.
""With traders pricing in more than 225 basis points of interest rate hikes over the rest of this year, there's certainly more risk of the Fed failing to meet expectations than exceed them,"" said Matthew Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com and City Index.
""The greenback's uptrend has begun to falter against some of its commodity-correlated rivals, but until the euro and yen can find a floor the path of least resistance for the dollar index remains to the topside,"" he added
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voter this year on the Federal Open Market Committee and a known hawk, continued to sound the alarm on inflation on Thursday.
He said the Fed remains behind in its fight against inflation despite increases in mortgage rates and government bond yields that have raced ahead of actual changes in the central bank's target federal funds rate.
Bullard's comments, however, had little impact on the dollar.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, neither of whom are voters in 2022, on Thursday supported rate increases, but provided a somewhat dovish counterpoint.
The dollar gained on Wednesday after minutes from the March Fed meeting showed ""many"" participants were prepared to raise interest rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months. 
The Fed also said it will reduce the Fed's balance sheet after the May meeting at a rate of $95 billion per month, the beginning of the reversal of the massive stimulus it pumped into the economy during the pandemic.
The euro, on the other hand, hit a one-month trough against the dollar at $1.0871, but was last down 0.2% at $1.0875.
European Central Bank policymakers appeared keen to unwind stimulus at their March 10 meeting, with some pushing for even more action, as conditions for raising rates had either been met or were about to be met, minutes of the ECB meeting showed on Thursday.
A seemingly tight presidential election in France is another wild card, and the prospect of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen beating incumbent Emmanuel Macron has weighed on the euro and French debt ahead of Sunday's first-round vote.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell 0.3% versus the greenback, as the Fed's tone offset a hawkish shift from Australia's central bank, while a pullback in commodity prices also reversed some of their recent strength.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.2% to 123.990.

The scheme is the first one approved under the EU crisis framework adopted last month, which temporarily eased the EU's state aid rules following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""This scheme will enable France to mitigate the economic impact of Putin's war in Ukraine and to support companies affected by the current crisis, as well as by the related sanctions"", European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The measure will be financed using part of the 300 billion euro budget France had initially allocated under three French schemes to support the economy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were initially approved in March 2021.

Under the new scheme, beneficiaries will be entitled to receive new loans that will be partly covered by a state guarantee.

36,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 08:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The ruble rallied for a third day to approach the highest in more than two months, evoking skepticism from currency strategists who say the market is broken because of capital controls, forced dollar sales and ultra-thin volumes.
Russia’s currency jumped as much as 7.3% on Thursday, sealing its rebound from a collapse that followed the nation’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions that isolated it from the global financial system. A key driver of the latest gains is the continued demand for Russia’s oil and gas in Europe and elsewhere, handing the country almost $1 billion a day in revenue.
Mocked as ‘Rubble’ by Biden, Russia’s Ruble Comes Roaring Back
Strategists say the ruble’s rally isn’t credible: The exchange rate is no longer free-floating and the currency would be at a very different level if barriers were removed. With Russia tottering on the brink of a debt default and the economy shrinking, the ruble no longer reflects the country’s fundamentals, they say.
“It’s a completely artificial level and so very little credence should be given to it,” said Cristian Maggio, the head of portfolio strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank in London. “Almost no one can trade the ruble and those who really do, they trade at very different levels than what the screens report. From a market and macroeconomic point of view, it makes no sense.”
The exaggerated moves in the ruble coincide with a plunge in trading volumes. The 20-day average of daily volumes in the currency has fallen to the lowest since 2012 as foreign investors cut exposure to Russian assets. 
Ruble volatility is surging. Realized 30-day swings have jumped to 79%, a record high that beats the 74% reached in the aftermath of the 2014 ruble crisis. While one-month implied volatility has come off its peak, it still remains high at 55%, compared with less than 12% before the invasion.
Given the thin participation, the ruble’s moves are dictated by the government’s tough capital controls. Those include a ban on foreigners selling Russian assets as well as mandated hard-currency sales by exporters.
Outflows Blocked
“It’s important to stress that it’s not a properly functioning market,” said Piotr Matys, a senior currency analyst at InTouch Capital Markets Ltd. in London. “The ruble is not a free-trading currency after Russia imposed various restrictions that essentially prevent capital outflows.”
Adding to the complexity, Putin has demanded that foreign buyers pay in rubles for Russia’s natural gas. While European officials rejected the plan when it was first announced, a French official said March 31 that the new mechanism won’t change payments as mandated in supply deals, which will continue as before.
All the moving parts mean price discovery is close to impossible.
“My focus has been limited on ruble lately purely because it is a synthetic market,” said Simon Harvey, the head of currency analysis at Monex Europe. “Once the depth comes back, pricing will look wildly different to where it is currently trading at, unless there is severe intervention or continued capital restrictions.”

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's real will keep trading close to its pre-pandemic levels in coming weeks, still riding a wave of positive sentiment that is strikingly at odds with worsening economic conditions in the South American country, a Reuters poll showed.
The Brazilian currency notched its best quarter in 13 years in the first three months of 2022, with a 17.5% appreciation. It began the second quarter strongly and is set to maintain the winning streak in the near term.
However, the real's performance is diverging from an economy that continues to disappoint. A sharp rise in interest rates is denting economic activity but failing to significantly curb high inflation.
Out of a total 10 analysts that answered a separate qualitative question in the poll, six viewed the risks for the real skewed to the upside, while three saw them tilted to the downside and one was neutral - the most bullish balance in recent surveys.
Numeric forecasts were more cautious, but relatively optimistic as well, pointing to a shallow 1.3% drop in one month to 4.72 reais per U.S. dollar from 4.66 reais on Wednesday, according to the median estimate of 21 FX strategists polled April 4-6.
The poll shows the Brazilian currency is now expected to depreciate 10.8% to 5.22 reais in 12 months, as Brazil's anemic growth, fears about the outcome of elections in October and other issues eventually offset the momentum.
Just before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the currency changed hands at around 4.20 reais to the dollar. 
""The level of interest rates and the positive tailwind of commodities, amid a significant country risk premia reduction vis-a-vis last year explain the move in BRL,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a recent report.
They upgraded their second-quarter estimate for the real to 5.00 from 5.30 but added: ""while we think the real can continue to be well supported around current levels, our valuation models have started to flag it on expensive territory.""
The Mexican peso, which traded at 20.034 per U.S. dollar on Wednesday, is expected to keep oscillating within its post-pandemic range of 20.00-21.00, slowly losing 2.7% in the next year to 20.60.

The Mexican currency has been trading steady since it returned to pre-pandemic levels shortly after the initial hit from the health crisis. In the first quarter of this year, it gained 3.2%, almost unmoved by the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

TORONTO (Reuters) - REUTERS POLL-CANADIAN DOLLAR TO STRENGTHEN SLIGHTLY TO 1.25/USD IN THREE MONTHS, MATCHING MARCH'S FORECAST
REUTERS POLL-CANADIAN DOLLAR SEEN UP 2% AT 1.23/USD IN ONE YEAR
Canada's dollar will strengthen over the coming year as the Bank of Canada potentially hikes interest rates aggressively but gains could be capped by the economy's dependence on the housing market, a Reuters poll showed. 
The median forecast in the poll was for the Canadian dollar to edge 0.4% higher to 1.25 per U.S. dollar, or 80 U.S. cents, in three months' time, matching last month's forecast. It was then expected to climb to 1.23 in a year's time.
Should Russia-Ukraine tensions ease over the next few months ""there will be both a reason for a bit more of a risk-on trade, which would be beneficial to the Canadian dollar, but also some help from the Bank of Canada, in so far as it front-loads rate hikes,"" said Royce Mendes, director & head of macro strategy at Desjardins.
Canada's central bank is expected to raise its overnight interest rate by half a percentage point at its next policy meeting on April 13, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also sharply raised their inflation forecasts for this year. [ECILT/CA]
The BoC has not raised rates by that magnitude since May 2000. Last month, the central bank moved by the quarter-percentage-point increment it usually favors as it hiked for the first time since October 2018.
With the Ukraine crisis driving demand for the safe-haven U.S. dollar, the loonie has not benefited as much as it normally does from surging oil prices. But that could change.
""I think there is still scope for a boost as investors digest some of the positive impact those higher commodity prices are having on the Canadian economy,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.
Canada is a major producer of energy products, helping to drive exports to a record high in February. Economists anticipate more gains for exports ahead.
But another key part of the economy, the housing market, has started to lose some momentum.
That could be an early sign there are limitations on how high the Bank of Canada will be prepared to lift rates in the current tightening cycle, at least compared to the Federal Reserve.

""The recovery in Canada has been so much more dependent (than the United States) on residential investment and house prices more generally and obviously those are more sensitive to interest rate hikes,"" Brown said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, but still remained close to a two-year high after minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers were preparing to move aggressively to head off inflation.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 99.520, just below Wednesday's high of 99.78 which was its highest since May 2020. 
Wednesday saw the release of the minutes from last month’s Federal Reserve policy meeting when the central bank raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
They showed the policymakers have laid out a plan to shrink their balance sheet by more than $1 trillion a year, and also indicated that “many” viewed one or more half-point increases as possibly appropriate going forward if price pressures fail to moderate.
While this content was broadly within expectations, the Fed’s determination to move quickly and aggressively to combat inflation gave the dollar a boost.
“Our short-term fair value model shows that, for some G10 pairs (like EUR/USD), the greenback remains undervalued,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This suggests the dollar still has some room to catch up with the big moves in rates (a major determinant of its short-term fair value), and we think a consolidation around these higher levels is more likely than a correction at this stage.”
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.0918, rebounding after hitting a one-month low of 1.0874 on Wednesday as fresh sanctions were levied on Moscow after allegations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine.
Also weighing on the single currency are the rising chances of the far-right, anti-EU Marine Le Pen winning the French presidential elections this month, with the first-round vote taking place on Sunday.
“Le Pen’s stance on a number of EU-related issues (like an exit from the EU) has softened since the 2017 election campaign, but her impact on the stability of the EU is still perceived to be quite significant,” ING added.
The minutes from the European Central Bank’s last meeting are due later in the day and are unlikely to be anything as hawkish as the Fed's with the bloc’s central bank having to cope with slumping growth in the wake of the Ukraine war even as Eurozone inflation soared to a record high of 7.5%.
""Quarter-on-quarter growth rates will be very low this year,"" ECB board member Fabio Panetta said in a speech Wednesday. ""The adverse impact of the war could well bring them into negative territory and produce longer-lasting effects.""
Elsewhere, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 123.70, near a one-week high, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3086, AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7491, while USD/CNY was largely unchanged at 6.3612."

(Reuters) - Bearish bets on most Asian currencies eased as regional central banks sought to normalise policy due to surging inflation, while investors turned bullish on Singapore dollar for the first time in over a month, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
Long positions on the Chinese yuan firmed despite increasing vulnerability from COVID-19 lockdowns, divergence in global and domestic monetary policy cycle, narrowing yield differentials, and headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Maybank analysts say strong fundamentals — a solid trade surplus, potential for more monetary accommodation and capacity to boost infrastructure investment to support growth has investors still betting long on the yuan.
Traders polled by Reuters have been consistently bullish on the yuan since late October last year, while some analysts expect the currency, which has depreciated 0.8% since March, to remain within a 6.35 and 6.40 per dollar range in the near term.
Elsewhere, bets turned bullish on the Singapore dollar for the first time since late February, while bearish positions on the Indian rupee, Philippine peso and the Thai baht eased marginally, a fortnightly poll of 14 respondents found.
""In Emerging Asia, the tide of improving economic conditions and rising inflationary pressures continues to tilt more central banks towards monetary policy normalisation,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said, expecting the Malaysian central bank to begin hiking rates soon.
The Philippine peso, which has appreciated nearly 2% since mid-March, has seen the sharpest drop in its bearish bets as the central bank looked ready to take pre-emptive action to combat rising inflation.
Short bets on the Indian rupee were at its lowest since Feb. 24. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday is expected to hold its key interest rates, a separate poll by Reuters showed, even as inflation held above the central bank's upper end of the forecast range.
The Indian central bank is seen holding until at least August to hike rates, in line with regional peers but placing it well behind major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in tackling inflation.
In Singapore, the central bank is likely to tighten its policy setting next week - the third time in a row - to tackle inflationary pressures.
Elsewhere, bets on the Indonesian rupiah turned marginally long for the first time since late February, while short position on the Malaysian ringgit solidified to its highest since mid-December on weak growth outlook.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was hovering near a two-year high on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its hawkish stance in its latest latest meeting minutes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was at 99.605 by 11:59 PM ET (3:59 AM GMT). The index hit its highest level since May 2020 overnight at 99.778.
The USD/JPY pair was little changed at 123.7.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.43% to 0.7481, while the NZD/USD pair was down 0.36% to 0.6897.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.3622 and the GBP/USD pair ticked up to 1.3076.
Commodity currencies retreated from their recent highs as oil prices fell. The euro recovered to $1.0911 in Asian trading after hitting a one-month low of $1.0874.
""Many"" policymakers are prepared to hike interest rates in 50-basis-point increments at coming meetings., the Fed’s minutes from its March meeting showed on Wednesday. The minutes also showed general agreement about trimming $95 billion a month from asset holdings which had ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the minutes’ content was widely within expectations, the Fed’s determination to begin as soon as May 2022 was a jolt to investors and is likely to keep the dollar elevated.
""The market has been slow to accept the reality that quantitative tightening is coming much sooner than previously expected,"" Spectra Markets’s Brent Donnelly told Reuters.
""This should keep stocks heavy and the dollar supported into the May 4th Fed meeting,"" he added.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) will release the minutes from its own latest meeting later in the day. Although expected to take a less hawkish stance than its U.S. counterpart, the ECB must also strike the balance between managing high inflation and preventing a recession.
However, China is taking the opposite approach, as it reiterated its intention to loosen monetary policy to help combat its latest COVID-19 outbreak and a slumping property market. The readout from a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday said that officials will use monetary policy tools at an “appropriate time” and consider other measures to boost consumption.
The broad selling of equities and other risk assets as higher interest rates loom also hurt cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin fell 5% overnight to $43,000."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will remain dominant for now so long as the Federal Reserve stays a hawkish course on interest rate hikes and its intentions to unload some of its pandemic-related bond purchases, according to a Reuters poll of forex strategists.
The dollar index, which gained nearly 7% against major currencies last year, continued its stellar performance and has risen another 4% so far this year, with about half of those gains in March alone.
Much of that strength was driven by comments from Federal Reserve officials who in addition to calling for 50-basis point rate rises are also speaking openly about forcefully reducing the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
That has driven U.S. Treasury yields to multi-year highs and investors into dollar-denominated assets, a key part of the strong dollar trade that is not expected to fade any time soon, keeping the currency well-bid.
Market speculators' net long bets on the dollar rose to an 11-week high in the latest week, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
More than two-thirds of analysts who answered a separate question, 37 of 53, said the strong dollar trade would last for at least another three months, including 17 who said more than six months. 
Thirteen respondents said under three months and the remaining three said the trade is already over.
""We've got some aggressive tightening coming up this year from the Fed. We think the fed funds rate will probably hit 3% in the first quarter of next year, but (they could) even be cutting rates by the final quarter of 2023,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets research at ING.
""I think the dollar could hold onto its gains for a lot of 2022...(and) we shouldn't be starting to look for weakening in the dollar until perhaps, next spring-summer 2023."" (Graphic: Reuters foreign exchange poll - April 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/znpneqmwxvl/Reuters%20foreign%20exchange%20poll%20-%20April%202022.png) 
That view lines up with median forecasts in the April 4-6 poll of over 80 forex strategists who expected the greenback to eventually cede some of its gains to other currencies.
But there are plenty of reasons for delay, not least of which is the Russia-Ukraine war, which has sent the cost of energy and commodities spiralling higher, with Europe in particular feeling the pinch. 
""We see developments in the energy market as the most important upfront negative for EUR/USD - elevated prices are not going away any time soon,"" noted George Saravelos, global head of FX research at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""On the flipside, further Fed repricing is becoming incrementally less beneficial to the dollar, the ECB has exceeded our (hawkish) expectations and Europe's fiscal response to offset the near-term growth impact looks sizeable.""

The euro was forecast to erase its over 4% losses for the year and rise to $1.14 in 12 months, a view analysts have held onto for more than two years. The common currency has not gained against the dollar for three months in a row since September 2020.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar's share of world currency reserves continues to ebb slowly - but reserve stashes are only one measure of its dominance of global finance, and there's no realistic scenario where that gets derailed any time soon.
Central banks and private businesses need their rainy day funds to be in liquid assets that are easily accessible, in currencies that are widely accepted and in plentiful supply, and in jurisdictions with an internationally recognized rule of law. 
The dollar meets all those criteria. No other currency comes close, even though the share of central bank reserves and global trade flows is increasingly being spread across a wider range of currencies.
The International Monetary Fund's latest cut of central bank reserves shows that the dollar's slice of the pie at the end of last year - before Russia's invasion of Ukraine and freezing of Moscow's FX reserves - was 58.8%. 
That's down from 59.2% the prior quarter and the lowest since comparable data were first tracked in 1999/2000. This is a long-term trend - the dollar's share of known, or 'allocated' reserves was over 70% in 2002. 
Bank for International Settlements data show that the dollar was bought or sold in roughly 88% of global foreign exchange transactions in 2019. That has remained pretty steady over the past 20 years.
A U.S. Federal Reserve paper in October showed that about 60% of international and foreign currency liabilities and assets - primarily claims and loans, respectively - are denominated in dollars. This share has remained pretty stable since 2000.
On trade, around 40% of global transactions in goods are invoiced in dollars. Global trade hit a record high of $28.5 trillion in 2021, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
The 2000-2020 period was marked by China's rise to global economic superpower, surging dollar reserves demand from Asia after the 1997 crisis, and an explosion in globalisation and cross-border capital and trade flows. 
These forces will be nowhere near as strong in the next 20 years, so demand for dollars will ebb, even if only slowly and at the margins - but so too will demand for all other reserve currencies. And in the relative world of currencies, that doesn't mean the greenback will lose out.
""You still need an alternative. Don't forget, it took two World Wars and loss of Empire for sterling to lose its status as the world's No. 1 reserve currency,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""UNASSAILABLE"" 
Debate over the dollar's future reserve status has intensified, with both sides broadly represented by two leading academics - University of California, Berkeley, professor Barry Eichengreen, and Columbia University professor Adam Tooze. 
Eichengreen and his colleagues argue that the dollar's unique status will gradually diminish as a more multipolar world takes shape. Central bank reserve managers have been undertaking ""active portfolio diversification"" into 'non-traditional' currencies for years, they said in an IMF working paper https:// last month. 
Tooze doesn't dispute this, but argues https:// that many of these currencies - such as Canadian and Australian dollars - are ""very much part of America's extended financial security system,"" protected and bolstered by dollar swap lines between their central banks and the Fed. 
If the United States was in direct economic or military conflict with Russia or China, it's clear which side most of these countries would be on. 
The only two credible, long-term rivals to the dollar for official reserves or 'vehicle currency' use - invoicing in a currency that is neither that of the importer or exporter - are China's yuan and the euro. 
But there are myriad reasons why it will take years before they are viewed as safe, liquid, and accessible as the dollar.
The euro has a shortage of high-quality assets central banks can use as a store of value, there is still no euro zone-wide government-backed asset, and some international investors may be put off by the internal politics of a 19-nation bloc.
In China's case, it could be decades - the yuan is not fully convertible overseas and it is highly doubtful Beijing would welcome the currency appreciation that would likely follow.
Joey Politano, an analyst at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and author of a personal economics blog, simply states that the dollar's reserve currency status is so strong ""as to be nearly unassailable."" No other country has the ""proper mixture of deep capital markets, clear rule of law, massive economic size, and technological dynamism.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar surged to a nearly two-year high on Wednesday after minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting reinforced expectations of multiple half percentage-point rate increases to control soaring inflation.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against six major currencies, climbed to 99.7780, its strongest level since late May 2020. It was last up 0.1% at 99.588.
Fed officials viewed the hefty rate increases as appropriate at future meetings, especially if inflation pressures intensify, minutes showed. They would also have preferred a 50 basis point rise in the target range for the federal funds rate at the March meeting.
""There's a realization that some of the doves have come over to the 50 basis point hike territory and that is likely what we're going to see at the next several meetings going forward as inflationary pressures remain elevated,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The Ukraine conflict uncertainty likely prevented a 50 basis point hike last month, so it could put a little cold water on extremely hawkish policy. But still, we know multiple hikes are coming very soon.""
Fed officials also agreed to reduce the balance sheet by $95 million per month - $60 billion of its Treasury holdings and $35 billion of mortgage-backed securities - over three months, according to the minutes of the March meeting.
Analysts at Action Economics said the $95 billion balance sheet run-off was close to expectations of $100 billion per month.
The U.S. currency also hit the nearly two-year milestone on Tuesday after Fed Governor Lael Brainard, usually a more dovish policymaker, said she expected a combination of rate increases and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year. Further tightening would follow as needed, she added. 
Analysts said the Fed minutes were less hawkish than Brainard's comments.
The dollar held gains against the yen, which tracks U.S. two-year yields reflecting Fed policy expectations, trading up 0.1% at 123.78 yen..
""Clearly we've got rate hikes ahead of us, and we have a shrinking balance sheet ahead of us,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""The Fed is determined to rein in inflation, and we just hope and pray that there will be a soft landing of the economy and not a hard landing that sends us into a recession.""
The euro, on the other hand, was little changed versus the dollar, after falling to its lowest in a month as the prospect of new Western sanctions on Russia and the upcoming French presidential election added to pressure to the European currency. Europe's single currency benefited earlier from strong euro zone producer prices for February, which surged 31.4% year-on-year in February. The euro was last slightly down at $1.0896, after briefly touching a nearly one-month low of $1.0874.

45,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 09:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Russian ruble has wiped out the steep losses it incurred in the weeks after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine.
The currency advanced past 81.16 per U.S. dollar in Moscow trading, the level it closed at on Feb. 23 -- the day before Putin launched his attack. The ruble’s gains on Wednesday came even as the European Union and the U.S. coordinated a new raft of sanctions against Russia, while the Finance Ministry said its attempt to service debt in dollars had been blocked, potentially moving the country closer to default. 
The ruble went into a nosedive immediately after the invasion on Feb. 24 amid a raft of international sanctions that effectively ended its time as a freely traded currency. 
But tough capital controls -- including a ban on foreigners selling Russian assets as well as mandated hard currency sales by exporters -- have helped the ruble to regain ground. Last month, Putin demanded that overseas buyers of Russian natural gas switch to making payments in the local currency.

The onshore rate came close to 122 per dollar in early March, a more than 30% collapse from the level before the attack. While offshore price sources at various points indicated even weaker levels, liquidity was severely hampered.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar strengthened Wednesday on raised expectations of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, while the euro was weighed by the prospect of additional sanctions on Russia.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 99.640, just off its highest level since May 2020.
Driving the stronger tone in the dollar were comments from Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who is awaiting confirmation as Vice Chair of the U.S. central bank, who called for interest rate increases and rapid reductions to the Fed's balance sheet to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year.
""I think we can all absolutely agree inflation is too high and bringing inflation down is of paramount importance,"" Brainard said at a conference at the Minneapolis Fed.
Brainard is normally seen as a more dovish policymaker, and her comments resulted in U.S. bond yields climbing sharply, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to its highest since March 2019.
The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last month, its first increase since 2018, and expectations have been building that the central bank will move more aggressively at its meeting in May.
The minutes from the Fed meeting last month are due for release later Wednesday, and traders will parse their words carefully for guidance on what the policymakers plan to do next.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.0884, falling to its lowest level in nearly a month, with the U.S., European Union, and Group of Seven coordinating on a fresh round of sanctions on Russia, including a U.S. bar on investment in the country and an EU ban on coal imports.
“The euro’s performance is very strictly tied to the content of new sanctions the EU looks likely to impose on Russia; the bigger the implications for the energy market, the larger the impact on the euro,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 123.91, heading back towards March's near seven-year peak of 125.10, with the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese yields weighing on the yen.
GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3062, while AUD/USD held firm at 0.7580, retaining Tuesday's strength after the Reserve Bank of Australia signaled higher interest rates were approaching.
USD/PLN rose 0.2% to 4.2671 and EUR/PLN gained 0.1% to 4.6467 ahead of the latest meeting of Poland’s central bank later Wednesday, which is expected to result in an interest rate hike for the seventh straight occasion to counter surging inflation."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, slowly heading towards its highest level in nearly two years. The U.S currency jumped overnight over hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers, while the euro was down as the West mulls further sanctions on Russia.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 99.580 by1:22 AM ET (5:22 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.24% to 123.9.
TheAUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7582 while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.6944.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.3665 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3075.
The dollar index hit its highest level since May 2020, gaining 0.5% on Tuesday over comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard. Normally viewed as a more dovish policymaker, Brainard said she expects a combination of interest rate hikes and a rapid balance sheet runoff to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later in 2022, with further tightening to follow as needed.
""Brainard's comments are the proximate cause of the back up in yields and the firmer dollar that we've got,"" National Australia Bank Ltd. global head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
The U.S. 2-year yield is at its highest level since January 2019. The 5-year yield is at its highest since December 2018 and the benchmark 10-year yield rose to 2.6120%, its highest since April 2019.
""But when we talk about the dollar, it's difficult to divorce it from the euro-dollar exchange rate, given its weight in the index, and the euro has been done no favors by the latest talk about broadening sanctions, which is opening up bad news for the eurozone economy,"" Attrill added.
The European Union (EU), alongside the U.S. and the Group of Seven, is coordinating a fresh round of sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions could involve banning the purchase of Russian coal and preventing Russian ships from entering EU ports.
The sanctions are the latest since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 and are in response to the discovery of dead civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.
The dollar also gained against the Japanese yen, climbing 0.27% for its highest gains in a week and heading back towards the seven-year peak of 125.1 hit in March 2022. The Bank of Japan’s dovish stance is pinning Japanese yields down, and the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese yields is weighing on the yen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit its highest in nearly two years on Tuesday, boosted by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials who pushed for a quick reduction in the central bank's bloated balance sheet, with one of them expressing openness to hefty rate increases of half a percentage point.
The dollar index rose as high as 99.526, the highest since late May 2020. It was last up 0.5% at 99.498.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard, usually one of the Fed's more dovish policymakers, said on Tuesday she expects methodical interest rate increases and rapid reductions to the Fed's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet to bring U.S. monetary policy to a ""more neutral position"" later this year. Further tightening will follow as needed.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, also in remarks on Tuesday supported a rapid run-off of the Fed balance sheet, and said as well that ""50 basis-points is going to be an option that we'll have to consider.""
""The dollar's moves were primarily a function of Brainard's hawkish comments today. She was very clear on two things,"" said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
""One, the Fed wants to reduce the balance sheet quite aggressively and much more quickly than the last cycle. And two, the Fed is really open to a 50-basis point hike and could do so at any point over the next few meetings. This is the kind of language that you don't see from many Fed officials, especially Brainard,"" Nelson added.
The dollar rose 0.7% against the yen to 123.63 yen after earlier hitting a one-week peak of 123.66. On March 28, the dollar soared to 125.105 yen, the highest level since August 2015.
The euro, on the other hand, struggled amid concerns about the outcome of the French elections. It was down 0.6% at $1.0901 and matched a low of $1.09 hit on March 14. Just days earlier amid increased optimism over an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the euro rose to a one-month high of $1.1185 
President Emmanuel Macron is still ahead in opinion polls but his far-right eurosceptic rival Marine Le Pen has been closing the gap, and a poll on Monday put victory within the margin of error, unnerving investors ahead of the French presidential election's first round on Sunday.
Worries about the French elections have prompted traders in the euro to buy put options around $1.07-$1.09 for end-April expiry, Refinitiv data shows.
Expected price swings for the euro, or implied volatility, climbed to three-week highs as traders braced for more sanctions.
In other currencies, commodity units rallied led by the Australian dollar, boosted by the prospect of policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
The RBA dropped its pledge to be ""patient"" on tightening policy, while holding the key rate at a record low for now, as was expected. The New Zealand and Canadian dollars, as well as the Norwegian crown, rose in tandem with the Aussie currency. 
Title: Australian dollar, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvwekkrdvw/Australian%20dollar.JPG 
The Aussie dollar rose 0.4% to US$0.77521, while the New Zealand dollar gained 0.2% to US$0.6937.
""We're starting to see monetary policy elsewhere catch up with the Federal Reserve,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe, in London. ""The general belief on current Fed pricing is that it is pretty well-priced and there isn't much room to ratchet expectations higher.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded in a tight range Tuesday, while the euro edged lower on talk of additional sanctions on Russia and the Australian dollar received a boost from a hawkish central bank.
At 3:00 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 98.955, just below the one-week high of 99.083 reached overnight. 
The dollar has been drifting this week so far as investors await the arrival of the minutes from last month’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, due on Wednesday. 
Expectations are building that the central bank will move more aggressively at its meeting in May, especially after a jobs report that showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 431,000 jobs last month while the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6%.
Ahead of the Fed minutes, Tuesday sees the release of ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI data for March, at 10:00 AM EST (1400 GMT), which is expected to show increased momentum in March, while speeches from Fed policymakers Neel Kashkari, Lael Brainard and John Williams will also be closely studied.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD rose 0.9% to 0.7607, jumping to a nine-month high, after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.1% at its latest policy setting meeting, but indicated that rate hikes were coming.
Australia’s central bank dropped its pledge to be ""patient"" on tightening policy in its statement following the decision, a phrase that has featured in every post-meeting release since November 2021, suggesting that it is going to hike sometime soon.
EUR/USD was largely unchanged at 1.0972, hovering above a one-week low, on talk of fresh sanctions on Moscow following alleged atrocities on civilians by Russian forces in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Putin and his supporters would ""feel the consequences"" of events in Bucha, while Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, stated that new U.S. sanctions against Moscow would be announced this week.
“It still seems that the EU is some way from weaning itself off Russian oil,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Presumably, any moves from the EU toward a Russian oil embargo would see crude prices spike higher again and the euro come under pressure.”
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 122.58, dropping back further from the multi-year high of 125.10 reached in late March after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated that the recent pace of appreciation was ""somewhat rapid,"" and policymakers are watching moves ""carefully.""
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3133, USD/CNY was flat at 6.3638, while USD/TRY rose 0.1% to 14.7092 the day after Turkey’s inflation jumped to a fresh 20-year high in March, with consumer prices rising an annual 61.1% through last month."

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Monday, rising for three straight sessions, as civilian killings in north Ukraine and the prospect of increased sanctions pushed investors to seek safety in the greenback.
The U.S. currency also continued to benefit from a strong non-farm payrolls report for March that backed expectations for a hefty half a percentage point tightening by the Federal Reserve at next month's meeting.
""The dollar is bouncing higher as geopolitical developments have darkened clouds over the global economy,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""The buck was already enjoying jobs-inspired gains after solid hiring and lower unemployment cemented expectations of super-sized U.S. rate hikes this year.""
French President Emmanuel Macron called for new sanctions and said there were clear indications Russian forces had committed war crimes in the town of Bucha.
The Kremlin denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in the town.
German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union should discuss ending Russian gas imports. Russia supplies some 40% of Europe's gas needs.
In late morning trading, the dollar, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers rose 0.3% to 98.89.
Data on Friday showed U.S. unemployment hit a two-year low of 3.6% last month, leading investors to assess if the numbers would strengthen the Fed's resolve to tackle inflation by lifting rates sharply.
The euro, which has been under pressure due to worries about the economic damage from the war in Ukraine, fell 0.6% to 0.4% versus the dollar to $1.0988. Against sterling, the euro fell to a six-day low and it was last down 0.6% at 83.73 pence.
""More sanctions of course also mean that the risk of energy disruptions in Europe rises, because of our own sanctions or because Russia might get completely serious with its counter-sanctions rather than just changing the payment mode for natural gas,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) Head of FX.
""In my view the risk of significant euro weakness increases.""
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3% to 122.855 yen.
Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said a 50bp rate hike was already priced in. 
""CFTC data suggest the market has been rebuilding its long dollar position. That's one reason the dollar is making heavy work of rising any further just now,"" he said. 
Speculators' net long bets on the dollar rose to an 11-week high in the latest week.
Fed funds futures on Friday have priced an 80% chance of a 50 basis point hike next month, while two-year U.S. yields hit 2.4950%, their highest level since March 2019.
Markets in mainland China were closed for a public holiday, but in offshore trade the yuan was kept under pressure by concerns over a lengthening lockdown in Shanghai, where authorities are seeking to virus-test all 26 million residents.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar stabilized Monday after last week’s strong jobs report, while the euro weakened as talk of additional sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine ramped up.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 98.612.
Friday’s much anticipated U.S. jobs report for March confirmed a strong economy and a tight labor market, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 431,000 jobs last month while February’s release was revised higher to show 750,000 jobs added instead of the previously reported 678,000. 
Additionally, the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% and wages accelerated, providing room for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sharply in May.
That said, this was widely expected and Fed funds futures have already priced in a very strong chance of a 50 basis point hike next month. Bond yields have responded accordingly, with 2-year Treasury yields climbing near to 2.5%.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 122.72, with the yen falling again, following the heavy beating the Japanese currency took in March on the expectation of higher U.S. interest rates while Japanese rates remained anchored at rock bottom.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1044, weighed by talk of fresh sanctions on Moscow after Ukraine accused Russian forces of war crimes in the town of Bucha, something denied by Russia's defense ministry. 
German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union should talk about ending Russian gas imports, a subject the bloc has steered clear of so far, despite pressure from the U.S.
Such a move would have severe economic ramifications on the Eurozone, to the detriment of the single currency, as Russia supplies some 40% of Europe's gas needs.
GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3133, AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7513 ahead of a Reserve Bank of Australia meeting on Tuesday, while USD/CNY was flat at 6.3634, with markets in mainland China closed for a public holiday.
USD/TRY rose 0.1% to 14.7037 ahead of the release of the latest Turkish inflation data, which are expected to raise the pressure on the lira.
Consumer prices are expected to climb an annual 61.5% in March from 54.4% a month earlier when released later Monday, according to the median of 19 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
Turkey’s central bank, under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has chosen not to lift interest rates for the last three months, meaning Turkey’s interest rates are the world’s lowest when adjusted for prices."

Investing.com – The dollar started the week on a firm foot as U.S. Treasury yields rose over expectations that the U.S. will further tighten its monetary policy. On the other hand, potential bans on Russian gas kept the euro within sight of its 2022 lows.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was steady at 98.547 by 11:41 PM ET (3:41 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 122.66.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7512 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.6936.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3632, with Chinese markets closed for a holiday. The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3118.
The euro continues to be weighed down by concerns that the war in Ukraine will continue to impact economic growth. It last bought $1.1047, not too far from March's almost two-year low of $1.0806.
German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union should discuss ending Russian gas imports, with Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio saying that a debate on the issue could take place within the next few hours.
Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, which the Russian defense ministry has denied.
""Negative news on the war or a further lift in energy prices could see EUR/USD test $1.0800,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts said in a note.
""However, an improvement in sentiment or a weak dollar following the U.S. Federal Reserve minutes could push EUR/USD through upside resistance around $1.1150,"" they added, in reference to the central bank’s minutes from its latest meeting, due to be released on Wednesday.
Friday's U.S. jobs report was stronger than expected, with non-farm payrolls rising by 431,000 and the unemployment rate at 3.6%, in March. Further data also showed that the Institute of Supply Management manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for March was 57.1, while the manufacturing PMI was 58.8. The data was enough to spur bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to tighten its monetary policy.
Fed funds futures have priced a near four-in-five chance of a 50-basis point hike in May and two-year yields stand at a three-year high of 2.4930%.
The yen steadied during the previous week after its pummeling throughout March. However, expectations of higher U.S. interest rates against anchored Japanese yields saw the yen drop back below 122 per dollar.
However, ""the yen is not out of the woods,"" Rabobank senior strategist Jane Foley told Reuters.
""Another prolonged bout of severe selling pressure on the yen could put pressure on the Bank of Japan to re-think its policy. We forecast further upside for dollar/yen towards the 125 level in the latter half of 2022."""

The six cities in Zhejiang, which included the provincial capital of Hangzhou, will host the Asian Games in September.
The PBOC has ramped up testing of the digital currency in recent years and hoped to take advantage of the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the yuan globalisation.

However, Beijing's aim to make an Olympic splash with its digital currency was thwarted by a COVID 19-induced exclusion of foreign spectators. Instead, it has been taken up by a captive audience of locals unable to use their usual digital payment apps.
The PBOC statement also said Beijing and Zhangjiakou, which co-hosted the Winter Games in February, will also become e-CNY's pilot cities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Friday, helped by robust U.S. job growth numbers for March that firmed market expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase the pace of interest rate hikes in an effort to blunt rising inflation.
The nonfarm payrolls report showed that 431,000 jobs were added last month, versus estimates of 490,000, while data for February job increases were revised higher. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, lowest since February 2020.
""Another strong print is sustaining expectations for two or more jumbo-sized Fed hikes in the coming months and has added to momentum driving the dollar higher,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay.
Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate fell after the jobs report, pointing to expectations that the Fed will hike by a half-a-percentage point at each of its next three meetings to deal a more decisive blow to price pressures. That would follow a quarter-point hike on March 16, when the Fed embarked on a new tightening cycle. 
The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against six counterparts, including the euro, was up 0.314% at 98.627 at 3:10 p.m. EDT, building on Thursday's 0.5% climb.
For the week, the dollar was nearly flat, having rebounded from a midweek decline as hopes over Russia-Ukraine peace talks faded, boosting safe-haven demand for the American currency.
""Global risk sentiment continues to deteriorate and lift the greenback as hopes for a ceasefire in Ukraine fade,"" Schamotta said.
The euro failed to find any support from surging euro zone inflation, which climbed to 7.5% in March, hitting another record high and raising pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to rein in runaway prices even as growth slows sharply.
""We still think that as much as inflation is set to intensify further in the Eurozone, the ECB is likely to wait it out this quarter to see how the bloc evolves with the shock emanating from the war in Ukraine, though we think the ECB is on borrowed time and will need to hike this year,"" analysts from TD Securities said in a note. 
The euro was 0.24% lower versus the greenback at $1.10395. The single currency retreated sharply on Thursday after hitting a one-month high earlier in the session, as hopes for a ceasefire in Russia's invasion of Ukraine faded. Peace talks were ongoing on Friday. 
Versus the Norwegian crown, the euro fell 0.7% to 9.6599 as the commodity-linked currency rebounded from Thursday's sharp declines. The Norwegian crown also rose 0.56% versus the dollar. 
""We regard NOK to be caught in a tug of war between rising global recession risks and rising global commodity prices. As long as the global inflation narrative thrives NOK assets are likely to be in high demand,"" said Kristoffer Kjær Lomholt, Head of FX at Danske Bank. 

Another commodity-linked currency, the Australian dollar, rose 0.15% to $0.74965.
The Russian rouble has recovered to levels last reached in the days before Russia launched its invasion in February, defying predictions that the war would send it into freefall.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A scheme that protects the value of lira deposits has helped Turkey prop up the ailing currency, but payouts from it look set to place an increasing burden on the state budget, despite revenue-raising initiatives to offset the cost.
Ankara introduced the KKM deposit scheme, which compensates for losses incurred against foreign currencies, to stem a collapse in the lira in December triggered by interest rate cuts that President Tayyip Erdogan had pushed for.
That initially helped keep the lira steady, but it is now 10% weaker than at the end of 2021 and, unless the scheme's incentives are boosted, outflows appear likely as the lure of foreign currency for the corporate sector grows.
Authorities say they are acting to counter this. The central bank is pursuing an active policy to keep the lira on the strong side of 15 to the dollar, and a government source said participants were being asked to keep deposits in the scheme when they mature.
According to bankers' data, last week's first redemptions under the scheme - which was launched with three-, six- and 12-month maturities - cost 13 billion lira ($886 million), with depositors making returns significantly above the central bank's 14% policy rate.
The government source said subsequent redemptions would entail ""a serious budget burden.""
That will add pressure on state finances that, while still relatively robust, are already under strain from inflation expected to rise above 60% in March and increased subsidies for energy costs that have risen sharply since Russia invaded Ukraine.
In a step to offset that, Erdogan's AK Party presented a bill, due for parliamentary debate next week, raising finance companies' corporate tax to 25% from 20%.
That would boost budget revenues by 3 billion lira this year and 10 billion lira next, a government analysis shows. 
By comparison and based on last week's KKM volumes of around 600 billion lira ($41 billion) estimated by a treasury official, the cost to the treasury and central bank of a full year's redemptions would be 35 billion lira at the current exchange rate around 14.7, according to Reuters calculations. 
That cost would however rise to 165 billion lira if the currency - which hit a record low of 18.4 on Dec. 20 - slipped to 18 to the dollar.
The cost of future redemptions remains uncertain for now, a banking source, though pressure on the lira would be likely to rise in the event of significant outflows from the scheme.

An export-oriented textile industry representative said staying within it in might require added incentives. ""If there is no separate incentive, there may be a return to foreign currency,"" the representative said.

By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar dropped to a nearly two-week low on Wednesday as optimism over peace talks between Russia and Ukraine faded and investors' attention shifted to economic data and interest rate expectations.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six peer currencies, was down 0.57% at 97.861 at 2:20 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, having earlier touched its lowest level since March 17.
Much of that weakness was due to strength in the euro, which had rallied on Tuesday following Russia's promise during peace talks to reduce its attacks on Kyiv. 
The shift in tone in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks suggested ""the conflict may be moving to a more localized phase with some of the more extreme tail risk scenarios reducing in probability,"" analysts from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note to clients on Wednesday that recommended buying EUR/USD.
The United States, however, warned it had not seen ""signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, whose forces continued to bombard the outskirts of Kyiv and a besieged city in northern Ukraine on Wednesday.
While optimism over the Moscow-Kyiv talks waned, inflation reports fanned expectations that rising costs, which were accelerated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, would force Europe to rate hikes sooner rather than later, supporting the euro.
""The euro was slightly appreciating before inflation readings for March but got an additional boost upon their arrival,"" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics Scotiabank Economics.
Preliminary data showed that German annual inflation rose to its highest level in more than 40 years in March as prices of natural gas and oil products soared. Spain's flash CPI data for March showed prices rising at their fastest since May 1985.
However, ECB President Christine Lagarde said food and energy prices should stop increasing, helping the euro zone avoid the combination of stagnant growth and high inflation feared by economists.
The euro was at its highest level versus the greenback since March 1, and was last up 0.6% at 1.1152..
Aside from its safe-haven status, the dollar has drawn strength this year from investor expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which raised rates by 25 basis points at its March 16 meeting, will be more hawkish than the European Central Bank.
In Europe, data and policymakers' warnings highlighted stalling growth, plummeting confidence and soaring inflation as the European economy feels the impact of the war in Ukraine.
""Investors in thinking about how far to go the ECB has and even a shift in sentiment and shift in policy will certainly send the euro higher, just from expectations and speculative demand on the currency,"" said Ivan Asensio, head of FX risk advisory at Silicon Valley Bank.

Elsewhere, the yen recovered further from its seven-year low hit on Monday, after a meeting between Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida added to speculation about the level of official discomfort with a falling yen.
The yen was up 0.83% against the dollar at 121.85.

LONDON (Reuters) - The rouble has staged a lightening-fast recovery to levels last reached in the days before Russia invaded Ukraine, defying predictions that the war would launch it into freefall.
The dramatic rebound - the currency nearly halved in value in seven trading sessions following the Feb. 24 invasion - is partly down to a genuine improvement in Russian finances as energy export revenues grow and imports shrivel.
But using it as evidence that Russia's sanctions-savaged economy is out of the woods would be at best misleading. 
The currency is also being artificially inflated by capital controls and, with the country's gross domestic product predicted to shrink 10%-15% this year, Russians are quickly getting poorer as soaring inflation devours their earnings.
""This (rouble recovery) shouldn't be taken to be the market's view on the medium to longer-term outlook for Russia,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""Market forces cannot drive the rouble in the way they can the euro or dollar,"" he added, noting that while Russian demand for foreign exchange was falling, speculators who use currencies to bet on a country were now absent. 
Since the war started, the rouble has split into an onshore market for local institutions, and an offshore one for Western banks and investors to trade with each other and entities not subject to sanctions. Trading volumes have dried up on both. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said this week that Western banks had scaled back trading and credit lines to Russian entities, creating ""a friction between offshore and onshore trading"".
However, as the rouble has recovered, the price gap between the markets has shrunk.
According to Refinitiv data, the offshore rouble this week was quoted as strong as 75 per dollar, around where it traded on the eve of the invasion that Russia terms a ""special military operation"". 
On March 7, it hit a record low of 150 per dollar.
In onshore markets, the rouble on Friday briefly hit 80.33 per dollar, levels last seen pre-invasion on Feb. 23 and well clear of its March 10 low of 121.5. 
Graphic: Russian rouble vs U.S. dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnmwjavq/rouble%20vs%20dollar.PNG 
'PROPPED UP...' 
The White House on Thursday said Moscow was artificially ""propping up"" the rouble, and the role of official measures in the recovery is easy to pinpoint.
In response to the sweeping sanctions, Russia ramped up interest rates to 20%, restricted local firms' access to foreign currency cash, barred citizens from withdrawing more than $10,000 in foreign currency for six months, and stopped banks from selling hard currency in cash. 
Foreign investors have been banned from exiting securities, limiting the scramble to dump roubles, and President Vladimir Putin on Thursday demanded that foreign buyers pay in roubles for Russian gas from April 1. 
""European countries are not willing to do this, because if it is successful and European countries agree to this, it would have a supportive impact on the rouble market,"" said Danske Bank chief analyst Minna Kuusisto.
Analysts generally view Putin's demand as an attempt to undermine sanctions and bolster the currency, and Kuusisto noted that Russian gas sellers in the past did not fully convert foreign exchange income into roubles. 
...BUT TRADE-DRIVEN GAINS TOO
Part of the rouble recovery is however genuine: currencies can perform well even if an economy is tanking, as long as the balance of payment position is improving.
Analysing tanker traffic data, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates Russia's March oil export earnings will total $12.3 billion - up sharply on March 2021 as energy prices soar.
Collapsing imports could see the current account surplus double from 2021 to $200-$240 billion this year, the IIF also estimates.
IIF chief economist Robin Brooks acknowledged questions about the rouble move were legitimate given capital controls, though he deemed the recovery ""genuine"", pointing to fellow oil exporter Kazakhstan's currency, which has recouped half its post-invasion losses.

In the longer term, the rouble's fortunes look less favourable. 
Ostracism from the West is likely to mean fewer buyers for Russia's exports, and should oil prices tumble the rouble will struggle. With half its $640 billion of gold and foreign exchange reserves frozen, Russia has less much scope to defend the currency.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Friday ahead of the release of the widely watched U.S. monthly jobs report, which could help the Federal Reserve decide upon a more aggressive rate tightening cycle.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 98.465.
The much anticipated U.S. jobs report for March is due for release at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) and is expected to show continued signs of an improvement in the labor market, with around another 500,000 new jobs created.
The omens for a strong number are good, after data on Wednesday from the ADP Research Institute showed that U.S. companies employed an additional 455,000 people in March, and the weekly initial jobless claims data remained at a very low level on Thursday.
The U.S. Federal Reserve lifted interest rates by 25 basis points in March, for the first time since 2018, and a number of central bank policymakers have since indicated that a larger hike of 50 basis points may be needed in May to combat soaring inflation.
“We continue to doubt there is much more downside for the dollar from these levels, and markets may rebuild more long-dollar positions ahead of [Friday’s] nonfarm payrolls which may well endorse the recent hawkish re-pricing of Federal Reserve tightening expectations,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
USD/JPY traded 0.7% higher at 122.44, the pair’s first rise in four sessions as traders looked once more at the difference in government bond yields, with Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda making clear this week he’s determined to keep his 0.25% target for 10-year bond yields while the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes interest rates,
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1071, stabilizing after earlier retreating from a one-month high of 1.1185 as optimism about a ceasefire in Ukraine drains even with new negotiations set to start later Friday.
Fears of an energy crisis in Europe are mounting after Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a Friday deadline for European buyers of Russian gas to pay in rubles, something they are not prepared to do. Moscow supplies around a third of all of Europe’s gas.
GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3115, also suffering from worries about Russian gas supplies, but supported by the Bank of England repeatedly hiking interest rates to take on soaring consumer inflation.
AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7475, while USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 6.3553 after the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 48.1 in March, the steepest rate of contraction since February 2020, from 50.4 in the previous month.
Morgan Stanley cut China’s 2022 economic growth forecast sharply earlier Friday, downgrading its full-year forecast to 4.6% from 5.1%, citing the country’s strict approach to combat COVID infections."

LONDON (Reuters) - Plague, war and inflation define the year so far - but faith in the U.S. dollar seems to have made it through the first three months.
Thanks largely to a newly hawkish Federal Reserve and some yawning yield gaps in ferociously volatile bond markets, speculators have remained net long of dollars through the turbulent first quarter. It underscores an overwhelmingly bullish consensus for a stronger dollar among asset managers coming into 2022.
And yet positioning is as long on dollars at the end of the March as it was short on it exactly one year ago. And that bet went sour over the remainder of 2021 as the buck flew higher.
Is there a repeat performance in store? Will the dollar back off now that a Fed tightening cycle has begun and been priced? Have U.S. yields peaked already? Will peace break out in Ukraine and COVID-19 get consigned to the past?
There are more questions than answers as always - but a counterview to the consensus always catches the eye.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' research team took a pace back from the frenetic news flow this month and sketched out a longer-term view of cross-border flows could spell trouble for the dollar ahead.
Examining investor, corporate and reserve manager behaviour, they showed that since 2014 a key funding source for the yawning U.S. current account deficit - which has almost doubled to 3.6% gross domestic product since 2020 - has been foreign buying of U.S. bonds by euro zone investors. 
Japanese funds remain the largest single national holder of U.S. Treasuries, but inflows over the past eight years originated mostly from euro zone - 61% of the $1.69 trillion rise in foreign exposure to U.S. fixed income over that time. 
The BNPP team argue that euro zone investors facing negative nominal yields at home over that period were drawn to unhedged dollar bond exposure. And those dynamics are now shifting. 
The dollar's history of peaking when the Fed starts raising rates and the prospect of European Central Bank ""normalising"" policy later this year change the picture.
And winding down the ECB's bond buying, as much as any rate rises themselves, play a key part.
Their analysis outlined how negative supply of euro zone bonds net of redemptions and ECB bond buying leads to mechanical transfer of bonds to the central bank from private investors - who have then used the proceeds to invest in overseas assets.
But as the ECB pulls back from the market, they estimate there a net 174 billion of new euro zone bonds this year that will not hoovered up by the central bank - a positive net supply that brings us back to 2014 levels. 
""But the FX market does not appear to price in this shift, which we think will support the euro,"" BNP Paribas told clients.
The return of positive yields on bonds that hold no currency risk for the euro zone's more conservative investors just underlines this. And euro bonds with positive yields now account for about 70% of all outstanding compared to less than 30% a year ago.

Graphic: US current account and the dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgqjkxvb/Two.PNG 
PLAGUE, WAR AND INFLATION
There are other reasons to be more negative on the dollar of course - such as a preference for currencies in commodity exporting economies that will ride the surge in energy, raw materials and food prices.
Many investors are also now wary of some currency reserve managers diversifying away from dollars after G7 powers froze the overseas reserves of Russia's central bank in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. 
Others think the Bank of Japan will eventually relent in its policy of capping long-term bond yields there - which pummelled the yen last month as the Fed tightened.
But long-term dollar bulls still seem confident.
Stephen Jen of hedge fund Eurizon SLJ thinks the three gloomy horsemen of 2022 - COVID, war and inflation - will still play out well for the dollar over the rest of the year.
""What is interesting to me is that China's number one challenge is Covid; the U.S. number one challenge is inflation; and Europe's number one challenge is Ukraine-Russia,"" he wrote.
Jen reckons the aggravated inflation picture will keep the Fed tightening through the year but also keep U.S. equities high as companies are able to pass on input prices in such a buoyant economy.
By contrast China's COVID-19 hit will drag harder on its economy and require more policy easing there, he thinks. And the euro area and ECB will be held back by the demand effects of a Ukraine-related energy shock that it will feel the hardest.
If that's all to plays out on the exchanges, the consensus will need to prove more durable than it did last year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, extending a rally against the yen. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report that could indicate the probability of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike in May 2022.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 98.510 by 11:41 PM ET (3:41 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair rose 0.84% to 122.69.
TheAUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7484 while the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.6925.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.18% to 6.3517. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index for March was 48.1.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3134.
The greenback’s safe-haven status also gave it a boost, as peace talks between Ukraine and Russia to end the war that was triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 faded. The talks will resume later in the day.
Meanwhile, the Fed will next meet to discuss its monetary policy on May 5, with CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool predicting a 71% chance of a half-point hike in interest rates.
The dollar index built on Thursday's 0.50% climb after falling to a four-week low of 97.681 mid-week. It ""has underwhelmed lately but showed some backbone overnight and upside potential remains in scope amid ongoing waves of fiercely hawkish Fedspeak and an aggressive frontloaded profile that includes almost 100 bps in hikes over the Fed's next two meetings,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
The index could top the 100 mark ""in coming weeks"", the note predicted. The second Fed meetings will take place from June 14 to 15.
Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day.
The dollar gained against the yen, its first in four days as the USD/JPY tracked moves in long-term U.S. Treasury yields. It is little changed for the week after a three-week 6.5% surge.
""The case for USD/JPY going much higher is still compelling as the Fed's rate hikes will revolutionize the hedging arithmetic for JPY-based investors and sensitivity to hedging costs is rising,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note.
""Little of this flow is likely to have happened yet and the rally in March has been driven largely by investors outside Japan anticipating domestic JPY selling. If positioning cleans up, we will revert to buying dips in USD/JPY,” the note added.
Meanwhile, the euro trod water at $1.10690, after its sharp drop from a one-month high of $1.11850 during the previous session as hopes for a de-escalation in the Ukraine war fade. However, it is still on course for a 0.82% weekly gain. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 0.93% to $45,093.74, sliding 3.78% in the week to date. It hit the $48,234 mark on Monday for the first time since the start of 2022."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senior U.S. officials fanned out this week to press world leaders to keep piling pressure on Moscow or join the campaign of sanctions and other measures, as the war in Ukraine enters its fifth week and the initial economic shock to Russia seems to be ebbing.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo met with senior officials in London, Brussels and Paris, and will finish the week in Berlin; the deputy national security adviser for international economics, Daleep Singh, pressed Indian officials in New Delhi, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the Ukraine war with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan in Morocco. 
The effort comes as the initial impact of unexpectedly tough sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs and companies begins to wear off somewhat, and the United States considers its next economic steps to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Within days of cutting off key Russian banks from the international SWIFT financial transactions network and immobilizing the bulk of the Russian central bank's $630 billion foreign exchange war chest, the rouble lost half its value, prompting U.S. officials to declare that Moscow was battling a financial crisis.
But a month later, the rouble has largely recovered to its level just before the invasion, propped up partly by Russian capital controls, government orders for export firms to sell foreign currency and companies gathering funds to make quarter-end tax payments. Shares on Russia's stock market are trading again, although they have dropped in value. 
Russian bank VTB, a principal sanctions target, remains open for business in Europe, where it has gathered billions of euros in deposits, mainly from German savers. Other Russian banks are considering China's UnionPay credit card system after Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) suspended Russian operations.
And the sanctions thus far have left Russia's biggest economic lifeline untouched - energy sales to Europe, which could be up to 500 million euros ($555 million) a day at current prices. Russia is demanding payments in roubles for gas starting on Friday, which could boost the currency further. 
The Biden administration is making sure European allies are firmly aligned on punishing Putin, while working to sway leaders who have sat on the sidelines as the war stretches on, officials say. 
""We've got to continue to raise pressure on Russia and increase our support for Ukraine,"" one senior U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""This is a challenge that is facing the free world and all democratic nations. And we need to be prepared for it to last a long time.""
COUNTERING CHINA, WARNING INDIA 
The visits follow closely on the heels of Biden's visit to Europe last week and come as Russia and China - the world's second largest economy - draw ever closer together. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday, reaffirming Beijing's plans to continue bilateral ties and boost cooperation.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Adeyemo's discussions with his European counterparts centered on sanctions, the impact of India and China on Russia's potential sanctions evasion efforts, and how to help countries like Germany cover their energy needs in the event of a Russian embargo, said one European official.
In Brussels, officials discussed steps to ""align sanctions implementation and enforcement, expand joint cooperation on sanctions, and further deepen the transatlantic sanctions alliance,"" Treasury said. 
One key issue was Russia's demand that foreign buyers pay for their Russian gas imports in roubles starting Friday or face supply cutoffs, the European official said. European capitals have rejected the demand, and the German government said it amounted to ""blackmail.""
It is imperative the United States keep tending its relationships with allies, said Catherine Novelli, a former senior U.S. trade official and diplomat, underscoring the difficulty to maintaining the momentum of sanctions and other punitive measures after the initial outrage wanes.
In India, White House economic adviser Singh, who led efforts to coordinate the Western response to the war, told officials Washington would not set any red lines about purchasing oil, but warned against rapid acceleration of purchases.
India has a military dependence on Russian technology and hardware and has tried to balance its long-standing ties with Russia and the West. Unlike other members of the Quad group of countries - the United States, Japan, Australia - it has not imposed sanctions on Russia. 

Singh spoke ahead of Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov's arrival in the Indian capital for a two-day trip.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Thursday as a lack of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine boosted demand for the safe-haven currency and as the United States announced the largest release ever from its emergency oil reserve to try to blunt the energy shock from the war. 
The dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of six global peers, was up 0.492% at 98.31 at 2:30 p.m. EDT. 
The dollar has attracted safe-haven flows since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and is on track for a rise of around 1.6% for the month of March, and around 2.8% for the first quarter. 
Month- and quarter-end flows have caused some additional volatility for markets, but trade is likely to muted ahead of Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls figures, said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank. 
U.S. President Joe Biden said that starting in May, the United States will release 1 million barrels per day of crude oil for six months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Biden said his administration has worked with allies in the IEA to coordinate releases which will bring the total volume to global markets to well over 1 million barrels per day.
Crude prices, which have been elevated due to the war, plunged on the news.
Commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, declined, with the Aussie down 0.34% at $0.74845 and the kiwi down 0.57% at $0.6931.
Hopes from earlier this week that peace talks would lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine five weeks after Russia's invasion have dwindled, with Ukrainian forces preparing for new Russian attacks in the southeast of the country. Peace talks were set to resume on Friday.
""This has caused a risk-off reaction that has dragged down stock markets and hit the risk-sensitive commodity currencies,"" said Marshall Gittler, Head of Investment Research at BDSwiss Holding Ltd. 
Separately, Russian President Vladimir Putin said foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas beginning on Friday as he tries to hit back against sweeping Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.
Western companies and governments have rejected any move to change their gas supply contracts to another payment currency. Most European buyers use euros.
The euro was down 0.8% at $1.1068, after hitting its highest since March 1 at $1.1184 earlier in the session as rising inflation in Europe stoked expectations of rate hikes.
European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane said on Thursday euro zone inflation was increasingly likely to stabilise around 2% but the ECB should be ready to change course if the outlook deteriorates due to the war in Ukraine.
""Until the risk of an energy crisis and considerable economic effects resulting from the Ukraine war have been banished, the ECB is likely to hesitate to make a clear commitment"" on how to take action against inflation, said Antje Praefcke, forex analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 

""And as a result, it will also be a while before the euro can appreciate on a sustainable basis,"" she added.
Elsewhere, the Norwegian crown slid after oil prices dived and the central bank said it would buy foreign currency for its sovereign wealth fund in April.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank more than quadrupled its foreign reserves in Chinese yuan last year, policymakers reported on Thursday, as it trimmed holdings of U.S. dollars and euros and built Brazilian reserves of currency from its biggest trade partner.
The Chinese currency, which until 2018 was absent from the forex reserves of Latin America's largest economy, rose to 4.99% of Brazilian central bank holdings at the end of last year, from 1.21% at the end of 2020.
That gave it the third largest share of the central bank's reserves, slightly behind the euro, which fell to 5.04% last year from 7.85% in 2020. Dollar reserves fell to 80.34% of the total from 86.03% a year earlier.
The shift underscores China's growing economic importance to Brazil, where it represents 28% of international trade, more than twice the United States, its next largest trade partner, World Bank data shows. 
Brazil also increased the exposure of its reserves to other currencies - including the Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar - and gold, often used as a hedge against other financial assets.

""In 2021, we sought greater diversification in the allocation of currencies, without prejudice to the countercyclical profile of the portfolio as a whole,"" said the central bank in the annual report on its foreign reserves.
Total reserves rose by $6.58 billion last year to $362.2 billion. Portfolio returns were down 0.62%, the worst performance since 2015, mainly due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in the portfolio.

""Potentially, the Kremlin is acting from a fear that Gazprombank will soon be sanctioned too, amid a wider bid by the European Union to cut energy ties with Russia completely.""

""The long-term contracts for natural gas purchases from Russia are denominated in EUR (euros) and therefore, without contract renegotiation, there is no legal basis for Russia to enforce this demand.""
""Russia would have to physically halt gas flows to EU 27 (European Union member states) to force the issue, marking a major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War. It would mark another major financial blow to Russia's coffers.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Thursday ahead of key employment data, while the euro held at a one-month high against the greenback on hopes the Ukraine/Russia conflict is heading towards a de-escalation phase.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 97.810.
The U.S. dollar received a boost Wednesday after data from the ADP Research Institute showed that U.S. companies employed an additional 455,000 people in March, growth which is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s view that the labor market is robust.
This comes ahead of Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims data and, more importantly, Friday’s monthly official jobs report.
The U.S. Federal Reserve lifted interest rates earlier this month and signaled a series of increases ahead to combat soaring inflation, so long as the economy didn’t retreat into recession, as an inverted yield curve has warned about.
The strength of the labor market suggests the Fed will feel confident about going ahead with more interest rate hikes in the months ahead, to the benefit of the dollar.
USD/JPY traded 0.2% lower at 121.58, stabilizing after climbing to its lowest since November 2015 on Monday, with the Bank of Japan’s intervention to prevent government bond yields from rising too high in stark contrast to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s approach.
“The dollar remains cheap against most G10 currencies in the short-term when short-term rate differentials – normally a key driver of FX moves – are considered,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1172, with the single currency gaining around 1.6% this week, climbing to its highest level in a month, on increasing hopes that the conflict in Ukraine could be approaching a conclusion.
The peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul earlier in the week raised hopes of a breakthrough. And although Russia has continued attacks in the east of the country, its promise to scale down military operations around Kyiv has raised hopes that the conflict could be entering a new phase involving the de-escalation of the violence. New peace talks are also scheduled for Friday.
“At this stage, we doubt there is much geopolitical risk premium left in most assets, as markets appear to have taken an optimistic stance well before peace talks have yielded any result,” ING added.
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3140, helped by data showing Britain's economy grew more quickly than previously thought in the last three months of 2021, with GDP increasing by 1.3% in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month period, stronger than a preliminary estimate of growth of 1.0%.
AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7479, handing back some of the pair’s earlier string gains, while USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3425 after China’s manufacturing and services sectors simultaneously contracted in March 2022 for the first time in two years."

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.12% to 97.990 by 12:08 PM ET (4:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.39% to 122.28.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.29% to 0.7488 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.6958.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3493. Data released earlier in the day showed that China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 49.5, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4, in March 2022. The Caixin manufacturing PMI is due on Friday.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.10% to 1.3117.
The European single currency was at $1.1175, holding its highest in a month, and has gained 1.7%in the week to date.
""The euro has been one of the biggest winners over the past sessions, part of that reflects the positive news about the Russia Ukraine tensions,""  Commonwealth Bank of Australia) (CBA) FX strategist Carol Kong told Reuters.
Sustained euro gains would be dependent on further developments in Ukraine, she added.
There was little breakthrough at peace talks between Ukraine and Russia that began earlier in the week. Russia said it would curtail operations near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, a little over a month since it invaded Ukraine on Feb 24. However, the pledge was met with skepticism from Ukraine and Western allies, who view it as a ploy to cut losses and prepare for other attacks.
Ukrainian forces are preparing for new Russian attacks in the east of the country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday.
The euro’s gains, as well as a brief recovery for the yen and strengthening commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar, meant the dollar index dropped to its lowest level in three weeks overnight. However, the yen resumed its decline on Thursday with the dollar gaining 0.5% to as high as 122.45 yen.
The Japanese currency fell sharply in March, dropping to its lowest since November 2015 on Monday, before recovering slightly over the following days.
The Bank of Japan’s intervention to prevent government bond yields from rising too high is in stark contrast to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s approach. Japan’s dovish approach set the yen on a downward trend, and it is set for its worst month since November 2016. Thursday's moves in Japanese assets are likely to be volatile as it is the end of the country’s fiscal year, CBA's Kong noted.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dropped to a nearly two-week low on Wednesday as optimism over peace talks between Russia and Ukraine faded and investors' attention shifted to economic data and interest rate expectations.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six peer currencies, was down 0.57% at 97.861 at 2:20 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, having earlier touched its lowest level since March 17.
Much of that weakness was due to strength in the euro, which had rallied on Tuesday following Russia's promise during peace talks to reduce its attacks on Kyiv. 
The shift in tone in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks suggested ""the conflict may be moving to a more localized phase with some of the more extreme tail risk scenarios reducing in probability,"" analysts from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note to clients on Wednesday that recommended buying EUR/USD.
The United States, however, warned it had not seen ""signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, whose forces continued to bombard the outskirts of Kyiv and a besieged city in northern Ukraine on Wednesday.
While optimism over the Moscow-Kyiv talks waned, inflation reports fanned expectations that rising costs, which were accelerated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, would force Europe to rate hikes sooner rather than later, supporting the euro.
""The euro was slightly appreciating before inflation readings for March but got an additional boost upon their arrival,"" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics Scotiabank Economics.
Preliminary data showed that German annual inflation rose to its highest level in more than 40 years in March as prices of natural gas and oil products soared. Spain's flash CPI data for March showed prices rising at their fastest since May 1985.
However, ECB President Christine Lagarde said food and energy prices should stop increasing, helping the euro zone avoid the combination of stagnant growth and high inflation feared by economists.
The euro was at its highest level versus the greenback since March 1, and was last up 0.6% at 1.1152..
Aside from its safe-haven status, the dollar has drawn strength this year from investor expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve, which raised rates by 25 basis points at its March 16 meeting, will be more hawkish than the European Central Bank.
In Europe, data and policymakers' warnings highlighted stalling growth, plummeting confidence and soaring inflation as the European economy feels the impact of the war in Ukraine.
""Investors in thinking about how far to go the ECB has and even a shift in sentiment and shift in policy will certainly send the euro higher, just from expectations and speculative demand on the currency,"" said Ivan Asensio, head of FX risk advisory at Silicon Bank.

Elsewhere, the yen recovered further from its seven-year low hit on Monday, after a meeting between Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida added to speculation about the level of official discomfort with a falling yen.
The yen was up 0.83% against the dollar at 121.85.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar weakened Wednesday as signs of progress in the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia boosted risk sentiment to the detriment of this safe haven and the benefit of the euro, while the Japanese yen recovered on fears of official intervention.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% lower at 98.170.
Additionally, EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.1116 following Russia promising on Tuesday to scale down military operations around Kyiv and Ukraine proposing adopting a neutral status, moves that offer hope of progress in ending the conflict between the two countries after face-to-face negotiations in Istanbul.
The euro has been battered in recent weeks over fears about the economic fallout from the war in Ukraine.
That said, these gains for the single currency could be short-lived amid skepticism over Russia’s intentions as well as the sharp gains in U.S. Treasury yields as traders position for aggressive tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
“EUR/USD is now looking overvalued in the short-term after the pair failed to correct sharply on the back of the significant widening in USD-EUR short-term swap rate differential,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “We estimate the current short-term fair value in the 1.07/1.08 area at the moment.”
Elsewhere, USD/JPY dropped 0.9% to 121.72, retreating after recent sharp gains on the back of the Bank of Japan buying bonds this week to defend its 0.25% 10-year yield target, maintaining its very accommodative stance in the face of monetary policy tightening by a number of the world’s central banks, and the Fed in particular.
A meeting between Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida raised speculation that the country’s senior officials are concerned with the extent of the drop in the yen. 
“We think the yen remains highly vulnerable as long as bond yields continue to press higher,” added ING. ""More indications that Japan is taking action to curb JPY volatility could offer some support, but that appears to be a secondary factor.” 
Expectations are growing that the Fed will raise rates by a half-point rather than the customary quarter-point increase when it next meets, and traders will look at today’s data dump for confirmation.
March's ADP nonfarm employment change data is set to be released Wednesday at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), with consensus forecasts looking for companies to have added 450,000 jobs, while GDP for the fourth quarter, at 8:30 AM ET, is set to show a 7.1% reading from the month before, well above the previous 2.3% release. 
GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3121, benefiting from perceived progress in the Ukraine peace talks. Also, U.K. shop prices rose in March at the fastest annual pace in more than a decade, suggesting that the Bank of England will continue hiking interest rates to combat inflation.
AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7527, holding just below recent peaks, while USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3564."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia as hopes for a breakthrough in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine gave the euro a boost. The Japanese yen, which is already under pressure, steadied even as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continues its efforts to pin down bond yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies is down 0.32% to 98.125 by 11:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair slid 1.09% to 121.50. Japanese data released earlier in the day showed that retail sales contracted 0.8% year on year in February 2022.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 0.7516 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.45% to 0.6964.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to 6.3604 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3106.
The euro has been battered in recent weeks over fears about the economic fallout from the war in Ukraine. Concerns about the war spreading west saw the single currency hit a two-week high of $1.1137 overnight before settling back to $1.1091 in Asian trading. It also hit a three-month high of 84.81 pence against the pound, while the Russian ruble climbed to a one-month high of 83.50 to the dollar.
In Tuesday’s face-to-face talks in Istanbul, Russia pledged to scale down military operations around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, while Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status. However, the U.S. warned that the threat to Kyiv remains, pouring cold water on the optimism for an end to the war that began with the Russian invasion on Feb. 24.
""At least the two sides are talking,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joe Capurso told Reuters.
""The tentative good news about the war will benefit the euro more than any other currency given Europe's proximity to the conflict and reliance on Russian energy,"" he said.
The increased risk appetite boosted risk-sensitive currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The Antipodean currencies held firm just below recent peaks in Asian trading and the South Korean won, battered by the recent surge in oil prices, recorded its best session in two years overnight.
Meanwhile, the yen is fighting to find a floor of around 123 to the dollar and is set for its worst month since November 2016. The yen has lost roughly 7% loss on the dollar as the Japanese central bank maintains its dovish stance while other central banks turn hawkish.
The BOJ is fulfilling its four-day pledge of unlimited bond-buying to hold 10-year yields beneath its 0.25% ceiling, and extended purchases along the curve in both directions. The efforts saw the 10-year Japanese government bond yield drop slightly to 0.225%.
""Risks remain tilted towards the upside for USD/JPY today. The 125 mark will continue to be a good level of topside resistance,"" MUFG Bank analyst Sophia Ng told Reuters."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of peer currencies on Tuesday as reports of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine lifted the euro and reduced the safe-haven appeal of the greenback.
Russia said in talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that it would scale down military operations around Ukraine's capital and north, while Kyiv proposed adopting neutral status, in confidence-building steps that were the first signs of progress towards negotiating peace.
The dollar, which had risen as much as 3.4% since Russia invaded Ukraine, declined 0.596% to 98.496, as traders looked to currencies deemed riskier.
""Risk appetite is back and I think you're seeing potentially a major turning point in the war in Ukraine as Russia signals talks have been constructive and there's hope that there could be a ceasefire,"" said Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. 
The euro was up 0.81% at $1.1076, having earlier hit its highest level since March 17.
""The euro today is enjoying a relief rally built on constructive peace talks, lower oil, and expectations that euro zone data this week could strengthen the case for the ECB (European Central Bank) to raise interest rates,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
Any step toward a ceasefire or potential peace deal in Ukraine would support the euro, as Europe is seen suffering a significant economic blow from the conflict, which began with Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 and sent energy prices soaring.
Inflation figures of euro zone members for March will begin to roll in on Wednesday, with the composite release on Friday. 
The greenback slid 0.89% against the yen to 122.83 yen. The Japanese currency had fallen to its lowest level since 2015 on Monday.

Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government would closely watch currency moves to prevent a ""bad"" weak yen that hurts the economy.
""While the comments from Japanese officials overnight are unlikely to reverse the yen weakening trend on their own, they should at least help to slow the recent fast pace of yen selling,"" Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said in a note to clients.
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday continued to defend a key yield cap by offering to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year government bonds, which will likely keep the yen on its back foot.
China's offshore yuan dipped 0.14% to 6.3763 against the greenback after new pandemic restrictions in Shanghai. It hit its lowest level since October 2021 at 6.4106 in mid-March.
Shanghai, China's most populous city, tightened the first phase of a two-stage COVID-19 lockdown, asking residents to stay indoors.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 0.92% at $47,585 after hitting its highest level since late December on Monday. 
Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.67% at $3,423.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan and the United States agreed to communicate closely on currency issues, Japan's top currency diplomat said on Tuesday in his strongest statement yet since the yen's decline to six-year lows against the dollar.
Masato Kanda, vice finance minister for international affairs, also said that ""excess volatility and disorderly currency moves"" would hurt the economy.
""We discussed financial market developments including dollar-yen moves,"" Kanda told reporters after meeting his counterpart Andy Baukol, acting Under Secretary of International Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
""We underscored the importance of maintaining previous G7 and G20 commitments on exchange rates,"" Kanda, who oversees G7/G20 meetings and currencies, said after the meeting at Tokyo's Ministry of Finance (MOF).
Kanda's remarks underscore Japan's growing concern over yen declines that some lawmakers say have inflated already rising import costs for energy and food.
The visit to Tokyo by a senior U.S. official, and the two sides' rare discussion of currency issues, indicated Japan's and the United States' shared concern over the yen's weakening, a Japanese MOF official told Reuters.
Although the Japan-U.S. meeting may edge Tokyo closer to direct intervention, some market players saw the yen's current levels as not weak enough to justify that.
""It's true the yen's fall has picked up pace of declines, making some people worried about excessive falls,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""The tone of warning from Japanese policymakers has not much changed. MOF bureaucrats must be aware that verbal intervention won't be effective in reversing the (weak-yen) trend.""
The prospect of aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes and the BOJ's decisive moves to defend its 0.25% yield cap have pushed the yen to six-year lows against the dollar.
The yen has lost almost 7% against the greenback so far this year. It last traded at 123.63 per dollar after falling as low as 125.10 on Monday, its lowest since August 2015.
Japanese policymakers have escalated their warnings over the impact of sharp yen falls on the world's third-biggest economy as it struggles to recover from the impact of the pandemic and as the war in Ukraine further increased the cost of oil.
Earlier on Tuesday, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will closely watch currency moves to prevent a ""bad"" weak yen that hurts the economy.
""Based on the G7 and G20 agreements, we will closely communicate with currency authorities from the United States and other countries to respond appropriately,"" Kanda said.
Kanda declined to comment when asked whether the ""close communication"" between Japan and the United States was meant to include currency intervention.

Given the economy's heavy reliance on exports, Japan has historically focused on arresting sharp yen rises and taken a hands-off approach on yen falls.
Yen-buying intervention to arrest steep yen falls has been very rare, with the latest action taken during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers escalated their warning against sharp yen falls, with the country's top currency diplomat saying Tokyo and Washington agreed to ""communicate closely"" on currencies as the world's third-biggest economy struggled to regain its footing.
Vice finance minister for international affairs Masato Kanda said ""excess volatility and disorderly"" currency moves were undesirable, signalling Tokyo's displeasure over the yen's steep slide to six-year lows versus the dollar.
Aside from such verbal intervention, Japan has several options to stem excessive yen falls. Among them is to directly intervene in the currency market and buy up large amounts of yen.
Below are details on how yen-buying intervention could work, the likelihood of this happening as well as challenges:
WHEN DID JAPAN LAST CONDUCT YEN-BUYING INTERVENTION?
Given the economy's heavy reliance on exports, Japan has historically focused on arresting sharp yen rises and taken a hands-off approach on yen falls.
Yen-buying intervention has been very rare. The last time Japan intervened to support its currency was in 1998, when the Asian financial crisis triggered a yen sell-off and a rapid capital outflow from the region. Before that, Tokyo intervened to counter yen falls in 1991-1992.
WHAT WOULD PROMPT TOKYO TO BUY YEN AGAIN?
Currency intervention is costly and could easily fail given the difficulty of influencing its value in the huge global foreign exchange market.
That is one key reason it is considered a last-resort move, which Tokyo would greenlight only when verbal intervention fails to prevent a free fall in the yen. The speed of yen declines, not just levels, would be crucial in authorities' decision on whether and when to step in.
Former top currency diplomat Eisuke Sakakibara told Reuters a yen fall below 130 to the dollar could be the trigger for intervention.
Some policymakers say intervention would only become an option if Japan faces a ""triple"" selling of yen, domestic stocks and bonds, in what would be similar to sharp capital outflows experienced in some emerging economies.
HOW WOULD IT WORK?
When Japan intervenes to stem yen rises, the Ministry of Finance issues short-term bills to raise yen which it can then sell in the market to weaken the Japanese currency's value.
If it were to conduct intervention to stop yen falls, authorities must tap Japan's foreign reserves for dollars to sell in the market in exchange for yen.
In both cases, the finance minister will issue the final order to intervene. The Bank of Japan will act as an agent and execute the order in the market.
WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?
Yen-buying intervention is more difficult than yen-selling.
To conduct dollar-selling, yen-buying intervention, Japan must tap its foreign reserves for dollars it can sell to markets in exchange for yen.
That means there are limits to how long it can keep intervening, unlike for yen-selling intervention - where Tokyo can continue issuing bills to raise yen.

Japan's foreign reserves stood at $1.38 trillion, which is the second largest after China's and likely consisted mostly of dollars. While abundant, the size could quickly dwindle if huge sums are required to influence rates each time Tokyo steps in.
Currency intervention would also require informal consent by Japan's G7 counterparts, notably the United States if it were to be conducted against the dollar/yen. That is not easy with Washington traditionally opposed to the idea of currency intervention, except in cases of extreme market volatility.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday while the Japanese yen recovered a little from heavy selling as the Bank of Japan continued its dovish monetary policy stance.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 98.933.
USD/JPY dropped 0.3% to 123.50, retreating slightly after rising to its strongest level since December 2015 on Monday, climbing over 7% in the last month with the Bank of Japan buying bonds this week to defend its yield target.
Japan's central bank bought a little more than $500 million in bonds on Monday and another $2 billion earlier Tuesday, having vowed to make unlimited purchases in the market until Thursday to defend its 10-year yield target of 0.25%.
This contrasts sharply with most central banks across the rest of the world, including importantly the U.S. Federal Reserve, which are hiking rates, pushing their respective yields higher.
“We think a move by 125 in USD/JPY is a matter of 'when' rather than 'if' given the bond market weakness on the back of rising Fed tightening expectations and rising energy prices, which are a negative for the export-dependent Japanese economy,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Upside risks should continue to prevail even beyond 125 and 130 is well within reach in the near term unless the bond environment improves.”
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1000, benefiting slightly from the hope that peace talks due to start later Tuesday in Turkey could bring an end to the Ukraine/Russia war, which is now in its second month.
That said, the single currency remains weak with the latest data from the GfK institute showing German consumer morale looks set to slump heading into April as the war in Ukraine weighs on households' income expectations.
The institute said its consumer sentiment index fell to -15.5 points heading into April from a revised -8.5 points a month earlier, the lowest since February 2021.
“We still see mostly downside risks for EUR/USD in the short-term, with a move to 1.0800 looking likely by the end of the year,” added ING.
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3102, ahead of the release of the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, and AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7509 after Australian retail sales beat forecasts again in February, climbing 1.8% from the previous month, beating forecasts of a 1.0% rise."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia. The yen fought for a footing after its worst session in 16 months, as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) keeps bond yields down while they are rising sharply elsewhere.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 99.045 by 11:49 PM ET (3:49 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.46% to 123.33.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7480, with Australian retail sales rising 1.8% month-on-month in February. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.6899.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.3700 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3094.
The Japanese currency fell as much as 2.4% against the dollar overnight and was at its lowest point since August 2015 before recovering to 124.24 in volatile Asian trading. The U.S. dollar remained broadly steady against other currencies, keeping the euro at $1.0988 and capping a recent rally in the Australian dollar.
BOJ bought a little more than $500 million in bonds on Monday and has pledged three more days of unlimited purchases to defend its 10-year yield target of 0.25%. This demonstrates the central bank’s resolve to keep its monetary policy ultra-easy and underscores a stark contrast with the hawkish stance adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve which has added to the yen’s losses.
The yen is down nearly 7% in March 2022 to date and almost 10% on the Australian dollar. But the barely visible retreat in Japanese government bond yields (JGBs) is a sign that some investors doubt the longevity of Japan's dovish policy.
""Anyone who watched the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) 'cap' blow is probably excitedly and logically short JGBs right now hoping for a similar move in Japan rates,"" Spectra Markets president Brent Donnelly told Reuters, referring to RBA’s abandonment of its yield target in November.
The minutes from the BOJ’s latest meeting stressed the need to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, even as some signs of growing inflationary pressure emerge. However, some economists see building pressure for a shift if persistent yen weakness exacerbates inflation by raising import costs, particularly for energy, and predict that 125, roughly where dollar/yen peaked in 2015, is a key level.
""Japanese yen depreciation is a big problem for the Japanese economy because the economy, especially households, is facing rising inflation and yen depreciation could accelerate that,"" Deutsche Bank AG chief economist Kentaro Koyama told Reuters.
""If the dollar/yen rate exceeded 125 I'd expect some more severe verbal intervention.""
Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki also said earlier in the day that Japan will carefully watch foreign exchange market movement to avoid ""bad yen weakening""."
77,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 07:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A monthslong slide in the yen that’s only accelerated in March is stirring chatter that the government might act or make noises to support it, although some in Japan might actually welcome a weaker currency.
Even if Japan stops short of directly selling dollars to buy yen, there are options available to help buoy the floundering currency. A further slide could prompt verbal jawboning from the Bank of Japan, according to Brad Bechtel, a strategist at Jefferies LLC, although a lack of inflation means the drop is less problematic and could support the country’s exporters. Thierry Wizman of Macquarie Futures instead sees the central bank raising the cap it has on benchmark yields to defend the yen. 
“It’s true they need more inflation, but they also don’t need the kind of uncertainty that’s brought to the market by a lot of dollar-yen volatility,” Wizman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. 
Japanese authorities are known for their readiness to intervene on behalf of the yen when under pressure in either direction. They last stepped into the market in 2011 after a devastating earthquake and tsunami. On Monday, Eisuke Sakakibara, the nation’s former top currency official, told Reuters he reckons they should opt for another intervention if the yen breaks through 130 per dollar. 
The yen’s plummet has brought its monthly losses to 7% against the greenback, and it took another leg lower Monday, falling as much as 2.3% to an almost seven-year low of 125.09. With the war in Ukraine helping push crude prices to their highest levels in more than a decade, the yen hasn’t found support from its usual crisis-induced haven demand because the Japanese economy is heavily dependent on energy imports. 
With U.S. Treasury yields surging back to pre-pandemic levels, another traditional headwind, there seems to be few signs of a potential reprieve for the yen. With so many key levels broken through so quickly, traders will be keeping an eye on which one might be the trigger for policy makers to step in.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar hit a six-year high versus the yen after the Bank of Japan moved to contain rising bond yields, while U.S. Treasury yields soared to new multi-year highs, highlighting a divergence between the BOJ and other major central banks. 
Treasury 10-year yields vaulted above 2.5% to three-year highs, with the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to deliver a half-point interest rate rise in May as it tackles rising inflation, having kicked off its tightening cycle this month.
""We now expect the FOMC to hike by 50 bps at the next two meetings before shifting back to a 25-bps-per meeting cadence for the reminder of the year,"" said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets Economics. 
Interest rate hike expectations helped lift the dollar to its highest in two weeks against a basket of six major peer currencies, last up 0.313% at 99.158, at 3:20 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (1920 GMT).
Against the yen, the dollar surged as much as 2.5% to its highest level since August 2015 and the biggest one-day rise since March 2020. Yen losses in March surpass 7% and the currency is set for its biggest monthly and quarterly falls since 2016. The dollar was last up 1.34% against the Japanese currency at 123.715 yen.
Struggling to swim against the tide lifting interest rates higher globally, the BOJ staunchly defended its 0.25% yield cap on Monday by offering to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds (JGBs) for the first four days of this week.
While that did not stop 10-year yields hitting the upper limit of the BOJ's policy band, it sent the yen spiralling.
""On net, JGBs mostly shook off what was just a repeated gesture to defend the 10-year yield ceiling but the signal toward expanding money supply contributed to yen softness alongside the more dominant Federal Reserve effects on the dollar,"" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank Economics.
Big energy import bills and the loss of tourism revenues mean ""the weight on the yen is likely to remain for the next year,"" said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho.
The Japanese currency also lost ground against the euro, which is increasingly underpinned by expectations the European Central Bank will join the rate hike club this year. 
The euro gained 1.27% to 135.895 yen, a four-year high.
The euro edged up 0.03% against the greenback to 1.0984. The single currency's fortunes this week could be determined by inflation figures from major European economies, with the bloc's harmonised HICP inflation seen edging up to 6.5% in March. 
Analysts at Monex said given the yen's weakness and risks to the euro from the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the dollar would likely stay buoyant, especially if Friday's jobs data proved strong.
""Should wage growth continue to tick up despite the recent increase in labour supply, money markets are likely to fully price two 50 bp hikes from the Fed in May and June,"" they added.
In commodity currencies, the Australian dollar dipped 0.33% to $0.74895, but was not far off its recent four-month high.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose 2.53% to a year-to-date high of $48,050.90.

It bitcoin holds above $47,000, it could be in for a major breakout, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher Monday, making gains against the Japanese yen in particular, benefiting from the monetary policy divergence between the two countries.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% higher at 99.218.
The Bank of Japan moved into the market earlier Monday, offering to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year Japanese government bonds at 0.25% in order to prevent these bond yields from rising above its key target after the benchmark 10-year JGB yield crept up to a six-year high of 0.245%.
This dovish stance contrasts vividly with the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking rates by a quarter percentage point a couple of weeks ago and Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicating that the central bank is prepared to raise rates in half-point increments to combat inflation if warranted.
USD/JPY climbed 1.2% to 123.47, rising to its strongest level since December 2015, and up over 7% in the last month.
Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for March could help to cement further tightening by the Fed, with economists expecting the U.S. economy to have added 475,000 jobs, after 678,000 were created in February, while average hourly earnings are forecast to increase 5.5% on a year-over-year basis.
Additionally, Thursday sees the release of personal consumption expenditures data, a gauge of inflation closely watched by the Fed. The core PCE price index is expected to rise 5.5% on an annual basis, staying well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.0952, still under pressure because of the economic impact of the war in Ukraine.
Inflation figures from major European economies and the Eurozone are due from Wednesday, and while the European Central Bank policymakers will be keen to move to address prices at historically high levels they are also very aware of the headwinds to growth in the region caused by the Ukraine war.
“We think that lingering Russia-related downside risk for sentiment and upside risk for commodity prices continue to warrant a stronger dollar and weaker European currencies,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Accordingly, the balance of risks for EUR/USD remains skewed to the downside in our view, and we expect a drop to 1.08-1.09 in the coming weeks.”
GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.3152 and AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7518, holding near last week's four-month high ahead of Australia's budget on Tuesday. 
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3720 after a surge of Covid-19 cases prompted China’s authorities to lock down Shanghai, the country’s financial hub, for eight days."
80,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - The war in Ukraine and Russia's effective exclusion from the global currency system could be an opportunity for China to raise the profile of its currency in a challenge to the U.S. dollar, a senior Taiwanese security official said on Monday.
Russia has said it is counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from Western sanctions, and will use Chinese yuan from its foreign exchange reserves after the sanctions blocked its access to its U.S. dollars and euros reserves.
Taking questions in parliament, National Security Bureau Director-General Chen Ming-tong said China had always wanted a way to throw off the domination of the U.S. dollar, and the war could boost the use of the yuan.
""Whether in renminbi trade or currency issuance system, this is an opportunity that must be taken"" by China, Chen said, using the yuan's formal name.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has raised its security alert level since the war, wary of Beijing making a similar move against it, and Taiwanese officials have been studying the lessons both they and China could learn from the conflict.
Chen said the war could actually improve China-U.S. relations if China chose to stand with the United States in the same way it did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks which earned U.S. goodwill.
""The Ukraine-Russia war is maybe another 911-style opportunity,"" he said.

Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions on russia and has insisted it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges. It has declined to condemn Moscow's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion.
But behind the scenes, China is wary of its companies running afoul of sanctions and is pressing companies to tread carefully with investment in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia. The Japanese yen continued a downward trend after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stepped into the market to defend its implicit yield cap. Bitcoin climbed to nearly its highest level in the year to date.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.35% to 99.170 by 12:11 AM ET (4:11 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair rose 0.83% to 123.07.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.7528, while the NZD/USD pair was down 0.29% to 0.6950.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.13% to 0.6748, while the GBP/USD pair was down 0.26% to 1.3154.
The yen fell to as low as 122.78 per dollar, the weakest since December 2015, giving up Friday's small gains when the BOJ did not step in to defend its target. However, the BOJ offered to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) at 0.25% on Monday morning, after the 10-year JGB yield climbed up to a six-year high of 0.245%.
""While a risk of near-term correction has risen given the rapidity of its ascent, we expect dollar-yen to remain well-supported at high levels,"" Barclays analysts, citing monetary policy divergence and the negative impact from higher commodity prices on Japan's terms-of-trade, told Reuters.
Japan’s monetary policy must remain loose, deputy chief cabinet secretary Seiji Kihara said on Sunday. The BOJ's dovish approach compares with the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance, with more interest rate hikes expected as the year progresses.
Although rising commodity prices have hurt the yen recently, it has given commodities linked currencies a boost. The Australian dollar was near the previous week's four-month high, while its Canadian counterpart was at 1.2496 per dollar, near Friday's two-month peak.
Australia will also hand down its budget on Tuesday, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg saying on Sunday the budget would mark a very significant material improvement to the government’s bottom line.
However, the latest COVID-19 outbreak could be a potential headwind for the Australian currency, with Shanghai entering a lockdown to curb rising numbers of cases in the city. The dollar was up 0.17% on the offshore yuan on Monday morning to 6.394.
Meanwhile, ""stronger-than-expected Eurozone consumer price indexes will add to rates market pricing for European Central Bank tightening, underpinning the euro,"" said the Barclays analysts. The single currency last traded at $1.0973 and was still feeling the economic impact of the war in Ukraine, triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24.
Also on the data front, the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is due on Friday.
However, the data is not expected to have a major effect on U.S. interest rate expectations and the dollar, with the market already bracing for several rate hikes within 2022.

82,"<span>Mar 27, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders primed for more turbulence will potentially look toward the yen when foreign-exchange market action kicks off in the Asia-Pacific on Monday amid ongoing uncertainty around the Russia-Ukraine war and the path of global central bank policies.
The Japanese currency has proved less reliable as a go-to global haven during the recent crisis, becoming instead a barometer of what investors are thinking in terms of interest rates. With the Federal Reserve signaling it will be lifting borrowing costs further and faster, and the Bank of Japan remaining steadfast in keeping its stance quite easy, the yen has collapsed.
Even with the fallout from Russia’s Ukraine invasion blighting global markets and weighing on risk appetite, the yen has fallen close to 6% this year. It’s the worst performer among Group-of-10 peers, and last week hit its weakest level since 2015. And there may be worse to come still, if the bears are right. 
Instead, it’s the greenback that has attracted most haven flows with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index this month climbing to its highest level since mid-2020. The euro could face renewed weakness as Europe seeks to strengthen sanctions against Russia and wean itself off Russian fuel imports, even as it shied away from an import ban. 
Currency traders are among the first to get going for the week, hours before aficionados of Treasury futures and cash bond markets can start making wagers. It might therefore be the dollar-yen pair that gives a first reading on whether last week’s Fed-fueled selloff in U.S. interest-rate markets will continue.
As trading gets underway, volatility across many assets remains elevated. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index -- a gauge of implied volatility in Treasuries -- is down from its early March peak, but notably above where it was for all of 2021. The same goes for a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) index of implied volatility for major developed currencies. 
In contrast, stocks have proven relatively resilient of late. Implied volatility in U.S. equities has actually subsided in the past few weeks, based on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index.
It’s also going to be another key week for watchers of Russian bonds, with the sovereign and various companies scheduled to make payments on foreign-currency debt. The government has so far steered clear of veering into default territory, but with the political and financial situation in flux, investors will be watching keenly to see how the situation plays out.

The Swiss currency has surged as investors have sought safe-haven assets during the Ukraine war. It rose above 1 franc to 1 euro earlier this month before weakening to around 1.02 francs to the euro. A year ago, a euro bought 1.10 francs.
""From an economic perspective, it's not got a big importance,"" Jordan told Swiss radio station SRF when asked if the franc rising above parity was a level the central bank would fight. 
""We don't give any forecasts where the exchange rate will go, but what's important is we don't just look at the euro but all currencies together...and also the inflation differences, that's very important."" 
Higher inflation outside Switzerland had reduced the impact of the stronger franc, he said, with Swiss businesses generally coping well with the currency's higher valuation.
Swiss inflation has picked up to 2.2%, its highest level since 2008, but remains low compared to the United States and Europe, Jordan said.
The SNB stuck to its expansive monetary policy in its latest update on Thursday, keeping interest rates locked at minus 0.75%, but doubled its inflation forecast for this year.

The central bank would continue to watch inflation closely, Jordan said, and also monitor the developments in the exchange rate.
""The franc remains highly valued...and it is the reason why we remain ready, when necessary, to intervene on the currency markets to prevent the franc becoming too strong,"" Jordan said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Friday, putting it on track for a third straight day of gains, as crude prices reversed earlier weakness and added to pressure for the Federal Reserve to be aggressive in combating inflation. 
After initially declining, oil prices rebounded following a missile attack hit Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company Aramco (SE:2222)'s storage facility.
The war in Ukraine and resulting rise in commodity prices has added upward pressure to already high inflation.
The dollar index rose 0.071%, with the euro down 0.11% to $1.0984.
The greenback is poised for a solid gain this week, which would mark its sixth weekly gain in the past seven. The dollar has benefited from its status as a safe haven and the conflict in Ukraine has driven expectations the Fed will hike interest rates.
""The one thing everyone can agree upon is inflation is going to be longer-lasting and a lot of that will be sticky and that will complicate what central banks do in the end,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at Oanda in New York. 
""You will probably see the dollar lead the charge with rate hikes, Europe will lag and that interest rate differential should provide some support for the dollar.""
Joining other analysts that have raised expectations for a more aggressive Fed, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Friday said it expects two hikes of 50 bps each at its June and July meetings with ""risks"" of those being pulled forward into May and June respectively. 
Citi also revised its Fed policy path higher for rate hikes, expecting 50 basis point hikes at the May, June, July and September meetings this year.
Economic data pointed to rising prices and interest rates starting to crimp some economic activity. 
Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes dropped to the lowest level in nearly two years in February while consumer sentiment was dented in part by climbing gasoline prices, which boosted inflation expectations to the highest level since 1981.
The euro gave up early gains and weakened, and was on pace for its sixth weekly decline in seven, although concerns about an economic slowdown were likely to keep it in a tight range. 
German business morale deteriorated in March due to worsening supply chain issues resulting from high petrol prices and driver shortages, a survey showed on Friday.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.21% versus the greenback to 122.07 per dollar after hitting a fresh low of 122.43, the weakest in more than six years, while Britain's pound was last trading at $1.3187, up 0.03% on the day. 

The yen has been under pressure, with the Bank of Japan expected to keep its soft monetary policy in place, in contrast to most other central banks around the globe.

The Office for National Statistics said February retail sales volumes were down by 0.3% from January as stormy weather deterred some shoppers from venturing out.
Meanwhile, a survey by GfK showed British consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since November 2020 in March because of inflation worries, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. 
At 1513 GMT, the pound was little changed against the dollar at $1.3192.
Against the euro, sterling was also flat at 83.40 pence, after earlier declining to its weakest level against the single currency since Monday.

""Sterling’s limited reaction to the data is indicative of the limited volatility in the pair around current levels,"" analysts at Monex Europe said, highlighting that volatility had ""dried up"" following Wednesday's budget announcement.

The trend of foreigners investing in China, and allocating yuan assets will not change, China's foreign exchange regulator said. Meanwhile, China expects a reasonable current account surplus this year, despite an expected slowdown in exports.
The comments come amid signs of heavy foreign outflows from Chinese markets since Russia launched war on Ukraine, as investors reckoned Beijing's friendship with Moscow could become a handicap the longer the conflict lasts.
The growing policy divergence between a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve, and a dovish People's Bank of China could also lead to money outflows.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said on Friday it will strengthen macro-prudential management of cross-border capital flows, and ward off risks of external shocks.
China will continue to maintain yuan flexibility, step up monitoring cross-border capital flows, enrich the policy toolbox, and appropriately guide expectations, it said. 
""China's financial market is increasingly open, and Chinese bonds and stocks have sound investment value,"" SAFE said.
""There's still big room for foreign investors to increase allocation (to China assets), which is good for long-term, steady capital inflows.""

In terms of current account, China's export growth will likely slow from a high base, as the pandemic's impact on global trade activities becomes muted.
But China's current account surplus will remain at a reasonable level, SAFE said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Friday, with the much-battered Japanese yen seeing some respite, at the end of a week which has seen rising expectations of a faster Federal Reserve tightening cycle. 
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 98.655.
The dollar has seen buying this week as a number of Federal Reserve policymakers have lined up to signal that the central bank is prepared to take strong action to combat inflation at 40-year highs.
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at their meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018, and expectations are rising that the U.S. central bank will hike by a more aggressive 50 basis points when it next meets.
We think the market “is inching closer to pricing in 100bp of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve at the next two meetings,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields were last seen trading at 2.36%, not far removed from the highest level since 2019, providing support for the dollar.
Goldman Sachs raised its forecasts on U.S. Treasury yields for this year, given this hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve. The influential investment bank now expects benchmark 10-year yields to rise to 2.7% by year-end, up from its previous forecast of 2.25%. 
USD/JPY fell 0.6% to 121.65, falling back from a six-year high, following the lack of intervention from the Bank of Japan when selling pushed its 10-year government bond yields close to its 0.25% target, climbing 3 basis points to a six-year high of 0.24%.
While this lack of intervention hinted at policy flexibility, the yield differential still suggests the USD/JPY has further to climb.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1012, helped by falling European natural gas prices with a deal between President Joe Biden and the European Union paved the way for more imports from the U.S. to reduce the bloc’s reliance on Russian energy expected to be announced on Friday. 
“The underlying tone has firmed somewhat and EUR could edge higher today,” said foreign exchange strategists at UOB Group, “However, any advance is expected to face solid resistance at 1.1045. Support is at 1.0985 followed by 1.0965.”
GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3175 after British retail sales unexpectedly falling 0.3% in February from January, compared with the expected 0.6% monthly rise.
British inflation rose to a new 30-year high of 6.2% last month, at the very top end of expectations, and this drop in retail sales is unlikely to cause the Bank of England to stop its rate-hiking cycle.
AUD/USD dropped 0.1% to 0.7507, NZD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.6958, both handing back a small portion of their recent gains, while USD/CNY edged lower to 6.3656."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, and the Japanese yen was set for its worst week in two years. Rising import costs and low interest rates contributed to the yen’s downward trend, but commodity currencies were set for a second consecutive weekly gain on the dollar as export prices continue to soar.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.26% to 98.540 by 11:43 PM ET (3:43 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair fell 0.61% to 121.58. Japanese data released earlier in the day showed that the Tokyo consumer price index (CPI) for March 2022 grew 1.3%, and the Tokyo core CPI grew 0.8%, year-on-year. The CPI Tokyo excluding food and energy also grew 0.2% month-on-month.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7518 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.6969.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.1% to 6.3616 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.3208.
Concerns that rising energy and food costs stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 could hurt the European economy continue. The euro has been slightly softer throughout the week and was pinned at $1.1005.
Australia, an exporter of both energy and food, was one beneficiary of rising costs and the Aussie recorded a second consecutive weekly rise of more than 1%.
However, the yen has dropped 2.6% against the dollar for the week, falling past the 120 mark and eyeing a test of major resistance around 123.70. It has lost nearly 6% through March 2022 to date and dropped some 8% against the Australian dollar in eight sessions.
The latest fall was triggered by hawkish remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell earlier in the week that also drove a surge in U.S. yields. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has, for its part, stuck to a more dovish tone than the Fed, but some investors warned that, at a six-year low, the yen is falling towards some uncomfortable depths.
""One thing to watch for in dollar/yen is pushback from policymakers in Japan,"" Spectra Markets trader and president Brent Donnelly told Reuters.
""I'm not sure we're quite there yet, but the 123.50/125.00 level is almost certain to attract some attention and generate headlines from either Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida or Minister of Finance Shunichi Suzuki. Pushback could also come from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda,” he said.
Recent movements in the bond market are also putting central banks between a rock and a hard place. Defending a challenge to yield curve control could further weaken the yen. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds hit 0.235% on Friday, near its 0.25% upper limit.
The Russian rouble traded firmly in Thursday’s European session after President Vladimir Putin vowed to start selling gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in the currency. However, it lost some of these gains in thin offshore trade and last traded at 102 per dollar."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose for the fourth time in the past five sessions, as economic data on the labor market helped firm expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in taking steps to curb inflation. 
Weekly initial jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 187,000 last week, the lowest level since September 1969 and below the 212,000 forecast.
While new durable goods orders unexpectedly fell in February as shipments slowed, demand for goods remained strong. In addition a measure of business activity for March climbed to an eight-month high. 
The data and recent comments from Federal Reserve officials have strengthened views the central bank will hike rates by more than 25 basis points at its next policy meeting in May. Expectations for a hike of 50 basis points at that meeting are 70.5%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html, up from 32.9% a week ago. 
""The dollar continues to be like a steamroller here, pretty much running over anyone that takes a short position against it,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto. 
""The data we are seeing certainly supports the case for multiple 50-basis-point hikes this year, and that is pushing up the front end of the curve and leading the dollar to outperformance against virtually every major as well as the commodity-linked currencies, which is something of a surprise.""
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently raised the possibility of raising interest rates by more than 25 basis points at upcoming meetings, a more aggressive stance echoed by other policymakers as they attempt to cool rising inflation, which has supported the greenback of late. 
On Thursday, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he would be comfortable raising rates at every Fed meeting through next March by 25 basis points each time but is ""open-minded"" about a possible 50-basis-point hike.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the state of the U.S. housing market should help shape monetary policy and there seems to be no cooling in sight for higher home costs, although Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on Thursday said he has penciled in seven quarter-point interest rate hikes this year and warned against overdoing it.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner on Thursday said the firm now sees 50-basis point hikes at both the Fed's May and June meetings, with 25-basis-point hikes at each meeting after through the rest of the year. 
The dollar index rose 0.163%, with the euro down 0.06% to $1.0997.
Euro zone business growth was stronger than expected this month, a survey showed on Thursday, although prices rose at a record pace, likely adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise rates.
The Japanese yen fell against the U.S. dollar for the fifth session in a row, hitting its lowest since December 2015 at 122.40 with the Bank of Japan expected keep its soft monetary policy in place, in contrast to most other central banks around the globe. 
The Japanese yen last weakened 0.92% versus the greenback to 122.27 per dollar, while Britain's pound was last trading at $1.318, down 0.17% on the day. 
The war in Ukraine has served to push up prices of oil and other commodities, adding pressure to already rising inflation. 
Western leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday agreed to strengthen their forces in Eastern Europe, increase military aid to Ukraine and tighten their sanctions on Russia.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Leaders from some European Union member states said on Thursday Russia's demand that ""unfriendly"" countries use roubles to buy for its oil and gas could breach supply contracts. 
President Vladimir Putin's demand on Wednesday for rouble payments sent European gas prices surging and added to concerns over supply disruptions in the EU, which gets about 40% of its gas from Russia.
Germany and Italy said the move may breach energy supply contracts. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said the currency German companies must pay for Russian fossil fuels was fixed in their contracts.
""There are fixed contracts everywhere, with the currency in which the deliveries are to be paid being part of these contracts... in most cases it says euros or dollars,"" Scholz said on his arrival to an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.
That was echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. ""This is basically a breach of contract, this is important to understand,"" he said. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed, and said the move was an attempt to circumvent EU sanctions against Russia.
""We will not allow our sanctions to be circumvented. The time when energy could be used to blackmail us is over,"" she said.
Payments in roubles would shore up the Russian currency which has plummeted since the Feb. 24 invasion. Putin’s speech lifted the rouble 9% against the dollar on Wednesday.
Analysts said rouble payments would be possible without breaking EU sanctions, which do not directly hit oil and gas supplies but target banks that could be involved in rouble transactions.
Russia's main gas exporter Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) has more than 40 long-term gas agreements with European counterparties, with Europe paying hundreds of millions of euros per day to Moscow for fossil fuels.
According to Gazprom, around 97% of its gas sales to Europe and other countries as of Jan. 27 were settled in euros or U.S. dollars.
A disruption to Russian oil and gas imports would hit some EU countries harder than others. Germany, Europe's biggest economy and energy consumer, receives 18% of Russia's gas exports and 11% of its oil.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said he was ""not scared"" by Putin's demand, since Latvia does not import Russian crude oil and could replace Russian gas with liquefied natural gas from elsewhere.
""Nobody will pay in roubles,"" Slovenia's Prime Minister Janez Jansa said.

The agreement is aimed at helping millions of Ukrainian refugees, who have fled the Russian invasion, to support themselves by exchanging their money into the currency of the EU country they have escaped to.
The draft document, seen by Reuters, is to be adopted by EU governments and would apply to all refugees under EU temporary protection, granted to Ukrainians earlier in March.
While maximum limits per person for exchanging hryvnia banknotes should be established taking into account national circumstances, the maximum limit should be at or below 10,000 hryvnias, with the number in brackets, signalling it might yet change, the draft showed.
Conversion into EU currencies is to be done without charges and the applicable exchange rate should be the official exchange rate published by the National Bank of Ukraine, the draft said.
The Ukrainian central bank's exchange rate of hryvnias into euros was set at 32.138 on Thursday, which means each refugee could get 311 euros for 10,000 hryvnias.
The scheme should run for a minimum of three months, the draft said, with the number placed within brackets to denote it could change.

Every EU country will set up its own system to make sure each refugee exchanges the maximum amount only once.
The scheme does not mention any role for the European Central Bank. That means national authorities would make the needed arrangements with the Ukrainian central bank, a departure from a scheme considered earlier in which the ECB would have been involved in a financial facility set up for the conversion.

The Chinese yuan held on to long bets, though they slipped to their lowest in nearly six months, while short bets rose on the Philippine peso and the Malaysian ringgit, a fortnightly poll of 13 respondents showed.
Market participants turned short on the baht, as surging COVID-19 infections in China dashed hopes for a recovery in tourism revenue, while rising commodity prices also dented sentiment for the country being a net energy importer.
Across the region, currencies have been largely subdued as the U.S. dollar found support after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points and officials signalled more aggressive measures to contain unexpectedly high inflation.
Meanwhile, rising oil prices also underpinned bearish mood in the region. While crude has slipped from a peak hit earlier this month, it still remains elevated enough to threaten bigger trade deficits and greater cost-pull inflation.
Singapore reported on Wednesday its fastest rise in headline prices in nine years, while central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines have noted risks from supercharged prices.
""Despite the backdrop of war, we expect the macro outlook to be driven primarily by inflation... Inflation will now get a further lift for at least a few months,"" Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), said in a note.
""Investors still believe that central banks such as the Fed will not have to over-hike into a recession to wrestle inflation lower. We agree with this view. But the risks are far greater than a month ago.""
To that end, analysts at ING said in a note on Wednesday that they expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to resort to additional tightening at its upcoming meeting in April.
Currencies of the region's major oil importers like India saw one of the highest short bets, while those on major oil exporter Indonesia were cut significantly.
The yuan, which had emerged as a safe-haven bet in the initial days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and whose strength supports regional peers, has also come under pressure.
Rising COVID cases, however, mean the government may provide more stimulus, providing some support to the currency. 
Bearish positions in the Taiwan dollar hit their highest since June 2019, despite the country's central bank surprising markets with an interest rate hike last week.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, finding some support as commodity currencies took a breather from their recent steep rally. However, a struggling Japanese yen from a recovery in the U.S. bond market.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.18% to 98.790 by 12:08 PM ET (4:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 121.23. Data released earlier in the day showed that Japan’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for March 2022 was 53.2, and the services PMI was 48.7.
The AUD/USD pair edge down 0.19 % to 0.7483, with Australia’s manufacturing PMI was 57.3 and the services PMI was 57.9. The NZD/USD pair edged down 0.2% to 0.6959.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3729 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 1.3191. Thursday’s data showed that the U.K.’s consumer price index grew 0.8% month-on-month and 6.2% year-on-year in February. The producer price index input grew 14.7% year-on-year and 1.4% month-on-month, while the producer price output grew 0.8% month-on-month and 10.1% year-on-year.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars remained just below multi-month peaks, while the euro traded at $1.0989 after a small overnight fall.
The yen hit a six-year low of 121.41 per dollar on Wednesday, remaining near that level in the Asian session. The Bank of Japan also released the minutes from its latest policy meeting earlier in the day, which showed that policymakers agreed that consumer inflation could overshoot expectations if companies pass on rising costs quicker than forecast.
An ever-hawkish turn by the U.S. Federal Reserve has further widened that policy gap with its Japanese counterpart. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said both a 50 basis-point interest-rate hike and a decision to begin asset tapering could be warranted at the next Fed policy meeting in May 2022, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she supported front-loading rate increases in 2022.
But even an overnight steadying in the U.S. Treasury market after a few sessions of brutal selling did not provide much support to the yen.
""The fundamental drivers of dollar/yen now are U.S. rates as well as Japan's current-account deterioration because of high oil prices,"" Barclays PLC senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
""From a technical perspective, about 121.7 was the high from early 2016, so that would be the next key target in the really near term, but if we break above that, 125 could come into focus.""
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which were battered by increasing bets on aggressive interest rate hikes from the Fed, regained some losses overnight. Yields fell by 9 basis points (bps), although they are still up more than 50 bps in March to date."
94,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 06:28PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble closed on Wednesday at its strongest this month against the dollar both in Moscow and offshore exchanges after President Vladimir Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles.
The rouble ended below 100 per dollar, still down over 22% this year as Russia faces strict sanctions globally, triggered by its invasion of Ukraine late last month.
European gas prices soared after Putin's shock announcement, on concerns the move would exacerbate the region's energy crunch.
""It seems to be an effort by the Russian authorities to apply pressure on Western countries by forcing foreign buyers of Russian gas to use roubles, with the added benefit of supporting the value of the currency,"" said Liam Peach, Emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics in a client note.
The rouble gained 6% to close at 97.7375 per dollar in Moscow after touching 94.9875, its strongest since March 2. It closed up 8.8% at 96.5 on the EBS platform. Both closing prices were the strongest since February.
Against the euro, the rouble rose 6% to 108.01 in Moscow.
Trading in OFZ bonds resumed this week, and the Bank of Russia announced some stock market trading would resume on March 24 after a near month-long hiatus, with 33 securities included into the benchmark IMOEX index set to be traded on the Moscow Exchange for a limited period of time and with short selling banned.
So far, the central bank has not disclosed the size of its interventions on the OFZ market that helped stabilise prices and provided extra liquidity to the financial system.
Yields on benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, closed at 13.85% on Wednesday after hitting a record high of 19.74% on Monday.
The benchmark yielded 8.42% at the end of 2021.
COUPON PAYMENT
Russia appeared to have averted default on foreign debt by making a coupon payment in dollars on a foreign bond maturing in 2029. A bondholder said the payment had been received.
But Russian holders of domestic corporate Eurobonds face delays in receiving payments settled through international agents, as transactions get snarled by sanctions, Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD), companies and analysts said.

Demand for rouble liquidity has declined as the central bank sold 0.8 trillion roubles ($7.7 billion) at a one-day ""fine-tuning"" repo auction on Wednesday, lower than in previous days. 
""Demand at overnight repo auctions is falling fast,"" Veles Capital brokerage said in a note, explaining that even though banks' liquidity levels have fallen to their lowest since June last year, lenders are repaying previous repo debts to the central bank.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Wednesday while the euro weakened as oil prices shot higher again with U.S. President Joe Biden poised to announce, alongside European leaders, new sanctions against Russia during his trip to Europe. 
Biden is due to arrive in Brussels later on Wednesday on his first foreign trip since the war in Ukraine began, and will meet NATO and European leaders in an emergency summit at the Western military alliance's headquarters. Sources said the U.S. package would include measures targeting Russian members of parliament.
Prices for commodities such as oil and wheat have climbed as tensions in Ukraine have escalated, putting additional upward pressure on already high inflation due to supply chain bottlenecks. Rising inflation has led many central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to take measures to rein in prices, such as by raising interest rates. 
""The capital flow is going to be I don’t want to be in Europe, it is closer to Ukraine literally in the geographical sense, but also it is the fallout from the sanctions, there is a lot of money rotating back out of Europe and back towards the States,"" said Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight.
""If we get another round of sanctions, then people therefore say the blowback on the West is going to fall on Europe disproportionately."" 
The dollar index rose 0.097%, with the euro down 0.17% to $1.1008.
Crude prices were up more than 5% on Wednesday, supported by disruption to Russian and Kazakh crude exports.
The Russian rouble strengthened 8.65% versus the greenback at 89.50 per dollar after hitting a one-month high of 87.50 after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sales from ""unfriendly"" countries.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of raising interest rates by more than 25 basis points at upcoming meetings, a more aggressive stance echoed by other policymakers, which has supported the greenback and helped boost the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to more than 2.4%. 
On Wednesday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester became the latest Fed policymakers to indicate a bigger hike was in the offing at the central bank's May meeting.
Jefferies on Wednesday updated its Fed forecast in light of Powell's comments and now sees a 50-basis-point rate hike at both the May and June meetings, followed by 25-basis-point hikes at the remaining meetings of 2022. 
The Japanese yen weakened 0.30% to 121.12 per dollar, while the British pound was last trading at $1.3207, down 0.42% on the day after earlier hitting a three-week high of $1.3298. 
Inflation in Britain shot up faster than expected last month to hit a new 30-year high at a 6.2% year-over-year rise. British finance minister Rishi Sunak cut taxes for workers and reduced a duty on fuel on the heels of the inflation data as he sought to soften a severe cost-of-living squeeze against the backdrop of fast-rising prices and slowing economic growth.
The yen has been weak against the dollar recently, with the currency slipping to a new six-year low of 121.40 per dollar as the path of their respective central banks has diverged. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday the central bank must maintain ultra-loose monetary policy as recent cost-push inflation could hurt the economy.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Wednesday, with the Japanese yen weakening, as rising commodity prices and expectations of a faster Federal Reserve tightening cycle continued to drive moves.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 98.558.
The dollar has continued to gain strength from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish speech earlier this week, where he signaled the central bank could hike interest rates by more than 25 basis points at upcoming policy meetings if the policymakers feel it necessary to tame inflation.
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at their meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018, and signaled six more hikes of that size this year.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields rose as high as 2.41% early in the Asian session on Wednesday, its highest level since 2019, providing support for the dollar, given the increasing interest rate differentials offered up by the bonds of the other major countries.
This gap is most obvious when compared with Japan’s debt, with the 10-year JGB yielding just 0.22%, and BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda maintaining that Tokyo must maintain its accommodative monetary policy for some time.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 121.09, just below the new six-year high of 121.41 seen overnight.
Also weighing on the yen are the higher commodity prices, and energy prices in particular, with Japan importing the bulk of its energy, widening the country's trade deficit.
“A sharply deteriorating trade position on the back of fossil fuel prices and a still dovish central bank leaves the door wide open for USD/JPY to trade up to 125 over coming weeks,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1025 with U.S. President Joe Biden heading to Europe later Wednesday for talks with European leaders about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
He is likely to announce plans for more sanctions on Moscow and will likely put pressure on European leaders to boycott Russian oil.
GBP/USD edged lower at 1.3259 despite British inflation rising to a new 30-year high of 6.2% last month, at the very top end of expectations. The Bank of England lifted interest rates last week, already moving to combat these high inflation levels.
Attention will also be on the U.K. Chancellor's Spring Statement later in the session, amid speculation Rishi Sunak will announce support measures to help consumers suffering from a cost of living crisis.
“That the UK's fiscal position has some room to support the economy may provide a little more room for the Bank of England to hike,” added ING.
AUD/USD dropped 0.1% to 0.7457, NZD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.6954, both handing back recent gains, while USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3753."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia. The Australian dollar minimized losses while the Japanese yen continued its slide, as investors slowly turn to riskier assets and climbing commodity prices continue to drive market movements.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 98.530 by 12:21 AM ET (4:21 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.28% to 121.13.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7461 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.6957.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3686 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 1.3282.
The Australian dollar hit its highest level since December 2015 versus the yen and has gained 8% in March to date. It hit a four-and-a-half month high in early trade, after gaining 0.95% overnight. The yen fell to as low as 121.4 per dollar, with the greenback gaining 1.1% on the Japanese currency overnight.
The Australian dollar's breaking of resistance at $0.745 was due to gains in equities and commodities, ANZ analysts told Reuters, adding that ""global risk sentiment"" continues to direct the Australian currency's outlook.
U.S. and Asia Pacific shares rallied on Wednesday, with investors largely shrugging off worries about the economic impact of the war in Ukraine, with commodities excepted. Soaring commodity prices will negatively impact the yen due to Japan’s reliance on imported oil and will widen the country's trade deficit.
""USD-JPY has nowhere to go but up,"" TD Securities analysts told Reuters, who pointed to the differential between U.S. and Japanese rates and the yen's vulnerability to the ongoing shock in commodities.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields rose to 2.4026% early in the Asian session on Wednesday. They were still receiving support from U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech on Monday, where he signaled hiking interest rates by more than 25 basis points at upcoming policy meetings.
The central bank has already raised its interest rate by 0.25% in its latest policy decision, handed down during the previous week.
""A number of other Fed speakers are jumping on Powell's aggressive hiking bandwagon,"" ING analysts told Reuters.
Powell will speak at the BIS innovation summit later in the day. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey are also among the summit’s speakers.
However, rising U.S. yields are having little effect on the dollar, with some investors saying much of the increase is already in the price.
The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly three weeks, with investors' focus on U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s “spring statement” on the budget due later in the day. British inflation data, including the consumer and producer price indexes, are also due later in the day.

Investing.com – The pound could mount a further recovery against euro on Wednesday, and is poised for wild swings as data showing inflation remains red-hot could renew bets on Bank of England rate hikes.
GBP/EUR rose 0.73% to $1.2020.
If the inflation data come in hotter-than-expected – as has been the case in the recent reports – the “BoE rate hike expectations could be fueled again, allowing sterling to recover somewhat further against euro,” {{Commerzbank said in a note}}.
Data on Wednesday is expected to show that the U.K. consumer price index and core inflation is expected to have risen by 0.7% to 6.2% and 5.1% in February year-on-year, respectively, the fastest pace in two decades.
A hotter than expected print could force investors to unwind bets of a less trigger happy Bank of England following the central bank’s dovish rate hike earlier this month.
The Bank of England hiked rates by 50 basis points in March, but “signaled a modest tightening of interest rates over the coming months,” Commerzbank said.
Having an acknowledge an inflation problem, the central bank has taken measures to curb price pressures including hiking its benchmark rate to pre-pandemic levels.
But the central bank is also wary that rising inflation could prove a useful tonic to its inflation problem by denting consumer demand enough to allow price pressures to slow.
The BOE “sees risks that in the end, high inflation might weaken private consumption which in turn could weaken price pressure. That is why it wants to implement cautious rate hikes,” Commerzbank added.
But whether inflation comes in hot again, or underwhelms, it “might well have the ability to move sterling considerably,” Commerzbank added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower on Tuesday as a boost from comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that boosted the greenback on the previous day faded and a rise in equities markets help boost risk-on sentiment. 
The greenback saw its biggest one-day percentage gain since March 10 on Monday, as Powell opened the door for raising interest rates by more than 25 basis points at upcoming policy meetings in order to combat inflation.
On Tuesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard repeated his call for the Fed to move aggressively on Bloomberg TV. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said she believes the main risk to the economy is a worsening of already high inflation as oil prices climb due to the conflict in Ukraine and a disruption in supply chains from China's COVID-19 countermeasures.
Traders are pricing in a 61.6% chance of a 50-basis-point hike at the Fed's May meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, up from slightly more than 50% a week ago.
In the wake of Powell's comments, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now anticipates the central bank will raise interest rates by 50 basis points at both its May and June meetings.
Investors were in a risk-on mood, as U.S. stocks rose and dented some of the safe-haven appeal of the greenback, with equities getting a lift, in part, from bank shares on Fed rate hike expectations.
""For the dollar, it is well supported by the Fed's increasingly hawkish rate stance but it is off its peaks, risk-appetite has something to do with that, with stocks higher that is kind of tempering the dollar’s gains,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington. 
""At least for now, it seems the market is giving the Fed the benefit of the doubt that it can foster a soft landing and that is what is underpinning risk appetite and capping gains in the dollar.""
The dollar index fell 0.06%. 
The yen continued its recent weakness as the Bank of Japan renewed its stance on keeping its ultra-loose monetary policy intact.
The yen hit a fresh six-year low of 121.03 and last weakened 1.05% versus the greenback at 120.72 per dollar.
The yen also suffered against other currencies, with the euro hitting a five-month high of 133.33 and was last up 1.2% to $133.17. The Japanese currency slumped to a more than 6-1/2-year low against the Swiss franc at 128.91, with the franc last up 1.48% to $128.89. 
The euro was up 0.13% to $1.1028. The single currency has weakened over the past month as the conflict in Ukraine has escalated, leading to an increase in energy prices. On Monday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the Fed and ECB will move out of sync, as the war in Ukraine has very different impacts on their respective economies.
But ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Tuesday the central bank needs to look beyond short-term swings in energy prices and focus on underlying inflation trends. 
Sterling was last trading at $1.326, up 0.72% on the day. 

In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last rose 3.67% to $42,662.37.
Ethereum last rose 3.59% to $3,014.26.

100,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The Russian rouble hovered around the 104 mark to the U.S. dollar most of the trading session in Moscow on Tuesday, lacking momentum for larger moves, while government OFZ bonds stabilised with the help of the central bank.
Russia confirmed its ability to service debt by paying a coupon on its Eurobond due in 2029, marking the second successful coupon payout in the past week.
At 1453 GMT, the rouble was little changed on the day in light trade near 103.88 against the dollar and was flat at 114.50 versus the euro.
The rouble has stabilised after falling to a record low of 120 in Moscow earlier in March and even further on the interbank market to 150 as Russia took a hit from unprecedented western sanctions in response to what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24.
Before that, the rouble traded at around 80 against the dollar.
The rouble is seen range-bound at 100-107 to the greenback and its further direction will depend on the political backdrop and volumes of Russian exports, Alor Brokerage said in a note.
Otkritie Bank said it expected the rouble to fall to 150 to the dollar by year's end in a pessimistic scenario or firm to 85 in an optimistic one.
Trading on the OFZ bond market continued for the second day after it was shut in late February.
The central bank said last week it would begin buying OFZ bonds to limit volatility, after it held its key interest rate at 20% after an emergency rate hike in late February.
The central bank has so far not disclosed the size of its interventions on the OFZ market that helped stabilise prices and provided extra liquidity to the financial system.
""Judging by the levels at which the rouble sovereign debt is trading, the central bank is playing a decisive role in the pricing,"" said Maxim Biryukov, senior analyst at Alfa Capital.
Yields on benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, stood at 13.63% on Tuesday after hitting a record high of 19.74% the day before. 
On Monday, OFZ trading volumes reached 13.8 billion roubles ($132.65 million), with 35% of turnover in the main session falling on individual investors. Before the crisis, an average daily turnover stood at 20 billion roubles, according to Alfa Capital.

The central bank has yet to say when trading in instruments like stocks can resume, as it seeks ways to clear a backlog of transactions while avoiding a market collapse. But a limited number of financial market operations have been permitted to resume over the next two weeks.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A jump in the price of oil and a yawning gap between yields at home and those of U.S. bonds have left Japan's yen with next to no chance of a quick recovery from the symbolic 120 level it fell to Tuesday, analysts say. 
The yen breached 120 per dollar for the first time in six years, extending its swift 4.5% fall in less than three weeks.
Analysts at BofA said the yen could reach 123 per dollar by September. In the past, Japan would have welcomed a weaker yen, which would have boosted profits from exports. But with exports slowed by the pandemic and foreign manufacturing, those days are gone, analysts say.
""You have a higher oil price, and you have the widening interest rate gap, and the university fund is supposed to start investing by the end of this fiscal year, so I think overall there's going to be more yen supply than demand in the coming months,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at BofA in Tokyo.
The 10 trillion yen ($83 billion) university fund, which will begin investing by this month, is part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's stimulus package and a chunk is meant to be parked in foreign assets.
Meanwhile, high energy prices caused in part by the war in Ukraine have caused Japan's trade deficit to soar.
The world's third-largest economy reported a wider-than-expected 668.3 billion yen trade deficit for February, smaller than January's 2.19 trillion yen gap, which was the biggest in a single month in eight years. 
Brent crude has been above $100 per barrel for almost all of March, and rose as high as $139 early in the month. [O/R] 
""The vicious cycle between a deteriorating trade balance and falling yen may have started already,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Tohru Sasaki said in a note. 
""Higher commodity prices will result in a larger trade deficit, which should result in a weaker yen,"" he wrote, adding that because a lot of Japanese manufacturing was no longer based in the country, there would be no concurrent jump in exports.
JPMorgan recently raised its target for yen to 121 per dollar by the first quarter of 2023. 
INTEREST RATE DIVERGENCE
Also weighing on the yen is the growing gap between Japanese and U.S. interest rates. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds are around 0.21%, and a sharp rise in U.S. yields - U.S. 10 year bond yields reached 2.35% on Tuesday - has taken the spread between the two markets to its widest since August 2019.
In theory, those low yields and expectations for yen weakness could spur more Japanese investors to sell their currency and turn their attention abroad, although in practice much of such flows are hedged and have only marginal impact. 
GRAPHIC: Japan's yen under pressure: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpomymmxpd/Pasted%20image%201647925341006.png 
Japan's yields are set to stay low. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday that ultra-loose monetary policy must be maintained, lest higher food and energy costs hurt the economy. With even the European Central Bank looking to tighten monetary policy, the BOJ is the last dove among major central banks. 
Japanese inflation is low by global standards. In the United States, markets are pricing in an increasingly aggressive cycle of rate increases. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched. 
Powell's comments were the catalyst in sending the yen past 120, said Yujiro Goto, head of FX strategy at Nomura Securities, though he reckoned the yen would not weaken much further. 
""I expect dollar-yen will move to a new range centred around 120. A lot of U.S. rate hikes are already priced into the market, so while the dollar could rise to 122 or 123 yen, it looks hard for it to break above 125,"" he said. 
Japan is watching recent falls in the yen carefully as sharp moves are ""undesirable,"" the government's top spokesman said on Friday. 

However, there may not be much they can do. 
""Policymakers care about volatility, and the speed of the yen's decline has been significant, so I do think there's going to be more comments trying to check the market,"" said BofA's Yamada. ""But a good part of this has been led by a shift in fundamentals - for example the trade balance - so I'm not sure if verbal intervention can really turn the market.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar strengthened Tuesday, particularly against the Japanese yen, after hawkish comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell raised expectations of a faster tightening cycle. 
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% higher at 98.903.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank’s desire to clamp down on surging inflation on Monday, at a conference of the National Association for Business Economics, saying the policymakers will take the “necessary steps” to get prices down.
“If we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” Powell said.
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at their meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018, and signaled six more hikes of that size this year.
This provides a stark contrast with the stance of Japan’s central bank, which maintains an ultra-loose monetary policy lest inflation hurt the economy. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated on Tuesday that Tokyo must maintain its extremely stimulative monetary policy as its economy is still in the very early stages of recovery.
Two-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields all climbed to their highest levels since 2019 early Tuesday, widening the gap on pinned Japanese yields, and USD/JPY soared 0.8% to 120.44, above the physiologically-important 120 level to a six-year high. The pair has gained more than 4% this month on the different policy stances. 
“USD/JPY, having broken through 120.00, had 123.00 and 125.00 potentially in its sights. Any thoughts that the Ministry of Finance will intervene were complete nonsense unless moves in the yen become extremely disorderly,” said Jeffrey Halley, OANDA’s Senior Market Analyst for Asia Pacific.
The dollar gains were not only against the yen, with EUR/USD down 0.4% to 1.0975 and GBP/USD 0.2% lower at 1.3137. Both currencies have been hit by expectations of weaker European economic growth as the Ukraine war rages on.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde stated on Monday that the ECB and the Federal Reserve will move out of sync in the foreseeable future, as the war in Ukraine has vastly different effects on their economies.
""Our two economies are in a different place in the economic cycle, even before the war in Ukraine,"" Lagarde told a financial conference. ""For geographical reasons, Europe is way more exposed (to the war) than the U.S..""
AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7384, NZD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.6879, both handing back recent gains, while USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3604 ahead of expected easing by China’s central bank to support the country’s struggling economic recovery.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, while the yen fell through the 120 mark for the first time since 2016. Investors continued to digest a hawkish speech from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that raised bets on higher U.S. interest rates and widened the policy gap on a dovish Bank of Japan.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 98.602 by 11:51 PM ET (3:51 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.36% to 119.90.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7401 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.6886.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12% to 6.3639 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.3152.
The yen fell about 0.4% to briefly hit 120.08 per dollar earlier in the session. It is down about 4% this month as soaring U.S. yields lured flows from Japan.
""Widening policy divergence is continuing to push the yen to more deeply undervalued levels against the U.S. dollar,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman told Reuters.
U.S. bonds and interest-rate futures retreated further overnight after Powell said policymakers needed to move ""expeditiously"" and teased the possibility of 50 basis point rate hikes.
Fed funds futures moved to price in an almost 2/3 chance of a 50 basis point hike in May 2022. They now predict the benchmark rate, which is currently below 0.5%, exceeding 2.5% in 2023. Benchmark 10-year U.S. yields soared 14 bps and, at 2.0914%, the gap on anchored 10-year Japanese yields is the widest in more than two and a half years.
The moves in the bond markets, alongside the continued fighting after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 lent broad strength to the dollar elsewhere.
In offshore trade, the Chinese yuan traded at 6.3739 to the dollar, falling from recent highs and settling in a new range as investors await promised monetary easing.
China’s State Council pledged stronger monetary policy support on Monday but cautioned against flooding the market with liquidity. The government vowed to avoid measures that can hurt market sentiment. Expectations are also growing that the People’s Bank of China will loosen monetary policy to support the economy.
“Although the People’s Bank of China left 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates unchanged... on Monday, we still expect it to lower the reserve ratio requirement by 50 bp again, as early as Q1 2022,"" Scotiabank strategist Qi Gao told Reuters. ""We maintain our short USD/CNH spot position."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar strengthened against a basket of major currencies on Monday, in the wake of comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that opened the door for the central bank to take a more aggressive monetary policy path.
The greenback had been fluctuating between slight gains and losses earlier in the day, and weakened slightly after comments from Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic. The policymaker said he sees six rate hikes this year and two for 2023, a more dovish stance than most of his colleagues as he has concerns about the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the U.S. economy.
But the dollar gained ground after Powell said the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to bring too-high inflation under control, and will, if needed, use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes to do so.
""He keeps saying the same thing over and over, that we've got to get inflation down and whatever it takes that's what we're going to do. The market unfortunately is hanging on to old norms, that they'll just do a quarter (of a percentage point) every time,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
""The Fed is kind of rewriting that playbook - we may have to go every meeting, we may have to do something more than 25 basis points, and we might have to do rate hikes and quantitative tightening at the same time.""
Markets have been volatile over the past month as the situation in Ukraine has escalated, increasing the prices of commodities such as oil and putting upward pressure on already high inflation. 
The Fed raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points last week for the first time since 2018 as it attempts to combat rising prices while trying to avoid a policy error which could send the U.S. economy into recession. Investors are now focused on the potential speed and size of future rate hikes.
The dollar index rose 0.123%, with the euro down 0.24% to $1.1022.
Ukraine defied a Russian demand that its forces lay down arms in the besieged port city of Mariupol before dawn on Monday.
While many central banks around the globe have been hiking rates, with the Fed the latest to do so, the Bank of Japan on Friday maintained its massive stimulus program and held rates steady, while warning of increased risks from the Ukraine crisis to a delicate economic recovery. 
That disparity has served to weaken the yen, with the Japanese currency trading near six-year lows versus the dollar despite its safe-haven status. 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday that the Fed and ECB will also move out of sync, as the war in Ukraine has very different impacts on their respective economies.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.17% versus the greenback at 119.38 per dollar, after touching 119.46 yen, its lowest level since February 2016.

Sterling was last trading at $1.3168, down 0.06% on the day. 
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last fell 1.84% to $40,973.32 while Ethereum last fell 1.33% to $2,908.60.

CAIRO (Reuters) -Egypt devalued its pound by 14% on Monday after Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted foreign investors to pull billions of dollars out of Egyptian treasury markets, putting pressure on the currency.
The pound dropped to 18.17-18.27 against the dollar, Refinitiv data showed, after having traded at around 15.7 pounds to the dollar since November 2020. 
The central bank also hiked overnight interest rates by 100 basis points in a surprise monetary policy meeting.
Egypt's central bank governor, Tarek Amer, told a press conference the pound had undergone a ""correction"" that reflected world and local developments. The correction would make exports competitive and help preserve foreign currency liquidity.
Egypt has been in discussions with the International Monetary Fund about possible assistance, people close to the negotiations have said, but it has not announced any formal request. 
""This is a good move to make as the devaluation of the pound moves it roughly in line with its fair value and it could pave the way for a new IMF deal,"" said James Swanston of Capital Economics. 
""However, it will be key whether policymakers now allow the pound to float more freely or continue to manage it and allow external imbalances to build up once more, possibly resulting in future step devaluations like today's,"" Swanston said.
The IMF in Cairo was not immediately available for comment. 
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan arrived in Egypt on Monday to meet President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, has been a strong financial backer of Egypt. Sisi flew to Riyadh to meet Saudi leaders on March 8.
Monday's weakening of the pound could catalyse inflows of foreign currency, while investors who already had money in Egyptian treasuries would be unlikely to sell now, said Farouk Soussa, senior economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""The move is designed to trap liquidity in the market and bring in investors who might be sitting on the sidelines waiting for the pound to bottom out,"" he said.
But it will also likely add to inflation and possible local dollarisation.
""The big question is whether this is enough, or if more might be needed to entice portfolio investors,"" Soussa said.
HIGHER WHEAT IMPORT PRICES
Shortages of dollars have led to blockages at Egyptian ports, after importers could not obtain necessary foreign currency for letters of credit to get their goods cleared, bankers said.
The war in Ukraine has also left Egypt facing higher costs for its substantial wheat import needs as well as a loss in tourism revenue from Russian and Ukrainian visitors to Red Sea resorts. Russia and Ukraine are the main suppliers of wheat to Egypt, which is often the world's largest importer.
The higher wheat prices could nearly double annual state spending on wheat imports to $5.7 billion, according to a study last week by the International Food Policy Research Institute, straining government finances and fuelling inflation pressure.
Headline inflation has accelerated to its highest level in nearly three years, registering 8.8% last month and touching the upper limit of the central bank's 5-9% target range.
The finance ministry will allocate 130 billion pounds ""to mitigate the repercussions of global economic challenges,"" it said in a statement on Monday. 
The package includes fixing the import customs exchange rate for basic commodities and production requirements at 16 pounds to the dollar and reducing the capital gains on initial public share offerings. 
Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly set the price of unsubsidised bread on Monday at 11.5 Egyptian pounds ($0.66) per kilogram, according to a statement from his office. Prices had jumped as much as 25% because of disruption to wheat imports caused by Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

The central bank cited global inflationary pressures amplified by the war in Ukraine for its hike in rates, which lifted the overnight lending rate to 10.25% and its overnight deposit rate to 9.25%.
State-owned Banque Misr and National Bank of Egypt said on Monday they were offering certificates of deposit with a yield of 18%.

106,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 12:50PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble steadied near 104 to the dollar on Monday and OFZ treasury bonds returned to trading, albeit in a volatile fashion, while investors kept an eye on Russia's ability to service state debt and pay the coupon on its Eurobond.
The rouble gained 0.8% to 104 against the dollar in Moscow trade and added 0.1% to finish the day at 114.64 versus the euro.
The market was focusing on clues about Russia's state finances as the country looks to gradually resume operations on its financial markets.
On Monday, Russia was expected to pay a $65.6 million coupon to holders of its 2029 Eurobond but the finance ministry has the right to pay creditors in roubles if they had asked to receive their interest in the Russian currency. 
Yields on the 2029 paper, which move inversely with their prices, stood at 43% compared with 4.5% seen a month ago before Russia started what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
Despite mounting concerns about Russia's ability to service debt, it paid coupons on two Eurobonds in dollars last week, meaning it has averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century.
OFZ TRADING RESUMES
The central bank said it would begin buying OFZ bonds when the Moscow Exchange resumed trading those papers on Monday, hoping to limit volatility, as it also held its key interest rate at 20% last week after an emergency rate hike in late February. 
Prices on some rouble-denominated OFZ bonds tumbled by a third in pre-market trade before trading on the main session resumed at 1000 GMT and the overall trading volume totalled 13.8 billion roubles ($128.67 million), Moscow Exchange data showed.
The central bank did not disclose the amount of OFZ bonds it bought but the cumulative bid for just three OFZ series exceeded 240 billion roubles, meaning the central bank might have saved papers from falling further, market players said.
The central bank put bids for some of OFZ series of 80 billion roubles to 120 billion roubles ($0.77-1.15 billion), asset managers at Locko Invest firm said in a note.
""That's a lot,"" they said.
The yield on Russia's benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, rose to a record 19.74% in pre-market trading, before settling near 14.1% by the end of the main trading session, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
The central bank's intervention on the market should provide extra liquidity to the banking system and help the bond curve adjust to the new environment, SOVA Capital said in a note, with short-term rates remaining close but above the current key rate of 20% and the curve being inverted. 
Russian banks will be the main players on the OFZ market while non-residents will seek to exit the market to the extent possible as the papers, which foreign investors used to like thanks to appealing yields, were excluded from global indexes, VTB Capital said .
For now, sales of OFZ bonds by non-residents, who owned 19.1% of all such bonds as of early February, will not be authorised between March 21 and April 1, Moscow Exchange said on Monday. 
Those investors will be able conduct repo and derivative transactions and, when stock market trading resumes, buy securities to close their short positions, but not sell previously purchased securities, the bourse said.
Stocks and bonds last traded on the Moscow Exchange on Feb. 25. The central bank subsequently curbed trading as Western sanctions over events in Ukraine threw markets into turmoil.

The bank has yet to say when trading in instruments like stocks can resume, as it looks for ways to clear a backlog of transactions while avoiding a market collapse. But a limited number of financial market operations have been permitted to resume over the next two weeks.
Later on Monday, Russia's lower house of parliament was due to discuss the nomination of Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina for another term by President Vladimir Putin.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Monday, trading in a tight range ahead of comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell later in the session, just a few days after the U.S. central bank started its tightening cycle. 
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally higher at 98.263.
The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points last week for the first time since the pandemic. This is expected to be the start of an aggressive tightening cycle given the soaring inflation, and thus traders will be looking for clues on the speed and size of future rate hikes.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later Monday about the economic outlook at the annual conference of the National Association for Business Economics, ahead of a raft of speeches from other Fed officials during the week, including Powell himself making another appearance on Wednesday.
“There is a camp arguing that the dollar typically sells off in the first six months of a Fed tightening cycle - presumably on the 'buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact' mentality of a well-telegraphed tightening cycle,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “What is different this time, in our opinion, is the aggressive front-loaded tightening about to be undertaken by the Fed and events in Ukraine which have damaged European growth prospects and will weigh on currencies in the region.”
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1051, and GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3160, with both currencies hit by expectations of weaker European economic growth as the Ukraine war rages on, lifting energy costs.
That said, in the short term, speeches this week by several policymakers at the European Central Bank, including president Christine Lagarde, could influence the direction of the euro, in particular.
USD/JPY edged higher to 119.22, not far removed from the six-year peak of 119.39 touched on Friday. The yen has come under severe pressure against the greenback, falling 1.6% last week, as the gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates widens.
Bank of Japan kept its dovish policy on Friday, which contrasted with the Fed hiking its interest rate the previous Wednesday.
AUD/USD dropped 0.3% to 0.7392, after the recent strong rally due to higher commodity prices, while NZD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.6895.
USD/RUB rose 0.3% to 105.0994, with fighting continuing in Ukraine, particularly around the south-eastern city of Mariupol, with Ukraine rejecting a Russian demand that its forces lay down their arms and leave the city."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, recording slight gains on the Japanese yen to as much as 119.3 yen and challenging the six-year peak of 119.39 touched on Friday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 98.278 by 11:47 PM ET (3:47 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 119.19, with Japanese markets closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7401, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.6905.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.3640 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 1.3159.
The yen continued to drop on Monday, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars remained bid. A slew of global central bank policymakers, including U.S. Federal Reserve Jerome Powell, will also speak throughout the week.
Moves in the pair could slow this week, but the dollar will climb further on the yen in the coming months as the gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates widens, CBA analysts predicted.
""Japan’s inflation dynamic is very different to that experienced in other major economies we monitor. As a result, an exit from the ultra-easy monetary policy by the Bank of Japan (BOJ)remains a long way off in our view,"" they added.
BOJ kept its dovish policy as it handed down its policy decision on Friday. This contrasted with the Fed’s approach, which saw it hike its interest rate the previous Wednesday.
CME’s Fedwatch predicted a nearly 90% chance of at least 75 basis points of increases across the Fed's meetings in May and June 2022. Such high expectations helped the dollar climb steadily in the early part of this year, but with many Fed increases already priced in, it could struggle to gain further, according to some investors.
""Given already-hawkish market expectations of Fed tightening, it is hard to foresee greenback strength persisting beyond the near term,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts told Reuters.
The yen also hit a four-year low against the riskier Australian dollar, which has received a boost from the recent rise in commodity prices.
Further gains could be possible as the Fed's hiking cycle is now priced in, and because of the ongoing recovery in global risk sentiment, which would typically support risk-friendly currencies, the Barclays analysts added.
The euro was at $1.1044, with the conflict in Ukraine dictating the future of the both the single currency and the pound. Speeches from policymakers at the European Central Bank, including president Christine Lagarde, might also play a role.
Fighting continues in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24. Russia called on Ukraine to lay down arms in the city of Mariupol, but Ukraine insisted that there is no question of surrendering the city."
109,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 04:48PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble fell in light trading in Moscow on Friday, with trading on separate exchanges stabilising beyond 100 to the dollar, after the central bank opted to hold rates at 20% and said it would start purchasing OFZ government bonds.
The central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged on Friday, in line with a Reuters poll of analysts, following an emergency rate hike in late February, but warned of higher inflation and an economic contraction this year, without giving new forecasts.
The central bank's actions have come in support of an economy buckling under the stress of sanctions from across the globe, triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine late last month.
U.S. President Joe Biden sought to prevent Beijing giving new life to Russia's troops in a video call with President Xi Jinping on Friday as stalled Russian forces pressed on with bombardments of towns and cities.
The rouble ended 1.6% weaker against the dollar at 104.82 in Moscow, and fell 0.95% to 114.80 to the euro, while rising for the week against both currencies. It has lost about a fourth of its value over the past four weeks.
In offshore markets, rouble bids were last indicated at 102.75 per dollar and traded at 105.
Trading on the stock market section on the Moscow Exchange has been closed for weeks but currency trading has continued.
Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who was nominated for another term by President Vladimir Putin earlier on Friday, said the bank would begin buying OFZ bonds when the Moscow Exchange resumes trading those papers on Monday, hoping to limit volatility.
Evgeny Suvorov, economist at CentroCredit Bank, said the bank had made clear this was a temporary measure to limit financial stability risks, and not akin to the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank's quantitative easing schemes.
""The central bank is afraid that the market at opening will go to hell and this will tear apart a load of banks and investment companies,"" he said. 
COUPON PAYMENT
The rouble showed limited reaction to an indication that Russia had averted a default on its foreign currency bonds, after it paid interest due on two sovereign dollar bonds seen as a key test after the imposition of hefty sanctions.
Those sanctions increased demand for foreign currency, which prompted the central bank to ban the selling of cash dollars and euros to individuals at banks' offices.

A month ago, the Russian currency traded at around 76 to the dollar and 85 to the euro.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in late February in what it called a special military operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index bounced back on Friday from recent declines as Federal Reserve officials said the central bank may need to be more aggressive to deal with inflation, while the dollar hit a fresh six-year high against the yen.
The U.S. dollar also was up 0.1% versus China's offshore yuan at 6.3716 yuan, registering little change following U.S. President Joe Biden's video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Biden sought to prevent Beijing giving new life to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The talks, which ended without big surprises, helped to boost stocks on Wall Street, however, especially in the technology sector.
Two of the Federal Reserve's most hawkish policymakers said the central bank needs to take more aggressive steps to combat inflation. A third, who just six months ago was the U.S. central bank's most dovish member, said he was open to that possibility.
The Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point Wednesday in an effort to tame inflation at 40-year highs. It was the first hike in three years, and the Fed also signaled that more rate increases are coming.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who dissented on this week's action in favor of a half-point increase, said on Friday that officials should raise the Fed's overnight lending rate to more than 3% this year. 
""For the dollar, hawkish Fed speak has put some wind back in its sails,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""It's playing up the more hawkish outlook for Fed policy. While the Fed was hawkish this week, their outlook for rates was still generally in line with market expectations.""
The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.2% at 98.190, but well off its highs of the session, after declining for the past four days.
The dollar was up 0.4% against the Japanese yen and hit a fresh six-year high. The Bank of Japan left its ultra-accommodative policy settings unchanged on Friday, as widely expected, leaving it an outlier among developed-world central banks which are exiting coronavirus pandemic emergency measures.
The euro weakened as investors assessed developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, including news that Russia paid interest due on two sovereign dollar bonds.
The euro declined 0.4% to $1.1054 but rose 1.3% for the week in its biggest weekly percentage gain since the first week of February, when European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde signaled for the first time that interest rates will rise in the euro zone in 2022.
The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar was up 0.5% against the U.S. dollar, extending gains for a fourth day. Oil prices settled higher on Friday, but posted a second straight weekly loss. [O/R]

Russian residents are not allowed to buy stakes in companies that are not Russian residents without the central bank's permission until the end of this year, the decree said.
The decree also said that Russian banks that were hit by Western sanctions can pay out FX deposits to companies in roubles using the actual rouble exchange rate until Sept. 1.

112,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 03:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The cost of insuring Russian debt against default dropped and bond prices rose after people familiar with the matter said funds earmarked for interest payments on the Russian government’s dollar notes were sent to the payment agent.
JPMorgan has processed the funds and sent the money on to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)., the people said, spurring optimism that the bonds may still be settled in dollars. 
As bondholders waited to receive the $117 million, two bondholders in Asia had yet to receive payment as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong on Friday. S&P Global Ratings warned that the “technical difficulties” in getting the money to investors was increasing the risk of a default -- either this time around or in the future.
Nonetheless, JPMorgan’s move caused Russian credit-default swaps to drop further Thursday after sharp declines this week, while the prices of its bonds maturing in 2023 and 2043 have rallied. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was the correspondent bank Russia used to send the payment to Citigroup, which is acting as payment agent on the bonds, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. JPMorgan sent the money to Citigroup after it sought and received the required approvals from U.S. authorities on Wednesday, one of the people said.
Representatives for JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment.  
Russian officials have said if the payment in dollars is blocked, then it would instead send it in rubles. Russia has a 30-day grace period to meet the payment obligations.
“If funds are not accessible for investors or if a payment is made in a currency not stipulated in the terms of the obligation and we believe that the investor does not agree to the alternative payment, we could deem this a default,” S&P analysts said in a statement, downgrading Russia’s foreign-currency rating to CC from CCC-.
Citigroup is the payment agent for about four dozen bonds tied to Russian companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some of those companies -- including MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC (OTC:NILSY) and Gazprom PJSC (OTC:OGZPY) -- have successfully made coupon payments in recent days.
But in other cases, coupon payments may not have gone through. Citigroup this week blocked a $19.25 million interest payment sent by EuroChem Group AG, a Russian fertilizer maker, according to a person familiar with the matter. The steel and mining company Severstal warned this week that Citigroup may refrain from processing a $12.6 million interest payment due on its dollar bonds.
The drama has thrust a spotlight on banks’ back offices. The Russian Finance Ministry said it had sent the order for a $117 million interest payment on March 14 to a correspondent bank that it didn’t identify, adding that it would issue a separate comment about whether the paying agent, Citibank’s London branch, has received the payment. 
As a correspondent bank, New York-based JPMorgan processes and clears payments and other transactions for financial institutions. In its role as payment agent, Citigroup, also based in New York, collects coupon payments from bond issuers and distributes those funds to investors. 
“This seems to take a technical default off the table for now,” said Kaan Nazli, a money manager at Neuberger Berman in The Hague, Netherlands. “However, there is still some uncertainty over corporate debt as only a number of companies have been given leeway.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but was set for its first down week in six and remained near a one-week low, as the impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision continues.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 98.120 by 11:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.16% to 118.78.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7373 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6880.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.18% to 6.3584 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3153.
The dollar’s losses were the euro’s gain, with the single currency little changed at $1.10885 on Friday but up 1.67% for the week. Hopes for an end to conflict stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 rose. Talks between the two countries continue but Thursday’s progress was elusive. Russia’s avoidance of default on its dollar-denominated debt also boosted sentiment.
U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will speak later in the day, where he is expected to warn China not to provide support to Russia.
The pound was higher and set for its first winning week in four. Investors continued to digest the Bank of England hiking interest rates to 0.75% as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday. The central bank also softened its language around the need for future rate hikes to ""might be appropriate"" from ""likely to be appropriate.""
However, ""a more favorable diplomatic backdrop between Russia and Ukraine appears to be developing and there's more dollar index downside to be had if momentum moves toward a ceasefire,"" Westpac strategists said in a note.
The dollar index still looks headed to 100 and above as the Fed's hiking cycle progresses, the note added. The U.S. currency paused for breath and was set for a 1.09% loss over the period. The greenback fell to 97.724 on Thursday for the first time since Mar. 10.
The ripple effects from Wednesday’s Fed’s policy decision, which saw the central bank hike its interest rate to 0.5%, also continue. The Fed also hinted at hikes at each of its six remaining policy meetings in 2022, with some investors wondering whether the economy will be able to handle the tightening.
""A well-worn market axiom, that says sell the dollar on the first Fed rate hike, is circulating with added momentum after the dollar's failure to rally in the wake of this week's indisputably hawkish Fed,"" TD Securities analysts said in a research report.
The Bank of Japan also kept its interest rate steady at -0.10% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The widening policy gap with its U.S. counterpart pushed the yen to a six-year high at 119.13 on Wednesday. The yen is set for a 1.15% weekly decline after falling 2.26% during the previous session, its worst in two years."

Many exchange offices and banks have thus far been reluctant to accept hryvnia given the oversupply of the currency resulting from the large numbers of refugees entering Poland and concerns about its decrease in value.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) said it was cooperating with the country's largest lender, PKO BP (NYSE:BP), to allow the almost 2 million refugees who have fled Ukraine for Poland to convert hryvnia. 
""Due to the significant influx of war refugees from the territory of Ukraine, coming to the Republic of Poland with hryvnia (UAH) in the form of cash, the National Bank of Poland is carrying out intensive preparations enabling the conversion of hryvnia to zlotys,"" NBP said in a statement.
It said bank notes in denominations of 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 hryvnia will be exchanged up to a total amount of 10,000 hryvnia per person in PKO BP branches.

Many refugees are struggling to buy even basic necessities because their savings in hryvnia are non-convertible across most of Europe, meaning they have no way to exchange them at reasonable rates. That in turn leaves them prey to unscrupulous traders offering ultra-low rates of exchange.
The European Central Bank is working on a financial facility to let millions of Ukrainian refugees convert their savings into hard currency, Reuters reported on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Thursday and hit its lowest in a week as investors digested the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook a day after the U.S. central bank's expected rate hike, while the euro rose as investors kept an eye on Russia-Ukraine talks.
The Fed's monetary policy turned hawkish with its quarter-percentage-point rate increase Wednesday and projection that the federal funds rate would reach a range of 1.75% to 2% by the end of 2022 and 2.8% next year, but the central bank did not deliver a tougher surprise that some investors might have been expecting.
""The strongest message yesterday was that the Fed was going to hike and it was primarily concerned with elevated inflation pressures,"" Bipan Rai, North American head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto, said. 
""The market is kind of taking the bet that the Fed has this view now but that could shift in the coming quarters, and there's a lot already priced in to the short-term interest rate markets for the Fed this year. Some of that is being pulled back, and that's one of the reasons why the dollar has come under pressure.""
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against six trading currencies, was down 0.5% at 97.980 and hit its lowest in a week. The index remains up 2.4% for the year so far.
The euro was up 0.5% at $1.1095 and touched its highest since early March. Officials from both sides of the Ukraine-Russia conflict met again for peace talks, but they said their positions remained far apart.
The Russian rouble rose in Moscow trading and was slightly weaker offshore. On foreign exchanges, rouble bids were indicated at 96 per dollar and traded at 104, down 3.9%.
The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar was up 1.2% against the U.S. dollar.
Oil prices climbed 8% on Thursday with a renewed focus on supply shortages in coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia.[O/R]
The euro rose against the British pound and hit its highest since early February. The Bank of England raised interest rates as expected, but softened its language on the need for further increases.
Money markets are pricing less than 120 bps of rate hikes by year-end. [IRPR]
The dollar was down 0.1% against the Japanese yen . Earlier Thursday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Japan's inflation was unlikely to hit a central bank target of 2%, even accounting for rising energy costs, making the case for keeping monetary policy ultra-easy.

116,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 04:40PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble rose in Moscow trading and was slightly weaker offshore on Thursday, with investors watching Russia-Ukraine peace talks and reports of foreign currency coupon payments on Russia's sovereign debt.
Ukraine's capital Kyiv came under renewed Russian shelling as the invasion entered its fourth week. Western sources and Ukrainian officials said Russia's assault had stalled. Officials from both sides meanwhile met again for peace talks, but they said their positions remained far apart.
In financial markets, two market sources said some creditors have received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week. This means Russia may for now have averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century.
""Even if this week’s payment is made, investors will need to then monitor the next upcoming payments as they may be treated differently,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a client note.
Dollar coupon payments on bonds with fallbacks that allow for payment in roubles are due next week and the following. A $2 billion bond matures on April 4.
The rouble rose 4.7% in Moscow to close at 103.15 per dollar, and gained 3.5% to end at 113.715 per euro. It is still down more than 20% against both currencies over the past four weeks. 
On foreign exchanges, rouble bids were indicated at 96 per dollar and traded at 104, down 3.9%.
International outrage over Russia's invasion of Ukraine grew on Thursday, as fighting continued. Western nations have imposed unprecedented sanctions against Russia in response, triggering the worst economic crisis in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Russia also laid down strict new rules for foreigners seeking permits to buy and sell Russian assets ranging from securities to real estate, a client memo by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) showed, raising fresh concerns Western investors could face large write-downs.
The U.S. House of Representatives backed legislation on Thursday that would remove ""most favoured nation"" trade status for Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine, which would allow higher tariffs on imports from the two countries.
Russia's annual inflation accelerated to 12.54% as of March 11, its highest since late 2015, while shortages and a sharp increase in sugar prices led the competition watchdog to start investigating major sugar producers. 
The Moscow stock market stayed largely closed by order of the central bank, and will remain so for the rest of the week. Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25, after which the central bank imposed restrictions.

The central bank is now in focus as it will hold a rate-setting meeting on Friday. The bank is expected to keep the key rate at 20% and could shed more light on its future plans to regulate financial markets.
While forex transactions are limited, including with bank accounts and purchases abroad, Russians can still buy and sell forex online, although spreads are wide, indicating a lack of liquidity.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tightening monetary policy or intervening in the currency market will do little to reverse unwelcome yen declines that inflate already rising fuel and raw material prices, Japan's former top currency diplomat Hiroshi Watanabe said on Thursday.
Japanese policymakers have historically battled sharp yen rises that threaten to damage exports by issuing verbal warnings or currency intervention, while keeping a hands-off approach on yen falls.
But the yen's recent weakness -- it has fallen over 3% against the dollar so far this month -- has drawn concern from politicians, who worry about the damage it could do to households and retailers via higher fuel and food costs.
Watanabe said the yen, now hovering around 118.90 yen, may fall below 120 to the dollar and add pressure on Japan's resource-poor, import-reliant economy.
""The Bank of Japan continues to say a weak yen is good for the economy. But if crude oil prices keep rising, it's uncertain whether it can keep saying so,"" said Watanabe, who retains close contact with incumbent policymakers including BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
Still, there was little policymakers can do to arrest yen declines, he told Reuters.
""Intervention (to stop yen falls) won't work"" given the huge size of the global currency market, Watanabe said.
Tightening monetary policy won't help either as the BOJ cannot raise interest rates as much as the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has signalled hiking aggressively to combat surging inflation, he said.
""Under current conditions, the BOJ doesn't need to tweak interest rates,"" Watanabe said. ""Tightening now would be doing something useless.""
The remarks by Watanabe, who oversaw Japan's currency policy in 2004-2007, highlight a sea change in how Tokyo perceives yen moves as the country's changing economic structure diminishes the benefits of a weak yen.

""The basic stance of a central bank must be to strive at enhancing the value of its currency,"" Watanabe said.
""For the government, the key is to come up with a strategy that allows Japan to run trade and current account surpluses,"" such as by nurturing new businesses, he said.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia. The yen was at a six-year low on the dollar as investors continue to digest a hawkish outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve that contrasts sharply with that of the Bank of Japan (BOJ).
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.27% to 98.355 by 11:31 PM ET (3:31 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.05% to 118.67.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.25% to 0.7308 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.6844.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.11% to 6.3451 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3155.
The Fed hiked its interest rate to 0.5% in its policy decision handed down on Wednesday. The central bank was more aggressive than expected, hinting that it could raise rates at all six remaining meetings in 2022.
The yen was at its lowest level against the dollar since early 2016, or 119.13, overnight. The Japanese currency also fell 1.6% against the Australian dollar on Wednesday, sliding further on Thursday to a four-year low of 86.97 yen per Australian dollar.
""The market is expecting the Fed to ramp interest rates higher during the course of 2022. By contrast, the BOJ is committed to extremely accommodation policy settings,"" Rabobank senior FX strategist Jane Foley told Reuters.
""Interest rate differentials and Japan's position as a commodity importer suggest the possibility of further upside potential for USD/JPY this year,” she added. The gap between benchmark 10-year Treasury yields and 10-year Japanese bond yields was also the widest in nearly two-and-a-half years overnight at 1.99%.
The Bank of Japan will hand down its policy decision on Friday, where it is expected to maintain its dovish stance. The Bank of England will also hand down its policy decision later in the day, where it is expected to hike interest rates for a third consecutive meeting.
Hopes for a breakthrough in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia also saw investors retreat from safe-haven assets and global shares rise. It also put a bit of downward pressure on the dollar more broadly.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said negotiations were becoming ""more realistic"" and Russia said proposals under discussion were ""close to an agreement.""
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar climbed above its 200-day moving average. Australian employment data for February 2022 showed that the unemployment rate was 4%, the employment change was 77,400, and the full employment change was 121,900. Unemployment was down to lows not seen since 2008, adding to pressure for an early interest rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia.
""The Australian dollar is like a balloon being held underwater,"" City Index senior market analyst Tony Sycamore told Reuters.
""Terms of trade are at record highs and commodity prices, even though they've pulled back significantly, are still elevated and that bodes very well for the Aussie dollar.""

Bombs rained down on Ukrainian cities despite talk of compromise from both Moscow and Kyiv in peace negotiations, three weeks after the start of the Russian invasion.
Market participants, meanwhile, focused on whether Russia would pay coupons on sovereign debt due Wednesday, or start the clock on a 30-day grace period, after which it could default on its foreign sovereign debt for the first time in over a century.
At the close of trading in Moscow, the rouble gained 1.9% on the day to close at 108 per dollar and gained 0.7% versus the euro to close just below 117.7.
On foreign exchanges, the rouble was bid recently at 91 per dollar and traded at 97, up more than 13% on the day. It is down 23% so far this year. 
""There hasn't been any liquidity in rouble so very small moves, very small amounts of volume and demand for the currency can cause very big moves up, rather than anything in particular,"" said Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights.
""Because of the restrictions of the Central Bank of Russia the rouble is still relatively non convertible, there's a lot of question marks about what foreigners can do with it. I wouldn't trust any rally in the rouble to be persistent.""
Russia has $117 million in payments due on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated Eurobonds. Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday that if the payments were done in roubles, it would constitute a sovereign default if not corrected after a 30-day grace period.
Sources said there was no evidence yet of payment as of the end-of-business day in London.
Events in Ukraine and the sanctions against Moscow that followed have triggered the worst economic crisis in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The Moscow stock market stayed largely closed by order of the central bank, and will remain so for the rest of the week. Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25, after which the central bank imposed restrictions.
The European Union on Tuesday launched a new barrage of sanctions, including bans on Russian energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow and imports of steel products from Russia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve moved to a hawkish monetary policy but without delivering a tougher surprise that might have added to its weeks-long momentum.
The dollar index, which had gained 3% since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on Feb. 24 and 10% since May, fell as much as 0.6% on Wednesday as traders parsed Fed statements following a two-day meeting. 
""There were no additional hawkish surprises,"" said Erik Bregar of Silver Gold Bull Inc, adding that traders seemed to have been expecting too much more from the Fed. ""That explains why some of these hawkish bets are being pared back a bit,"" he said.
The dollar lost value to the euro and the British pound, both of which had been up earlier in the day on hope for a compromise in Russia and Ukraine peace talks.
The euro and pound both gained 0.7%, with the euro trading at $1.1032.
The Fed raised interest rates by the expected quarter of a percentage point and projected its policy rate would reach a range of 1.75% to 2% by the end of this year and 2.8% next year.
Strategists at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities called the Fed comments ""very hawkish,"" in a note to clients and said it should be good for the dollar going forward.
The decline in the dollar index was surprising and could reflect disappointment that the Fed rhetoric was not more hawkish, they said. 
The Fed did project the equivalent of quarter-percentage-point rate increases at each of its six remaining policy meetings this year but that was in line with market expectations for rates. 
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached 2.2% and two-year yields rose to 1%, flattening the yield curve.
The Bank of England meets on Thursday and markets expect it to raise rates by another quarter point.
The Bank of Japan is expected on Friday to leave ultra-loose policy settings in place. 
The dollar rose 0.4% on the Japanese yen and during the day touched 119.13 yen, the highest in more than five years. 
The commodity-sensitive Australian dollar added 1.3% to $0.7288.
Bitcoin was last up 5% on the day to $41,186.

The trade balance was –JPY668.3 billion ($5.65 billion) and the adjusted trade balance was –JPY1.03 trillion.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7202, after falling to $0.71650 during the previous session for the first time since Feb. 28. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.6767.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.17% to 6.3598, while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3053.
The euro continued to crawl back up from its plunge to a nearly 22-month low earlier in the month. The single currency edged up 0.14% higher to $1.09695, clawing up from a low of $1.08060 hit on Mar. 7.
U.S. Treasury yields climbed ahead of the Fed’s policy decision, which will be handed down later in the day. This gave the dollar a boost vis-a-vis the yen, with investors fully priced for the first interest rate hike in three years and giving 13% odds of a half-percentage point increase.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision on Thursday, with the Bank of Japan’s decision following a day later.
The Australian dollar also came under pressure, as its top trading partner China deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak. Numbers more than doubled to a two-year high on Tuesday, and areas such as the southern city of Shenzhen and Jilin province are currently under lockdown.
This kept the dollar index around the 99 mark after it hit a high of 99.415 at the beginning of the previous week. The dollar was also near its highest level this month to its riskier Australian counterpart, with commodity prices retreating from multi-year peaks as Russia and Ukraine continue talks that could lead to a ceasefire. Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.
""Whether it's forlorn or otherwise, there does seem to be some enduring optimism coming from the fact that Russia and the Ukraine are still talking,"" helping the euro to stabilize, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
For the greenback, ""the bigger question will be that there is a lot of historical evidence that the dollar peaks as soon as the Fed commences the tightening cycle, so there's a lot of interest in whether what the Fed does turns out to be something of a watershed in terms of a peak,"" with the dollar index topping out around 100, he added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index recovered after falling on Tuesday as volatile oil prices impacted the euro and markets grappled with the significance of talks between Russia and Ukraine and indications that COVID lockdowns will crimp economic growth in China.
The dollar index against major currencies was up less than 0.1% in the New York afternoon as markets awaited statements on Wednesday from the U.S. Federal Reserve after a meeting on monetary policy.
The euro was last down less than 0.1% to $1.0933 after having been up nearly 0.5%. The British pound was up 0.2% to $1.3027.
The Japanese yen continued trading at its weakest levels to the dollar in five years as the greenback gained 0.1% to 118.335 yen.
The dollar index had lost nearly 0.5% overnight after oil prices fell below $100 a barrel, bolstering the euro. The index recovered after oil turned up from a low for the day and was last at $99.14, up 3% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Brent crude futures dropped as much as 8% after concerns over supply were eased by ongoing Ukraine ceasefire talks and as rising COVID-19 cases in China suggested slower economic growth and less demand for oil.
The European economy and the single currency are especially sensitive to the war and to the price of oil.
""This (the drop in oil price) reflects the hope that the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian negotiators might lead to an imminent and peaceful solution after all,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) forex analysts said in a note to clients.
Early in the day, major currency pairs had been relatively steady as markets waited to hear on Wednesday the tone of U.S. Federal Reserve comments on interest rate policies in coming months.
Traders want to see if the Fed gives hints to how quickly it will raise rates again after putting through the quarter-point increase they expect to be announced on Wednesday. 
""The path that the Fed lays out for the rest of the year is going to be more interesting than the actual rate hike itself,"" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. 
The Fed's policy statement and economic projections are due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) and will be followed by a press conference. The central bank's effort to bring down surging inflation without triggering a recession is being challenged further by the impact of the Ukraine war.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Kyiv was prepared to accept security guarantees that stop short of its long-term objective of the NATO alliance membership, which Moscow opposes. Peace talks with Russia, via video link, resumed on Tuesday, the first time a round of talks ran into a second day. 
The dollar's rise since May last year makes the tone of Fed comments on Wednesday more important.
Its recent gains have come on its safe haven status during the Ukraine war and on expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise faster than rates on other currencies. The Bank of Japan, for example, is not expected to raise interest rates when it meets on Friday.
""The dollar is at pretty high levels. We would need a hawkish surprise from the Fed to see a further rise, but I think the bar is quite high for that,"" Matthew Ryan, senior market analyst at Ebury, said. 
""It will be difficult for the dollar to stage any meaningful rally after the Fed policy meeting.""

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - In times of crisis, not much in financial markets roars ""safe haven"" louder than the Japanese yen.
But in the three weeks of market turmoil since Russia invaded Ukraine, the yen has whimpered its way to a five-year low against the dollar. This time really is different. 
The characteristics that usually lay the foundations for yen strength in times of global market upheaval - falling interest rates and commodities prices against the backdrop of a sizeable Japanese current account surplus - are not in place.
Worse still for the yen, these forces are working in reverse: global interest rates, led by expectations for the Fed, are marching higher; energy and commodities prices are soaring; and Japan's current account surplus is small and evaporating. 
Currency analysts at HSBC hold their hands up and acknowledge they underestimated the nature of the market shock following the Feb. 24 invasion. Instead of the ""typical risk-aversion play"" propelling countercyclical currencies like the yen, ""currencies of most commodity exporters have performed well in contrast to those of net commodity importers.""
And there are few major economies more reliant on imported energy than Japan. 
Graphic: Japan Energy Costs & Yen- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxokbgopx/YENENERGY.jpg
Most of Japan's primary energy needs are met by crude oil, more than 90% of which comes from the Middle East. Japan is also one of the world's biggest importers of liquefied natural gas, which accounts for around a quarter of its energy mix.
Brent crude rocketed towards $140 a barrel earlier this month from around $90 before the war started, although it has fallen back below $100/bbl. Asia LNG spot prices have risen almost 20-fold from pre-pandemic levels.
This marks a sharp deterioration in the country's terms of trade, and the yen-boosting current account surplus that Japan has mostly run for decades could soon become a deficit. 
""This is an unusual crisis. U.S. interest rates are going up rather than down, oil is going up rather than down. And terms of trade are going against Japan,"" said Alan Ruskin, macro strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
Graphic: Japan Export & Import Prices- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomzxynvd/JapanTermsofTrade.jpg
SAFE HAVEN NO MORE
Ruskin has been watching global FX markets for 40 years. Most major financial shocks in that time - the first Gulf War in 1990, Russia's default and near collapse of hedge fund LTCM in 1998, the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 - have triggered immense yen rallies. 
This is because domestic investors suddenly repatriate some of the overseas holdings they have built up in calmer times on the back of Japan's huge current account surplus. Home bias from one of the world's biggest investor pools is a powerful force.
Graphic: Japan Current Account, Trade Balances- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzybljwvw/JAPANCA.jpg
The most powerful yen rally of all came in October 1998, after Russia stunned the world that August with its domestic debt default, which helped trigger the near-collapse of U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management a month later. 
The yen leaped 7% against the dollar on October 7 and soared 16% in that week, both historic moves. 
Russia is on the brink of default again, although failure to make coupon payments on March 16 would constitute technical default on its foreign debt obligations. Yet the yen's safe-haven status has deserted it this time around.
Previous bouts of severe market stress or geopolitical tension have usually been associated with interest rate differentials moving in the yen's favor, as U.S. yields fall faster than Japan's. 
Graphic: US-Japan Yield Spread- https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byprjewbxpe/USJPSPREAD.png
But not now. This crisis, which Russia says is a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine, has accelerated the recent upswing in U.S. bond yields. Markets expect the Fed to act tough on inflation, which is at a 40-year high near 8% and likely to increase even further in the coming months.
Steven Englander, head of global FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and a long-standing currency market watcher too, reckons the yen is due a bit of a breather. It has lost 2.5% against the dollar in less than three weeks.

But he also notes that any respite will probably be brief, given that the main drivers of a currency's value – interest rate differentials, safe-haven appeal, and underlying economic growth – are working against the yen.
""It's a costly safe haven right now,"" he says, adding: ""The dollar is scoring 3 for 3, and if you add a fourth driver - an energy shock - then there is very little reason to be positive on the yen right now.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will closely watch exchange-rate moves as market stability was ""very important,"" Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday in the wake of the yen's decline to a five-year low against the dollar.
While Tokyo policymakers have traditionally favoured a weak yen for the boost it gives to exports, the sliding yen has become a source of worry recently as it further inflates the cost of food, fuel and raw material imports.
""Exchange-rate stability is very important. We'll carefully monitor the currency market and its impact on the Japanese economy,"" Suzuki told a news conference, when asked about the softening yen.
He refrained from directly commenting on the dollar/yen's level and whether a weak yen was negative for Japan's economy.
The yen fell as low as 118.44 per dollar on Tuesday to hit a new five-year low on bets the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will maintain its dovish stance, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates on Wednesday.
The BOJ is likely to keep policy ultra-loose on Friday and vow to maintain its massive stimulus, even as rising fuel costs are set to push up inflation near its 2% target.
""Japan's economic and price situation is different from that of the United States and Europe,"" Seiichi Shimizu, head of the BOJ's monetary affairs department, told parliament on Tuesday.
""That means the direction of monetary policy will be different,"" he said, making the case for sustaining monetary support for an economy still reeling from the pandemic.
Japanese policymakers have said a weak yen has both merits and demerits for the economy due to the country's changing export patterns and increasing reliance on imports.
Many lawmakers and business executives have however voiced concern over the damage a further yen decline could have on consumption and retailers' profits.

""I think there are more demerits (to a weak yen) with the dollar/yen having exceeded 115,"" Kengo Sakurada, chairman of business lobby Keizai Doyukai, told a briefing on Tuesday.
""If the BOJ cannot follow global central banks in raising rates, the yen would weaken further.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, alongside the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar. The latest COVID-19 outbreak in China saw lockdowns in some cities, but the focus is firmly on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s March policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 98.948 by 11:07 PM ET (3:07 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.11% to 118.31, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) handing down its policy decision on Friday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7181. The Reserve bank of Australia released the minutes from its last meeting earlier in the day, and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.6744.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.16% to 6.3754. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that fixed asset investment grew 12.2% year-on-year in February. Industrial production grew 7.5% year-on-year and retail sales grew 6.7% year-on-year, while the unemployment rate was 5.5%.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 1.3026, with the Bank of England to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
The Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates for the first time since the pandemic when its hands down its policy decision on Wednesday. Investors expect a 25 basis point rise at this meeting, according to the CME's Fedwatch tool. However, pricing has risen to indicate a 70% chance of a larger 50 basis point hike at the May 2022 meeting, thanks to increasing concerns about inflation.
""We think the Fed statement and Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference after the meeting will be influential in terms of market pricing for a 50 basis point rise in May and beyond, and that will impact the U.S. dollar intraday,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) FX strategist Carol Kong told Reuters.
The dollar index was not far off the 99.415 touched a week ago, its highest level since May 2020.
The yen recorded sharp drops in recent sessions, as the difference in the policies adopted by the Fed and BOJ becomes more noticeable.
Hopes that Ukraine and Russia will reach a negotiated end to the war triggered by Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 also took some of the yen’s safe-haven appeal away.
The two countries held a fourth round of talks on Monday, but no new progress was reportedly made. The talks will resume on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan weakened to a one-month low against the dollar on Monday. Rising expectations of looser monetary policy and the COVID-19 lockdowns weighed on the Chinese currency.
The offshore yuan was softer at 6.398 per dollar, but the People's Bank of China kept the one-year medium-term lending facility unchanged at 2.85% in a surprise decision earlier in the day.
The situation in China was also weighing on the Australian dollar, according to Kong. The Aussie continued a downward trend, after falling 1.5% on Monday, as commodity prices eased from their earlier rally."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped modestly against a basket of currencies on Monday but remained near a 21-month high hit last week as investors eyed Russia-Ukraine peace talks, while major central bank meetings this week kept large moves in foreign exchange in check.
The dollar index fell 0.056% at 98.96, not far from the 99.415 touched a week ago, the highest level for the greenback since May 2020.
Tentative hopes of progress in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia helped boost the appetite for riskier currencies on Monday, though upcoming central bank meetings and another COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown in China kept risk-taking muted.
Russian and Ukrainian delegations held a fourth round of talks on Monday - by video link this time rather than in person in neighboring Belarus as in the past - but no new progress was announced and talks are expected to resume on Tuesday.
""We look for the U.S. dollar to remain broadly better supported amid elevated geopolitical risks and a hawkish Fed,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotia Bank.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates when it concludes a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, with investors completely pricing in a hike of at least 25 basis points, according to CME's FedWatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently flagged multiple rate hikes this year as the central bank attempts to curb surging inflation.
The dollar hit a more than five-year high against the Japanese yen at 118.05 on bets that the Bank of Japan, which meets on Friday, would maintain its dovish stance despite rising inflationary pressures. 
The dollar was last up 0.65% against the yen at 118.04 yen.
The British pound gave up earlier gains and lost 0.15% against the greenback even as the Bank of England appears poised to lift interest rates to 0.75% on Thursday, its third hike in a row, as it seeks to rein in a surge in inflation intensified by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Australian dollar fell 1.2% as commodity prices eased, while the New Zealand dollar was down 0.8%.
The Russian rouble strengthened 8.96% versus the greenback at 114.88 per dollar.
China's lockdown measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 lifted the dollar to 6.3961 versus the offshore yuan, the yuan's weakest in two months. The yuan rose 0.56% versus the greenback at $6.3940 per dollar.
China has reported more local symptomatic COVID-19 cases so far this year than in all of 2021, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant causes outbreaks from Shanghai to Shenzhen.

130,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 09:00AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's finance ministry is preparing to service some of its foreign currency debt on Wednesday, but such payments will be made in roubles if sanctions prevent banks from honouring debts in the currency of issue, the ministry said on Monday.
""Is that a default? ... From Russia's point of view, we are fulfilling our obligations,"" Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview with state TV aired on Monday.
Western sanctions over events in Ukraine have cut Russia off from key parts of global financial markets and have frozen nearly half of the country's $640 billion gold and FX reserves, triggering the worst economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
Siluanov said Russia has to pay coupons on its Eurobonds on March 16 and has already asked Western banks to carry out the transaction. 
But should a major part of Russia's reserves be frozen, the payment could run into ""particular challenges"" as the possibility of those payments going through would depend on sanctions. 
The government is due to pay $117 million on two of its dollar-denominated bonds on Wednesday. 
""If we see complications with executing the order then on Tuesday we will prepare a relevant transfer order in the rouble equivalent,"" Siluanov said in the TV interview.
Russia has the necessary funds to service its external obligations and may also use a yuan part of its gold and forex reserves if there is such a need, he said.
Several Russian banks have been banned from the SWIFT international payments network, hampering efforts to move money outside of Russia. 
""The freezing of the central bank and the government's foreign currency accounts can be seen as a desire by several Western countries to organise an artificial default,"" Siluanov said.

The Chinese currency accounted for 13.1% of the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves in June 2021, compared with just 0.1% in June 2017, with Moscow's dollar holdings dropping to 16.4% from 46.3% in the same period.
China is Russia's top export market after the European Union. Russian exports to China were worth $79.3 billion in 2021, with oil and gas accounting for 56% of that, according to China's customs agency.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Monday, but still hit a five-year high against the Japanese yen, at the start of a week that includes a number of key central bank policy-setting meetings, in particular the Federal Reserve. 
At 3:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 98.993, not far off its best level since May 2020.
The highlight of a busy week of central bank meetings will be that of the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to announce its first interest rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday.
The uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine has virtually ruled out a hike of 50 basis points, but with consumer inflation running at 7.9%, the largest annual increase in 40 years, the Fed has made clear its intention to lift interest rates, and a 25-basis-point hit looks likely. 
In contrast, the Bank of Japan is set to remain dovish at its meeting this week as policymakers try to boost the country's weak economic recovery from the pandemic.
USD/JPY rose 0.4% to 117.75, just below its highest level since January 2017.
“The yen is trading more like a carry-play and less like a risk-off haven,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, in a note.
EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.0941, buoyed by optimism that talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict may be making some progress after U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman said Sunday that Russia showed signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations.
That said, the euro remains under pressure as the fighting in Eastern Europe continues and threatens to cause even more diplomatic frictions with the U.S. claiming the Russians have asked the Chinese for military help.
“Speculators in the futures market have amassed the largest net long euro position since the middle of last year,” added Chandler. “But the fog of war and the anticipated hike by the Fed on March 16 keeps the euro on the defensive.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3049, with the Bank of England expected to hike rates for the third time since December after its meeting on Thursday, with consumer price inflation in the U.K. climbing to an almost 30-year high in January at 5.5%.
AUD/USD dropped 0.5% to 0.7252, after the recent strong rally due to higher commodity prices.
USD/CNY rose 0.3% to 6.3592, with the Chinese yuan weighed by another outbreak of COVID-19, prompting the authorities to place 17.5 million residents of the technology hub of Shenzhen in lockdown.
USD/RUB rose 0.7% to 115.1000, with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva stating that a Russian sovereign default is no longer improbable following the Western sanctions levied on Russia and its banks in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia. The Japanese yen hit a fresh five-year low as a slew of central banks prepare to hand down their policy decisions throughout the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 99.245 by 11:21 PM ET (3:21 AM GMT). The dollar index contract rolled over to the June 22 contract on Mar. 13.
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.48% to 117.84.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.45% to 0.7258 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.33% to 0.6784.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.16% to 6.3498 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 1.3014.
Hopes that talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict that began with the former’s Feb. 24 invasion weighed on safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday that there could be signs that Russia is willing to begin substantial negotiations to end its invasion of Ukraine. However, fighting in the conflict that began on Feb. 24 continues.
The dollar climbed to as much as 117.61 yen earlier in the session, the highest level since January 2017, extending gains from the previous week which Barclays PLC analysts attributed to a decline in demand for safe havens as equities rallied.
""The BOJ’s dovish bias, in contrast to the expected Fed liftoff, should continue to support dollar-yen alongside negative terms of trade impact from high energy costs,"" Barclays PLC added, adding there is ""no clear resistance until the end-2016 high of 118.6.”
The Bank of Japan is widely expected to maintain a dovish stance when it hands down its policy decision on Friday. The Fed, on the other hand, is expected to hike interest rates when it hands down its decision on Wednesday. The Reserve Bank of Australia will also release the minutes from its last meeting on Tuesday.
The Bank of England (BOE) will also hand down its policy decision, with bets firmly on a further 25-basis-point rate hike.
“How the Fed and ECB's rate hikes will affect the pound ""will depend in large part on their post-meeting statements and the Fed’s press conference. With the U.K. more exposed to the Russian supply shock than the U.S., we think the risks lies with disappointment by the BOE and a weaker pound down to 1.2894,"" CBA analysts said in a note.
The euro traded at $1.0935, with hopes of an end to the conflict in Ukraine giving it a small boost. However, the conflict’s impact on eurozone growth continues to weigh on the single currency. Commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian and the New Zealand dollars, retreated from the multi-year highs hit in March due to surging oil, grain, and metals prices.

Oleg Ustenko told local media that Ukraine's budget was fully funded and that the country's foreign exchange reserves of $27.5 billion would be replenished. Ukraine has secured emergency financing from the International Monetary Fund and other institutions to support its economy during the war. 

Russian forces have shelled major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, hit critical infrastructure and disrupted shipping routes through the Black Sea. 
Ustenko has previously said that invading Russian forces have so far destroyed at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure, buildings and other physical assets.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Central Bank tightened trade restrictions on Saturday, ordering exporters to repatriate foreign exchange earnings within 180 days of transactions in a bid to improve country's depleting foreign exchange reserves.
Sri Lanka is tackling its worst financial crisis in over a decade, struggling to pay for critical imports including fuel, food and medicines and with just $2.31 billion of reserves.
The bank's moves include mandatory currency conversion for exporters of goods and services to change their foreign exchange earnings into Sri Lankan rupees. 
""All licensed banks are required to strictly monitor receipts of goods to Sri Lanka,"" the central bank stated in a notification, adding that it ""has the right to initiate action against non-compliance by any exporter or licensed banks"".

The state-run oil company on Friday increased prices by 55 to 95 rupees (22-24 cents) per litre for most fuels to offset losses after Sri Lanka introduced a flexible exchange rate that saw the rupee plunge 30% to 260 rupees to the dollar.

So far this year, the sol is South America's second best performing currency behind Brazil's real, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. It has also outperformed Chile's peso, whose economy is similarly dependent on mining as the world's top copper producer. 
High metal prices should allow Peru to collect over 6 billion soles ($1.62 billion) in tax revenue this year, said Adrian Armas, the Central Bank manager of economic studies. 
""With the record prices of commodities, collection is improved, therefore (also) the supply of dollars from mining,"" Armas said during a conference call. 
Peru's sol currency rose 0.22% on Friday to 3,704/3,705 units per dollar, rising 7.17% since the beginning of the year.
On Thursday, the central bank raised its interest rate to 4% from 3.5% amid the inflationary pressures that have been affecting economies around the world. 
Armas added that global uncertainty due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and a likely interest rate increase in the United States could weaken the Peruvian currency in the future.

The Central Bank officer added that the Peruvian economy should have grown in January at a year-on-year rate equal to that of December, when it rose 1.72%. A recovery is expected for February, he added.

138,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 04:20PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The Russian rouble edged up against the dollar in thin on- and offshore trading on Friday, but ended a third week of hefty losses, with the central bank now further restricting access to foreign currency.
The rouble has lost a third of its value in Moscow exchanges since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, as the local economy buckles under the pressure of sanctions imposed across the world in retaliation for the invasion.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had reached a ""strategic turning point"" in the conflict with Russia, but Russian forces bombarded cities across the country in what Moscow refers to as a ""special operation,"" and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on the capital Kyiv.
On Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden joined allies to hit Moscow on trade and shut down development funds, and announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds.
The rouble closed 3.7% stronger for the day against the dollar at 114.2525 on the Moscow exchange, while for the week, it fell 8.1%, having lost over 32% of its value over the past three weeks.
Offshore bids were indicated at 125.50/140 on Refinitiv and bid 135.00 to the dollar on EBS.
The currency has fallen as much as 39% this year in Moscow, while offshore bids have seen even larger declines, by far the worst performing currency in the world this year. Wide bid/ask spreads showed how illiquid trading has become.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its year-end inflation forecast to 20% from 17% partly due to the further depreciation of the rouble.
""This is not a pure market so looking at the pricing, it is difficult to know what the level really is,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. ""The outlook (for the rouble) is completely dependant on whether there is a place for Russian produce and energy again (in the global economy).""
Against the euro, the rouble gained over 3% Friday to 121.03 in Moscow after hitting a record intraday low of 132.4175 on Thursday. It dropped 1.7% for the week and 28% over three weeks.
Trading on the equity market remained largely closed on Friday by order of the central bank. 
Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported, citing sources, that the central bank and Moscow Exchange were thinking of restarting local securities trading next week in stages. The main point of discussion was how to start trading in a way that would avoid prices collapsing, the sources told Vedomosti.
On Thursday, the central bank introduced restrictions on local firms' access to foreign-currency cash for the next six months, after earlier restricting citizens' access to hard-currency cash.
From March 10 to Sept. 10, local companies and entrepreneurs who want U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds and euros in cash can receive only up to $5,000-worth, and only to pay for overseas work trips.
Russia's economy is facing its most severe crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, after the West imposed severe sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system. 

Russia is also due to repay $117 million for two coupons on external dollar-bonds on Wednesday. While it has a 30 day grace period to make the payment, not doing so next week would see it edge closer towards its first major external default in around a century.
The central bank, which more than doubled interest rates in late February to 20%, is due to meet on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar edged higher in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $5.44 billion for the week ended March 8. Last week, speculators' net long position stood at $5.12 billion, the lowest level since mid-August 2021.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long of $3.88 billion, up from $3.84 billion a week earlier.
The fallout from the Russia-Ukraine has boosted the dollar, upending investor expectations for a weaker greenback as geopolitical uncertainty and worries over European growth raise the U.S. currency’s appeal.
The dollar which rose 6.3% against a basket of currencies in 2021, has climbed another 3.6% for the year. 
Speculators also trimmed their net long positioning on the euro to 58,844 contracts, down from 64,939 contracts, last week.
In the wake of Russia's attack and the consequent financial sanctions on the country, net longs on the Russian rouble were slashed to 9,674 contracts, the lowest since late January.

New York (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Friday, notching a five-year high against the safe-haven yen, while commodity-linked currencies slumped after Russian President Vladimir Putin said there had been some progress in talks between Moscow and Ukraine.
Putin said in a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko that there had been ""certain positive shifts"" in negotiations with Ukraine and that talks continued practically on a daily basis.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has roiled markets, causing volatility in commodity prices and threatening global economic growth prospects.
The dollar initially declined on the news, but then gradually firmed and was last up 0.76% against a basket of six global peers at 99.11. The index was on track for a 0.56% increase for the week, following last week's 2% rise, which was its largest weekly percentage gain since April 2020.
The greenback hit a five-year high against the Japanese yen, which was down 1.03% at 117.32 yen. 
""When people are taking a look at which economies are poised to handle the widespread inflationary pressures, the U.S. economy is looking like it's going to be the outperformer and that's why you're seeing the dollar do well against the yen in these risk-averse times,"" said Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda.
The dollar has also been supported by expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates at the end of its March 15-16 policy meeting, with inflation running hot.
While the U.S. central bank is all but certain to hike rates from the COVID-19 pandemic low, the Bank of Japan, which also holds a policy meeting next week, is set to remain an outlier.
The euro slid 0.69% against the dollar to $1.0912, erasing gains from the overnight session and putting it on track to end the week slightly lower for what would be its sixth-straight weekly loss. The single currency has fallen more than 2.5% against the U.S. dollar in March.
After hitting a nearly two-year low on Monday amid growing stagflation worries arising from the Ukraine war, the euro received some support from the European Central Bank's announcement that it will phase out its stimulus, opening the door to an interest rate hike before the end of 2022.
Commodity-linked currencies, including the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, were lower versus the greenback, with the Aussie and the kiwi both down 0.8%.

""Currencies that had been gainers because of the commodity chaos ... are starting to come down a little bit based on this idea that if perhaps there is optimism and positivity towards talks and there is any chance that there is a cease-fire or peace, that of course would get global growth momentum going again,"" said Juan Perez, head of trading at Tempus Inc. 
Bitcoin slid 1.64% to $38,798. It had surged this week after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday requiring the government to assess the risks and benefits of creating a central bank digital dollar.

141,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 10:44AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Friday as domestic data showing a blockbuster jobs gain raised expectations of a more aggressive than usual interest rate hike next month by the Bank of Canada.
Canada added 336,600 jobs in February, more than double the 160,000 analysts had forecast, while the unemployment rate dropped below its pre-pandemic level for the first time as businesses reopened from strict Omicron restrictions.
Money markets moved to price in a 45% chance of a 50 basis point interest rate hike at the April 13 policy announcement, compared to 37% before the data.
The BoC usually moves in 25 basis point increments, as it did last week when it raised its benchmark rate from a record low of 0.25%, its first hike in three years.
The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.5% to 1.2700 per greenback, or 78.74 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2695 to 1.2794.
It was the third straight day of gains for the loonie, after it touched on Tuesday a 2-1/2-month low at 1.2901. For the week, it was on track to rise 0.2%.
Gains on Friday for the loonie came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said there had been some progress in Moscow's talks with Ukraine, lifting investor sentiment at the end of a roller-coaster week for financial markets.

The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose on continued concerns about supply disruptions for Russian oil and oil products. U.S. crude oil futures were up 1.2% at $107.29 a barrel.
Canadian government bond yields were higher across the curve. The 10-year touched its highest level since Feb. 16 at 1.989% before dipping to 1.977%, up 4.1 basis points on the day.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Friday, boosted by strength against the Japanese yen, while the euro pushed higher following the hawkish turn by the European Central Bank. 
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 98.627.
USD/JPY rose 0.5% to 116.70, climbing to its highest level since January 2017, and up 1.5% this week, its biggest weekly gain since October.
This move follows Thursday’s release of data showing that U.S. consumer prices surged 7.9% year-over-year in February, the largest annual increase in 40 years.
Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have policy meetings next week, but while this inflation release all but confirms the Fed will tighten monetary policy in the form of an interest rate hike, the BOJ is set to retain a dovish monetary policy.
EUR/USD edged higher 0.1% to 1.0984, the day after the European Central Bank announced it would be speeding up its plans to tighten monetary policy, phasing out all of its asset purchases in the summer if inflation fails to come down fast enough. 
Still, while the euro is higher, it has struggled to retain most of the gains seen after the announcement. 
“By ending asset purchases sooner than anticipated, the central bank is taking the dangerous step of tightening in the face of slowing growth. Even [ECB President Christine] Lagarde said the risks to growth are to the downside,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs stated on Thursday that they expect economic output in the Eurozone to actually shrink in the second quarter, citing the region’s proximity to the war in Ukraine.
ABN Amro now has a base case of EUR/USD falling to parity or even below for the first time in about two decades, with the supply disruptions to key commodities disproportionately hitting the euro area economy and delaying European Central Bank tightening.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3081, despite Britain's economy rebounding much more than expected in January, with GDP climbing 0.8% on the month in January after a 0.2% decline in December.
The Bank of England policymakers meet next week and were already widely expected to hike interest rates once more, even before this stronger than expected data.
AUD/USD lost a little ground on Friday, down 0.2% to 0.7345, after the recent strong rally due to higher commodity prices."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, hitting a new five-year high on the yen after a U.S. inflation report showed the largest annual increase in 40 years. The euro struggled to hold its own, with a surprisingly hawkish turn from the European Central Bank (ECB) offset by growth risks from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 98.520 by 10:43 PM ET (3:43 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.29% to 116.47, with the dollar gaining 1.3% on the yen this week.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.23% to 0.7340 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 0.6852. New Zealand’s Business NZ purchasing managers' index was 53.6 in February.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.3248 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3089.
The U.S. report, released on Thursday, showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 7.9% year-on-year and 0.8% month-on-month in February. The core CPI grew 0.5% month-on-month and 6.4% year-on-year.
The CPI data ""basically indicates that the U.S. Federal Reserve should be hiking rates this month, but it also indicates that they will keep going with interest rate hikes, at least initially,"" National Bank of Australia currency strategist Rodrigo Catrill told Reuters.
The Fed and the Bank of Japan will both hand down policy decisions in the following week. While the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates, its Japanese counterpart is choosing to maintain a more dovish stance.
Both the pound and euro have felt the impact of the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant surge in commodity pieces.
The euro last traded at $1.1010, after a volatile Thursday that saw it finish 0.8% lower.
""The more hawkish message from the ECB had a temporary upward pressure on the euro but it was very short-lived which tells you that other dynamics are overriding any considerations about what the ECB might do, including news coming from Ukraine,"" said Catrill.
He was referring to the ECB’s policy decision, handed down on Thursday, which kept the interest rate steady at 0% but said that the central bank will phase out its stimulus in the third quarter. The decision also leaves the possibility of an interest rate hike before the end of 2022 open.
The ECB also modestly downgraded its growth forecasts for both 2022 and 2023, while ramping up inflation expectations. ECB President Christine Lagarde also called the conflict in Ukraine a ""watershed for Europe"" that would boost inflation but curb economic growth.
Meanwhile, talks between Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Thursday made disappointingly little progress towards ending the conflict."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro retreated from its overnight gains on Thursday following the European Central Bank's announcement it will phase out its stimulus in the third quarter, while the dollar strengthened after a strong U.S. inflation report.
The statement from the ECB, which left the door open to an interest rate hike before the end of 2022 as soaring inflation outweighs concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, briefly sent the euro higher, before market sentiment turned negative.
""The euro got a double whammy, from what is still a relatively dovish ECB - lower growth obviously - and with the higher inflation the market is really starting to price in a rate differential between the dollar and the euro,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. 
The ECB is trailing other major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in the post-pandemic tightening cycle, which has also weighed on the single currency.
The euro touched a 22-month low of $1.0804 earlier in the week, with investors expecting the crisis in Ukraine to have a sizeable impact on European growth. The single currency is widely seen as a gauge of Europe's biggest security crisis since 1945.
Recent speculation that EU leaders were considering joint bond issuance to finance energy and defense spending have, however, given the euro some support. EU leaders were meeting on Thursday in Versailles, west of Paris. 
At 3 p.m. Eastern time, the euro was down 0.83% at $1.0985, after having jumped 1.6% on Wednesday, its best day in nearly six years. 
The Fed is expected to raise rates by at least 25 basis points when it meets next week.
""Our base case scenario is still for the Fed to be the most hawkish central bank in the developed world and that should support the dollar at the margin,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
The dollar index was up 0.547% at 98.506, after falling 1.17% on Wednesday.
Data on Thursday showed that U.S. consumer prices surged 7.9% year-over-year in February, culminating in the largest annual increase in 40 years.
Inflation is poised to accelerate further in the months ahead as Russia's war against Ukraine drives up the costs of crude oil and other commodities.

Commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and the Canadian dollar, were up on the day, with the Aussie up 0.58%, the Kiwi up 0.49%, and the loonie up 0.37%.
Bitcoin tumbled nearly 6.02% to $39,434, erasing most of its gains from the previous day when an executive order from U.S. President Joe Biden requiring the government to prepare reports on the future of money calmed market fears about an immediate regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Thursday, while the euro handed back some of the previous session’s hefty gains ahead of high-level talks between Ukraine and Russia as well as the latest European Central Bank meeting. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 98.015.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1065, maintaining most of Wednesday’s 1.6% gain, its largest single-day jump higher since June 2016, after the announcement of talks between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia as well as easing oil prices boosted risk sentiment.
Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov is set to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey later Thursday. This is the first get-together between the two since Russia’s invasion, raising hopes that a ceasefire can be agreed even though Ukraine's foreign minister warned that his expectations were low.
“Fanning those hopes seem to be comments from President Zelenskiy that Ukraine no longer seeks NATO membership. At the same time, it seems that Russia may no longer be seeking regime change in Kyiv,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This seems to be building expectations that some kind of deal can be achieved.”
Also helping the euro recover from its recent beating was the sharp selloff in crude prices late Wednesday, with the Brent and WTI contracts both falling over 12%, after indications from a couple of major producers that they could increase supply to attempt to make up for the disruptions caused by the Western sanctions on Russia.
The common currency fell to a 22-month low of 1.0804 earlier in the week, weighed down by the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the associated sanctions, on crude prices, escalating fears of stagflation within Europe.
Also on the agenda, Thursday is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with investors looking at how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will impact monetary policy, given the policymakers had signaled in February an exit strategy to its emergency bond purchases, opening the way for an interest rate hike late this year.
The U.S. will release its consumer price index for February later in the day. This is expected to show another rise, with the annual figure seen reaching 7.9%, up from 7.5% this previous month. 
The Federal Reserve meets next week and is widely expected to hike interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY traded 0.1% higher at 115.94, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.3184, after jumping strongly on Wednesday, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7340.
USD/RUB edged 0.4% higher to 120.4700, with the ruble suffering in the wake of the sanctions levied by the West on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.
Russian officials have taken many measures to shore up its battered economy and safeguard hard currency availability, but the economy is headed for one of its biggest inflation spikes this century, to the likely detriment of its currency.",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro's fall of as much as 4% against the dollar and Swiss franc in two weeks is raising the question of what - if anything - the European Central Bank will do about it.
Euro weakness, in normal times, would be welcomed by an export-reliant bloc that has long struggled to meet a 2% inflation target. But in days of 5%-plus inflation, record energy import bills and a looming Russia-linked growth hit, it is something the policymakers cannot ignore.
Given that the decline is down primarily to the diminishing likelihood of a near-term ECB interest rate rise, investors will want to see how far policymakers are willing to tolerate currency weakness. 
What the ECB says is in focus after the Swiss National Bank on Monday pledged to curb franc strength - while the SNB frequently steps in to buy euros and dollars, it has not intervened verbally since 2016.
Analysts speculate that Thursday's ECB statement may throw in a mention of monitoring exchange rates, a line omitted in recent months. It may also signal rate hikes remain an option. Some even suggest the possibility of direct currency intervention - an extremely rare event. 
""The ECB should intervene in EUR/USD,"" is the title of a note by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s head of global currency strategy George Saravelos, who said euro depreciation was already inflicting economic damage via the import price channel. 
""The single most efficient way to ease inflationary pressures in the euro zone at the moment is via a stronger euro,"" Saravelos wrote, adding ""the more oil and natural gas push higher, the more the euro drops, pushing commodities priced in euros even higher - a vicious inflationary spiral"".
Commodity markets have seen eye-watering price surges this year, with Brent crude touching 14-year highs around $140 a barrel or, in euros, a record-high of around 128 euros per barrel.
European gas prices, up 150% this year, are projected by some to rise by another third to 300 euros a megawatt hour. 
Annual euro area inflation was a record 5.8% in February, with energy inflation running at 31%. Citi estimates Brent's latest surge will add 0.3 percentage points to the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) in March-April while gas prices will add 0.4 percentage points in the coming year. 
Saravelos does not see FX intervention as the most likely outcome, although he does not rule out a coordinated move involving G7 central banks if ""things get disorderly"". 
Instead he suggested lifting interest rates to 0% from the current -0.5% and a further bond-buying boost as the most effective solution. 
INTERVENTIONS
Currency market ructions are worrying many central banks, with several, from Poland to South Korea, intervening to support exchange rates.
But the ECB, which has said repeatedly it does not target the exchange rate, has not intervened in the $6.6 trillion a day forex market since 2011, when it joined a concerted G7 effort to weaken the yen following the Fukushima disaster and earthquake. 
Its last solo intervention happened in 2000 when it conducted seven bouts of euro-buying amounting to 10 billion euros to prop up the single currency soon after its launch.
One reason for reluctance may be the view that exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to inflation may have declined: a paper published by the ECB in September estimates the ERPT linked to import prices from outside the bloc at around 0.3%, compared to 0.8% in 1999.
So while a 1% euro depreciation raises import prices on average by 0.3% over a year, headline HICP increases around 0.04%, the paper added. 
""The current environment has to worsen significantly and the currency has to fall more rapidly for them to intervene,"" said Aaron Hurd, senior portfolio manager, currency, at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
He reckons the euro would have to fall to parity versus the dollar - a further 8% drop - for the ECB to step in.
Moreover, to move the currency significantly, an intervention would have to be sizeable. Daily euro-dollar turnover averaged almost $770 billion in October 2021 in London, a Bank of England survey found.
ING Bank analysts also do not consider the euro ""screamingly undervalued"", attributing its fall to diverging rate-hike expectations with the Fed, and hefty outflows from equity markets.
So for now, the ECB may merely talk about ""monitoring the exchange rate,"" which would ""introduce the notion that the ECB may consider measures to support the currency should it fall further"" it said.

A further energy price shock could see the currency fall towards the 2020 lows around $1.0640, the bank added.

(Reuters) - Investors raised their bearish views on most Asian currencies, with short bets on the Indian rupee at a near two-year high, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine supercharged commodity prices and stoked inflation concerns, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
The poll of 13 respondents showed market participants turned short on the Singapore dollar and significantly extended short bets on the South Korean won, the Taiwanese dollar and the Philippine peso.
The invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", has led investors away from risky emerging markets and caused regional bond yields to spike, as surging prices stoke worries over how economies recovering from the pandemic will manage higher inflation in the face of slowing growth.
Net energy importers such as India are the most at risk, as oil prices threaten to exacerbate inflationary risks at a time when retail inflation has already breached the upper limit of the central bank's tolerance band.
Bearish bets on the rupee hit their highest level since April 2020 as a result. The currency had slumped to a record low on Monday.
Analysts at DBS bank said in a note on Wednesday that fuel excise cuts might become necessary to cushion the hit from higher prices, which will widen India's current account deficit and put the central bank's dovish bias in ""tricky territory"".
Investors were also short on Indonesia's rupiah and Malaysia's ringgit, though the currencies were spared a drubbing due to the countries being major commodity exporters that would benefit from sky-high prices.
Still, risks from commodity export curbs linger, according to Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho bank.
""While IDR's coal export offset provides uncharacteristic backstop against 'risk off', it exposes a single-point of failure should coal exports ban be imposed due to domestic shortages. Not unlike the tightening of curbs on palm oil exports,"" he said.
Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan, which has emerged as a regional haven during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, eased but were still largely healthy.
The yuan traded roughly flat against the U.S. dollar at 6.32 on Thursday. It had hit its highest in nearly four years last week, prompting major state-owned banks to buy the greenback to restrain the bullish currency.
The Thai baht saw long positions cut sharply as the country's tourism sector is likely to be hit by a drop in tourists from Russia due to the conflict and from elsewhere due to fuel prices, further pressuring another net oil importer.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.

The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, while the euro held onto most of its overnight gains. The latter had posted its steepest daily jump in nearly six years after a meeting between Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers, and investor sentiment also improved as oil prices eased.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.23% to 98.175 by 10:20 PM ET (3:20 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.29% to 116.16.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7317 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.6825.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.3202 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 1.3156.
The European Central Bank (ECB) will hand down its policy decision later in the day, with investors looking to how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will impact monetary policy.
The euro was at $1.1047 after climbing 1.6% on Wednesday, the single currency’s best day since June 2016. European shares also gained on Wednesday, while bonds saw a sell-off. The euro fell to $1.0804, a 22-month low, earlier in the week as concerns grew about the invasion's impact on the European economic recovery.
""A glance across the market, in all things eurozone especially, could leave any casual observer forgiven for assuming that the war in Ukraine might have ended overnight. Not so, sadly,"" NAB analysts said in a note.
The note attributed the euro's gains to some optimism ahead of a meeting between Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. The meeting was the first between the two since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
It also pointed to reports that the European Union was discussing bond issuance to finance energy and defense spending, as well as “suspicions the ECB might not fully reverse its early February 'hawkish tilt' when it meets later today, given that inflation is destined to push still higher given the latest energy price shock.”
Oil recorded its biggest fall in nearly two years, after Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) member United Arab Emirates said it would support increasing output. This in turn gave the riskier Australian dollar a boost.
On the data front, the U.S. will release its consumer price index later in the day. This will be of note, with the U.S. Federal Reserve preparing to hand down its policy decision in the following week. The central bank is widely expected to hike interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in its decision."
149,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 04:56PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia's rouble tumbled to record lows in onshore trading on Wednesday despite measures by Moscow to shore up its battered economy and safeguard hard currency availability amid fresh economic sanctions triggered by its invasion of Ukraine.
Catching up after two days of market closure, the rouble jumped to 120.83 to the dollar on the Moscow Exchange before clawing back some losses to close at 120, or 12.5% softer than its Friday close. 
It closed 6.3% weaker against the euro at 127 after hitting a record 131 per euro in early trade. 
Offshore rouble trading was also thin with large disparities in pricing: On Refinitiv, the rouble stood at 129 to the dollar while on the EBS platform it was bid at 138 from the previous 130 close, down 5.8%.
Russia's financial markets have been thrown into turmoil since its invasion of Ukraine prompted severe economic sanctions.
On Wednesday, the European Union froze ties with the central bank of Belarus, an ally of Russia in its Ukrainian invasion, and top banks there.
""If we just take a step back and think about the near term, the headlines about lack of liquidity, how the military situation evolves, that will determine a lot of the near-term trading,"" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.
""But if we think about the long term economics, a very weak rouble certainly makes sense for the foreseeable future.""
The central bank has more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% and the government has rolled out support measures, but Russian assets have been sold heavily and the rouble is now down around 30% against the dollar in Moscow since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
On Tuesday, the central bank said it was offering additional crisis support to financial firms and that banks were banned from selling foreign currency to its citizens for the next six months, a move seen aimed at preserving precious hard currency in the country.
The finance ministry said Russian banks will be allowed to lend to companies controlled by non-residents, which would allow companies wishing to do business in Russia to operate as usual.
Trading in equities on the Moscow Exchange remained closed. Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25.
BMO's Ma said that once the stock market reopens there is a chance that prices will drop further than what their longer-term value will be, but timing that will be very hard.
""It's certainly not something for anyone who is unwilling to take an extreme amount of risk because the reality is that many international investors simply want out and price doesn't really matter,"" said Ma.
Russia's 5-year credit default swaps - a measure of the cost of insuring exposure to the country - soared sharply to a record 2,960 basis points and was recently at 2,939 bps. 
Annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 9.15% in February from 8.73% in January, its highest in seven years, with prices soaring further on a weakening rouble.

Michael Metcalfe, global head of macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets, said in a research note that there were signs prices in Russia had risen sharply since the rouble's slump - more so than in prior currency collapses. 
""If it were sustained in the coming weeks and months, (this rate) could see the Russian annual inflation rate almost double in the coming months,"" Metcalfe wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro gained more than 1% against the dollar on Wednesday as risk appetite returned to financial markets and commodity prices eased from recent peaks that were driven by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
After touching a 22-month low on Monday of $1.0806, the euro was last at $1.1019, up 1.15% on the day, after a report citing unnamed officials said the EU was discussing joint bond issuance to finance energy and defence spending.
Just one month ago, the euro was close to touching $1.15, and its rapid decline to below $1.10 may have been overdone, said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.
""That's an extremely fast and steep move and so I think we're seeing some profit-taking and also some reversal based on that,"" he said.
Against a basket of currencies including the euro, the dollar fell 0.851% to 98.276, after hitting a 22-month peak on Monday. 
Markets also welcomed a pull-back in commodity prices that have contributed to surging inflation and added to uncertainty around economic growth expectations.
Brent crude was down 5.4%, at $121.02 a barrel, after earlier falling to as low as $120.04, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell 5.3%, to $117.14. Both are still up around 40% since Feb. 23 - the day before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine - and have hit their highest since 2008.
Some investors took the view that the U.S. ban on Russian oil may not worsen a supply shock and the head of the International Energy Agency said the agency could further tap oil stocks.
Easing oil prices helped Wall Street's main stock indexes to open sharply higher on Wednesday, with investors snapping up stocks hammered by concerns over Western sanctions on Russia. 
""It's certainly a risk on move today in all the markets,"" said Trevisani.
European currencies such as Poland's zloty and Hungary's forint rose sharply, rebounding from record lows against the euro, also supported by both central banks hiking rates on Tuesday.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday but amid the spectre of stagflation, money markets expect policymakers to delay rate hikes until late in the year. [IRPR]
""European currencies have been under heavy pressure for the past couple of weeks and some of these valuations have begun to look stretched,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX Strategy at Rabobank in London. 
Sterling rose 0.49% against the dollar to $1.31655, Poland's zloty jumped %6.07 against the greenback to 4.3095 and Hungary's forint rose 3.62% to 342.72. 
In the United States, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday requiring the government to assess the risks and benefits of creating a central bank digital dollar, as well as other cryptocurrency issues, the White House said.

Analysts viewed the long-awaited executive order as a stark acknowledgement of the growing importance of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, and their potential consequences for the United States and global financial systems.
Bitcoin rose 9% to $42,260, on track for its biggest gain since Feb. 28, while smaller peer ether added 6.2% to $2,737, also set for its best day this month.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Wednesday, while the euro saw some support ahead of this week’s emergency EU summit as well as the latest European Central Bank policy-setting meeting. 
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 98.983, just below the recently hit 22-month peak at 99.090.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.0922, recovering somewhat from Monday's 22-month low of 1.0806, helped by reports that the European Commission was looking at the potential of a large joint bond issue to finance defense and energy projects in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with an emergency EU summit to be held on Thursday. 
“This follows last year's initiative that included joint debt to fund a 1.8 trillion euro (~$2 trillion) emergency package. The details were still being worked out, but the prospect seemed to be helping support the euro today and narrowing the spreads between core and peripheral bonds,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
That said, the European Central Bank also meets on Thursday, and with the likelihood that the soaring commodity prices will stunt growth in Europe this year, the policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year. 
This contrasts with the likely decision of the Federal Reserve when it meets next week, with Chairman Jerome Powell backing a quarter-point rate increase while telling Congress last week he would move more aggressively later if inflation didn’t abate.
The U.S. moved to ban Russian oil imports late Tuesday, something the majority of its European allies, and Germany in particular, have been unable to do given their greater dependence on Moscow.
“Along with the geographical vicinity and different correlation with risk sentiment, the disorderly rise in energy prices is what is generating a big divergence between the dollar (the U.S. is largely energy-independent) and most European currencies (the region is largely dependent on Russian oil and gas),” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This looks unlikely to change soon.” 
Elsewhere, USD/JPY traded 0.2% higher at 115.84, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.3119, near a 16-month low, while AUD/USD climbed 0.4% to 0.7294, helped by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe stating that an interest rate hike this year is “plausible.”
USD/RUB was indicated 11% higher at 117.3550, in the offshore market before foreign exchange trading resumes in Moscow on Wednesday.
Russia’s rating was downgraded to C by Fitch Ratings late Tuesday, with the rating agency saying that a bond default is “imminent” as a result of measures ushered in since the war in Ukraine."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the euro took a breather. Commodity currencies also fell from recent highs, as investors calculate that sky-high energy, grains, and metals prices could decrease demand in the long run.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.05% to 99.035 by 10:36 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT), just below a 22-month high.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.15% to 115.84. Japan’s GDP grew 1.1% quarter-on-quarter and 4.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.7277, with Australia’s Westpac consumer sentiment contracting 4.2% in March. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.6811.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.3168. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month and 0.9% year-on-year in February 2022. The producer price index grew 8.8% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3114.
The euro steadied in early trade, recovering from a 22-month low of $1.0806 hit on Monday to trade at the $1.0898 mark. News that the European Union was reportedly discussing joint bond issuance also gave the single currency a boost.
Although any issuance could herald stimulus measures and an eventual fiscal union, not many details were provided. Some investors also warned that the euro is unlikely to rise much while the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.
""Our near-term pessimism is driven by a view that investor fears that the war could extend beyond Ukraine's borders will not dissipate quickly,” Standard Chartered global head of G10 FX research Stephen Englander told Reuters.
The euro will fall to $1.06 by the end of the quarter before slowing creeping toward $1.14 by year's end if some kind of agreement to contain fighting is reached but would probably fall below parity if the war were to spread, he added.
Investors now look to the European Central Bank’s latest policy decision, due on Thursday. The possibility of stagflation means that bets on the central bank delaying interest rate hikes until later in 2022 are growing.
The recent move towards commodity currencies as rising export prices boost terms of trade also appears to be slowing down. Increasing raw material costs are also acting as a tax on consumers and are hindering economic growth. The Australian dollar steadied and is about 2% below Monday's four-month high of $0.7440.
""Market participants may switch their view from 'buy Australian dollars because commodity prices are high' to 'sell Australian dollars because very high commodity prices will cause demand destruction,'"" Commonwealth Bank Of Australia strategist Carol Kong told Reuters.
""It is still possible AUD/USD tests $0.7000 before the impact of the war subsides.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The euro took a breather on Wednesday ahead of this week's central bank meeting, while commodity currencies eased from recent peaks as investors reckoned war-driven surges in energy, grains and metals could end up crimping demand in the long run.
The euro was steady in early trade and has recovered to $1.0898 from Monday's 22-month low of $1.0806, helped by a Bloomberg News report which citied unnamed officials and the European Union was discussing joint bond issuance.
Such a move could mean stimulus and a step toward a fiscal union. But details were scant and analysts also said the euro is unlikely to rise much while there is so much worry about the war in Ukraine spreading. Fighting has not abated.
Sterling, which has been sold along with the euro, has barely recovered and was pinned near a 16-month low at $1.3100.
The U.S. dollar index is just below a 22-month peak at 99.090.
""Our near-term pessimism is driven by a view that investor fears that the war could extend beyond the Ukraine's borders will not dissipate quickly,"" said Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)'s global head of G10 FX research, Stephen Englander.
He expects the euro will fall to $1.06 by the end of the quarter before slowing creeping toward $1.14 by year's end if some kind of agreement to contain fighting is reached, but said it would probably fall below parity if the war were to spread.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday with the spectre of stagflation prompting economists to figure that policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.
Enthusiasm for commodity currencies as surging export prices boost terms of trade also appears to be wavering since sky high raw material costs also act as a tax on consumers and a brake on world growth.
The Australian dollar, steady at $0.7274 on Wednesday, is about 2% below Monday's four-month high of $0.7440. The kiwi, at $0.6809, is about 1.7% beneath its Monday top. [AUD/]
""Market participants may switch their view from 'buy Australian dollars because commodity prices are high' to 'sell Australian dollars because very high commodity prices will cause demand destruction,'"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Carol Kong.
""It is still possible AUD/USD tests $0.7000 before the impact of the war subsides.""
Surging oil costs are also dulling the lustre of the yen as a safe haven, since import spending propelled Japan to its largest current account deficit since 2014 in January. The yen touched a three-week low of 115.87 on Wednesday.
Russia's onshore currency market is expected to open for the first time this week at 0700 GMT.
The rouble, along with other Russian assets, has taken a drubbing since Russia launched what it called a ""special military operation"" last month, and fell as low as 160 per dollar in offshore trade this week, last recovering to 130.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The euro on Tuesday climbed from 22-month lows against the U.S. dollar hit the previous session, lifted in part by expectations that the euro zone will increase fiscal spending to help offset the economic effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Investors were also hesitant to sell the euro ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday. The prospect of stagflation has prompted economists to suggest policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.
Europe's single currency, which has been pummeled since the start of the latest geopolitical turmoil, also gained versus other currencies such as the yen, Swiss franc and sterling.
Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the European Union plans as soon as this week to jointly issue bonds on a potentially massive scale to finance energy and defense spending.
Franziska Palmas, markets economist at Capital Economics, said that if confirmed the news would be positive for euro zone assets, but it would not be enough to sustain their recovery.
Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington, believes the euro appears to have found a ""tentative bottom,"" with some investors reluctant to test new lows ahead of the ECB meeting.
""There is a risk that the ECB president may acknowledge euro weakness as among the headwinds facing the bloc's economy. That's been enough to offer the euro at least a momentary reprieve,"" Manimbo added.
In addition, the international oil benchmark Brent crude backed off Monday's 14-year high of just under $140 per barrel, which helped boost euro sentiment. Brent was still up 4.3% on Tuesday at $128.50 per barrel.
The euro regained some ground after five sessions of declines versus the dollar. It was up more than a cent from a trough of $1.0806 on Monday, its lowest since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic gripped Europe.
The single currency was last up 0.5% at $1.0906.
The euro briefly traded at parity with the Swiss franc on Monday for the first time in seven years. It rose 0.9% on Tuesday to 1.0134 francs.
Traders are expecting choppy markets over the next few months, with euro/dollar volatility gauges at their highest since the market chaos of March 2020.
As the euro gained, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six global peers, was flat to slightly lower at 99.15.
That said, the safe-haven dollar remains an in-demand asset despite Tuesday's slight pullback. Since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, the dollar has gained around 3.3% as the crisis has intensified.
Besides the commodities' rally, the war and subsequent Western sanctions have crushed Russian assets, with the rouble falling to a record low of 160 to the dollar in erratic offshore trade on Monday. The rouble on Tuesday though firmed 5.9% versus the greenback, which fell to 127 roubles.

The local market was closed for a public holiday, with currency trading expected to resume on Wednesday.
The rouble has fallen more than 40% against the dollar since the start of the year, with losses sharply accelerating after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, a move that sparked sweeping sanctions from governments around the world.
""The outlook for the rouble is highly uncertain at the moment,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""That said, if sanctions on Russia's energy sector are expanded, it is likely to depreciate further.""
U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, and the barrel of oil hit its highest price this week since mid 2008. 
Curbs on Russia and on its lenders, companies and key individuals, as well as counter measures from Moscow, have made it increasingly difficult for investors to trade Russian assets.
On the EBS trading platform, the rouble was recently trading at 127 per dollar, or up more than 6% on the day. It was indicated as far as 134 on Refinitiv, with volumes down 99% compared to the February daily average.
The U.S. oil ban kept pressure on Russian leader Vladimir Putin to halt his devastating assault on Ukraine, but an effort to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city of Mariupol failed.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Stock trading on the Moscow Exchange was restricted all last week by order of the central bank. The bank said stock market trading will remain largely suspended on Wednesday, keeping only a limited range of operations.
The foreign currency market will reopen at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), forgoing the early morning session. 
Russia will be excluded from all of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s fixed income indexes on March 31, the bank said on Monday, joining rival index providers that excluded Russian securities after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

An investment firm that held some of Russian energy firm Gazprom (MCX:GAZP)'s $1.3 billion bond that matured on Monday said it received full payment in U.S. dollars. Investors had been unsure whether they would be paid after Russia put restrictions on payments to foreigners holding its securities.

TORONTO (Reuters) - As the Russia-Ukraine crisis propels crude oil to its highest level in 14 years, the historic link between the Canadian dollar and energy prices has weakened, leaving the Bank of Canada with one less tool to fight inflation.
The normal tight relationship between the Canadian dollar and oil has typically meant the central bank could rely on a stronger currency to ease inflation pressures brought on by higher energy prices. Gains for the loonie would reduce the cost of Canada's imports.
But not so in the current cycle, with the crisis also hurting the outlook for the global economy, a negative for risk-sensitive currencies like the loonie, and driving demand for the safe-haven U.S. dollar.
""There is a kink in the CAD-oil relationship,"" said Eric Theoret, global macro strategist at Manulife Investment Management. ""You are not getting the currency strength that would dampen inflation.""
The last time oil was above $100 a barrel, in 2014, the Canadian dollar was at 1.09 per U.S. dollar, or nearly 92 U.S. cents. It is currently at about 1.28. 
Graphic: Canadian dollar decouples from oil: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwaarwvo/Canadian%20dollar%20decouples%20from%20oil.png 
Meanwhile, the 3-month rolling correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil has fallen to 0.3 from 0.9 in December, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, moving closer to the zero threshold that would indicate no connection.
""What we've seen over the last month or two has definitely been a quite significant outlier in what has been historically a very steady and pretty consistent relationship,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.
""We would probably be in a situation here where the Bank (of Canada) would not be pushing back against the idea of a stronger Canadian dollar.""
Canada's central bank has pledged to tame inflation, which reached a 30-year high of 5.1% in January. Last Wednesday, it raised its key interest rate for the first time in three years and made clear more hikes are on the way.
Inflation could move even higher over the coming months due to surging commodity prices, economists say. 
Higher energy prices will ultimately benefit the loonie over the coming year, say strategists in a Reuters poll, but due to an improvement in Canada's terms of trade, or the ratio of its export prices to import prices, rather than an expected increase in investment.
Canadian companies are wary of spending aggressively to grow oil production after the pain of 2020's pandemic-induced oil price collapse. Investors are demanding strict capital discipline, while environmental opposition to new fossil fuel projects and the Canadian government's plans to cap carbon emissions are also deterring growth. 

""The era of 'drill, baby drill' is over in America and it's the same kind of discipline in Canada,"" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive, referring to a political slogan of the U.S. Republican Party.
""Oil isn't the driver (of the Canadian dollar) it once was,"" Button said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday while the euro traded marginally above the previous session’s 22-month low as the war in Ukraine threatens the European growth outlook. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded just lower at 99.275, retaining its strength as a safe haven as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensifies.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0863, attempting something of a recovery after almost a week of selling, but remains near to Monday's low of 1.0806, suggesting any support is pretty half-hearted. The euro is down 4% against the dollar since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
“How low could EUR/USD go? Support levels seem to be around the 1.0760/70 area and then the March 2020 lows of 1.0640 - but probably at times like these, big figures of e.g. 1.0500 become more relevant,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
And it’s not only the dollar that the single currency has seen hefty selling against, as it briefly traded at parity with the Swiss franc on Monday for the first time in seven years.
This prompted the Swiss National Bank to state that it is ready to intervene and address the rapidly strengthening franc.
The European Central Bank (ECB) meets on Thursday, but the single currency is unlikely to get support then as the likelihood of slowing growth in the region on the back of the Ukraine conflict and rising commodity prices could prompt the policymakers to delay rate hikes until late in the year.
The ECB is also unlikely to intervene by itself in support of the euro.
“Were things to get out of hand, we would think coordinated G5 intervention to support EUR/USD would be more likely than ECB own account intervention,” added ING. “But that may not occur until closer to parity.”  
The Federal Reserve meets next week, and Chairman Jerome Powell last week backed a quarter-point rate increase while telling Congress he would move more aggressively later if inflation didn’t abate.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY traded 0.1% higher at 115.43, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.3108, near a 16-month low, while AUD/USD dropped 0.4% to 0.7285, handing back some of its recent gains.
USD/RUB was indicated 4.1% lower at 130.00, with the ruble benefiting from the lack of solidity between Western governments on a move to ban Russia’s oil imports.
USD/PLN rose 0.1% to 4.5865 ahead of the latest policy-setting meeting of Poland’s central bank, which is expected to result in interest rates rising 50 basis points to 3.25%.
This move will help to support the zloty, which plunged to a record low against the euro as the fallout from Russia’s war on Ukraine spreads."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, while the euro was stuck near a 22-month low. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to dim Europe’s economic outlook, but a weeks-long rally in commodity currencies showed signs of a pause.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.16% to 99.135 by 10:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 115.44. Japanese data from earlier in the day showed the largest current account deficit since the start of 2014, with the current account at JPR1.189 trillion ($10.33 billion) and the adjusted current account at JPY0.19 trillion in January 2022.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7324, with Australia’s National Australia Bank business confidence index at 13 in February. The NZD/USD pair was steady at 0.6831.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.13% to 6.3126 while the GBP/USD pair edged 0.18% to 1.3125.
The euro remained close to Monday's low of $1.0806, despite efforts to bounce after six straight sessions of selling. The single currency is down 4% on the dollar since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, with the conflict showing no signs of ending. The euro came close to parity on the Swiss franc on Monday, the first time in seven years it has done so.
Little progress has been made over two rounds of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Germany's opposition to a ban on Russian energy imports knocked oil futures from Monday's 14-year peak, but the supply shock will hurt European growth, some investors warned.
""Markets could continue to price the risk of a disruption to Russian energy exports and downgrade the European growth outlook,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Carol Kong told Reuters.
""As such, we expect the euro to remain under pressure. There is a reasonable chance euro/dollar tests the COVID-19 low of $1.0688 this month.""
Investors now await the European Central Bank’s policy decision, due to be handed down on Thursday. The possibility of stagflation prompted economists to figure that the central bank could delay interest rate hikes until late in 2022.
Alongside commodities’ meteoric rally, the conflict in Ukraine and the Western sanctions that followed saw the rouble sliding to a record low of 160 to the dollar in erratic offshore trade on Monday. Other Russian assets also took a hit, although the U.S. dollar remained firm amid concerns that the war would be prolonged, and the economic hit would also spread.
In Asia Pacific, the Australian and New Zealand dollars rose in early trade but were below Monday’s four-month highs.
The New Zealand dollar jumped 4.5% in just over a month as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kicks off a round of interest rate hikes. Energy price pressures could drive back-to-back 50-basis-point hikes in April and May, ANZ Bank analysts said on Tuesday."
159,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:15PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's rouble fell sharply in thin trading on Monday to a fresh record low, with local markets closed for trading until at least Wednesday.
The rouble has lost nearly 50% of its value against the greenback since the start of the year, with losses sharply accelerating since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, a move that sparked sweeping sanctions from various governments across the world.
The rouble bids were indicated as far as 150 to the dollar after closing at 121.037 on Friday, according to Refinitiv data. On the EBS trading platform, the rouble weakened as far as 160 to the dollar, or more than 22%, and was recently traded at 145, down 14.5% on the day.
Bid/ask spreads were between 7 and 15 cents, pointing to an increasingly illiquid market. 
Trading on the MOEX Moscow exchange is scheduled to be closed until Wednesday for a bank holiday. 
The curbs on Russia, its lenders, corporates and key individuals, as well as counter measures from Moscow, have cut Russian assets increasingly out of global financial markets and have made it hard for investors to trade any securities. 
""The future doesn’t look bright for the Russian rouble at all,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote.
""The combination of western sanctions, the rising risk of default and the incentive to divest from rouble-denominated assets will likely further weigh on the currency.""
Stocks last traded on Feb. 25 on Moscow's bourse. An ETF of Russian and Russia-exposed companies traded in the United States was halted on Friday after dropping nearly 80% year-to-date.
Five-year credit default swaps in Russia - reflecting the cost to insure exposure to the country's sovereign debt - soared to a record 2,757 basis points compared to 1,725 basis points on Friday, data from IHS Markit showed.
Trades on Russia's sovereign dollar- and euro-denominated debt have all but ground to a halt, with some issues bid at around 20 cents in the dollar or euro. 
""With Russian prices on the euro bond somewhere around 20, this is going to go on for a long, long time, and nobody wants to be associated with (the rouble),"" said Gabriel Sterne, head of global EM research at Oxford Economics.
""Just sell it and take a loss. You have to interpret the price movements as: there's almost infinite supply and very little demand for these assets at the moment. It's now just a matter of an orderly disposal of Russian assets.""
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""

Rouble implied volatility gauges - a measure of demand for options on the currency rising or falling against the dollar - have stayed near record highs hit last week, with the one-week gauge above 84% and the one-month one above 94%.
The rouble's collapse has also hit trading volumes. Turnover on the Russian currency on EBS fell more than 80% on Friday compared to the end of February.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar rose on Monday, lifted by safe-haven flows, as investors weighed the effects on global economic growth of oil prices that hit 14-year highs after the United States and European allies considered banning Russian crude imports.
The dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against six global peers, was last up 0.33% at 99.24.
The euro was down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.08575 on concerns that higher energy prices will spark stagflation and hammer the European economy as it tries to recover from the pandemic.
""The Russia-Ukraine conflict is continuing to lead to further surges across several commodities, which is threatening growth prospects for the year,"" said Edward Moya, a senior analyst at Oanda.
Brent crude was up 4.1% at $122.97 a barrel, having earlier reached as high as $139.13 - last hit in July 2008 - as the American and European ban on Russian oil imports was being considered, while it also looked less likely that Iranian crude would return swiftly to global markets. [OIL/]
""There are a growing amount of jitters that will probably keep the dollar supported, as you're going to see the U.S. economy is still nicely positioned in the short term because it's not as dependent on Russian energy supplies as Europe is,"" Moya said. 
That will likely benefit the dollar in the short term, Moya added.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, euro/dollar volatility gauges climbed to their highest levels since March 2020. 
The euro, having lost 3% in three days, on Monday held above $1.08, with its about-turn at $1.0806 potentially noteworthy for coming days, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
""Maybe the market will be careful about pushing it further downward ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday,"" Manimbo said.
The ECB will wait until the last months of the year to raise rates, according to economists polled by Reuters poll. 
After flirting with parity to the Swiss franc earlier on Monday, the euro traded up 0.32% at 1.00495 francs. 
Against the dollar, a volatile British pound was last down 0.91% at $1.3108.
The Aussie, which tends to trade with commodity prices, was down 0.56% against the dollar, more than reversing all of an earlier 1% rise. 
The conflict in Ukraine and harsh international sanctions on Moscow have sent Russian assets tumbling, while prices of the country's exports such as precious metals, oil and gas have soared at a time when the global economy was already grappling with inflationary pressures.
Europe is the most vulnerable as it imports as much as 40% of its natural gas from Russia and the single currency has become increasingly correlated with oil prices - the higher oil climbs, the more the euro falls.

""The euro continues to absorb the most pressure of major currencies on the fallout from the war in Ukraine,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.
According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), a sustained $20 oil rise shock would lower real economic growth in the euro area by 0.6% and by 0.3% in the United States. But in a more adverse scenario if Russian gas shipments via Ukraine were curtailed, then euro area GDP could fall by as much as 1% from gas alone.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's central bank on Monday set an exchange rate limit of 230 rupees to the dollar, effectively allowing a currency depreciation it hopes will attract investment and remittances to help ease the worst financial crisis in years.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) had been criticised by economists and analysts for maintaining an unofficial dollar peg since October at 200-203 rupees.
The depreciation is expected to encourage remittances, a major source of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka, which dropped to a 10-year low of $5.49 billion in 2021.
Sri Lanka's foreign reserves dwindled to $2.36 billion at the end of January, but it has to repay about $4 billion in debt including a $1 billion international sovereign bond maturing in July.
""Greater flexibility in the exchange rate will be allowed to the markets with immediate effect. The Central Bank is also of the view that forex transactions would take place at levels which are not more than (Rupees) 230 per US dollar"" the CBSL said in a statement.
Experts said the central bank should have set a higher exchange limit to increase remittances.
""This move could help exporters but it is too little too late for migrant workers who are now used to higher curb rates and are unlikely to shift to bank rates,"" said Umesh Moramudali an economist attached to the University of Colombo.
He said the central bank should have set the rate at about 250-260 if it wanted to bring in more remittances. ""However, if CBSL keep pushing up rates that is likely to increase inflows through official channels.""

CBSL called on the government to incentivize remittances and foreign investments in its latest monetary policy announcement.
In December, CBSL announced a host of measures including giving an additional 10 rupees per dollar as an incentive but this had limited impact with remittances dropping 61.6% in January to $259 million from $675 million a year earlier.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -The Indian rupee fell to a historic low on Monday, while bond yields surged as a sharp rise in global prices of crude oil stirred concern about domestic inflation, strengthening prospects of interest rate hikes by the central bank.
India imports more than two-thirds of its oil needs. High prices are likely to widen the country's trade and current account deficits and boost imported inflation. 
The partially convertible rupee ended at 76.96 against the dollar, just off its record low of 76.97 hit earlier in the session. It closed Friday at 76.16. 
The rupee struck its previous record low of 76.9050 on April 22, 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Brent crude soared to near $130 a barrel, its highest since 2008, as the United States and European allies mulled a Russian oil import ban while delays in the potential return of Iranian crude to global markets fuelled tight supply fears.
The fall in local shares also further added pressure on the rupee as foreign investors continued to dump riskier assets. (BO)
Latest data showed foreign investors had sold $862.56 million worth shares on Thursday, taking the total sales in 2022 to $11.25 billion. 
""Stocks continued to trade in the red and we saw sustained selling by foreign funds. Though RBI was likely selling dollars sporadically, they wouldn't want to come in too heavily against the tide,"" a senior trader at a foreign bank said. 
The Reserve Bank of India typically sells dollars via state-run banks to prevent sharp moves in the rupee. With forex reserves at $631.53 billion by early March, traders feel it has enough firepower to avert a much sharper fall in the currency.
The key concern, however, is whether the RBI will be forced to act to contain inflation by raising interest rates in the aftermath of the Ukraine crisis.
So far, the RBI has reiterated its commitment to reviving economic growth and keeping policy accommodative. 
Last week, economists and analysts said India's trade and current account deficits were likely to widen, putting pressure on the rupee, as global oil prices surge and the domestic economy re-opens from a third wave of the pandemic.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield ended trading at 6.89%, up 8 basis points on the day, its biggest single-session rise since the sell-off on budget day on Feb. 1 when the government announced a sharply higher-than-expected market borrowing.

Investors will closely monitor the global geo-political situation as well as results of the state elections due to be announced on March 10 for further direction. 
""A reversal of the recent losses will be seen only if spot USD/INR pair breaks below 76.50. The pair will have upside targets of 77.30/77.52 levels until support holds,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services wrote in a note.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank repeated on Monday its pledge to intervene on the currency markets to curb a rise in the franc after safe-haven inflows driven by the Ukraine conflict briefly pushed the currency above parity with the euro.
The euro/franc exchange rate fell to 0.9910 in Asia overnight, as investors sought refuge in the Swiss currency. The valuation is the highest level for the franc since January 2015 when the Swiss central bank scrapped its peg to the euro.
""The Swiss franc is currently sought after as a refuge currency, along with the U.S. dollar and the yen,"" the central bank said in a statement.
""The Swiss franc continues to be highly valued,"" it added. ""The SNB remains prepared to intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary.""
The verbal intervention is an unusual move by the central bank, which last gave a separate statement indicating its concerns about the franc's appreciation after Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016.
""While the SNB has been rather relaxed about the appreciation of the Swiss franc in the last months ... a drop below parity could change its attitude because parity is also a psychologically important threshold,"" said UBS economist Alessandro Bee.
The SNB said the increased valuation of the franc, which is a danger for Switzerland's export-dominated economy, also recognised the inflation differentials between Switzerland and other countries.
Swiss consumer price inflation rose to a higher-than-expected 2.2% in February, its highest level since 2008 but well below the 5.8% level in the neighbouring euro zone, Switzerland's biggest export market.
The SNB on Monday said it said it looked at the overall currency situation rather than individual currency pairs.
Sight deposit data, a proxy for the SNB's foreign currency purchases, showed a rise of just 500 million francs last week, indicating a small amount of intervention.
""I expect the SNB to fight this appreciation only moderately – because it cannot change the environment for investors that just seek safety,"" said J. Safra Sarasin economist Karsten Junius.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation"" has introduced uncertainties as the global economy looks to move towards monetary policy normalisation, SNB Governing Board Member Andrea Maechler said in an interview published on Saturday.

Her comments indicated the crisis had delayed SNB plans to retreat from negative interest rates and foreign currency purchases which have been the foundation of its expansive approach.
The central bank gives its next monetary policy update on March 24.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar tracked higher while the euro slumped to a fresh low as soaring crude prices raised fears that the war in Ukraine will result in a stagflationary shock, particularly to countries in Europe. 
At 3:20 AM ET (0820 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% higher at 98.957, just off last week’s 22-month top of 99.220 on the back of strong employment data.
EUR/USD fell 0.5% to 1.0871, after earlier falling to its lowest level since May, and seemingly heading towards its 2020 trough of 1.0636. 
Fight in Ukraine continues to intensify, with Russian troops closing in on Mykolaiv, a city of half a million people near Odessa. 
This has resulted in the United States and Europe looking at bans on Russian crude imports in order to punish the Putin regime, prompting oil prices to leap to highs not seen since 2008.
“The repercussions for energy prices are most severe in Europe due to its energy dependency on imports,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “European households spend a higher proportion of their income on heating/gas/electricity compared to American households. Hence, the economic ramifications will be more pronounced for the European economies than in the U.S.”
This puts the spotlight on the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, as the policymakers will face a complicated picture of rising prices but also a severe threat to future growth.
“The ECB has very hard decisions to make, but to keep its options open, it will likely decide in favor of a faster taper of its net asset purchases,” Nordea added. “The wish to normalize policy is strong within the Governing Council.”
It was not only against the dollar that the euro weakens, the single currency also briefly sank below parity versus the safe-haven Swiss franc for the first time in seven years.
This prompted the Swiss National Bank to state that it was prepared to intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary, the sort of language the Swiss central bank uses when it feels that its currency has strengthened too much, to the detriment of its exports.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY traded 0.2% higher at 115.03, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3208, just above a two-month low, while AUD/USD soared 0.7% to 0.7419, helped by the soaring commodity prices.
USD/CNY traded flat at 6.3179, despite China announcing an economic growth target of around 5.5% this year, sharply lower than last year's 8.1% GDP growth.
USD/RUB rose 12.5% to 135.4900, with the ruble falling to a fresh record low in thin offshore trade with local markets closed for trading.
The ruble has lost more than 40% of its value against the dollar on the back of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the associated Western sanctions."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with the euro falling to a fresh 22-month low against the dollar and hitting multi-year lows on the yen, Swiss franc, and the pound. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine drove up commodity prices and stoked fears of a stagflationary shock that would hit Europe the hardest.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.27% to 98.933 by 11:04 PM ET (4:04 AM GMT). It was near a 22-month peak of 98.925 hit on Friday.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.10% to 114.90.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.62% to 0.7416 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.48% to 0.6893.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.3224. Trade data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 16.3% year-on-year in February 2022, while imports grew 15.5% year-on-year, and the trade balance was $115.95 billion.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3209.
The euro was down as much as 0.6% to $1.0864 earlier in the session, the lowest since May 2020, and was on the way to its 2020 low around $1.0636. It also fell below one Swiss franc, hitting 0.9982 for the first time since the franc quit its euro peg in 2015.
Oil futures, which surged more than 20% last week, climbed 10% as the U.S. and Europe look to ban Russian imports.
""This is very bad news for global growth, particularly Europe, given their dependence on gas from Russia,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.
""All up, it's another big, ugly supply shock on top of lingering COVID-19 impacts, with serious inflationary consequences that give central banks absolutely no room to 'give growth a chance'.""
The conflict in Ukraine intensified over the weekend, with attempts at a ceasefire to allow civilians to evacuate from the city of Mariupol having seemingly failed so far.
The euro fell to a 15-month low of 124.78 yen and hit its lowest since mid-2016 against the pound at 82.23 pence.
In Asia Pacific, the Australian dollar was up 0.3% to a four-month high. Spot prices for Australian coal climbed more than 70% in about a week as buyers seek alternatives to Russian energy, and wheat is also up about 50% since early February. The Australian dollar is also up more than 10% against the euro in around a month. The New Zealand dollar is up to a seven-week high, although it could give up those gains if the geopolitical situation deteriorates and the war in Ukraine drags on.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank will hand down its policy decision later in the week, with the central bank expected to wait until the last months of 2022 to hike its interest rates, according to a Reuters poll. The U.S. will also release its consumer price index later in the week."

Russia's credit rating was cut deeper into junk by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), following similar moves from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, as international sanctions ramped up the chances of a default. Russian forces in Ukraine sparked worldwide alarm as they seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant.
Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Feb. 24 start of the Russian invasion.
The rouble ended the week at 105 per dollar from 83 last Friday in Moscow, though it strengthened 1% on the session from its Thursday close. Against the euro, it closed just below 119 from 93 last week. 
It hit a record low against the dollar on Thursday, and the euro on Friday.
On the EBS platform, the rouble closed down 12.9% on the day against the dollar at 124, for a decline of 32% this week alone, the most for any week on records back to 2007. The bid-ask spread was very wide throughout the day in what traders called a sign of evaporating liquidity. 
Dmitry Polevoy, investment director at Locko Invest, cautioned that the sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine invasion - which Moscow says is not designed to occupy territory - would lead to an economic shock of a magnitude not seen in a long time.
""Russian assets are being destroyed in value,"" said Cristian Maggio, head of portfolio strategy at TD Securities.
Russia five-year credit defaults swaps - a measure of the cost of insuring exposure to its debt - stood at 1,565 basis points (bps), up from Thursday's 1,412 bps close but still some way away from the record close of 1,973 on Monday, data from IHS Markit showed.
Moscow stock trading remained closed and bonds showed wide bid-ask spreads in little to no volume, as they did for most of the week.
On Friday, the Russian central bank lowered the commission on foreign exchange purchases by individuals via brokers to 12% from 30%. Analysts said an earlier move to hike the commission to 30% for purchases of currencies like the dollar, euro and British pound had led to distortions like a surge in demand for other currencies like the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen.
In a move to try to stabilise wildly fluctuating markets, the Moscow Exchange imposed a ban on short selling of euro currency and stock instruments.
Citing a deterioration in borrowing conditions, the finance ministry paused issuance of OFZ treasury bonds for households. There were roughly 39 billion roubles ($343.5 million) of the retail investments outstanding as of Jan. 1.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long positioning in the U.S. dollar dropped in the latest week to the lowest level since mid-August 2021, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position fell to $5.12 billion for the week ended March 1, from $5.80 billion the previous week. U.S. dollar net long positioning fell for a seventh consecutive week.
The U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, as well as Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning, which includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long position of $3.84 billion this week, from $5.05 billion in the prior week.
""Data released today showed a decline in U.S. dollar bullish sentiment despite elevated market anxiety owing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" wrote Scotiabank in a research note after the release of the CFTC data.
Speculators also increased net long positioning on the euro to 64,939 contracts, the largest since July 2021.
Scotia, however, said positive drivers are limited for the euro. That should see investors trim net bullish positions on next week's data ""particularly ahead of a dovish ECB (European Central Bank) decision on Thursday given the risks posed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""
In the wake of Russia's attack and the consequent financial sanctions on the country, net longs on the Russian rouble were slashed to 9,674 contracts, the lowest since late January.
In cyptocurrencies, speculators turned net long on bitcoin futures, with 80 contracts, for the first time since the week of Feb. 1, CFTC data showed.
It has been a roller-coaster ride for bitcoin over the last couple of months. Like most risk assets, bitcoin has struggled amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy at its meeting later this month.
So far this year, bitcoin has fallen 14% versus the dollar. It was last down 7.2% at $39,411.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro fell against major currencies and the U.S. dollar rallied on Friday as worries increased over the impact of the escalating Ukraine-Russia conflict, especially on Europe's growth outlook.
The euro fell below $1.10 against the dollar, hitting its weakest level since May 2020. It was last down 1.3% at $1.0923 in its biggest daily percentage decline since March 2020. The European single currency also hit a fresh seven-year low versus the safe-haven Swiss franc. 
Russian invasion forces seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant on Friday. A blaze in a training building was extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe, while combat raged elsewhere in Ukraine in the second week of the assault launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Against the Swiss franc, the euro was last down 1.2% at 1.0025 francs, close to parity, a level investors are watching closely in the event that it prompts intervention from the Swiss National Bank to weaken its currency. The euro also sank against sterling, hitting its lowest level since June 2016. Strategists worry that surging energy and gas prices will hit Europe's economic growth prospects.
Investors flocked to the U.S. dollar and other safe-haven currencies. The U.S. dollar index initially pared gains but then rallied further following data Friday that showed U.S. job growth surged in February. The index also rose 2% on the week, the largest weekly percentage gain since April 2020.
Employers in the United States added 678,000 jobs in February, more than economists' expectations of a gain of 400,000. Average hourly earnings were unchanged, however, compared with an expected 0.5% gain.
The index was last up 0.9% at 98.565, reaching its highest since May 2020, while the dollar was down 0.5% against the Japanese yen
""The most compelling story here is the flight to safety, which we've seen coming in ebbs and flows. It picked up overnight with the fire"" in Ukraine, said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco. ""That created a pop up in U.S. dollar across the board. 
""The big losses have really been focused on European currencies in particular,"" he said, noting that economists could be revising lower their European growth forecasts. 
Amid the crisis, the U.S. dollar has been ""the currency of choice,"" he said.
Also supporting the dollar, investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its March 15-16 meeting for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in testimony before Congress this week reiterated that he supports a 25-basis-point hike this month.
In addition, the Czech National Bank said on Friday it was intervening in the market to stem the depreciation of the crown. Poland's central bank intervened this week, while Hungary delivered its most aggressive rate hike since 2008.
The rouble ended the week down more than 20% against the dollar and euro in Moscow trading on Friday. The rouble ended the week at 115 per dollar from 83 last Friday in Moscow, though it strengthened 1% on the session from its Thursday close. Against the euro, it closed just below 119 from 93 last week.
Commodity-linked currencies mostly extended recent gains. The Australian dollar was up 0.6% against the U.S. dollar, while the New Zealand dollar was up 0.9% against the U.S. dollar. But the U.S. dollar was up 0.4% against the Canadian dollar.
""Commodity currencies generally are doing very well, but it's intersting that North American commodity currencies are softer than others,"" Sahota said.

The Polish currency has been under pressure since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, prompting the central bank to sell foreign currencies for zlotys. The last intervention was conducted on Friday, after the zloty fell to its lowest level since 2009.
""We know how to defend the zloty and there is no fear that the zloty will be a weak currency in the long run,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told private TV broadcaster Polsat News. 
He added that the government is working on measures that would reduce the negative impact on the economy due to the conflict in Ukraine. 
""It is time for an anti-Putin shield and we will be working on such a shield in the near future,"" he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""It will concern all those elements of economic life that suffer from war, such as economic growth, currency, inflation, interest rates. ... We are preparing such an anti-Putin shield,"" he added without giving further details. 

In a podcast also published on Friday Morawiecki called again for imposing more sanctions on Moscow. 
""With each passing day that Putin wages this war, the sanctions package should expand,"" he said.

BUDAPEST/WARSAW (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine is putting pressure on central banks along the European Union's eastern flank to prop up their weakening currencies, forcing Czech and Polish rate-setters into market interventions and Hungary into prolonged rate hikes.
The market sell-off in the wake of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 and a looming energy price shock in Europe due to a surge in global oil and gas prices compound already strong underlying price pressures in the region, and the currencies' sharp weakening could fuel additional inflation.
Economists say against this backdrop, the region's central banks - which have been fighting inflation with rate hikes since June 2021 - have little choice now but to intervene as needed and tighten policy further even as the growth outlook is set to deteriorate as a result of the military conflict.
""The implications of the conflict for CEE-4 monetary policy are firmly hawkish, in our view,"" economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
""While the crisis is likely to have a dampening effect on growth, the combination of higher commodity prices and FX depreciation is significantly inflationary."" 
""Moreover, this pro-inflationary shock is occurring at a time when CEE-4 central banks have been trying to tighten financial conditions to bring exceptionally high inflation rates under control. The recent depreciation of CEE-4 exchange rates is making this task more difficult.""
Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for peak official rates by 50 bps to 5.5% in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania.
On Friday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) intervened in the market against excessive volatility and crown depreciation, its first such move since abandoning a cap on the Czech currency in 2017, lifting the unit from 10-month-lows.
The CNB, which said ""it is active on the foreign exchange market and is conducting operations to mitigate excessive fluctuations and depreciation of the crown"", followed the Polish central bank in intervening on Friday.
The Czech central bank has already raised rates by 425 basis points since last June to bring its rate to a 20-year high of 4.5% and analysts see chances the bank will raise rates by up to 50 basis points at its next meeting in late March.
The National Bank of Poland also stepped in to prop up its currency by selling foreign currency for zlotys, while the National Bank of Hungary delivered its biggest rate increase since late-2008 to rein in the forint from successive all-time-lows.
Despite those moves, all three currencies, which started the year on a strong footing, have remained in the red for the year, with the zloty trading at 13-year-lows. The forint plumbed record lows this week, falling to 385.97 versus the euro by Friday afternoon from 372 on Monday. 
DOUBLE-DIGIT INFLATION
Central banks cannot do anything other than remain hawkish in the near term, economists at Wood and Co. said in a note, projecting a 2 percentage point drop in 2022 economic growth compared to their previous baseline due to the inflation shock.
""There is a high risk of double-digit inflation this year, moderating, but staying two-to-three times the central banks' targets in 2023E,"" they said.
Economists say rising Romanian swap yields also signal central bank intervention to keep the leu stable. 
The central bank has denied comment but it has a long track record of FX interventions to stem large currency volatility.
The National Bank of Poland meets next Tuesday when it is expected to raise its key rate by 50 bps to 3.25%.
The National Bank of Hungary holds a non-rate setting meeting on Tuesday, which some economists expect to turn into a rate-setting meeting after the bank exhausted its room for manoeuvre with Thursday's massive hike.
The bank raised its one-week deposit rate to 5.35%, just 5 bps shy of the top of its interest rate corridor.

Economists at UniCredit said the NBH could also end up having to intervene this year if government price caps to keep a lid on inflation, which rose to a near 15-year-high in January, are removed after an April general election.
""We believe that rate hikes cannot strengthen the currency on their own. If EUR/HUF remains close to 380 for longer, the FX pass-through could exceed 1pp,"" UniCredit said. The NBH has declined comment on direct market interventions.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher while the euro headed for its worst week in nine months as the intensifying war in Ukraine prompted safe haven flows as well as a hit to European growth expectations. 
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% higher at 98.055.
EUR/USD fell 0.5% to 1.1012, just above its lowest level since May 2020. The single currency has lost almost 2% against the U.S. currency this week, which would be its worst week since June 2021.
The catalyst to the latest forex moves was an attack by Russian troops on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, as Moscow tightens its grip on its southern neighbor.
Energy prices have soared during this conflict as Western sanctions on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine have raised fears of severe energy shortages, mainly in Europe, given Russia’s importance in supplying the region with oil and gas. 
Russia taking control of this nuclear power station, or rendering it inactive, can only add to that narrative, to the detriment of future European economic growth.
""This war will be devastating for Ukraine. As for Russia, the short and longer-term implications will definitely hurt the economy. But EU countries will also be among those which will be hit the most by these sanctions,"" said analysts at ING, in a note.
Also adding support to the dollar was the confirmation by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, on the second day of his semi-annual testimony to Congress, that he would support a 25 basis point hike at the central bank’s meeting later this month in order to combat soaring inflation.
The main economic data release Friday will be the U.S. monthly employment report, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to show another month of strong job growth, providing the Fed with room to lift interest rates.
While inflation is also an issue in Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatens to derail the European economic recovery from the pandemic and delay even further the European Central Bank’s slow progress toward policy normalization.
“The war's impact on eurozone growth could be anywhere in the 0.3%-1.0% region and the ECB will be treading very carefully when it comes to tightening policy,” ING added.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY traded flat at 115.47, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3325 and AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7351, with the Australian dollar helped by soaring commodity prices."

175,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 01:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- What seemed almost impossible a few months ago, is now growing into an appreciable risk: the euro may sink to parity with the dollar this year.
That’s what strategists are warning as the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatens to derail the European economic recovery from the pandemic and delay even further the European Central Bank’s glacial progress toward policy normalization.
The euro has been one of the worst performers among global currencies during the early stages of the Ukraine war, sliding 3.7% against the dollar over the past month to as low as $1.1010 on Friday. Traders have sold the shared currency as the welter of sanctions placed on Russia look to hurt the economies of the European nations most interlinked with Moscow.
“Right now the euro is the most liquid short available for investors,” said Stephen Miller, an investment consultant at GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Corp. in Sydney. “The consequences of this conflict are going to last for a long, long time and it’s not unimaginable that we see euro test parity with the dollar over a 12-to-18-month horizon.” 
The probability that the euro will drop below parity with the greenback this year has climbed to 9.6%, according to Bloomberg’s FX Rate Forecast Model. That compares with odds of just 2.4% a month ago, when most observers still saw the prospect of a full-blown war in Ukraine as unlikely.
The common currency took another leg lower Friday after Ukrainian officials said Russian troops had shelled Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, located in the eastern part of their country. That sent the currency down to the cusp of the $1.10 level that it last touched in May 2020.
Adding to the euro’s downdraft is the difference between the dovish ECB and hawkish Federal Reserve, which is set to commence a cycle of raising interest rates at its March meeting.
“The war in Ukraine and the divergent monetary policy path between the EU and the Fed are seriously undermining the euro,” said Qi Gao, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore. “If this war drags on, there is a serious risk the euro will approach parity against the dollar.”
Traders are currently focusing on $1.10 -- to see how long that support level will hold out and prevent further declines.
“The longevity in this conflict will be a challenge for broader Europe and the weakness of the euro tends to be a natural play linked to this,” said George Boubouras, head of research at hedge fund K2 Asset Management in Melbourne. “I continue to see more pressure on the euro from here.”

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) -The ballooning euro cost of oil and gas to record highs as war rages in Ukraine has prompted markets to murmur about the chances of a rare, even if unlikely, ECB intervention to bolster the euro against the dollar.
At first glance, it would be odd for the European Central Bank to opt for euro buying over interest rate rises to cap soaring inflation. While both effectively tighten monetary policy, the ECB has been reluctant to signal any rates move until the second half of the year at the earliest and will be careful about the economic hit as much as the inflation spur.
And while the euro has slumped against the dollar this week, exaggerating the cost of dollar-priced commodities, it's stable against a broad trade-weighted basket of currencies - still less than 5% from record highs.
There have been few signs of disorderly movements, and it has been more than 20 years since a direct euro-targeted intervention on the markets.
But in times of war and crisis, nothing can be ruled out.
The surge in commodity prices since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, particularly oil and natural gas, is of such a magnitude that further euro depreciation could spin an already toxic inflationary vortex out of control.
At least, that's the warning from George Saravelos, head of global currency strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in a note headlined: ""The ECB should intervene in EUR/USD."" To be clear, he says this remains unlikely and that the ECB can support the euro in other ways, like interest rate hikes or verbal intervention.
But he argues that surging energy prices are now the single biggest threat to the euro zone economy, which could unleash ""a vicious inflationary spiral"" that infects broader financial conditions.
Oil in euro terms is its most expensive ever. On Thursday it nudged 108 euros a barrel, up almost 25% in a week and 50% this year. Natural gas prices have more than doubled since mid-February and are up over 800% in the past 12 months.
""If financial conditions get disorderly, there is precedent for coordinated FX intervention from the G7,"" Saravelos says, pointing to the G7's action in 2011 to weaken the Japanese yen after the Japanese earthquake, tsunami, and Fukushima nuclear disaster in March that year.
That was the last time the ECB waded into the FX market. Before that, you have to go back to 2000 when it conducted seven bouts of euro-buying intervention worth 10 billion euros, as the fledgling currency lost almost 30% of its launch value.
Clearly, FX intervention is not something the ECB takes lightly. Since Russia invaded Ukraine the euro has weakened 2% against the dollar to $1.1050 but its trade-weighted value remains stable and strong.
FORGET IT
A weaker euro may yet pose a headache for the ECB - annual inflation is at a record high 5.8% and likely to rise further - but that seems some way off. As former ECB Vice-President Vitor Constancio points out, the exchange rate is generally not an objective of monetary policy because it is very difficult to reliably identify its drivers.
Constancio also notes that unilateral intervention is rarely effective. In that context, it is difficult to imagine the U.S. Federal Reserve getting on board a policy to weaken the dollar just when it will almost certainly be raising interest rates.
""Right now, the euro is hovering around $1.11, and there is no need or the possibility of organizing a multilateral intervention. It is better, therefore, to forget the issue,"" he said.
There is a building consensus, however, that the euro is heading lower. Robin Brooks, chief economist at Washington-based Institute of International Finance, reckons parity with the dollar - a 10% depreciation from current levels - could come within three months.
ECB policymakers' consistent position since the euro's launch in 1999 has been that the central bank will intervene in the currency market if it sees disorderly movements or unwarranted volatility.
That it has acted so infrequently suggests market conditions would have to deteriorate significantly for it to do so again. Implied euro/dollar volatility is spiking up toward 10%, but from a low base. It is also well below previous peaks, levels which did not trigger intervention.
But even if the euro soon trades at parity with the dollar, as the IIF's Brooks predicts, market volatility may not matter to ECB policymakers if they are facing down an oncoming recession.

""The picture in the euro zone has turned on a dime and the whole notion of second-round inflation effects is just fanciful now. ECB intervention to support the euro is counterintuitive. An effective tightening of policy makes no sense,"" Brooks said.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.16% to 97.950 by 10:36 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.09% to 115.36. Japanese data released earlier in the day showed that the jobs/applications ratio was 1.2 and the unemployment rate was 2.8%, in January 2022.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7335, with Australian retail sales growing 1.8%. Higher commodity prices due to the Russian invasion have helped the riskier Australian dollar to climb steadily over the past few weeks.
The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.6805.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3204 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3343.
In a move that deepens the crisis in Ukraine, Russian troops shelled the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine earlier in the day. Russia also continued to surround and attack Ukrainian cities on the eighth day of its invasion, which began on Feb. 24. These include the eastern port city of Mariupol, which has come under heavy bombardment.
The largest plant of its kind in Europe was reportedly on fire, which gave the Australian dollar a boost. The news sent the euro tumbling a further 0.48% to $1.1009, its lowest since May 2020. The single currency has lost 1.84% in the week to date, its worst week since June 2021. The dollar also fell against the safe-haven yen but gained against other currencies.
""This war will be devastating for Ukraine. As for Russia, the short and longer-term implications will definitely hurt the economy. But European Union countries will also be among those which will be hit the most by these sanctions,"" ING analysts told Reuters.
The effects of surging energy and gas prices could undermine the industrial and private consumption rebound that had been expected following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and was also likely to slow European Central Bank policy normalization. ""At next week's ECB meeting, any hints of rate hikes are out of the question,"" they added.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to hike interest rates for the first time since COVID-19 began when it hands down its policy decision on Mar. 15. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in his second day of testimony before Congress that he would back an initial quarter percentage point hike in the interest rate."

BENGALURU/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Currencies are in for a bumpy ride with already heightened volatility expected to increase over the next three months in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to a Reuters poll of analysts who forecast more pain for the battered rouble.
Volatility spiked on Wednesday to levels not seen since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
That trend is expected to continue in the near term, with over 90% of respondents to an additional question in the Feb. 28-March 3 poll of currency strategists expecting volatility to either increase or increase significantly in the coming three months.
""It will be a higher volatility period just because the issues under discussion haven't been under discussion in a generation and in some places in a lifetime,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). 
Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, money has been siphoned away from riskier assets into safer havens, including the dollar, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, as well as currencies linked to commodity markets.
While the yen and franc were expected to be in demand in the short term they were forecast to weaken marginally against the greenback over the 12-month horizon as neither currency carries an interest rate edge.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to begin raising rates at its meeting this month from near-zero, delivering at least 125 basis points of tightening by year-end, according to a separate Reuters poll. [ECILT/US]
""The traditional safe havens...are doing OK but not brilliant when under tensions, and underperforming badly when tensions ease because, in a way, they have nothing to offer. They don't have any rates,"" said Englander.
INVASION'S WIDER FX IMPLICATIONS UNCLEAR
Median forecasts of over 60 respondents showed little change in analysts' expectations compared with the February poll, suggesting many forecasters have not yet worked out the wider FX market implications of armed conflict in Europe. 
""We have a very, very wide range of geopolitical outcomes here, which the market is not pricing for correctly,"" said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank.
""The risks in play here in the background transcend anything to do with where the euro/dollar is trading.""
So far, analysts expect the euro, which hit a 21-month low on Wednesday, to recoup its 2.5% losses for the year and gain more than 1.0% over the next 12 months.
The yen and the franc are also forecast to trade slightly lower in a year, and commodity currencies to outshine them.
The Aussie dollar and Kiwi dollar are expected to gain over 2.3% and 6.0%, respectively, and the Canadian dollar over 2.5%.
The Russian rouble hit a record low on Thursday, shedding over a third of its value this year, as stinging Western sanctions pummeled Russia's financial system.
Asked how low the rouble would fall to this month, 11 strategists returned a median of 125/$. Forecasts ranged from 120-150/$.
Russia's neighbour Turkey, where President Tayyip Erdogan has been urging the central bank to cut interest rates to fight inflation now running at 54%, has been battered by a currency crisis that saw the lira lose nearly half its value last year.

The lira was forecast to plunge another 20% in the next 12 months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro extended recent declines and hit its lowest since 2016 against sterling on Thursday as investors worried about the impact of rising oil prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the U.S. dollar index rose as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that he supports a 25-basis-point hike this month.
Powell repeated the comments during his second day of testimony before Congress. The dollar also was supported by weekly U.S. jobless claim data, which suggested the labor market was gaining steam, a day ahead of Friday's key February U.S. jobs report. 
Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to their lowest level this year last week. Economists are anticipating another month of solid job growth in Friday's jobs report.
The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.4% and hit its highest since June 2020, while the dollar was down slightly against the yen.
""The dollar is in a significant groove right now, benefiting from safe-haven flows and the solid shape of the U.S. economy,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""Certainly the data this week has been really bullish ... so if we see strong job growth coupled with oil exacerbating inflation, we think that would keep big Fed rate hikes in the conversation,"" he said.
In other U.S. data, new orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in January, pointing to continued strength in manufacturing.
Oil eased after hitting prices not seen in roughly a decade. Sellers jumped on hopes the United States and Iran will agree soon on a nuclear deal that could add barrels to a tight global market. [O/R]
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on the need to set up humanitarian corridors and a possible ceasefire around them for fleeing civilians, both sides said after talks on Thursday, while Russian invasion forces surrounded and bombarded Ukrainian cities as the conflict entered its second week.
""The Ukraine crisis has really lit a fire under oil, and we're showing how that's really becoming a source of significant weakness for the euro and a major source of strength for commodity currencies,"" Manimbo said.
The euro was down 0.5% at $1.1060 and again reached its lowest since May 2020. It is headed for its fourth straight weekly fall against the U.S. dollar. Against sterling, the euro hit its lowest since July 2016.
Commodity-linked currencies mostly rose. The Australian dollar was up 0.3% against the U.S. dollar.
The Russian rouble was flat by the end the day on the Moscow exchange at 106.01 after hitting an all-time low of 118.35 in thin, volatile trade. The Russian central bank imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges - a move brokers said appeared designed to curb demand for dollars.
The U.S. dollar was last up about 12% against the rouble.

180,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 04:25PM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble slumped to new record lows against the dollar on Thursday though it closed the Moscow session little changed, after Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Russia's sovereign debt to ""junk"" status, with steps by the central bank and finance ministry failing to halt its slide.
Russia's financial markets have been thrown into turmoil by sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. The stock market remains closed and trading volume on its sovereign debt has vanished.
The rouble ended at 106.01 per dollar in Moscow from Wednesday's 106.02 close, after hitting an intraday record low of 118.35, down over 10% on the day.
Against the euro, it closed down another 1.9% at 117.60 after weakening past 125 for the first time ever during the session.
In foreign markets, the rouble was recently trading at 110 per dollar, down 9.1% on the day, with bids in other platforms close to 117 per dollar.
""You know trading is thin when the Bank of England and European Central Bank stop publishing quotes on the rouble exchange rate,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for multi-asset solutions at Allspring Global Investments.
""The bid-ask spread is a measure of liquidity and you could drive a truck through that spread. The longer the situation plays out, the more economic damage will be done to the Russian economy and sellers of roubles will get more and more desperate while potential buyers get more and more hesitant to hold the currency.""
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed in response have led to dire warnings about the Russian economy, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicting a 35% contraction in the second quarter. 
The Russian central bank imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges - a move brokers said appeared designed to curb demand for dollars - but there was little immediate impact.
The central bank on Thursday said it would not reveal the change in its gold and forex reserves, which are frozen by Western sanctions, through the next three months.
The finance ministry said it was halting purchases of foreign currency and gold this year as part of a suspension of parts of its fiscal rule - a move also aimed at easing pressure on the rouble.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. 
Since Russian troops entered Ukraine on Feb. 24 the rouble is down close to 30% against the dollar, and analysts say it will probably remain highly volatile. 
The government has ordered Russian exporters to convert 80% of their foreign exchange revenues into roubles in another attempt to buttress the local currency, but people are still queuing up at banks to buy dollars as the rouble slumps. 
Russia's five-year credit default swaps, which investors use to hedge against risk, fell to 1,250 basis points on Thursday from their closing level of 1,321 on Wednesday, but rouble implied volatility gauges rose to fresh record highs.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) noted that Russian financial conditions had tightened significantly. https://tmsnrt.rs/3C9UMcI
TRAPPED MONEY
""There's huge uncertainty around ongoing events, and there's going to be a lot of volatility, volumes will be a lot lower, liquidity will be incredibly poor,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING. ""There's a lot of trapped foreign money in Russia at the moment.""
On Thursday, Russia's National Settlement Depository said coupon payouts on Russia's OFZ government bonds which were due on Wednesday had only been made to local holders, citing a central bank order barring payments to foreigners.
Moscow is blocking foreign investors, who hold tens of billions of dollars worth of Russian stocks and bonds, from exiting those holdings. It has temporarily barred Russian companies from paying dividends to overseas shareholders, without saying how long the curbs will last.
Trading on the Moscow Exchange's stock section remained largely closed on Thursday, a fourth day of restrictions ordered by the central bank. 
Overnight, Fitch said U.S. and European Union sanctions prohibiting any transactions with the Bank of Russia would have a ""much larger impact on Russia's credit fundamentals than any previous sanctions."" 
Moody's said the severity of the sanctions ""have gone beyond Moody's initial expectations and will have material credit implications.""

S&P lowered Russia's rating to sub-investment grade last week.
On Wednesday, index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI said they would remove Russian equities from all their indexes, after a top MSCI executive earlier this week called Russia's stock market ""uninvestable.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's finance ministry said on Thursday that it was halting purchases of foreign currency and gold for this year as part of a suspension of parts of its fiscal rule relating to the use of extra oil and gas revenues.
Under a rule adopted in 2017, Russia buys foreign currency when oil prices are high and sells when prices go below $44 per barrel, shielding the rouble from oil price swings.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained strong, while the euro traded near a 21-month low, with the war in Ukraine likely to weigh on European growth while the Federal Reserve lines up interest rate hikes. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 97.525.
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1097, just above its overnight low of 1.1058, the weakest since May 2020, and down 1.5% for the week so far.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.72, GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3406 and AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7319, climbing to a new seven-week high with the Australian economy seen benefiting as prices for its commodity exports soar.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated on the first day of his two-day testimony to Congress that he was still comfortable with supporting an interest rate increase of 25 basis points at the central bank’s next meeting later this month, prioritizing the fight against inflation over the risks from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
While his remarks effectively take a half-point hike off the table when the central bank meets in the middle of March, this is still likely to put the Fed several months ahead of the European Central Bank even before the likely impact of the Ukraine conflict is accounted for.
“The macro dent from Putin's war will clearly cost Europe far more heavily than the U.S.,” analysts at ING said, in a note. “The relative insulation of the US economy is allowing the Fed to remain in hawkish mood and probably have the most cause of any to stick to tightening plans.” 
Eurozone inflation soared to another record high in February, climbing to 5.8% on an annual basis from 5.1% the previous month, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.
These figures illustrated the dilemma for the European Central Bank, as fears are rising that the Ukraine war will stifle growth in the region but fuel even higher inflation due to supply disruptions, creating the dreaded stagflation. 
That said, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane said late Wednesday that the central bank is closely monitoring the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine and will do whatever’s necessary to support the continent’s rebound.
Elsewhere, the ruble is continuing to slump as Russian citizens try to ditch the currency, prompting the country's central bank to impose a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, Reuters reported, citing a letter from the regulator. 
USD/RUB traded 3.8% higher at 110.0261, near a new record high.
Finally, USD/CAD fell 0.1% to 1.2614, after the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 0.5% from a record-low 0.25% on Wednesday, hiking for the first time since October 2018, and indicated it would need to go higher to tackle inflation."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia. The euro was near a 21-month low over worries that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will hurt Europe’s economy, while commodity currencies were at multi-week highs as export prices surged.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.14% to 97.547 by 10:35 PM ET (3:35 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 115.65.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7286 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.23% to 0.6768.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.3181. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin services purchasing manufacturers index for February was 50.2.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 1.3389.
The euro managed to recover to $1.1111 in early Asian trading from its overnight low of $1.1058, the lowest since May 2020. However, it is down 1.4% for the week to date and is set for a fourth consecutive weekly loss against the dollar.
The Australian dollar, on the other hand, touched a seven-week high on Wednesday, remaining near that mark on Thursday as prices for Australian exports such as coal, gas, and grains climb. The euro is down nine sessions in a row to a four-year low of A$1.5218 against the Australian dollar.
""In the current crisis, we view the euro's status as vulnerable,"" Jane Foley, a senior FX strategist at Rabobank which is reviewing its $1.11 target on the downside, told Reuters.
""On a corporate level, there is a web of complex relationships between the European Union and Russian firms, particularly in the energy sector. Energy prices have pushed higher, as have those for many agricultural products. The war in Ukraine thus suggests higher for longer inflation and the potential of slower economic growth,” she added.
Meanwhile, Europe’s consumer price index (CPI) hit a record 5.8% year-on-year in February 2022, according to data released on Wednesday. The European Central Bank will also release the minutes from its February meeting later in the day.
Across the Atlantic, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the central bank would begin ""carefully"" hiking interest rates in March but was ready to move more aggressively if needed. The comments were widely in line with investor expectations.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, with Kharkiv, the latter’s second-largest city, suffering heavy bombardment on Wednesday. Russian forces have also reportedly captured the Black Sea port of Kherson.
A total of 141 United Nations members passed a resolution condemning the invasion. Western sanctions have also impacted the Russian rouble and other assets. The Russian currency hit a record low of 100 per dollar in Moscow on Wednesday, before trading a little firmer at 97.999 to the dollar in interbank trade outside Russia.
Other Eastern European currencies have also taken a hit, with the Hungarian forint hitting record lows on the dollar and the euro overnight and the Polish zloty falling to a two-decade low."
185,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 05:21PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) -The rouble touched a record low of 110 to the dollar in Moscow on Wednesday and crawled back near 100 in other trading platforms, though it continued under pressure as Russia's financial system teetered under the weight of Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian stock market remained closed and trading on bonds showed wide bid-ask spreads and little-to-no volume.
The rouble fell 4.5% to 106.02 against the dollar in Moscow trade, earlier hitting 110.0, a record low. It has lost 30% of its value against the dollar since the start of the year. Against the euro, it shed 2.5% on Wednesday to finish the day at 115.40.
But trading outside of Russia saw the currency rebound to end the day up 6% to 100 on the EBS platform and 7.6% at 97.6 elsewhere.
The currency is still over 20% weaker than where it traded at during the first half of February.
On the EBS platform, the rouble has this week had the three widest daily ranges since 2010, with Monday the widest range on record.
""Who gosh-darn knows what's going to happen tomorrow,"" said Colin Stewart, head of Americas at Quant Insight in New York.
""It's just too volatile.""
Russia has responded to the currency weakness by more than doubling its benchmark interest rate to 20% and telling companies to convert 80% of their foreign currency revenues on the domestic market as the central bank, which is now under Western sanctions, has stopped foreign exchange interventions.
The weak rouble will hit living standards in Russia and fan already high inflation, while Western sanctions are expected to create shortages of essential goods and services such as cars or flights.
Many international companies have announced plans to exit Russia, while the country's credit ratings are coming under pressure as a result of the crisis.
Credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said it was reviewing Russia's rating for a downgrade, a move that ""reflects the negative credit implications for Russia's credit profile from the additional and more severe sanctions being imposed.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said about $4.2 billion in Russian debt is at risk of being kicked out of investment-grade bond indexes.
Meanwhile, Scope Ratings said capital controls ""raise significant questions surrounding the Russian state's willingness to service its debt owed to foreign residents"" a day after cutting its Russia rating to junk status.
The measures, Scope added, make Russia ""more vulnerable to banking and liquidity crises.""
In a separate note, JPMorgan said there was a deep recession in the making for Russia and the bank was reassessing its regional macro forecasts. 
""The most recent measures targeting the CBR have completely changed the picture,"" JPMorgan said. 
""Russia's large current account surplus could have accommodated large capital outflows, but with accompanying CBR and SWIFT sanctions, on top of the existing restrictions, it is likely that Russia's export earnings will be disrupted, and capital outflows will likely be immediate.""
Several Russian banks have been barred from the SWIFT global financial network that facilitates transfers between banks. 
As households and businesses in Russia have rushed to convert the falling rouble into foreign currency, banks raised rates for foreign currency deposits to attract those flows.
Russia's largest lender Sberbank is offering to pay 4% on deposits of up to $1,000, while the largest private lender Alfa Bank is offering 8% on three-month dollar deposits. For rouble deposits, Sberbank offers a 20% annual return.
Sberbank said on Wednesday it was quitting almost all European markets, blaming big cash outflows and threats to its staff and property, after the ECB ordered the closure of its European arm.
The bank's London-traded shares fell to 4.5 cents from $16 at the start of the year.

A U.S.-traded ETF of Russian companies and others heavily exposed to Russia fell 13% on Wednesday, for a 72% drop since mid-February.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Commodity-linked currencies strengthened on Wednesday as the impact of an escalating conflict in Ukraine kept prices surging for oil and other raw materials.
The Russian rouble fell 4.5% to 106.02 against the dollar in Moscow trade. During the session, it hit a record low of 110.0, with Western sanctions following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine pummeling Russia's financial system. The rouble has lost about a third of its value against the dollar since the start of the year. In later trading outside of Russia, the rouble strengthened 6.61% versus the greenback at 100.10 per dollar.
The Canadian, the Australian and the New Zealand currencies were firmer as investors expected to benefit from higher commodity prices.
Crude oil futures surged above $110 a barrel, and wheat and aluminum prices jumped, with Western sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine seen disrupting Russian commodities exports.
The Aussie was 0.66% higher, the kiwi rose 0.4%, while the loonie was 0.8% higher. 
""Whether or not that continues depends really on whether or not we continue to see this move higher in oil prices. That's going to be the key to watch for especially given the fact that there's so much uncertainty emanating from the Russia-Ukraine story,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets, in Toronto.
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks its performance against six major currencies, was last flat after hitting its highest since June 2020. The euro was last nearly unchanged against the dollar, after slipping to a 21-month low during the session.
""A continued escalation of conflict with no clear off-ramps for Russia is pulling the euro toward a test of 1.10 in the coming days,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotia Bank.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will move forward with plans to raise interest rates this month to try to tame inflation, even as the outbreak of war in Ukraine has made the outlook ""highly uncertain,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.
""Judging from just his testimony... it's pretty much in line with our view that the Federal Reserve is going to hike rates at the next meeting,"" Rai said.
Data showed U.S. private employers hired more workers than expected in February and data for the prior month was revised sharply higher as the labor market recovery gathered steam.
The Canadian currency extended gains after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.50% in its first hike since October 2018, and said it would continue with the reinvestment phase of its bond buying program.
A modest pick-up in investors' appetite for riskier currencies kept the safe-haven Swiss franc and the Japanese yen pressured, with the dollar rising 0.2% against the franc and up 0.5% against the yen.
Bitcoin was down 0.31%.

187,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 12:57PM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia plans to tap its National Wealth Fund (NWF), a rainy day cushion, after it scrapped its borrowing plan this year amid Western sanctions and said it would spend up to 1 trillion roubles ($9.34 billion) to buy shares in Russian companies. 
The plan to tap the fund, originally designated to help the budget to cover pension fund's deficit, comes as Moscow faced harsh economic sanctions from the United States, European Union and their allies after Russia invaded to Ukraine last week. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
The sanctions saw a big part of the central bank's gold and foreign exchange reserves frozen and its biggest banks were cut off from the SWIFT international banking messaging system. 
Forex assets held by the NWF are part of Russia's overall gold and forex reserves of $643 billion. 
HOW BIG IS THE FUND?
Under a fiscal rule adopted in 2017 to strengthen the NWF Russia buys foreign currency when oil prices are high and sells when prices go below $44 per barrel, shielding the rouble from oil price swings.
The fund had 13.6 trillion roubles, equal to 10.2% of the gross domestic product initially projected for 2022, or $174.9 billion, as of Feb. 1, according to the finance ministry. 
ARE ALL THE NWF'S ASSETS AVAILABLE TO USE?
Out of total $174.9 billion, liquid part of the fund, or assets at the central bank's accounts, stood at $112.7 billion, or 8.8 trillion roubles, equal to 6.6% of GDP projected for this year as of Feb. 1, the ministry said.
In cash, the central bank holds: 
- 38.6 billion euros;
- 4.2 billion British pounds;
- 600.3 billion Japanese yen;
- 226.8 billion Chinese yuan;
- 405.8 tonnes of gold in cash equivalent;
- 266 million roubles
HOW MUCH OF NWF IS INVESTED INTO NON-LIQUID ASSETS?
- 530.6 billion roubles in deposits at the state development bank VEB, as on Feb. 1, the ministry said;
- $3 billion in foreign countries' debt instruments;
- 294.8 billion roubles and $4.1 billion worth of Russian securities linked to large infrastructure projects;
- 279 billion roubles worth of preferred shares at a number of banks;
- 138.4 billion roubles at subordinated deposits held at VTB and Gazprombank and related to large infrastructure projects;
- 3 trillion roubles of Sberbank shares;

- 47.4 billion roubles of Aeroflot shares

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan is once again lurching towards economic collapse in the aftermath of a coup in October, with exports plummeting more than 85% in January according to central bank data and the currency sliding on the black market.
Cut off from billions in foreign assistance, a military-led government is raising prices and taxes on everything from healthcare to cooking gas, but the increases have angered struggling citizens.
Sudan's long-running economic crisis - a legacy of decades of war, isolation, and sanctions - had shown signs of abating before the coup, but now poses a fresh humanitarian risk as its population faces renewed violence and rising levels of hunger.
Military leaders have yet to name a prime minister and protests have raged for months. The political deadlock is paralysing business, said Amin Shibeika, a Khartoum banker. 
""No one is making future plans, it's all suspended. There's a lack of transparency, with no light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said.
The Oct. 25 coup ended a power-sharing agreement between the military and civilians struck after the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in a 2019 uprising. Designed to lead to democratic elections, it had seen a civilian government implement painful economic reforms and secure foreign assistance and debt relief. That is now frozen.
In the latest effort by the leadership to rally scarce international support, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, deputy leader of Sudan's ruling council and commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, travelled to Moscow last week accompanied by finance minister and armed group leader Jibril Ibrahim.
While the delegation met senior figures including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, no major deals have been announced and Russia itself is now facing sweeping Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.
NO BAILOUT IN SIGHT
A senior Sudanese official said the government saw no foreign bailout on the horizon, and Ibrahim has said Sudan would rely on its own resources for this year's budget.
According to a copy of the draft budget seen by Reuters, it is aiming for a 145% increase in tax revenues and a 140% increase in revenue from the sale of commodities and services.
Among the tax measures to achieve that is what traders say is a four- or five-fold increase on annual business licence fees. But businesses are so used to not paying taxes that increases would be hard to impose, said Shibeika, the banker. 
""Business has basically stopped in the last few months, so these are additional burdens in difficult circumstances,"" said a business owner in central Khartoum. ""This is the worst its been since I started trading 20 years ago."" 
Revenues and spending are forecast to rise by more than a third, with a deficit of 363 billion Sudanese pounds ($820 million).
Though the government has ratified the budget, a senior finance ministry official said it was not realistic and not being applied on the ground.
Analysts say it would not be possible to pay salaries and meet other expenditures without resorting to inflationary printing of money, which Ibrahim last week denied doing.
The finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
'WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY'
A weeks-long blockade of Port Sudan prior to the coup and barricades along a trade route with Egypt by anti-military protesters have restricted exports of goods such as sesame seeds, peanuts, cotton and gum arabic that bring in badly needed dollars.
In January, Sudan exported only $43.5 million worth of goods, down sharply from $293 million in December, according to central bank data seen by Reuters, although this is a peak agricultural export season. 
Following the devaluation of Sudan's currency a year ago, the exchange rate had stabilised at about 450 pounds to the dollar. But in recent weeks the black market has resurfaced and the pound was changing hands at 530 against the dollar on Wednesday, compared with an official rate of 443.50.
Dollar auction results show the central bank has been selling lower quantities, hinting at depleted reserves. Inflation has eased slightly, but remains at one of the highest rates globally at 260% in January.
Prices for petrol and electricity have risen following global trends after subsidy reforms, as has the cost of government-issued paperwork and subsidised cooking gas.
In a move that was subsequently suspended, the cost of patient admissions at state healthcare facilities went from 250 pounds to 4,200 overnight last month, said Ali Shakir, head of one of the country's largest public hospitals.
He said that while he had requested an increased budget, ""we were surprised that they wanted us to take it from citizens' pockets"".
Sudan's ruling council said in a statement that prices would be reviewed and that the government did not consider healthcare a revenue earner.

But the rising costs could fuel further resentment over the kind of economic hardships that triggered the uprising against Bashir, including increasingly scarce subsidized bread.
""Life has become really, really terrible,"" said Khartoum resident Amna of the time since the coup. ""The bakery sells a piece of bread as big as a marble and say it's 30 Sudanese pounds ($0.07). We don't have the money for it.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher in early European trade Wednesday, with the euro under pressure, with the intensifying conflict in Ukraine prompting demand for the world’s reserve currency.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the  Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% higher at 97.660.
Russian forces have intensified the bombardment of Ukrainian cities, warning residents of Kyiv to leave as a miles-long convoy of armored vehicles draws near to the capital.
This is resulting in traders seeking out the dollar, the globe’s reserve currency, main safe haven, and most liquid asset.
“Recent headlines that Russia is escalating nuclear preparations and that the west is imposing increasingly tough sanctions, including freezing assets and cutting off certain Russian entities from the SWIFT interbank communications network, suggest that the risk-off tone may linger throughout the week and potentially beyond,” said Matthew Weller, Global Head of Market Research at GAIN Capital.
The ruble is continuing to decline despite the Bank of Russia doubling its key interest rate to 20%, as investors weighed the impact of tough economic sanctions on Russia.
But of the major currencies, it’s the euro that is being hit hardest as the severe sanctions on Russia and surging oil prices raised concerns about a hit to Europe's economy and growth.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), USD/RUB traded 2.1% higher at 103.3218, while EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1098, just above a new 21-month low, with the 1.1100 support level struggling to hold.
“Although there are not many reasons to be long of euros at the moment, from a technical perspective, the potential seems to be building for a short-squeeze,” said Jeffrey Halley, OANDA's Senior Market Analyst for Asia Pacific. “A new Ukraine-Russia meeting or progress by China in brokering some sort of ceasefire would be enough to spark a 200 point rally.”
Traders will look to the release of Eurozone CPI data later in the session, with the European Central Bank having to balance between surging inflation and the potential for a hefty hit to growth in the region on the back of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3292, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.16, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7252, helped by data showing the Australian economy performed strongly in the fourth quarter.
Later in the session, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will testify on matters economic before the House Committee on Financial Services, with investors keen to know his thoughts about the potential fallout from the conflict in Ukraine, given the central bank is widely expected to lift interest rates later this month to curb soaring inflation.
Finally, USD/CAD fell 0.1% to 1.2734, with the Bank of Canada expected to start raising interest rates later in the session with inflation at a three-decade high.",,,,,

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, but the moves were small. Investors flocking to safe-haven assets as Russia’ invasion into Ukraine intensified.
The US Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 97.382 by 9:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 115.00.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.45% to 0.7280, while the NZD/USD pair was up 0.37% to 0.6781.
The USD/CNY pair stabilized at 6.3125, while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3327.
The euro was last down 0.8% on the day after diving to its lowest since June 2020. The Russian rouble was down as the invasion of Ukraine intensified.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note that they were closing trade recommendations for long euro against the U.S. dollar, yen, pound and the Brazilian real and were “neutral on the euro overall.”
“Investors who have assets in Russia that will be increasingly challenging to divest thanks to growing capital controls and sanctions may look at hedging options. Currencies that have a high correlation with RUB risk may be seen as such an option, such as currencies in the CEE area and potentially the EUR,"" the note said.
“We will potentially look to re-enter these positions and re-affirm our EUR-bullish thesis in the future should conditions warrant, but, for now, we think it best to keep risk limited and preserve capital for when clearer themes emerge,” the note added.
Investors were looking at the latest Ukraine developments. Russia warned Kyiv residents to flee their homes, and Russian commanders have intensified the bombardment of Ukrainian cities.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. The West slapped sanctions and cut some Russian banks from the global SWIFT network. The U.S. is expected to ban Russian aircraft from American airspace, following similar moves by Europe and Canada.
Brent oil futures had their highest close since August 2014 over energy shortage concerns. The coordinated release of crude stocks by the U.S. and allies to minimize supply disruption failed to ease worries as Russia is one of the world’s top oil exporters.
""The likelihood of a '70s-style global oil shock is growing, and investors are moving to safe havens as fast as they can,” Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) chief market strategist Karl Schamotta told Reuters.
“The euro is on the front lines here, most exposed to energy shock,” with the euro falling as oil and gas prices jump, he added.

192,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 05:46PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) -The rouble weakened past 100 against the dollar in Moscow trade and hit a record low of 117 in other markets on Tuesday, threatening the living standards of ordinary Russians as the country is hit by harsh Western sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine.
The currency had found some support after Russian authorities ordered exporting companies, among which are some of the world's biggest energy producers from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) to Rosneft, to sell 80% of their forex revenues on the market, as the central bank's own ability to intervene on currency markets was curbed.
Later in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree banning the export of cash in foreign currency exceeding $10,000 in value with effect from March 2, according to a Kremlin statement.
But even the session-strong dip under 90 per greenback had left the rouble well shy of the 75 to the dollar it traded at before Russia recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine and sent troops into its neighbouring country last week.
The rouble ended down 6.5% to 101.23 against the dollar in Moscow trading, and lost 5.8% to 112.49 versus the euro.
After the Moscow close, the rouble weakened to as much as 117 per dollar and was trading near 105 in late trading in New York.
""By nature, it's a sign of disconnect between what's going on in Russia and what's going on abroad,"" said Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights in New York.
""Ultimately, a lot of foreign actors aren't really able to participate in purchasing Russian assets right now.""
Major Russian banks have been shut out of the SWIFT international payments system.
The rouble has tumbled since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, at one point losing a third of its value in Moscow trading, prompting the central bank to more than double interest rates to 20% and adopt a range of other urgent measures.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
STOCKS ABROAD TUMBLE
Share trading on the Moscow Exchange was suspended for a second day after sharp sell-offs hammered the market since mid-February.
Russia said on Tuesday it was placing temporary restrictions on foreigners seeking to exit Russian assets, and it ordered the spending of up to $10 billion from its rainy-day fund on buying shares in Russian companies.
But an ETF of Russian stocks traded in the United States fell 24% Tuesday for a combined 47% drop in two days and set a record closing low, while the London-listed iShares MSCI Russia ETF lost a third of its value on Tuesday and is down 83% since mid February.
""Price is the great arbiter and the price falling the way it is tells you that at least right now, the market's a bit skeptical about that demand,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
""If that type of statement or show of force was credible, clearly it wouldn't be falling as quickly.""
Dominant state lender Sberbank's depositary receipts in London tumbled 80% on Tuesday.
LIVING STANDARDS DAMAGED
The weak rouble is set to reduce living standards in Russia and fan already high inflation, while Western sanctions are expected to create shortages of essential goods that people in Russia have become used to, such as cars.
The Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade group representing large banks, warned that Russia was extremely likely to default on its external debts as well, and that its economy would suffer a double-digit contraction this year.

The Russian central bank and finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the possibility of defaults.
Inflation will spike in the short term but over the longer term could slow as people in Russia switch to a money-saving mode, said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko-Invest.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro hit its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since June 2020 on Tuesday and the Russian rouble was down in volatile trading as Russia's invasion into Ukraine intensified and oil prices surged.

194,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 10:46AM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Queues of people snaked through Moscow shopping malls on Tuesday as the scramble for hard currency continued, and Russians faced increasing isolation as sanctions made travel harder and sports teams were ejected from major competitions.
Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine threaten to decimate the economy, and have already sent the rouble plunging to record lows this week before a partial recovery.
Wearing a light blue winter coat, Olga has spent the last two days searching for an ATM where she might be able to withdraw some of her savings in foreign currency.
Some Moscow residents waited for hours, only to find that automatic tellers were empty or carried just roubles.
One of the queues, reminiscent of Soviet times when people waited in line for hours to purchase staple foods, extended around the corner from the Tsvetnoy shopping mall.
""I haven't managed to withdraw any euros yet,"" Olga said as she waited in line to use the ATM. ""I'm concerned. I somehow need to get cash.""
The Russian currency hit a low of 109.1850 against the dollar on the Moscow Exchange on Monday, days after Russia launched what it has called a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
Some analysts said the rouble could continue its tailspin in the wake of more Western sanctions designed to ostracise Russia, raising the risk of a default on its foreign debt.
The central bank and the finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the possibility of defaults.
Since President Vladimir Putin launched Moscow's military campaign on Thursday, Russians like Olga have begun bracing themselves for worsening living standards.
Already hit by high inflation, they fear prices will rise further and have already seen interest rates more than double as the central bank tries to shore up the local currency.
'I DON'T LIKE IT'
Russia has closed its airspace to airlines from the European Union and a string of other countries in response to sanctions, driving up ticket prices and severely limiting the population's ability to travel. 
Russians will also not be able to watch their national soccer team try to qualify for this year's World Cup or world-renowned figure skaters, many of whom stepped on the podium at the Beijing Games last month, compete at international events.
With purchasing power steadily dwindling and few opportunities to leave, many Russians have opted to spend their roubles on electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops before they become scarce, or simply unaffordable.
Check Index, which analyses consumer trends in Russia based on transaction receipts, said that spending on electronics and appliances - often foreign-made - had jumped 80% from Feb. 21-27 in comparison with the previous week. 
Electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado confirmed it had seen heightened demand for its products, which it attributed in part to the rouble's volatility.
Clients at three of Russia's 10 largest banks - VTB, private lender Sovcombank and central-bank-owned Otkritie - can no longer pay with ApplePay and GooglePay services.

That has created problems for metro users in Moscow, forcing commuters to buy one of the transport system's Troika cards, use a plastic card or sign up to the city's facial recognition Face Pay system instead.
""Everything is obviously bad,"" said Anna, another Muscovite. ""Everyone is going to be sad. Prices are going up. I don't like it.""

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia. The rouble steadied somewhat after crashing to a record low, while the safe-haven yen steadied after its biggest rallies in almost seven weeks. However, investors’ focus remains on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.16% to 96.847 by 10:04 PM ET (3:04 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.14% to 115.16.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7261, with the risk-sensitive Australian dollar trading at a nearly one-week high. The Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision later in the day. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6760.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3115. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for February was 50.2, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 51.6 and the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.4.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3435.
Currency markets calmed down somewhat after Russian and Ukrainian officials held the first round of ceasefire talks. The rouble also regained some of its dramatic losses earlier in the week, when it plunged as much as 30%. However, the pressure on Russia remains with the West slapping sanctions and cutting some Russian banks from the global SWIFT network.
The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) implemented an emergency interest rate hike of 20% and other measures. The rouble last traded at 102.
Currency volatility was at its highest in 14 months on Monday, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) index.
""News from Ukraine remains bleak, with Russia-Ukraine talks yielding no resolution. Fighting rages on as the West looks to increase efforts to isolate Russia,"" National Australia Bank Ltd. senior foreign-exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
The instability will keep safe-haven currencies bid and euro under pressure, while the Australian dollar has so far held up due to higher commodity prices and Australia's geographic distance from the conflict, the note added.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields retreated to an almost one-month low overnight, which weighed on the dollar. Investors sought the safety of Treasuries, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to hike interest rates at its policy meeting in March 2022.
The crisis in Ukraine has also induced investors to reduce bets for a Fed 50 basis-point rate hike to just 8.5%, according to CME's Fedwatch tool. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday said that he is not excluding a half-point move.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -The cost of raising U.S. dollar funds in the euro swaps market rose sharply on Monday after Western nations ramped up sanctions against Russia over the weekend, including blocking some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system. 
Three-month euro cross-currency swaps hit 38.25 basis points, the highest since mid-March 2020, the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, as foreign banks and companies scrambled for dollar funding. 
In other words, investors were willing to pay around 38.25 basis points over interbank rates to swap three-month euros into dollars. 
Last Friday, that three-month cost was 21 basis points and it was 8 basis points a month ago.
Cross currency swaps allow investors to raise financing in a particular currency from other funding markets. For example, an institution with dollar funding needs can raise euros in euro funding markets and convert the proceeds into dollar funding obligations via an FX swap.
""There are many question marks around the financial stability impact of sanctions, but it seems likely that they will temporarily make dollar funding more expensive for foreign banks,"" said Antoine Bouvet, a senior rates strategist at ING. 
The ruble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the dollar on Monday, after Western nations on Saturday unveiled tougher sanctions including blocking some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system.
Analysts said the move by the United States and its allies to block Russia from using $630 billion in central bank foreign currency reserves over the weekend will make dollar funding costs expensive for Western companies who were getting paid by Russian counterparties.
""For Western companies, it means central banks may have to provide dollar and euro liquidity,"" said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London.
According to estimates by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Zoltan Pozsar, Russia holds about $300 billion in short-term money market instruments: $200 billion in FX swaps and another $100 billion through public and private deposits.
The stress was not limited to euro funding markets. Borrowing costs in pounds and yen also rose to their highest since March 2020.
The jump in borrowing costs hurt trading volumes. A trading desk at a large U.S. bank said that overnight Treasury volumes were lower than recent averages.
Trading in euro zone government bonds slowed sharply on Thursday following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, data from MarketAxess showed on Friday.
Concerns about the Russia-Ukraine war have filtered to U.S. funding markets.
The spread between the U.S three-month forward rate agreement and the three-month overnight index swap rate, a funding stress indicator, rose to 19.14 basis points late Monday, its widest since early July 2020

On an intraday basis, the gap was 23.75 basis points hit early morning in New York, the highest since May 2020. The higher spread reflects rising interbank lending risk or dollar hoarding.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a research note, said that should funding stress worsen, the Fed has several mechanisms in place that could provide relief for short-term funding markets such as FX swap lines. The Fed maintains standing FX swap lines with a number of central banks, including the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Russian rouble plunged and the euro nursed losses against the U.S. dollar on Monday as the West ramped up sanctions against Russia over its Ukraine invasion, prompting investors to shun riskier currencies.
Western allies have ramped up efforts to punish Russia with new sanctions including cutting off some of its banks from the SWIFT financial network and limiting Moscow's ability to deploy its $630 billion foreign reserves and shuttering their airspace to Russian aircraft. Companies also reported divestment plans.
After plunging 30% to a record low of 120 per dollar, the rouble recovered some ground, to trade down about 24% on the day at 111 per dollar, as an emergency rate hike and other urgent measures adopted by the Russian central bank helped it trim losses.
Still, outside of the rouble the FX market reaction has been relatively stable, market participants said.
""There is clearly weakness in east European currencies even outside of the rouble... but at the same time they are not really weakening to new record lows or anything like that,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, in New York. 
""It's a very subdued reaction,"" he said.
Officials from Russia and Ukraine ended peace talks on Monday and will return to their respective capitals for further consultations before a second round of negotiations, RIA news agency quoted Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak as saying.
News of the talks helped soothe some nerves and the euro pared losses to trade down 0.49% on the day at $1.1212, after earlier falling more than 1% to a four-day low of $1.1121. 
""The initial knee-jerk reaction is fading from the real extreme flight to safety that we saw at the open yesterday,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay.
Still, traders remained very skeptical of holding euro positions, Schamotta said.
One-month implied volatility on the euro, a measure of how much traders expect the currency to move against the dollar over the near term, hit a 16-month high on Monday.
General aversion to risk kept the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc well supported. With the greenback down 0.53% against the yen and 0.95% lower against the franc.
While a jump in the price of oil, one of Canada's main exports, helped support the Canadian currency, investors' hesitancy to take on risk kept a lid on the loonie. The Canadian dollar was up about 0.1% at 78.75 U.S. cents. 

Besides geopolitical tensions, investors also remain focused on key economic data releases expected later this week, including U.S. nonfarm payrolls due Friday, that could help shape the U.S. Federal Reserve's thinking as it gears up to raise interest rates.
Markets are now pricing in a 93% chance the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by 25 basis points at its March meeting, according to CME's Fedwatch tool.

198,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 11:56AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -The Russian rouble tumbled to a record low in extremely volatile trade on Monday, losing a third of its value so far this year, but an emergency rate hike and other urgent measures adopted by the central bank helped it trim losses.
The Bank of Russia had sold around $1 billion from its reserves on Thursday, Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. But Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the central bank had stopped interventions on Monday due to the latest western sanctions, suggesting the rouble was supported by other unnamed market participants.
On Monday, Russian financial authorities ordered domestic exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign exchange revenues from Feb. 28. 
Russian markets suffered after Western countries stepped up sanctions in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. In response, President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday.
By early close at 1600 GMT the rouble was trading at 94.60 to the U.S. dollar, down 14% from Friday's close, with the central bank's 20% key rate hike limiting losses in Moscow trade.
It had earlier touched a record low of 120 to the dollar on electronic currency trading platform EBS, and was still trading considerably higher there than in Moscow. Per euro, the rouble closed 14% lower at 106.0.
Russia's sovereign hard currency bonds have suffered a dramatic decline over the past few days, though losses sharply accelerated on Monday with many of the country's dollar bonds dropping more than 40 cents in the dollar on the day and longer-dated issues trading at deeply distressed levels of 29-33 cents, Tradeweb data showed.
The cost of insuring exposure to Russia's debt through credit default swaps soared to a record 1200 basis points, around tenfold the 124 bps level it stood at by end-December.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
""The rate hike to 20% can very substantially limit the ability to open positions against the rouble... But new shocks from the geopolitical sphere and sanctions can lead to unpredictable spikes in supply and demand that can disrupt the balance,"" said Maxim Biryukov, senior analyst at Alfa Capital.
Trading in equities on the Moscow Exchange was closed, but depository receipts and exchange-traded funds listed in London and Frankfurt did open for trading with the London-listed iShares MSCI Russia ETF slumping 48%, taking year-to-date losses to 70%. 
Dominant state lender Sberbank's depositary receipts in London dropped more than 70% on the day and are down 93% year-to-date. Its European arm faces failure, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned, after a run on its deposits sparked by the backlash from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
STATE SUPPORT VS SANCTIONS
Russia is extremely likely to default on its external debts and its economy will suffer a double digit contraction this year after the Western sanctions, the Institute of International Finance said on Monday.
Russia's central bank scrambled to manage the fallout of the sanctions that will block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, with a slew of measures on Sunday.
The central bank said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions.
Analysts at Rabobank had warned before the Moscow Exchange opened that the sanctions on currency reserves removed what little support the rouble had.

""Even the gold is not liquid if nobody can use FX in exchange for it. There will be a complete collapse in the rouble today,"" they wrote.
Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), said in a note on Sunday, ""a collapse in the rouble appears inevitable on Monday morning"", and there was an increased risk of a Russian debt default as a result of the weekend developments.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar soared in early European trade Monday, while the ruble plummeted to a record low, as enhanced sanctions by the West on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine lifted demand for the world’s reserve currency. 
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.5% higher at 97.115.
Western powers escalated the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by blocking over the weekend several major Russian banks from using the global SWIFT payment system.
""Exclusions from SWIFT will lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts similar to the missed payments and giant overdrafts that we saw in March 2020,” Credit Suisse analysts said Sunday, in a note. 
This could push central banks, and the Federal Reserve in particular, to enhance liquidity to offset missed payments, the Swiss bank added.
Additionally, the EU and U.S. announced moves that effectively froze over half the extent of the Russian Central Bank's foreign reserves.
This is resulting in traders seeking out the dollar, the globe’s reserve currency, main safe haven and most liquid asset.
On the flip side, the ruble tumbled to a record low against the dollar on Monday, prompting the Russian central bank to raise its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5%, with companies urged to sell foreign currency to try and defend the currency.
At 2:55 AM ET, USD/RUB rose over 11% to 92.7400, having earlier climbed as high as 117.8170, a new all-time high.
Russia's economy is likely to contract 20% in the second quarter and by around 3.5% for the full year given these intensified sanctions, JPMorgan said on Monday.
""The two pillars of the economy even in the midst of slowing growth, rising inflation, and high interest rates were the 'fortress' FX reserves of CBR and Russia’s current account surplus. Not anymore,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) added.
Given the extreme market volatility, investors will look this week at testimony on the economy and monetary policy by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, before the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday, and again before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
The Federal Reserve had widely been expected to lift interest rates at its next meeting in March, potentially by as much as 50 basis points, but the officials must now weigh the geopolitical and economic fallout from the conflict in Ukraine against plans to curb soaring inflation.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.7% to 1.1187, with Europe bearing the brunt of the impact from Russia’s move into Ukraine, with higher energy costs likely hitting growth in the region. The Polish zloty was partic8ularly hard hit, falling 1.6% against the euro and 2.4% against the dollar.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 115.52, with the yen seeing some safe haven flows but factory output fell 1.3% in January, adding to concerns that the economy could shrink this quarter as public health restrictions weigh on activity.
The risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7202, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3380, while USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3109.
Additionally, USD/TRY fell 1.3% to 13.8810, after Turkey’s economy expanded more than predicted in the fourth quarter of last year, with GDP rising 9.1%, driven by a surge in domestic consumption and exports.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended several popular trades, inflicting heavy losses on investors bullish on European stocks and the euro and also those bearish on the Japanese yen and government debt.
The view before the aggression was that global economic recovery was chugging along, company earnings were robust and central banks, facing rising inflation, were on course to raise interest rates several times this year. 
But while the spiking geopolitical tensions continue to fan inflationary pressures via the oil channel, they are undermining some of the biggest consensus trades in markets.
""We just experienced a major pain point: the Russian invasion. That was enough to flush out the more aggressive short term positions"" "" said Aaron Hurd, senior portfolio manager, currency, at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston. 
Some of the more entrenched bets will come under further pressure if the conflict threatens the broader growth outlook, Hurd predicted. 
Below are five charts showing the main consensus positions in global markets: 
1/SHORT YEN, LONG EUROS
The premise that the Bank of Japan would lag global counterparts in tightening policy had made the Japanese yen every currency trader's preferred short -- hedge funds' net short bets on the yen were just below three-year highs, according to data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The yen's rise to a three-week high on Thursday would have dealt a blow to those positions. 
Another large consensus trade has been long euros where net longs are at six-month highs and rose by $1.2 billion in the latest week, according to CFTC.
Derivative markets show traders were frantically buying puts this week, an option to protect against losses, as the single currency fell below $1.11, its lowest levels since July 2020.
Meanwhile the growing trend to bet against the dollar -- long dollar positions slipped to the lowest since August - also backfired, as the dollar index jumped to a mid-2020 high.
2/ BEARS PROWL, MOOD DOWNBEAT
According to a BofA monthly survey, European stocks were investors' most preferred region with investors a net 30% overweight. 
But it is also the most vulnerable to fallout from the Russia conflict, and accordingly it European stocks slipped on Thursday to the lowest since May 2021, while European bank shares, a popular trade due to ECB rate hike bets, have shed 6.5% this week. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) slashed its European stocks forecast by 8% by end-2022 while the European Central Bank's chief economist said the conflict could shave as much as 0.4% of euro zone GDP. 
As risk aversion takes hold, the price of put options on European stock indexes at 10% below current levels for contracts expiring in March has jumped sharply. Open interest - the number of contracts outstanding, is at the highest level ever.
NOT SO AGGRESSIVE NOW
Convinced that the U.S. Federal Reserve would go big and fast with interest rate hikes in coming months, traders had piled on bets against Treasuries and most major bond markets.
Treasury shorts on the rate-sensitive front-end of the bond curve, jumped, with bearish bets on 2-year note futures at the highest since October. 

Those bets are being rapidly unwound amid the dash for safe trades. Bets of a 50 bps rate hike by the Fed next month have melted by half from a week earlier, according to the CME's Fedwatch tool, while expectations of ECB rate hikes have also dropped.
""Central banks' stagflation trade-off has only become more difficult amid the Russian invasion,"" said Kristoffer Kjær Lomholt, chief analyst at Danske Bank.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, while the Russian rouble fell to a record low. Tensions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine continue to rise, with Western nations announcing fresh sanctions against Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin putting nuclear-armed forces on high alert.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies rose 0.75% to 97.345 by 11:13 PM ET (4:13 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 115.55. Japan released data, including industrial production month-on-month and retail sales year-on-year for January 2022, earlier in the day.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.73% to 0.7179. Australia also released data, including private sector credit and retail sales month-on-month for January, and the Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision a day later.
The NZD/USD pair fell 0.78% to 0.6682, with New Zealand releasing its ANZ business confidence index for February.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.3109 and the GBP/USD pair was down 0.43% to 1.3348.
The rouble fell to as low as 119 per dollar in early trading on Monday, hurtling past a previous low of 90 roubles per dollar.
Western powers blocked big Russian banks from using the global SWIFT payment system. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) responded by announcing measures to stabilize domestic markets and the rouble, while the central bank itself was slapped with restrictive measures to prevent it from deploying its international reserves and undermining the sanctions.
Putin also put Russia's ""deterrence forces"" on high alert, which added to the tensions considering that the forces wield nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, the rouble’s losses as the Ukraine conflict intensifies were the dollar’s gains. ""In the near term, we think the dollar faces a risk of pushing above the 97.47 resistance level,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) FX strategist Carol Kong told Reuters.
The extent of the dollar's gains would depend on any further leap in volatility, the size of the selloff in global equities, and assessment of central bank's tightening programs. High energy prices were also capping the yen, given Japan imports the bulk of its energy requirements, she added.
Investors are now betting that there is a 95% chance of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by 25 basis points when it meets in March 2022, according to CME's Fedwatch tool. Expectation is also growing that the Ukrainian conflict will deter the European Central Bank from making any strong hawkish moves.
In Asia Pacific, an official from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand told Reuters that it is too early to assess what impact, if any, the Russian invasion of Ukraine might have on policy and that it has more work to do on interest rates to control inflation."
203,"<span>Feb 27, 2022 10:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar is rising against virtually every peer as fallout from the sanctions levied against Russia supercharge demand for the world’s reserve currency. Treasuries also rallied. 
Traders are piling into the most liquid asset as sanctions on Russia’s central bank and lenders reverberate through global markets, with talk that the Federal Reserve may have to intervene in global markets. U.S. and European stock futures fell, while currencies from the euro to the rand dropped.
“USD is king, offering liquidity and safe haven attributes,” said Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. “When trouble hits the road, you need to look for cover.” 
Signs of funding strains became apparent in major money markets early Monday as spreads widened for very short-term eurodollar contracts. The gap between future Libor and Fed rates -- the FRA/OIS spread -- widened nine basis for one-month contracts, the most since March 2020. March eurodollar contracts dropped relative to June peers, a classic sign of funding stress.
That comes as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG warned of how the decision to exclude some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system could impact money markets as payments are missed and giant overdrafts are made. Strategist Zoltan Pozsar drew comparison with how the Fed had to supply dollars during the the height of the pandemic panic in March 2020.
A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.7%, extending on last week’s 0.4% gain. Global bonds rallied, with 10-year Treasury yields dropping 7 basis points to 1.89% while yields on Australia’s 10-year government debt slumped as much 10 basis points. 
The ruble was indicated 28% lower versus the dollar in offshore trading on Monday. The Russian currency has fallen more than 6% in onshore trade to underperform all its emerging-market peers in February as traders brace for President Vladimir Putin’s response to the toughened sanctions.
“Europe is bearing the brunt of the invasion’s initial impact, with higher energy costs hurting consumers and the level of sanctions pressuring European growth, with a knock-on effect for U.S. growth prospects,” Scott Glasser, chief investment officer at Clearbridge Investments and investment specialist Jeff Schulze, wrote in a note.
SWIFT Risk
“Russia’s ex-communication from SWIFT would isolate Russia financially from the world and could cripple its economy,” Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, wrote in a note.
SWIFT is used for trillions of dollars worth of transactions around the globe.
Credit Suisse’s Pozsar has also estimated that Russia has about $300 billion of foreign currency held offshore -- enough to disrupt money markets if it’s frozen by sanctions or moved suddenly to avoid them.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria will offer a naira incentive to exporters of semi-processed or finished goods made at home in a push to shore up the country's dollar supply, the central bank said.
Nigeria is facing chronic dollar shortages while rising demand has put pressure on the naira, as providers of foreign exchange, such as offshore investors, exited after the COVID-19 pandemic triggered an oil price crash.
The central bank in a circular dated Feb. 25, said it will pay 65 naira ($0.16) to exporters for every repatriated dollar through official channels and sold to the currency market, and it will pay 35 naira for funds repatriated for other uses.
The central bank said this month that it was hoping Nigeria can reach earnings of $200 billion a year in foreign exchange from non-oil exports over the next three to five years.
""In an effort to reduce exposure to volatile sources of foreign exchange and to earn more stable and sustainable inflows of FX, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced the (race to $200 billion) programme,"" it said.
Nigeria sells oil and cocoa on global markets to dollars but imports petrol and chocolate at higher cost, the central bank said at the announcement of the scheme.
Exporters sometimes sell their proceeds on the unofficial market where the dollar exchanges at a premium to the naira, or keep funds abroad, an action the central bank wants to change.
In March, the bank offered 5 naira to recipients of remittances from the Nigerian abroad for every imported dollar through licenced channels. It later extended the offer indefinitely, saying that remittances had increased five-fold.

Remittances or money transfers make up the second largest source of foreign exchange receipts after oil exports in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rallied against the greenback on Friday as traders walked back some of the large moves seen the day before in reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and awaited an interest rate decision next week by the Bank of Canada.
The loonie climbed 0.8% to 1.2720 per greenback, or 78.62 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2711 to 1.2821.
On Thursday, the currency touched its weakest intraday level in more than two months at 1.2877. It was up 0.3% for the week.
""It feels like markets are moving past the panic moment that we had yesterday,"" said Eric Theoret, global macro strategist at Manulife Investment Management. ""It is really all about the big dollar, the U.S. dollar."" 
The safe-haven U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, and stocks globally rose as investors welcomed coordinated Western sanctions on Russia that targeted its banks but not did not block it from a global payments system and left its energy sector largely untouched.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, gave back some recent gains, with U.S. crude futures settling 1.3% lower at $91.59 a barrel.
Analysts doubt that the start of war in Ukraine will stop the Bank of Canada from raising interest rates next Wednesday. A 25 basis point move is priced into money markets which would be the first hike since October 2018.

Canadian wholesale trade was up 3.9% in January from December, a flash estimate from Statistics Canada showed. 
Canadian government bond yields were mixed across the curve, with the 10-year rate easing less than half a basis point to 1.916%.

MEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped on Friday, giving back some of the strong gains from the previous day, as investors gauged the latest round of sanctions on Russia and U.S. inflation data was seen as unlikely to make the Federal Reserve overly aggressive at its next policy meeting. 
The greenback on Thursday notched its biggest one-day percentage gain since Nov. 10 to reach 97.74, its highest since June 30, 2020. However, it gave back some gains after U.S. President Joe Biden hit Russia with a wave of sanctions following that country's invasion of Ukraine, but refrained from imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international banking system.
U.S. economic data showed consumer spending increased more than expected in January even as price pressures mounted, with annual inflation hitting rates last seen four decades ago, although the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 0.6% in January after rising 0.5% in December.
""The revisions to income and spending data shows the economy was very resilient to Omicron and to high oil prices. Hopefully, the situation with Russia is short-lived, but even if oil prices stay elevated, the economy should have enough fundamental strength to tolerate high energy prices,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
""The inflation numbers weren’t great, but at least the month-on-month inflation numbers aren’t moving higher,"" Jacobsen said. ""That should take some wind out from under the wings of the most hawkish Fed members.""
The dollar index fell 0.459%, with the euro up 0.59% to $1.1257. The euro fell to $1.105 on Thursday, its weakest against the greenback since June 1, 2020. 
Even with Friday's pullback, the dollar was still on track for a third straight week of gains. 
The increased risk appetite was evident in the U.S. stock market, with the S&P 500 up more than 2% after staging a late session rally on Thursday.
Before Thursday's jump -- which sent the dollar to its highest level since June 30, 2020 -- the greenback had been subdued in recent weeks, as rising tensions in Ukraine fueled expectations the Fed may be less aggressive in tightening policy as it attempts to rein in inflation. 
Expectations for at least a 50-basis-point interest rate hike at its March meeting have fallen to 25% from around 34% a day ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. 
In the central bank's latest monetary policy report to Congress, the Fed warned inflation could last longer than anticipated should labor shortages and fast-rising wages continue.
The European Union is planning a third round of sanctions against Moscow, an EU official said on Friday, minutes after Ukraine's president pleaded with the bloc for faster, more forceful steps to punish Russia for its invasion of his country. 
Policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB) said the situation in Ukraine could cause the ECB to slow its exit from stimulus measures.
Investors see only a 4% chance the ECB will boost its benchmark interest rate by 10 basis points at its March 10 policy meeting. [IRPR]

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.13% to 96.960 by 10:32 PM ET (3:32 AM GMT). It rose as high as 97.740, its highest level since June 2020.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.22% to 115.27.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7175 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.6694. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand aims to hike interest rates as quickly as possible to contain inflation and avoid the need for even greater policy tightening in the future, according to Governor Adrian Orr.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.16% to 6.3813 and the GBP/USD pair was up 0.26% to 1.3409.
The Russian rouble also fell to a record low of 89.986 per dollar overnight, before recovering slightly. The euro last traded at $1.1196 after hitting its lowest level since May 2020, or $1.1106. The pound and the riskier Australian dollar also suffered losses, with both currencies struggling to recover from their losses.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen and Swiss franc. The greenback slid 0.48% on the Japanese currency on Thursday and was at 0.9241 against the Swiss franc after losing 0.85% the previous day.
In the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine on Thursday. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes and Ukrainian forces fought on multiple fronts. The U.S. responded by slapping sanctions on Russia, impeding the latter's access to foreign currencies alongside sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.
""The first order impact is naturally in Russia and Ukraine... but there is an impact on Asia Pacific bond and foreign exchange markets as well,"" MarketAxess APAC head Riad Chowdhury told Reuters.
This has led to a ""flight-to-quality type move both in global assets moving to the dollar and yen as well as in emerging markets,” Chowdhury added.
Investors were also calculating the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on central banks’ monetary policies. Some officials from the European Central Bank, even those who could be perceived as hawkish, said the situation in Ukraine could cause the central bank to delay the start of asset tapering.
In the U.S., investors and some officials said the conflict would likely slow, but not stop, imminent interest rate hikes from the U.S.Federal Reserve."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar jumped to its highest level in nearly two years and the Russian rouble plunged to a record low on Thursday after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, as investors fled risk assets and moved toward safe-haven assets.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine in an assault by land, sea and air, in the biggest attack on a European country since World War Two.
The dollar index rose 0.869% and was on pace for its biggest daily percentage gain since March 2020, when U.S, markets were in the throes of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The greenback reached a high of 97.740 against a basket of major currencies, its highest since June 30, 2020. 
The dollar weakened slightly as U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, including banks.
""We have a big geopolitical development that a lot of people haven’t seen before in their lives; it’s a classic risk-off move,"" said Erik Bregar, director, FX & precious metals risk management at Silver Gold Bull Inc in Toronto. 
""There is a push and pull over which currency is the biggest safe haven in the moment."" 
The Russian rouble weakened 4.51% versus the greenback to 84.96 per dollar after softening to a record low of 89.986 per dollar. 
Against other safe havens, the dollar rose 0.77% against the Swiss franc while the Japanese yen weakened 0.54% versus the greenback at 115.61 per dollar. 
The greenback also gained sharply against other European currencies such as the Swedish crown, Hungarian forint and Polish zloty. 
The Swedish crown fell 1.13% versus the U.S. currency to 9.49 per dollar.
The dollar rose 2.85% against the zloty and rose 3.11% against the forint.
The euro was down 0.95% to $1.1202 while Sterling was last trading at $1.3393, down 1.10% on the day. 
The greenback has been subdued recently as tensions in Ukraine have increased and fueled speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve may be less aggressive in tightening policy at its March meeting. Expectations for at least a 50-basis-point interest rate hike have dropped to 7.5% from around 34% a day ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/fed-funds.html. 
Fed policymakers on Thursday acknowledged the central bank's tightening plans were now jousting with the possibility of war and its impact on oil prices.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin last fell 1.22% to $37,067.89.

""In the end, if you want to talk about the safety trade, as much as everyone likes to say bitcoin is great, push comes to shove, people want gold,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida. 
Ethereum last fell 2.21% to $2,560.77.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble bounced off all-time lows on Thursday as the central bank announced FX interventions and stocks plummeted, bracing for harsh sanctions against Moscow, after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces to invade Ukraine.
No Russian assets were left unscathed as Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast, after Putin authorised what he called a special military operation in the east.
The Russian currency shed 7.9% of its value to 87.52 against the dollar as of 1720 GMT, having earlier hit a record low of 89.60 in highly volatile trading.
Against the euro, the rouble lost 6.5% to trade at 97.60, earlier hitting an all-time low of 101.03 on the interbank market.
For the first time since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, the central bank said it will support the rouble with foreign currency interventions to shore up financial stability.
The central bank could ease the pressure on the rouble as its gold and forex reserves are close record highs of near $640 billion, analysts say.
""War or no war, tensions between the West and Russia are to remain high for longer, putting the rouble under pressure,"" said Stephanie Kennedy from Economic Research at Julius Baer.
The rouble was expected to gain support from Russia's economic recovery and high prices for oil and gas, its chief export, but sanctions and risk aversion leave little room for its recovery, meaning reduced living standards and higher inflation.
MARKETS AND SANCTIONS
Russian markets braced for harsh sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The Russian stock market in all its history has never lived through such a catastrophe as today,"" said Evgeny Suvorov, an economist at CentroCreditBank.
The dollar-denominated RTS stock index crashed 39% to 742.9 points after hitting 610.33, its lowest since January 2016. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index ended the day 33% lower at 2,058.1 points after hitting 1,681.55, its lowest since early 2016.

Russia's largest second largest lender VTB crashed 42% on the day after the UK said it was imposing sanctions on the state-owned bank.
Shares in Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot fell more than 30% on the day after the UK said its aircraft would be banned from landing in Britain.
Russia's largest lender Sberbank, shares in which lost nearly 46% in a day on Thursday, said it was prepared for any developments and had worked through scenarios to guarantee its customers' funds, assets and interests were protected.

Yields on Russian benchmark 10-year OFZ rouble bonds, which move inversely to prices, rose to 14.09%, their highest since early 2015.
Western countries and Japan have already imposed sanctions on Russian banks and individuals in response to Moscow's recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, but promised tougher measures should Russia invade.

Stock markets globally slumped and the safe-haven U.S. dollar rallied after the biggest attack by one country against another in Europe since World War Two. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.7% lower at 1.2819 to the greenback, or 78.01 U.S. cents, after touching its weakest intraday level since Dec. 27 at 1.2847.
Still, the commodity-linked loonie fared better than most other G10 currencies. Only the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc performed better against the greenback.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, climbed 7.60% to $99.10 a barrel as the invasion added to concerns about disruptions to global energy supply.
Higher sales in the petroleum and coal product industry helped drive a 1.3% increase in Canadian factory sales in January from December, a preliminary estimate showed.

Investors stuck with bets for the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates next Wednesday for the first time since October 2018, but longer-term rates tumbled, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, with the euro weakening and increased demand for safe-haven currencies as concerns of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine intensify.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.41% to 96.580 by 11:48 PM ET (3:48 AM GMT). It rose as much as 0.19% to 96.372 for the first time since Feb. 14, 2022.

The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.3172 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 1.3518.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special operation to “protect” Ukraine’s Donbass (Donbas) region, according to a TASS report citing a speech. While Putin said that while Russia has no plans to occupy Ukraine, he urged Ukrainian forces to put down their arms and go home and that Russia would not let Ukraine secure nuclear arms, the report added.
A state of emergency has been declared in Ukraine, and Russia began evacuating its embassy in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. The West reacted by slapping sanctions on Russia, with the U.S. joining Germany in sanctioning the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Germany and Russia.
The dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss Franc all climbed towards multi-week highs against the euro. The dollar remained near a one-week peak after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes Russia will invade Ukraine within hours.
Riskier commodity-linked currencies also fell, reflecting investors’ decreasing risk appetite, losing its resilience from earlier in the week. The euro fell as much as 0.26% to $1.12750, its lowest level since Feb. 3. It also fell 0.29% to 129.640 yen, near the low of 129.360 hit on Tuesday, the weakest since Feb. 3. The single currency also slipped 0.22% to 1.03550 francs, approaching Tuesday's low of 1.03405, the lowest since Jan. 24.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higher on Wednesday as the latest developments in the Ukrainian crisis dented investor appetite for risk, as a sell-off in the equity market helped drive a safe-haven bid for the greenback.
After spending the early part of the day lower, the dollar began to strengthen as the situation in Ukraine intensified and U.S. stocks gave up initial gains, and the U.S. State Department said a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine remains potentially imminent.
The United States and allies unveiled more sanctions against Russia, with European Union measures taking effect on Wednesday. Ukraine declared a state of emergency and told its citizens in Russia to come home, while Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy.
The greenback has been subdued recently as tensions in Ukraine have increased, fueling speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be less aggressive in tightening policy at its March meeting.

""Given the current environment, I anticipate the Fed is going to become a little bit more cautious,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York.
""You are also seeing geopolitical tensions are going to keep risk aversion the go-to trade so any rebounds in risk are going to be faded."" 
The dollar index rose 0.161%, with the euro down 0.21% to $1.1301. 
The Russian rouble weakened 2.70% versus the greenback at 81.13 after reaching 81.392 per dollar, giving back gains made on Tuesday. 
The New Zealand dollar jumped after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised interest rates and said more tightening could be necessary. The kiwi last was up 0.59% versus the greenback at $0.677.
The rise in the New Zealand dollar, along with climbing crude prices, also helped other commodity-linked currencies such as the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate were up more than 1% on the day. 
The Canadian dollar rose 0.22% versus the greenback to 1.27 per dollar while the Australian dollar rose 0.17% versus the greenback at $0.723.

China's yuan touched a fresh four-year high against the dollar, amid signs the escalating Russia-Ukraine crisis is boosting foreign demand for Chinese assets. The greenback fell 0.17% versus the yuan to $6.312 per dollar. 
The greenback rose 0.69% versus the Swedish crown to 9.39 per dollar after the Riksbank’s Deputy Governor Martin Floden said on Monday the central bank was unlikely to raise rates in the coming year or so.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday but gave up much of its advance as rising Russia-Ukraine tensions weighed on investor sentiment.
The loonie was up 0.2% at 1.2740 to the greenback, or 78.49 U.S. cents, after earlier touching its strongest level since last Friday at 1.2683.
""Recent trading has made it clear that the broader risk mood is the essential driver for the CAD at the moment,"" strategists at Scotiabank, including Shaun Osborne, said in a note.
U.S. stocks were sharply lower and the safe-haven U.S. dollar gained ground against a basket of major currencies as Ukraine declared a state of emergency and the West unveiled more sanctions against Russia over its move into eastern Ukraine. 
Sanctions were not yet expected to disrupt oil supplies, helping to cap the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, after it notched a seven-year high on Tuesday. U.S. crude prices settled 0.2% lower at $92.10 a barrel. 
Other commodity-linked currencies also gained ground, including a 5-week high for the New Zealand dollar as the country's central bank hiked interest rates as expected and signaled a more aggressive path forward than even the most hawkish investor had wagered.

The Bank of Canada is expected to hike next Wednesday for the first time since October 2018.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -The Russian rouble slumped on Wednesday, diving around 3% to hit a near two-year low past 81 to the dollar as Ukraine declared a state of emergency, with sanctions and invasion fears hammering Russian bonds and stocks.
Western nations responded to President Vladimir Putin's recognition of separatist enclaves in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine and subsequent orders to send in ""peacekeeping"" troops with plans to target banks and elites. Germany froze a major gas pipeline project from Russia, and London and Washington targeted Russian debt.
Ukraine told its citizens in Russia to come home, while Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy in the latest ominous sign for Ukrainians who fear an all-out Russian military onslaught.
By 2020 GMT, the rouble was 3.1% weaker against the dollar at 81.26, earlier sinking to 81.3975, its weakest point since March 23, 2020. 
It had lost 2.7% to trade at 91.86 against the euro, earlier hitting 92 for the first time since April 2021. 
Russia was celebrating the Defender of the Fatherland public holiday on Wednesday, with many traders away from their desks, but some trading went on. 
Russia's high interest rates, copious reserves and strong balance of payments should make the rouble one of the strongest currencies, said Dirk Willer, global head of macro and asset allocation at Citi, but people are scared of sanctions.
""Buying the dip may be the right response to geopolitics but it's not necessarily true for the part of the world where the fire is actually burning,"" he said.
The initial round of sanctions stopped short of targeting major financial institutions, meaning their impact could be rather symbolic, but additional measures soon followed and the European Union was due to hold an emergency summit on Thursday. 
""There is probably scope for further falls if sanctions are imposed due to the uncertainty about whether sanctions will need to be ratcheted up further in order to influence Russian policy,"" said William Jackson of Capital Economics, anticipating that the rouble may fall by another 10% in that scenario, pushing up already high inflation. 
The sharp drop in the rouble from levels around 70 to the greenback seen four months ago is expected to fuel accelerating inflation, one of the main concerns among Russians, which would dent the country's already falling living standards.
BOND MARKET ROUT
Russia's finance ministry on Wednesday said it would offer only new series of OFZ government bonds from now on, in response to U.S. sanctions on the secondary market for Russian debt.
Russia's sovereign dollar bonds suffered their worst day since the spring 2020 COVID market rout, with some longer-dated bonds tumbling more than 10 cents and the 2047 issue hitting a record low of 84.466 cents.
The cost of insuring exposure to Russia's debt through credit default swaps soared past 400 bps for the first time in nearly seven years.
The premium demanded by investors to hold Russian debt over safe haven U.S. Treasuries blew out to 449 bps - well above the levels for smaller and riskier frontier markets such as Bolivia or the Dominican Republic.
Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 0.2% at $96.64 a barrel.

Russia's dollar-denominated RTS index closed 1.8% to 1,204.1 points, but Russian stocks' foreign listings felt serious pressure. 
U.S.-listed VanEck Russia ETF dropped nearly 10% to hit its lowest level since May 2020 while Russian e-commerce platform Ozon Holdings and internet company  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) N.V. suffered drops of around 12%.

The Kremlin said it remained open to diplomacy with the United States and other countries as it faced actions from a slew of countries. Britain published a list of sanctions and Germany froze the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, which would have significantly increased the flow of Russian gas.
The dollar weakened somewhat as U.S. President Joe Biden announced the first wave of sanctions against Russia while saying he hoped diplomacy was still available.
The euro rose versus the greenback after earlier touching its lowest level since Feb. 14, buoyed in part by the hope for talks and economic data that showed business morale in Germany improved in February across all sectors to its highest since August.

The study from Anova Policy and the Venezuelan Finance Observatory, which gathered data from 354 establishments in Caracas, found that 34.3% of foreign-currency cash payments accounted for 34.3% of purchases made this month in supermarkets, pharmacies, hardware stores, and other businesses, up from 27.5% in December.
Remaining payments in foreign currency were made with cards or via bank transfers, the report said.
The amounts of foreign currency in circulation have risen since the government of President Nicolas Maduro relaxed economic controls in 2019 to help businesses struggling under U.S. sanctions and economic turmoil, with Maduro describing the dollar as an ""escape valve."" 
The study said transactions in Venezuela's bolivar continued, even as high inflation eroded its value.

Venezuela's government is hoping to strengthen the bolivar after inflation slowed late last year and is considering taxing foreign currency transactions, though analysts and business leaders say such tax would not guarantee bolivar's recovery. 
""People will want bolivars when they see that inflation is stable,"" said Jose Guerra, an economist and a member of the Finance Observatory.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine's assets came under pressure on Tuesday after a sharp escalation of tensions with Russia, sending the hryvnia tumbling to levels last seen in 2015 when the country was headed for default. 
Russia's formal recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine late on Monday has raised the spectre of war on Europe's eastern flank and rattled global financial markets. 
Ukraine's hryvnia weakened as much as 1.4% to 29.1196 to the dollar - its weakest level since the currency dropped sharply in 2015 as the country hurtled towards a debt restructuring. 
The currency has weakened nearly 10% since end-October, when the conflict with Moscow intensified as investors ditched Ukrainian assets amid growing concerns over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine's borders and fears Russia is preparing for a military attack against Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied that.
Ukraine's dollar-denominated sovereign bonds also stumbled.
Its 2032 bond dropped 2 cents in the dollar to trade at a record low of 71.694 cents, Tradeweb data showed. Ukraine's 2040 GDP-linked bond slipped more than 3 cents to trade at 58.303 cents, having lost around half its value since June last year. 

Dennis Shen at Scope Ratings in Berlin said a further escalation could pressure Ukraine's credit rating. 
""There is still a number of available scenarios, including those observing de-escalation as long as negotiations continue,"" Shen said in emailed comments. ""However, such scenarios have narrowed in view of Russia’s most recent actions.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) -The rouble rebounded from a near two-year low and shares in major Russian banks leapt on Tuesday after Britain announced the first but relatively modest sanctions after Moscow recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent.
The rouble on Monday suffered its biggest one-day drop since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic after President Vladimir Putin recognised the two regions as independent, but it regained some ground in volatile trade as the first round of penalties proved to be less harmful than feared.
Britain imposed sanctions on five Russian banks and three billionaires but stopped short of targeting major lenders, such as state-controlled Sberbank and VTB.
Shares in Russia's largest lender Sberbank jumped 7.9% on the day as of 1517 GMT, while shares in No.2 bank VTB were up 4.7%.
Other possible sanctions could target major financial institutions, block Russia's access to electronics supplies, or curb the operations of its energy firms.
The rouble rebounded to 79.13 to the dollar, up 0.8%, after earlier falling to 80.97, a level last seen on March 23, 2020.
That resurgence came as Russia said it would only recognise the regions' independence within the boundaries that the Moscow-backed separatists currently control, and as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy played down the prospect of a large-scale conflict with Russia.
""There was a headline that just hit that they (Russia) are recognising the borders where they have authority, so markets are rallying on that,"" said Peter Kisler, emerging market fund manager at Trium Capital.
""We are not in the clear - but that gives a path to de-escalation.""
The Russian central bank said it was ready to take all necessary measures to support financial stability, and analysts said currency market interventions to limit rouble losses were one of the options on the table.
Against the euro, the rouble was 0.5% stronger at 89.75, having earlier hit 91.4475, its weakest level since April 2021. 
RUSSIA SELL-OFF
Russian markets plunged on Western fears that Putin's moves - to recognise the independence of the two regions collectively known as the Donbass and send in forces to ""keep the peace"" - might presage a major war.
""It was nothing but a disaster yesterday – news that the conflict with Ukraine in Donbass could be turning hot triggered a massive sell-off in all types of assets,"" BCS Global Markets said in a note.
The sell-off also hit Russia's neighbours. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, hit an all-time low of 29.1198 to the dollar, while Kazakhstan's tenge slipped to 438.08 against the greenback from levels around 427 seen on Monday.
On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia was heading towards ""pariah status"" and that the world must now brace for the next stage of Putin's plan, saying the Kremlin was laying the ground for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian OFZ bonds fell further, with yields on 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to prices, hitting their highest since early 2016.
""The market situation is really tense. Non-residents are likely to cut their positions (in OFZs) ... and buy foreign currency instead. Rouble positions will depend on sanctions,"" said Georgiy Vaschenko, head of trading on the Russian stock market at the Freedom Finance brokerage.
OFZ bonds used to be popular among foreign investors due to their relatively high yields, but non-residents have cut exposure to Russia in recent months.

Russian stock indexes have lost around a quarter of their value in just five days but tried to recover on Tuesday.
The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 2.1% to 1,233.9 points after hitting 1,075.98, its lowest since November 2020. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 2.1% higher at 3,099.2 points.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia as Russia recognized two breakaway parts of eastern Ukraine, increasing concerns of a major war.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to $96.168 by 10:11 PM ET (3:11 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 114.63.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7192 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.6704.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.09% to 6.3408, and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 1.3584.
Investors turn to safe-haven assets as Russia and Ukraine tension escalates. The euro dipped about 0.1% to a one-week low of $1.1297 while the Swiss franc, another safe-haven, hit a one-month high overnight.
""It is remarkably restrained...but in these circumstances risk metrics are the driving force,"" NAB head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent on Monday and ordered the deployment of troops to the areas.
Whether the action was the start of an invasion of Ukraine is not clear yet, but the West has begun to respond by preparing sanctions.
The Russian robule extended its slide on Tuesday after it tanked more than 3% against dollar on Monday.
""The sharp sell-off in Russian assets is a stark reminder that tension remains super high and risk sentiment is being hit across equity, credit and bond markets,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
“However, the commodity story remains super supportive though and we are in the middle of miner dividend season meaning that we are likely set for more rangy price action around $0.72,” the note added.
Cryptocurrencies were also under pressure, with bitcoin sitting its near three-month low at $37,112."
225,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 12:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman backed a March interest-rate increase and said that while it was premature to say if the move should be 50 basis points, that question was on the table for officials to discuss.
“I support raising the federal funds rate at our next meeting in March and, if the economy evolves as I expect, additional rate increases will be appropriate in the coming months,” said Bowman. “I, as all of my colleagues will as well, will be watching the data closely to judge the appropriate size of an increase at the March meeting,” she told an American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference Monday in Palm Desert, California.
Asked during the question and answer session after her speech if she backed a half-point move or a quarter-point increase, she said that question “is one that we will address at the upcoming FOMC meeting in a few weeks’ time,” referring to the Federal Open Market Committee gathering on March 15-16. 
“I think between now and then it is very important that we continue to watch how the economy develops and understand whether or not things are improving or getting worse,” she said, adding that “at this point I think it’s to soon to tell.”
U.S. central bankers are confronting the hottest inflation in 40 years and want to get started on removing pandemic policy support by raising rates from near zero and starting to shrink their bloated balance sheet, though views differ on how aggressively they should act. 
They have stepped up their rhetoric on raising rates after data showed consumer prices rose 7.5% in the year through January as employers added almost half a million more workers to a labor market in which unemployment stands at 4%. Central bankers will get fresh readings on price pressures and employment for February before they meet again in March.
Senior Fed officials Governor Lael Brainard, who’s nominated to be vice chair, and New York Fed President John Williams, on Friday said they were ready to move in March. But Williams leaned against a half-point move, noting he doesn’t see a compelling argument for taking “a big step at the beginning.”
Officials next meet March 15-16. During their January gathering, policy makers concluded that they would raise rates soon and were on alert for persistent inflation that would justify a faster pace of tightening, according to minutes of the session released Feb. 16.
Speculation the Fed would begin with a half-point move was fanned by hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard. Bowman didn’t declare where she stood but made plain she was open to taking aggressive action if needed.
“Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves,” Bowman said, who as a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors has a permanent vote on monetary policy. “My intent would be to take forceful action to help reduce inflation, bringing it back toward our 2% goal, while keeping the economy on track.”
Data since the Fed’s January meeting “have only increased the urgency to get on with the process of normalizing our interest rate stance and significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.” she said.
Noting that the Fed will conclude its asset purchase program in early March, she said “in the coming months, we need to take the next step, which is to begin reducing the Fed’s balance sheet by ceasing the reinvestment of maturing securities already held in the portfolio.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian banks increased their liquid assets held in foreign currencies by $8.5 billion in January to $53.5 billion, the central bank said on Monday, in a sign lenders may try to boost their forex shield in light of fresh sanctions threat. 
The United States is considering new sanctions against Russia, proposing to cut some of its top banks from dollar transactions and reducing their ability to service dollar-denominated obligations, sources told Reuters.
Sanctions would come into a force if Russia invaded Ukraine, a move the Kremlin denies is on the cards despite a large Russian troop buildup near its neighbour's borders.
Banks' liquid forex assets, such as cash held by lenders directly and in the central bank as well as short-term loans and other non-rouble tools which could be easily claimed, stood at $45 billion in December, the central bank said in a report. 
Earlier on Monday, Russian ratings agency ACRA estimated that the country's banks imported $5 billion worth of forex banknotes in December, double from a year ago, in a pre-emptive step in case sanctions create increased demand.
The central bank declined to comment on ACRA's calculations, nor did it provide a breakdown for the banks' liquid forex assets disclosed in its report Monday. 
However, it said that last month, lenders had 21% of their clients forex funds and 15% of banks' liabilities covered by liquidity - a protection cushion if customers demand a speedy withdrawal. That was up from 18% and 13% in December, respectively. 

Although retail clients withdrew 810 billion roubles from their current accounts last month, Russian banks managed to post 164 billion roubles ($2 billion) in January profit, up by 47% from the previous month, the central bank said. 
($1 = 79.2050 roubles)

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro's gains fizzled and the dollar received a safe-haven boost on Monday after the Kremlin said there were no concrete plans for a summit over Ukraine between the Russian and U.S. presidents.
Weekend reports that Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden had agreed in principle to discuss finding a possible path out of Europe's biggest military crisis in decades had prompted investors to cautiously buy stocks and the euro and pull capital away from safe-haven shelters such as the yen and government debt.
But the latest news, along with reports of border skirmishes, prompted investors to take shelter.
""Tensions are running high,"" said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the euro currency sank half a percent to a three-week low at 1.0384 francs per euro.
Versus the greenback the euro, which was up 0.6% at one stage during early London trading, slowly abandoned those gains and was up a meagre 0.1% at $1.1336. 
Russia's FSB security service said a shell fired from Ukrainian territory had destroyed a border guard post, while Ukrainian authorities warned that hackers were preparing to launch major attacks on government agencies, banks and the defence sector on Tuesday. 
""The optimism has dissipated,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC, pointing to fresh news headlines suggesting that Britain believes Russia may still be planning an invasion.
""Caution is the order of the day,"" he said.
During the same time, the dollar index recovered most of its losses and was down only 0.13% against major rival currencies.
Echoing the mood swing over the prospects of a de-escalation, European stock markets turned sharply negative after opening in positive territory, with a gauge of European stock market volatility at its highest level since November 2020.
By contrast, safe-have currencies that have benefited from the tensions spurred by Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders were back in favour. The Swiss franc added 0.54% at $0.9164 versus a broadly sturdy U.S. dollar.
Bitcoin, which was on a recovery path from a mild bruising over the weekend, struggled to stay in positive territory, holding around $38,500 levels.
While the outcome of negotiations to find a peaceful way out of the Ukrainian crisis remains uncertain, more volatility is expected ahead. A gauge of currency market volatility held near its highest levels since February 2021.

Currency markets participants are also focused on central bank policy, seeking clues on the speed and size of interest rate hikes in major markets.
Investors will be closely watching remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers this week for any hint that an expected rate hike at the Fed's March meeting could veer more towards to 50 basis points instead of the current consensus for a 25 basis point increase.

Investing.com -- The U.S. dollar weakened in early European trade Monday as risk sentiment received support from the news of a likely meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the fraught situation on the Ukrainian border. 
At 2:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% lower at 95.745.
News of the potential summit came from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron, who had proposed the idea to the two leaders. The White House said in a statement that Biden had accepted the meeting ""in principle"" but only ""if an invasion hasn't happened”, while the Kremlin was silent on the matter.
The dollar had been one of the main beneficiaries last week of the heightened tensions on the Ukrainian border, with Russia massing troops and also undertaking military exercises in neighboring Belarus while Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels exchanged accusations of violence in the east of the country.
EUR/USD rose 0.5% to 1.1373, with the euro boosted by the potential of diplomacy winning the day. USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 114.96, giving up early gains, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.6% to 0.7217.
The Russian ruble, which has been sensitive to the prospect of war, strengthened, with USD/RUB down 0.9% at 76.6073.
“Geopolitics have stolen the spotlight and created worries for investors and people around the world,” said analysts from Nordea, in a note. “The Russia-Ukraine crisis is still ongoing and unfortunately we are far from certain that geopolitical risks have peaked.”
Elsewhere, German producer prices rose 2.2% on the month in January, climbing 25% on the year, an indication of the inflation pressures the European Central Bank officials were under when they signaled a shift toward a more hawkish policy.
German manufacturing PMI numbers for February are due later in the session and will be studied carefully to see how this important sector, a major regional driver of growth, is coping with the Omicron situation and the associated supply-side difficulties.
Elsewhere, the U.S. market is closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday, but the expectation of aggressive moves by the Federal Reserve to combat consumer inflation at levels not seen for 40 years continues to provide support for the dollar.
With this in mind, the PCE price index, rumored to be the Fed's favorite inflation measure, is due for release on Friday, and will be closely watched. It’s forecast to have risen 6% year-over-year in January, while the core reading, which excludes food and fuel prices, is expected to rise 5.2%.
There will also be speeches from several Fed officials during the week, including Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Christopher Waller.
“Going forward, we do not expect the current [Ukraine] crisis to be the key driver of the risk sentiment this year. It’s much more likely that central banks and the inflation outlook will dominate the narrative in the financial markets,” added Nordea. “However, countries and companies which are closely linked to Russia could face negative spillover effects and the Russian ruble remains vulnerable.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with currency markets monitoring the ongoing tensions over Ukraine. The safe-haven yen was not far from a two-week high while the euro was on edge as investors calculated the energy security and economic implications for Europe in the event of a Russian invasion.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.21% to 95.820 by 10:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 114.97.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.49% to 0.7208 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.29% to 0.6719.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3255 and the GBP/USD pair was up 0.23% to 1.3622.
""Russia-Ukraine tensions are starting to dominate risk sentiment and price action. The market is likely to keep chasing headlines without any clarity on the eventual outcome,"" said Barclays analysts in a note.
In a reflection of the situation, the euro got a small boost early in the Asian session as U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed “in principle” to hold a summit to discuss Ukraine. However, the summit would not take place should Russia invade Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the yen lost a little bit of ground on the dollar following the announcement. However, safe-haven assets such as the yen and Swiss franc benefitted from investors’ risk aversion due to the tension in Eastern Europe.
The euro traded 0.12% higher at $1.13340, after falling earlier in the session in reaction to Sunday's announcement from the Belarusian defense ministry that Russia would extend military drills in Belarus.
Central banks’ policies also remain on investors’ radars, with the People’s Bank of China’s loan prime rates due later in the day. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday and the Bank of Korea will hand down its policy decision a day later.
Outside Asia Pacific, Bank of England (BOE) Governor Andrew Bailey will appear before the Treasury Committee on Wednesday. Several U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers will also speak throughout the week, with investors looking for clues that a large 50 basis point rate hike could come at the Fed's March 2022 meeting, instead of the more widely expected 25 basis point increase.
The BOE is also widely expected to hike rates again at its March meeting, giving the pound some support although the situation in Ukraine perhaps capped gains."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen fell slightly against the dollar on Friday, pulling back after recent gains, but was up for the week as a series of developments in the Ukraine-Russia crisis put investors on edge.
In afternoon New York trading, the dollar was up 0.1% at 115.025 yen. For the week, the dollar was down 0.4% against the Japanese currency in its biggest weekly percentage decline in about a month. Against the Swiss franc - another safe haven - the dollar was up 0.1% at 0.9212 francs.
Concerns about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine also have boosted demand for safe-haven bonds, with Treasury yields dropping on Friday. 
On Friday, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine said they planned to evacuate their breakaway region's residents to Russia, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the events transpiring in the border area over the past two days are part of a Russian scenario to create false provocations.
News late on Thursday that Blinken had accepted an invitation to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov late next week gave some relief to investor jitters.
""Everyone is fixated over what's happened with the Ukraine situation. There's a tremendous amount of nervousness. Everyone is hoping for some type of deescalation but it just doesn't seem like that is the direction things are going,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at Oanda in New York.
""The trade has been about safe havens, and it's been a great week for the Japanese yen. Today the yen is slightly softer but the overall concern right now is you're entering the long weekend, and you still have a lot rhetoric coming out of Russia,"" he said.
The Russian rouble weakened 1.26% versus the greenback at 77.40 per dollar. 
The euro was down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.1329, while the U.S. dollar index was up 0.3%.
Bitcoin last fell 1.3% to $40,025.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -The rouble weakened on Friday, tumbling past 77 to the dollar after Russian-backed separatists announced the sudden surprise evacuation of their breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, spooking already jittery markets.
Russia has repeatedly rejected Western assertions that it may be planning to invade neighbouring Ukraine, but its assets have been hammered by fears of a military conflict that would almost certainly trigger sweeping new Western sanctions against Moscow.
By 1651 GMT, the rouble was 1.3% weaker against the dollar at 77.29, slipping sharply from a session-high of 75.63 after the self-proclaimed regions of Donetsk and Luhansk announced evacuation plans. The rouble extended losses on reports of a car being blown up in Donetsk.
President Vladimir Putin ordered the emergencies minister to travel to southeast Russia to organise accommodation for residents leaving. 
Against the euro, the rouble slipped 1.1% to 87.54.
The Russian currency had traded at 74.26 against the greenback before the latest sell-off started a week ago. 
""The week ends as it began, awash in uncertainty on the geopolitical and economic fronts, suggesting caution and some bargain-hunting will be at play,"" BCS Global markets said.
TENSIONS ON THE BORDER 
Russian markets have been buffeted by tensions over Ukraine, improving on reports of Russian troop withdrawals from near the border, but slumping as Western powers warn of imminent invasion. 
U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said Russia was preparing a pretext to justify an incursion, but high-level Moscow-Washington talks earmarked for late next week are holding open hopes of a diplomatic solution.
Joint military drills between Russia and Belarus, which both share borders with Ukraine, have put the West on edge.
Meeting his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Moscow on Friday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia must enhance its economic sovereignty to counter the threat of sanctions. 
Fitch Ratings said there had been a marked increase in the risk of severe sanctions that could pressure Russia's sovereign and bank ratings.

U.S. sanctions cutting off Russian state banks from the dollar are the most powerful measure for NATO members, according to Russian executives, bankers, and former senior U.S. sanctions officials.
Russian stocks pared gains to slide. The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 4.1% to 1,391.3 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 3.4% lower at 3,393.3 points, its lowest point since Jan. 27.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Friday as investors weighed diplomatic efforts to avoid a Russian invasion of Ukraine and preliminary domestic data showing that retail sales climbed in January.
Canadian retail sales rose 2.4% in January from December, a flash estimate from Statistics Canada showed, following on a 1.8% decline in December as consumers stayed home amid concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant.
""Consumer demand appears to be resilient, though persistently strong inflation is eroding purchasing power,"" Shelly Kaushik, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. 
U.S. stock index futures seesawed after news that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed to a meeting with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, raising the prospect of ending the standoff over Ukraine.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, extended losses and was headed for a weekly fall as the prospect of increased Iranian oil exports eclipsed fears of potential supply disruption resulting from the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
U.S. crude prices fell 2.1% to $89.8 a barrel, while the Canadian dollar was nearly unchanged at 1.2706 to the greenback, or 78.70 U.S. cents.
The currency traded in a range of 1.2675 to 1.2717. For the week, it was on track to gain 0.2%. 

Meanwhile, Canadian police started arresting protesters as part of an operation to end a three-week blockade of Ottawa by hundreds of truck drivers that crippled the capital and prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assume emergency powers.
The Canadian yield curve flattened, with short-term rates barely moving and the 10-year rate easing 1.7 basis points to 1.899%. On Wednesday, it touched a three-year high at 1.995%.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Friday, with risk sentiment boosted by the news that the U.S. and Russia were set to discuss the Ukraine crisis next week, raising hopes for a diplomatic solution. 
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.740.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks in Europe next week, the State Department said Thursday night.
The dollar, along with other safe-haven currencies the yen and the Swiss franc, have gained this week amid high tension on the Ukrainian border, with U.S. President Joe Biden warning on Thursday that the probability of an invasion of Ukraine is still “very high.”
News that the two principal players are set to meet next week has been greeted with a degree of optimism, although the situation remains very tense, especially after both Ukrainian government forces and Moscow-backed rebels accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules on Thursday.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1372, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.11, having touched a two-week low of 114.78 in early Friday trading, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.4% to 0.7214.
The Russian ruble, which has been sensitive to the prospect of war as sanctions loom, strengthened, with USD/RUB down 0.7% at 75.7917.
Back in the U.S., the debate continues about how aggressive the Federal Reserve will have to be this year in terms of interest rate hikes to combat consumer inflation at levels not seen for 40 years.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said late on Thursday the Fed would need to raise interest rates at a faster pace and shrink its balance sheet more quickly than it did after the ""Great Recession"", while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Fed may need to raise rates above 2% to tame inflation.
That said, the advocates for a 50 basis point Fed hike in March received a blow Thursday as initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose for the first time since mid-January, climbing by 23,000 to 248,000 in the week ended Feb. 12, the reference week for the February jobs report that’s due early next month.
There are more Fed speakers due later Friday, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, FOMC member John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard, while economic data will be concentrated on the housing sector.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3624, boosted by British retail sales growing faster than expected in January, climbing 1.9% in January after a 4.0% decline in December. Sales were 9.1% higher than a year earlier, when non-essential shops were shut due to lockdown restrictions.
This quick rebound will add to expectations that the Bank of England will continue to lift interest rates, having hiked at its last two meetings, as the year progresses.  
USD/TRY rose 0.3% to 13.6149 after Turkey’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a second month on Thursday, as it struggles to contain rampant inflation while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan preaches a low interest rate policy.

The USD/JPY pair was up 0.22% to 115.19.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.24% to 0.7200 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.33% to 0.6709.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.3354 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3609.
""The support level of 114.63 looks within reach today if more negative headlines on Ukraine emerge,"" CBA analysts said in a note. Markets were also focused on the Bank of Japan (BOJ)’s policy, as the central bank continues with its policy of yield curve control, the note added.
Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists exchanged fire on Thursday, renewing Western concerns of an imminent Russian invasion. U.S. President Joe Biden accused Moscow is preparing a pretext to justify a possible attack and Russia expelled an American diplomat.
The tensions also caused the U.S. currency to lose ground on the Swiss franc, with the greenback last at 0.9196 francs, or just above Thursday's two-week intraday day low of 0.9186 francs. Meanwhile, bitcoin was around the $40,500 mark, around a two-week low.
""Crypto has shown us once again that it is a high beta risk asset, and it has a dark sinister look that could morph into something ugly,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a morning email.
Volatility continued for the euro due to the tensions in Ukraine, and the single currency last traded at $1.1360. The British pound was supported by bets that the Bank of England will further tighten its monetary policy.
Central banks and their monetary policies were also under scrutiny with the BOJ’s offer to buy an unlimited amount of benchmark 10-year government bonds earlier in the week weighing on the yen. Although markets have not aggressively tested the BOJ's 0.25% yield target on those bonds, yields on other tenors have been rising.
Meanwhile, the debate on how aggressively the U.S. Federal Reserve should hike interest rates, and whether it should be a 25 or 50 basis point hike at the March 2022 meeting, continues.
The Fed would need to hike interest rates at a quicker pace and shrink its balance sheet more quickly than it did after the 'great recession', Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Thursday.",,,,,

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc climbed to two-week peaks against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, on worries about escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions that could have economic repercussions worldwide.
In afternoon trading, the dollar slid to 114.845 yen, the lowest since early February. It was last down 0.4% at 114.93 yen.
Against the Swiss currency, the greenback fell to 0.9189 francs, the weakest since Feb. 3. The dollar last changed hands at 0.9202 francs, down 0.2%.
""Safe havens are outperforming as today's geopolitical development dampened hopes for a diplomatic deal to avert military action around Ukraine,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday there was now every indication Russia was planning to invade Ukraine in the next few days and preparing a pretext to justify it, after Ukrainian forces and pro-Moscow rebels traded fire in eastern Ukraine.
Russia also accused Biden of fueling tension and released a strongly worded letter that said Washington was ignoring its security demands and threatened unspecified ""military-technical measures.""
Fears of a Russia invasion pushed U.S. stocks sharply lower and spurred bids for safe-haven Treasuries. [US/]
For now, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has superseded concerns about the Federal Reserve's plans to tighten monetary policy, starting at the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. But the market has been divided over the size of the expected interest rate increase.
Last week, with the latest U.S. consumer prices data showing the largest annual gain in 40 years, rate futures market had priced in a roughly 70% chance of a half-percentage rate rise in March. That has come down to 37% on Thursday,
The more likely scenario is for a quarter-point tightening by the Fed, analysts said.
But even with the Fed's hawkish shift, the dollar has remained broadly unchanged.
""We think this is largely because other central banks' hawkish shifts have also pushed up the yields of long-dated government bonds in other developed markets, resulting in a smaller shift in relative yields,"" said Jonathan Petersen, markets economist, at Capital Economics.
The dollar index, a measure of its value against six major currencies, has gained just 0.2% so far this year. Against the yen, however, the greenback has been down 0.2% so far in 2022.
U.S. Treasury 2-year yields, which reflect rate expectations and are correlated with dollar/yen, have surged about 74 basis points.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index was flat at 95.827.
Some commodity currencies, which are sensitive to risk sentiment, fell, with the Australian dollar falling 0.1% to US$0.7188. The Norwegian crown dropped as well against the dollar, which rose 0.5% to 8.917.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, which moves in tandem with other risk assets, was last down 7.8% at $40,590.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its safe-haven U.S. counterpart on Thursday despite Wall Street tumbling on geopolitical worries, with investors sticking to bets that the Bank of Canada would hike interest rates multiple times in 2022.
The loonie was nearly unchanged at 1.2686 to the greenback, or 78.83 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2676 to 1.2734.
""The relationship between FX vol (volatility) and equity and bond market vol is just not what it used be,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities.
""Have we really seen the market take out central bank pricing because of what's happening in Ukraine? Not really.""
Money markets expect the BoC to hike on March 2 for the first time since October 2018 and six times in total this year.
U.S. stocks dropped, with investors gravitating toward defensive sectors and safe havens such as bonds and gold as geopolitical tensions heightened between Washington and Russia over Ukraine.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, settled 2% lower at $91.76 a barrel as talks to resurrect a nuclear deal with Iran entered their final stages which could unlock more crude supplies.
Domestic data showed that foreign investors bought a net C$37.56 billion in Canadian securities in December, led by new shares resulting from cross-border mergers and acquisitions.

Canadian government bond yields were lower across a flatter curve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries.
The 10-year eased 4.5 basis points to 1.914%, after touching on Wednesday its highest intraday level in three years at 1.995%.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble and stocks slipped in volatile trade on Thursday after Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces traded accusations of firing shells across the ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine, sending market players running for cover. 
Kyiv said the incidents in eastern Ukraine looked like a ""provocation"" at a time when Russia has troops massed on the frontier. 
Russia, which denies any plans to invade, on Thursday rejected what it called ""unfounded accusations"" by the United States and NATO that it was not withdrawing its forces from near the border, saying it takes time to wind down military exercises.
By 1345 GMT, the rouble was 1.2% weaker against the dollar at 76.15 , moving further away from 75 touched in the previous session and earlier falling as far as to 76.7175 in volatile trade.
The unit had weakened 0.9% to trade at 86.47 versus the euro.
""The jury is out as to whether the threat of invasion has de-escalated, unsettling risk appetite,"" said BCS Global Markets in a note. 
The rouble had been recovering this week after its sharpest single-session drop in nearly two years on Friday, caused by Western nations' calls to their citizens to leave Ukraine.
The reports of shelling saw most of those gains evaporate and both Russia's and Ukraine's sovereign dollar bonds suffered fresh falls on Thursday, though Russian assets managed to pare some losses later in the session. 
Five-year credit default swaps for Russia - a measure of the cost of insuring exposure to the country's debt - jumped by around 13 basis points from Wednesday's close to 227 bps, though that was still some way off the more than 270 bps hit on Monday, data from IHS Markit showed.
The West has threatened tough sanctions should Russia invade, something Moscow has repeatedly denied planning. 
For NATO members, the most powerful measure against Russia would be U.S. sanctions cutting off Russian state banks from the dollar, according to Russian executives, bankers, and former senior U.S. sanctions officials.

Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 1% at $93.83 barrel.
The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 4.1% to 1,462.0 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 3.1% lower at 3,532.1 points.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar bounced in early European trade Thursday, with this safe haven boosted by reports of hostilities in eastern Ukraine, raising fears of a major conflict. 
At 2:55 AM ET (07:55 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 95.900.
Russian-backed rebels earlier Thursday accused Ukrainian government forces of shelling their territory in the eastern part of the country. This has created a lot of uncertainty over whether this will remain a localized event or if it could lead to a broader conflict with Russia using the event as a reason to invade.
Tensions had been reduced earlier in the week after Russia announced it was withdrawing some of its troops positioned near Ukraine, but a number of Western countries, including the U.S., and NATO have disputed that claim.
We have seen ""no meaningful pullback"" of Russian forces from the border with Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, while being interviewed on television. ""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border.""
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1366, having jumped 0.5% the day before, USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 115.28, with the safe haven yen in demand. GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3588, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD was largely flat at 0.7194, having earlier fallen as much as 0.6%.
The Russian ruble, which has been sensitive to the prospect of war as sanctions loom, weakened, with USD/RUB up 0.7% at 75.8008.
“A diplomatic solution remains our base case (albeit arguably still a close call), and we expect the geopolitical risk premium to fade with time,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The timing for that is however highly uncertain, and pro-cyclical FX gains could remain moderate in the near term.”
Elsewhere, traders continue to digest the minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting, ahead of the release of the weekly jobless claims data.
With consumer inflation at 40-year highs, expectations had been growing that the Fed policymakers had already decided to start its policy tightening with a 50 basis point hike at its March meeting.
However, the minutes showed that while policymakers agreed that it would ""soon be appropriate"" to raise the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate from its near-zero level, they would re-assess the rate hike timeline at each meeting depending on the available data. 
USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 13.6160, with Turkey’s central bank widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged for a second consecutive meeting later Thursday, as inflation surges.
The benchmark one-week repo rate is expected to stay at 14%, with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan opposed to higher interest rates despite this being the orthodox method of combating soaring consumer prices.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, alongside the euro. Investors are digesting U.S. doubts that Russia has withdrawn troops on the border with Ukraine, with fears of an invasion still very much alive.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 95.765 by 9:56 PM ET (2:56 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.91% to 115.47.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.24% to 0.7209 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.34% to 0.6700.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.3327, while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3590.
The euro was pinned around $1.1379 early in the Asia session. It had rallied, alongside global shares, as Russia signaled a military pullback, a step forward in the deepest regional crisis in decades. However, the U.S. said on Wednesday that the Russian statement was false.
Investors were also relieved that the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s January 2022 meeting took a much less hawkish turn than some had expected.
""The minutes did not mention any discussion about a half-point move and didn't disclose details about the timing or the monthly pace of the planned balance sheet reduction,"" Scotiabank strategist Qi Gao said in a note.
The U.S. dollar index fell about 0.2% after the minutes to 95.769 and remained close to this level on Thursday. However, it could probably slide a bit lower toward 95, according to Gao.
In Asia Pacific, Japan released trade data that showed the biggest trade deficit in a single month in eight years in January. The adjusted trade balance was at -JPY930 billion ($8.05 billion), while the trade balance was at -JPY2.19 trillion. Exports grew 9.6% year-on-year, while imports grew 39.6% year-on-year.
Elsewhere in the region, Australia released employment data earlier in the day that showed the employment change was 12,900 and the full employment change was –17,000, while the unemployment rate was 4.2%, in January. However, the data was not enough to lift the Australian dollar through resistance around $0.7210.
The New Zealand dollar is also in focus, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand widely expected to hike interest rates by 25 basis points when it hands down its policy decision on Feb. 23. Swaps trade even pointed to a better-than-one-in-four chance of a 50 bp hike.
Expectations that the Bank of England will also hike interest rates in March 2022 held the pound firm. Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernández de Cos and European Central Bank (ECB) chief economist Philip Lane will speak later in the day, with both speeches closely watched for clues on the ECB outlook.
In the U.S., Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard will also speak later in the day.",,,,,
240,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 09:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese yuan is making deeper inroads as a currency of choice for global payments, with international transactions climbing to their highest level ever. 
Payments using the renminbi, as the currency is also known, jumped to a record 3.2% of market share, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, breaking through its previous high set in 2015 that came on the back of a currency devaluation in a bid to increase exports.
Usage has jumped in the past three months as international funds boosted holdings of Chinese government bonds, pushing their share to a fresh record, and amid gas producer Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft’s decision to accept yuan rather than dollars for fueling the Russian airplanes at China’s airports. The currency retained its fourth place in the past two months, compared with being the 35th most-popular medium of exchange for payments in October 2010 when Swift, which handles cross-border payment messages for more than 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries, started tracking.
Despite its rise in the rankings and having upped its market share by orders of magnitude over the last 12 years, the renminbi is still dwarfed in popularity by its more established peers, notably the U.S. dollar and the euro. 
The dollar kept its top spot in January, a position it’s held since June, even though its market share fell to about 39.9% from 40.5% in December. The euro also lost ground but held onto second place, while the British pound and yen rounded out the top five in third and fifth place, respectively.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index was down on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level since Friday after minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting suggested policymakers are not set on a particular pace of interest rate hikes.
According to the January meeting minutes released on Wednesday, Fed officials last month agreed that, with inflation widening its grip on the economy and employment strong, it was time to tighten monetary policy, but also that decisions would depend on a meeting-by-meeting analysis of data.
Strategists said the minutes suggested policymakers may not be as hawkish as investors feared.
""Members were not as aggressive as some had expected, which is being reflected in the modest sell-off of the dollar,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing at Monex USA in Washington. 
""We are taking these minutes with a grain of salt anyway, as the meeting happened before the recent CPI and PPI data, which were considerably higher than forecast.""
Earlier this week, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated calls for a faster pace of Fed rate hikes, and stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data including Wednesday's U.S. retail sales data have helped to underscore that view. 
Those expectations have helped to give support to the dollar in recent sessions.
At the Fed's Jan. 25-26 meeting, policymakers agreed that it would ""soon be appropriate"" to raise the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate from its near-zero level.
The dollar index was last down 0.3%, while the euro was up 0.2% at $1.1383. The U.S. dollar was down 0.4% against the Swiss franc and down 0.2% against the Japanese yen. 
On the geopolitical front, the United States and NATO said Russia was still building up troops around Ukraine on Wednesday despite Moscow's insistence it was pulling back. 
The Russian defense ministry said its forces were pulling back after exercises in southern and western military districts near Ukraine. The Russian rouble strengthened 0.73% versus the greenback to 75.14 per dollar. 
Oil prices rallied earlier, and the Canadian dollar rose 0.33% versus the greenback to 1.27 per dollar.
Sterling was last trading at $1.3593, up 0.44% on the day. Data earlier showed UK inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.5%.
The Bank of England has already raised interest rates twice since December, and financial markets expect a further rate rise on March 17 after the BoE's next meeting.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 0.7% at $44,271.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday as oil prices rose and domestic data showed inflation further heating up in January.
Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated in January to a 30-year high of 5.1%, as food and housing costs continued to rise, while the average of the Bank of Canada's three core measures rose to 3.2%, data from Statistics Canada showed.
Still, analysts doubted the data would be enough to sway the central bank to hike by 50 basis points rather than 25 basis points at its March 2 policy meeting. Money markets see about a 30% chance of the larger increase.
""The loonie is unlikely to find too much further upside from the CPI data,"" said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada. ""Focus will likely remain on broader market risk appetite and this afternoon's FOMC meeting minutes.""
World stocks crept higher for a second day, though market moves were checked by Western scepticism that Russia had indeed pulled back troops from Ukraine's borders. Traders were also waiting for the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, recouped some of Tuesday's decline with U.S. crude were up 1.7% at $93.65 a barrel.

The Canadian dollar was 0.2% higher at 1.2690 to the greenback, or 78.80 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2665 to 1.2727.
Canadian government bond yields were lower across a flatter curve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year yield touched its highest since January 2019 at 1.995% before pulling back to 1.960%, down 1.3 basis points on the day.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Wednesday, continuing the previous session’s selloff as news of the withdrawal of some Russian troops from the Ukraine border drained some geopolitical risk premium from the market. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.900, having fallen around 0.4% on Tuesday.
The change in risk sentiment followed Russia announcing it was returning to barracks some of its troops positioned near Ukraine after the completion of exercises.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1365, having jumped 0.5% the day before, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 115.67, with the safe haven yen weakening having briefly touched 114.99 on Monday, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7169.
That said, the dollar's losses are fairly minor. NATO chief General Jens Stoltenberg, warned that the military alliance has so far “not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side”, while Ukraine suffered a cyberattack on the online networks of its defense ministry and two banks.
""Nothing has changed on the ground in any meaningful way,"" said the Mark Galeotti, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute, via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Putin could have invaded yesterday, he can still do so tomorrow.""
Additionally, traders are wary of fully deserting the greenback ahead of the release of the minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting, at which the policy makers in all likelihood discussed raising interest rates at its March meeting.
“While indications that the Ukrainian situation may be heading to a diplomatic solution could help pro-cyclical currencies recover and lift some support from safe-havens (including the dollar), we expect the narrative around frontloading of tightening by the Federal Reserve to put a floor under the dollar in the near term even if the geopolitical risk is priced out,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3558, after British consumer prices rose 5.5% in January, the fastest annual pace in nearly 30 years, up from December's 5.4%.
The Bank of England has already raised interest rates twice since December in an attempt to combat this surging inflation, and a further rate rise from the current 0.5% is expected in March at the central bank's next meeting.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3350 after China’s factory-gate inflation slowed to its slowest pace in six months in January, thanks to government curbs bringing raw materials prices down.
The producer price index rose 9.1% year-on-year, slower than the 10.3% growth recorded in December 2021, while consumer price inflation grew 0.9% year-on-year, compared with December’s 1.5% increase.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - As the Bank of Japan asserts its standing as a lone dove among its peers, the yen is reclaiming its status as the world's most popular funding currency.
The trade comes with risks though, given the yen could revert to being a safe haven if tensions over Ukraine heighten or if an aggressive Federal Reserve triggers a markets selloff.
The yen's conventional role as the cheap currency investors could borrow and use to finance 'carry' trades in higher-yielding markets was somewhat diluted during the coronavirus pandemic, as other central banks cut their rates to zero too.
But it is back as the favourite funding currency this week after the BOJ announced a special bond-buying operation to remind markets about its commitment to keep yields low for longer. 
That stance is at odds with the Fed and central banks in Europe that have turned forcefully hawkish about inflation. 
""If you're an investor in London or Hong Kong and you're thinking about which currency to fund a trade out of, you're basically only left with one central bank ... at least for the moment,"" said Ben Shatil, a Tokyo-based FX strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
""And that's an environment that has typically favoured the yen as a funding currency for carry trades.""
Some things haven't changed for the yen. Japan has one of the weakest currencies among the Group of Seven nations, sub-zero short-term rates and a domestic investor base desperately seeking returns abroad. 
Yet, aside from the Ukraine factor, shorting the yen has become a riskier trade. 
The prospect of rising energy prices and imported inflation might force the BOJ to raise rates. An associated risk is that the Fed goes too fast and far with its policy tightening, causing a global selloff in markets that spawns flows into the safe-haven yen.
In a typical carry trade, investors borrow the low-yielding yen or Swiss franc to invest in higher yielding assets elsewhere. Stability in the funding currency is key to keeping the cost of the trade down.
In deflation-plagued Japan, yen short-term deposit rates have been near zero for decades, and negative since 2016 when the BOJ adopted its yield-curve-control policy. 
One example of a typical carry trade would involve borrowing yen to invest in Brazil's money markets. That trade has returned an annualised 10.7% so far this year. 
Paul Mackel, global head of FX research at HSBC, says investors may be going back to the yen as the funding currency of choice, but it's risky.
""A carry trade is never going to be super smooth sailing, it's always about picking up pennies in front of the steamroller, but that steamroller may be a little bit closer given these uncertainties associated with political risk,"" Mackel said. 
IF YEN APPRECIATES 
With the United States warning about an acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border, the yen has been rising.
After testing its more than four-year low at 116.33 per dollar last week, it has strengthened sharply to 115.33. That sort of rapid appreciation erodes carry trades, most of which involve going short on the funding currency.
""The yen's safe haven properties can kick into gear very fast,"" Mackel said. 
There are also worries that Japanese policymakers may become concerned about the economic impact of a weak yen, particularly given the country imports the bulk of its energy and oil prices are at seven-year highs. 
Inflation has crept closer to the BOJ's 2% policy target, which raises prospects the BOJ will loosen its grip on yields, and rising yields torpedo yen-funded trades. 
The BOJ is keeping markets guessing. While it offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds this week to underscore its resolve to contain domestic borrowing costs, it has made clear such offers would be made only sporadically. 
For now, investors are buying into the dovish view.
The BOJ's offer to buy bonds, ""in the short term will probably quieten down what was quite a loud chorus of people saying that the BOJ would relent on yield curve control,"" JPMorgan's Shatil said. 

This ""creates a runway for a bit of yen weakness which would be helpful in the context of these carry trades.""

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the euro held on to overnight gains in early Asia Pacific trade. Investors also digested reports that Russia could move forces away from its border with Ukraine, alongside the latest economic data from China.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 96.045 by 10:54 PM ET (3:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 115.69.
The AUD/USD pair was steady at 0.7152 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.6637.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3403. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that China's consumer price index grew 0.9% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month in January, while the producer price index rose 9.1% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3540.
The Russian defense ministry on Tuesday published footage to show it was withdrawing some troops from the border with Ukraine after exercises. However, U.S. President Joe Biden said that the U.S. had not verified the move, while Ukraine reported a cyber-attack on the online networks of its defense ministry and two banks mere hours after the Russian announcement.
The euro steadied at $1.1356 on Wednesday, after climbing 0.45% the day before, while global shares rebounded over expectations of a possible Russian withdrawal.
However, some investors were optimistic that the dollar’s losses would be capped.
The dollar ""shed ground overnight as the Ukraine geopolitical risk premium came out of markets, but expectations of an aggressive Fed hike cycle should keep a base for the dollar index in place,"" said Westpac analysts in a note.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to hike interest rates at its March 2022 meeting, with several more hikes also likely to follow throughout the year.
Investors now await the minutes from the Fed’s last meeting later in the day, which could influence the dollar and U.S. rates’ movements. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was last at 2.0329.
A debate among Fed officials on how aggressively the central bank should hike interest rates also continues. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Monday repeated calls to speed up the pace of Fed rate hikes, but some of his colleagues are less keen to commit to a half-point hike or were even concerned it could cause trouble.
Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England could hike its own interest rates by a further 25 basis points at its March meeting, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The central bank last hiked rates at three consecutive meetings in 1997."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was down slightly on Tuesday as investors absorbed the latest news on the Russia-Ukraine standoff, with the dollar index briefly paring some of its losses late in the day after President Joe Biden said that a Russian attack on Ukraine remains a possibility.
Biden, in nationally televised remarks, also said reports that some Russian forces have moved away from the Ukraine border have not yet been verified by the United States.
Earlier, Russia said that some of its troops were returning to base after exercises near Ukraine, news that appeared to reduce investor anxiety over the crisis in the region.
Concern over the standoff has driven gains recently in the safe-haven dollar, but investors mostly took a risk-on view on Tuesday, with U.S. stocks rising.
The U.S. dollar index was last down 0.3%, while the euro was up 0.5% against the dollar at $1.1358. The U.S. dollar was up 0.1% against the yen at 115.64 and up 0.1% against the Swiss franc at 0.9255. The Russian rouble strengthened 1.80% versus the greenback at 75.32 per dollar.
Biden also said the United States is ""not seeking direct confrontation with Russia"" but that if Russia were to attack Americans in Ukraine, ""We will respond forcefully.""
A ""feeling of de-escalation on the Russia-Ukraine border,"" drove some underperformance in the dollar, said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto, although investors remain focused on developments in the region.
Market participants will also remain alert to any comments this week from U.S. Federal Reserve officials on the interest rate hike outlook.
Fed officials continue to spar over how aggressively to begin raising rates at their March meeting, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Monday reiterating calls for a faster pace of Fed rate hikes. Other Fed officials have been less willing to commit to a half-point hike, or were even concerned it could cause trouble.
""The key is really going to be what we hear from other Fed speakers later this week... That could be pivotal for markets this week,"" Rai said.
The European Central Bank has joined its central bank peers in signaling a hawkish turn in its monetary policy at a meeting this month.
Sterling was about flat against the dollar at $1.3537. It had been rising amid expectations that the Bank of England was likely to raise interest rates again next month after lifting them twice since December. 
Investors also assessed data showing U.S. producer prices increased by the most in eight months in January. The data follows last week's report showing a strong rise in consumer prices in January, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 3.6%.

Investing – The dollar’s bright start to the week faded Tuesday, as easing Russia-Ukraine tensions coaxed investors out from the safe-haven arms of the greenback, but the potential for fresh clues on the Fed frontloading rake hikes will keep losses in check.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.37% to 95.99, as the flight to safety waned after Russia reportedly pulled some of its troops back from the Ukraine border. 
But fresh hopes for a deescalation in tensions won't keep the dollar pinned down for long. The Fed's minutes from the January meeting, set to be released on Wednesday, will return focus to monetary policy, and the prospect of aggressive rate hikes ahead. 
“[W]e expect the narrative around frontloading of tightening by the Federal Reserve to put a floor under the dollar in the near term even if the geopolitical risk is priced out,” ING said in a note.
The minutes will arrive just as bets on the Fed frontloading rate hikes by increasing its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points at its meeting next month continue to growth.
The recent jump in rate hike expectations were spurred by a red-hot inflation showing prices pressure continue to trend at multi-decade highs, and hawkish remarks from the St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.“I do think we need to front-load more of our planned removal of accommodation than we would have previously. We’ve been surprised to the upside on inflation. Bullard told CNBC’s Steve Liesman during an interview earlier this week.
The St. Louis Fed president, who tends to lean more hawkish on monetary policy, previously called for interest rates to be increased by a full percentage point by July 1.
“I’d like to see 100 basis points in the bag by July 1,” Bullard said in an interview with Bloomberg last week.  “I was already more hawkish but I have pulled up dramatically what I think the committee should do.""
Markets were quick to take note, with the 2-year Treasury yields, which are heavily influenced by the Fed’s policy action, pricing in a 100-basis-point hike.
The minutes, however, predated the hawkish remarks from Bullard, and the red-hot inflation report that led to a repricing of aggressive Fed rate hike bets, so may offer little insight.
“[T]here is a limit to which any policy inferences drawn from the January meeting’s minutes may be relevant to formulating expectations for the March meeting, Scotiabank Economics said. 
""The minutes will be significantly stale on arrival since we’ve since had a blow-out jobs report (+467k in January with +709k of revisions to the prior two months) and a stronger-than-expected CPI inflation report (7.5% y/y).”"

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble rose more than 2% versus the dollar on Tuesday as Russia said some troops near Ukraine were returning to their bases after military exercises, easing concerns over a potential invasion that had fuelled a Russian asset sell-off last week.
Following days of U.S. and British warnings that Moscow might invade its neighbour at any time, Russia's statement that it was withdrawing some forces from near the border helped the currency, stocks and bonds rebound.
Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade Ukraine. NATO said it had yet to see any sign of de-escalation on the ground. 
By 1252 GMT, the rouble was 2.1% stronger against the dollar at 75.15, close to recouping all losses sustained in the currency's sharpest single-session drop in nearly two years on Friday.
The rouble strengthened 1.7% against the euro to 85.28.
""Market sentiment remains highly fragile, so volatility is bound to stay high,"" Sberbank CIB said in a note.
On Monday, the currency climbed after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested to President Vladimir Putin that Moscow should continue along the diplomatic path in its efforts to extract security guarantees from the West. 
Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko Invest, said the currency's reaction to those words showed that a single phrase can be sufficient to move the rouble strongly in either direction. 
""We still believe the rouble is likely to rise from these levels,"" he said, adding that the rouble has lagged other emerging market currencies by 5% to 7% this year.
One development that may complicate the currency's growth trajectory was parliament voting to appeal to Putin to recognise two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent.
Recognition of the two regions could unravel the existing Minsk peace process for east Ukraine to which Russia has said it is committed. 
""The shuttle diplomacy continues – as long as the West remains vocal on the issue, the market will continue to follow headlines, with the binary outcome (a further deterioration vs conciliation) suggesting significant up/downside,"" BCS Global Markets said.
Yields on Russia's 10-year benchmark OFZ bonds eased to 9.81% after spiking above 10% for the first time since February 2016 on Monday. Yields move inversely to prices. 
Russian stock indexes were up, recovering after a sell-off in the previous two sessions.

The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 5.6% to 1,505.1. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was up 3.1% at 3,590.9.
Shares in internet giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) rose 7.5%, outperforming the wider market after the company reported full-year results and said it is eyeing $6.5 billion in revenues in 2022.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday, but losses are minor with the Russia/Ukraine conflict generating safe haven flows and traders still mulling the potential for aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 96.220, having reached a two-week high on Monday.
Although the dollar has weakened slightly, this follows sharp gains over the last few sessions as tensions on the Ukraine border grew. The United States warned on Monday that Russia could soon invade, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the U.S. embassy would be relocated from Kyiv to Lviv, citing the ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces"".
“For now, it looks like markets are holding on to a mostly sanguine stance, even though Friday’s price action showed a shift to defensive trades,” said analysts at ING, in a note,
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1324, having touched 1.1278 the day before, its lowest in over a week, risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7118, while USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 115.30, after briefly hitting 114.99 on Monday, also a one-week low.
Earlier Tuesday, data showed that Japan’s economy expanded an annualised 5.4% in October-December, below expectations for a 5.8% gain, after contracting a revised 2.7% in the previous quarter.
Aside from the Ukraine conflict, traders are trying to gauge the Fed’s intentions when it next meets in March in terms of interest rate hikes.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard reiterated on Monday his call for the U.S. central bank to take decisive action, citing four strong inflation reports in a row.
Last week's stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer price index report, in particular, has raised expectations that the Fed might raise rates by a full 50 basis points in March.
“While we doubt the Fed will deliver half-point increases, ongoing market speculation in that direction can offer some support to the dollar, and 96.00 could represent a floor for DXY this week,” added ING.
Additionally, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3534, after the release of the latest U.K. employment data. Britain's unemployment rate for the three months to the end of December held at 4.1%, but the January claimant count fell almost 32,000, suggesting the labor market could be recovering from the Omicron hit.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, while geopolitical tensions over Ukraine weighed on the euro. However, the debate on how aggressively the U.S. should hike interest rate capped the dollar’s losses.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.15% to 96.210 by 12:29 AM ET (5:29 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.19% to 115.31.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 0.7115, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.6616.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.3542, while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3535.
The euro was at $1.1308 in early Asian trading, after hitting $1.1278 the day before, its lowest in a week-and-a-half. With moves also cautious elsewhere, the dollar was just below a two-week high hit on Monday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday called on citizens to fly the country's flags from buildings and sing the national anthem in unison on Feb. 16, the date when some Western media have predicted a possible Russian invasion. The comments spooked investors, but the comments were meant to be “sarcastic,” according to Zelenskiy’s office.
Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve officials continue to argue over how aggressively to begin upcoming interest rate hikes at their March meeting. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who called for a large 50 basis point increase in the previous week, repeated calls to hike interest rate faster on Monday.
However, Bullard’s colleagues were more cautious in their remarks, and the Fed will also release the minutes from its latest meeting on Wednesday. The Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its own meeting earlier in the day.
Tensions in Ukraine and the more aggressive outlooks for the Fed funds rate are both supportive for the dollar in the near term, Commonwealth Bank Of Australia senior currency strategist Kim Mundy told Reuters.
""Your best bet for seeing which is having a greater impact is to look at USD/JPY and we have seen that trading a little bit weaker in the last day or two, which suggests markets are very conscious of what's happening on the Ukraine border. We just have to keep watching the headlines and see what happens,"" she added.
The safe-haven yen is usually a beneficiary of runs towards safety, while the Bank of Japan’s dovish monetary policy compared with the U.S. policy is likely to push the yen even lower. The Japanese central bank said during the previous week that it would buy an unlimited amount of 10-year government bonds at 0.25%. However, investors did not test this 0.25% line on Monday.
The Russian rouble remained volatile but strengthened overall on Monday. It weakened again slightly during the Asian session."

SINGAPORE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan's recoil from a near four-year high has raised market nerves that a recent period of stability is ending, which could leave regional peers exposed especially as U.S. interest rates start to rise.
A steady yuan, along with robust exports and currency reserves, has helped shield Asia's emerging markets from the sort of exodus typically seen when developed market interest rates rise.
Yet slowing economic momentum and policy easing in China, amid expectations for as many as seven U.S. rate hikes this year, has cast a pall over the yuan outlook, historically an ill wind for neighbours.
""The yuan played a key role in stabilising Asian currencies in 2021 and even outperformed the dollar,"" said Claudio Piron, co-head of Asia fixed income and FX at Bofa Securities in Singapore.
But the policy headwinds can drag it about 5% to 6.70 per dollar this year, he predicts. 
""This yuan depreciation will have a negative spillover into Asian currencies, especially the South Korean won and Taiwan dollar.""
Already, volatility has returned for the yuan, which suffered its heaviest selling in seven months when it dropped sharply against the dollar on Jan. 27. The yuan is flat for the year so far, at about 6.36 per dollar.
A long rally in the Taiwan dollar has also paused and the South Korean won is trending downward and under pressure.
""The reasons that supported the yuan despite a weak economy are fading,"" said Ken Peng, head of investment strategy in Asia at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. 
""Bond inflows have already shrunk sharply as the positive carry disappeared,"" he said, and the trade surplus will probably retreat from record levels, leaving the yuan vulnerable, he thinks, to dropping to 6.50 per dollar this year.
Foreign holdings of Chinese bonds rose to a record of almost $400 billion last month, but flows have been slowing as the gap between Chinese and U.S. 10-year yields has almost halved since December.
FUNDS RETREAT
Analysts say a stable yuan provides a pillar of fundamental strength in the region as it reflects strong a Chinese economy. That is seen as positive for Asian exporters, reducing the immediate need for competitive currency devaluation.
While China's central bank has vowed to keep the currency stable, authorities have also been stressing the need to prepare for two-way volatility and analysts expect downward pressure to intensify as U.S. interest rates rise.
Previous bouts of weakness, such as a devaluation to support the economy in 2015 or its slide due to trade tensions in 2018, have typically led to pressure on currencies including the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Singapore dollar.
""If the yuan becomes more volatile, it would likely result in reduced foreign flows to China and likely hurt overall flows to Asia,"" said Mitul Kotecha, TD Securities' emerging markets strategist in Singapore.
He does not expect a repeat of the regional contagion seen in 2015, as China's outbound capital controls have since tightened, but he noted that the Philippines and Thailand appeared most vulnerable to foreign flows drying up.
So far the yuan has stopped rallying rather than fallen and the riskier corners of the region, such as Indonesia, have been remarkably resilient - a far cry from emerging markets' walloping in 2013 when the rupiah fell 17% in five months.
Indeed, Citi's Peng sees domestic factors as more relevant than any drag from the yuan and BofA's Piron thinks a Chinese economic recovery can eventually provide support. Inflation is also less pressing on Asian economies with faster growth.

Yet pressure could mount very quickly if the Federal Reserve starts raising rates as fast or faster than futures markets imply, and data suggests that the foreign equity investors left in the region already spent last month voting with their feet.
January's outflows from Asia were the biggest in six months, led by $4.4 billion running out of Indian stocks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index reached a two-week high on Monday on growing worries about Russia-Ukraine tensions and as St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard reiterated calls for faster U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
The index briefly jumped further in afternoon trading after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians to fly the country's flags from buildings and sing the national anthem in unison on Feb. 16, a date some Western media have cited as the possible start of a Russian invasion. 
The comments spooked investors, who have fled to the safe-haven dollar amid the escalating geopolitical problem, but the dollar index quickly came off those highs.
Ukrainian officials said Zelenskiy was not predicting an attack on that date, but instead responding with skepticism to foreign media reports.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was deeply worried about ""increased speculation"" about a military conflict, and urged world leaders to step up diplomacy to calm the situation.
Washington had said Russia could invade Ukraine ""any day now,"" and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday called the situation ""very, very dangerous."" 
""The big driver clearly is tensions in the Ukraine. Markets are in risk-off mode across the board. Implied volatilities are up,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
The dollar index was last up 0.4% at 96.3090 after reaching 96.4410, its highest since Feb. 1.
The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen at 115.57, while the dollar was also nearly flat against the Swiss franc at 0.9252 franc..
Earlier Monday, Bullard also said four strong inflation reports in a row warranted action and that the central bank needed to ""ratify"" market expectations of its upcoming moves.
Last week's stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer price index report has driven speculation the Fed might raise rates by a full 50 basis points in March.
""Clearly we still have the after shocks of last week's inflation report and St. Louis Fed president Bullard's comments,"" Schamotta said. ""We have traders positioning for a front-loaded tightening cycle.""
The move into safe-haven assets has overshadowed expectations for monetary policy tightening from the European Central Bank. ECB President Christine Lagarde also recently reiterated that any policy action would be gradual.
Against the dollar, the euro was down 0.4% at $1.1301.
The Fed will release its January meeting minutes on Wednesday.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 0.2% at around $42,169.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble pulled away from its weakest mark since late January on Monday in topsy-turvy trade, attempting to recover from its sharpest drop in nearly two years on Friday, after Russia proposed more diplomacy over European security concerns.
Moscow has dismissed renewed fears of an imminent incursion into Ukraine as Western hysteria, and repeatedly denied plans to invade. On Monday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested to President Vladimir Putin that Moscow continue with diplomacy. 
By 1407 GMT, the rouble was 0.8% stronger against the dollar at 76.74, swinging from 78.29, a level last seen on Jan. 28, to as strong as 75.93 during a volatile session. 
The rouble had weakened sharply last month to a near 15-month low of 80.4125 on the Ukraine crisis. 
It had pared those losses in recent weeks, hitting its strongest level on Thursday since early 2022, before falling again on Friday after the United States urged all its citizens to leave Ukraine within 48 hours.
""It makes sense to eliminate risks related to Russia to a maximum and to not take any active moves with Russian assets before the risk of a military scenario is gone,"" said Evgeny Suvorov, an economist at CentroCreditBank.
Against the euro, the rouble strengthened 1.1% to 86.62 after touching its weakest level since Jan. 27 of 88.6950.
Ukrainian and Russian dollar-denominated government bonds tumbled to the lowest of the crisis so far. Yields on Russia's benchmark 10-year rouble-denominated OFZ bonds hit 10.17%, their highest since February 2016. Yields move inversely to prices.
FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT
Even though the rouble is vulnerable to geopolitical fears, it retains fundamental support from Russia's record strong current account surplus fuelled by high commodity prices. It is also supported by the central bank's monetary tightening that, in theory, makes investing in rouble assets more attractive.
Russia jacked up its key interest rate to 9.5% last week and indicated a further rate increase was likely.
Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.6% at $93.84 a barrel, earlier hitting a more than seven-year high. 
Russian stock indexes fell to their lowest since late January.

The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 2.2% at 1,437.8 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index 1.5% lower at 3,492.0 points.
""Russian equities are again trading under pressure against the backdrop of more and more worrying news headlines around the Ukraine crisis,"" said Aton investment management firm.

World shares skidded and the safe-haven U.S. dollar gained ground against a basket of major currencies as the United States said Russia might create a surprise pretext for an attack on Ukraine.
Still, hints by Ukraine at possible concessions to Russia helped cap the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports.
U.S. crude prices fell 0.6% to $92.55 a barrel, while the Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.2752 to the greenback, or 78.42 U.S. cents. It touched its weakest intraday level since Feb. 4 at 1.2783.
North America's busiest trade link reopened for traffic late Sunday evening, ending a six-day blockade, the Canada Border Services Agency said, after Canadian police cleared the protesters fighting to end COVID-19 restrictions.
Canada's inflation report for January, due on Wednesday, could offer clues on the outlook for Bank of Canada interest rate hikes. Money markets expect the central bank to tighten next month for the first time since October 2018 to fight inflation.

Canadian government bond yields were higher across the curve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries.
The 10-year was up 3.3 basis points at 1.904%, after touching on Friday its highest intraday level in nearly three years at 1.961%.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has largely held on to last week’s gains with traders fretting over the potential of a war in Eastern Europe as well as high inflation and potentially aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 96.040, having climbed sharply at the end of last week.
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin any day.
""We cannot perfectly predict the day,” he said, “but we have now been saying for some time that we are in the window, and an invasion could begin -- a major military action could begin -- by Russia in Ukraine any day now.”
This has boosted the so-called safe haven currencies, with USD/JPY down 0.1% to 115.36 from a five-week high of 116.34 last week. 
On the flip side, EUR/USD was largely unchanged at 1.1349, well below last week's high of 1.1495, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7120, well below last week’s levels.
Additionally, USD/RUB fell 0.8% to 76.5920, with the ruble paring losses after earlier slumping to a two-week low. While these geopolitical tensions are weighing on the Russian currency, the country’s central bank on Friday delivered its third 100 basis-point interest-rate hike in less than a year, adding support. 
This volatile situation adds to reasons to support the dollar, after hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data last week raised expectations that the  Federal Reserve will start tightening its monetary policy with a 50 basis point interest rate hike in March.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly tried to rein in such expectations on Sunday, saying that being too ""abrupt and aggressive"" with interest rate increases could be counter-productive to the Fed's goals.
However, these views could be countered this week with Fed speakers out in force. St. Louis Fed’s Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are to speak on Thursday. On Friday Fed Governor Lael Brainard speaks, as do New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.
Additionally, Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed's January meeting, will be scrutinized for any indications on how big a move officials are contemplating.
“In advance of what could be a very aggressive Fed tightening cycle, we remain bullish on the dollar,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Currently we would favour that strength being played out selectively. But were Fed tightening to get out of hand, raising fears of recession, we would expect the dollar to rally more broadly.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, but losses were minimal as safe-haven currencies held gains and riskier ones struggled to hold onto them. Investors also remained concerned about potential conflict in Eastern Europe, alongside soaring inflation.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 96.082 by 12:04 PM ET (5:04 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 115.48.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.7118, with Australian jobs data due on Thursday and the possibility of surprising numbers driving Australian dollar volatility gauges to nearly one-year highs. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.38% to 0.6622.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.08% to 6.3597 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 1.3542.
Increasing concerns of a Russian invasion of Ukraine saw the euro tumble to $1.1360 from the previous week's high of $1.1495. The riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars also remained below the previous week's levels, and the Russian rouble saw its sharpest fall in nearly two years on Friday.
The U.S. sounded the alarm on Sunday that Russia could create a surprise pretext to invade its neighbor, which Russia has denied. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will head to Ukraine later in the day, followed by a trip to Moscow the day after, and warned of sanctions if an attack takes place.
The tension is the latest shock to a market already reeling from the previous week’s high U.S. inflation data. Although concerns about an emergency rate hike have somewhat subsided, some investors expect the dollar to stay supported.
""With Fed hike expectations surging again and geopolitical tensions in Ukraine escalating dramatically the dollar index should be back on the front foot again,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
The dollar steadied earlier in the session, with the euro, which dropped 1.2% on the yen on Friday, and oil importers' currencies viewed as most at risk from any conflict in Ukraine.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will address the European Parliament, while Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard will also speak to the media, later in the day.
The pound was steady, with investors convinced the Bank of England will hike its own rates in March 2022 and pricing about a 40% chance of a 50-basis point rise.
Across the Atlantic, the Fed will release the minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday. The previous week’s talk about an inter-meeting interest rate hike died down somewhat after the Fed released an unchanged bond-buying schedule for the coming month. The central bank will increase interest rates only after its buying has ceased."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The dollar rose along with other safe-haven assets on Friday after the United States said Russia has massed enough troops near Ukraine to launch a major invasion.
A Russian attack could begin any day and would likely start with an air assault, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told a media briefing.
The dollar had been trading mostly sideways when the U.S. warning hit markets. The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.258%.
U.S. crude futures jumped more than 5% to $94.66 a barrel, the highest since 2014, while gold rose more than 2% to a near two-month high at one point.
The dollar's rise was due to Sullivan's comments, as well as reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to invade Ukraine, which the White House later disputed, said Bipan Rai, head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
That move up, along with moves in other safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen, indicates the market is growing more and more concerned about the prospect of an invasion, said Rai.
""It’s definitely a safe-haven move,"" he said.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.63% versus the greenback at 115.29 per dollar, while the Canadian dollar weakened as the potential for an imminent Russian attack triggered a sell-off in risk-sensitive assets.
Russia's currency, already lower for the day, fell further on the news. The rouble was last down 2.73% versus the greenback at 77.00 per dollar.
Washington urged all U.S. citizens to leave the country within 48 hours. Other countries -- including Britain, Japan, Latvia, Norway and the Netherlands -- told their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately.
The euro, meanwhile, weakened as markets processed the news, and was set for a weekly decline after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in an interview that raising rates now would not bring down record euro zone inflation but only hurt the economy.
The greenback had struggled to pick a direction earlier in the day as investors digested the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment index for February. 
That report found that U.S. consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than a decade in early February amid expectations that inflation would continue to rise in the near term. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up.
The market's lack of clarity as to how interest rate hikes might progress has contributed to frenzied sessions this week as the dollar remains undecided on the future, said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. 
“I tend to think we consolidate in the short term here and am still biased toward euro downside, dollar upside against most currencies,” he said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, giving back some of this week's gains, as the potential for an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine triggered a selloff in risk-sensitive assets.
Wall Street tumbled and safe-havens such as U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar rallied after Washington said Russia has massed enough troops near Ukraine to launch a major invasion.
""It's a flight to safety trade and that always works in favor of the U.S. dollar,"" said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco.
""I would be a little concerned about having open positions over the course of the weekend.""
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2742 to the greenback, or 78.78 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2670 to 1.2754. For the week, the loonie was up 0.2%.
Still, the loonie fell by much less than some other currencies on Friday, as escalating Ukraine tensions added to concern about tight supply in the market for oil, one of Canada's major exports. U.S. crude oil futures settled 3.6% higher at $93.10 a barrel.
Meanwhile, Canada's Ontario province declared a state of emergency and threatened to fine and jail protesters who have been blocking a key U.S. trade corridor for four days.
The disruption to trade could weigh on Canadian economic activity in the first quarter but is unlikely to derail an interest rate hike next month by the Bank of Canada, say analysts.

""The latest disruptions will raise prices and lead to shortages of some goods,"" said Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins. ""Monetary policy will be guided by inflation and inflation expectations.""
Canadian government bond yields fell across the curve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year was down 7.6 basis points at 1.861.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are piling into derivatives linked to a rising euro, according to industry data and trading sources, as they bet the European Central Bank's hawkish tilt means the end to eight years of negative interest rates.
The euro has hit three-month highs near $1.15 since the ECB opened the door to a rate increase later in 2022 and said that a March 10 meeting would be crucial in deciding how quickly the central bank would reduce its bond-buying scheme.
ECB policymakers, including President Christine Lagarde, have since struck a more dovish tone. But many traders believe the shift in thinking is evident and markets must catch up with an ECB finally ready to tighten -- even if not as fast as rivals.
""There was not a lot priced in (to the euro) and people have been forced to look at the ECB and when it could tighten. German inflation is very high,"" said Antony Foster, head of G10 spot trading, EMEA, at Japanese bank Nomura. 
The end of negative rates would mark a significant moment for euro zone markets, which have suffered persistent outflows and currency weakness that analysts attribute to sub-0% rates.
Those rates have made the euro a favourite for hedge funds to engage in lucrative carry trades -- the equivalent of borrowing in low-yielding currencies to invest in relatively higher-yielding ones. 
A strategy of borrowing euros and investing them in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and sterling posted a return of 5.3% last year, the highest since 2015, according to Refinitiv data.
Vasileios Gkionakis, head of European FX strategy at Citibank, said that the mentality of regarding the euro as a cheap currency to borrow was beginning to disappear.
""The ECB decision was a game changer for the euro,"" he said. ""While we don't expect the euro and rest of the world yield differential to shrink dramatically, it is a big change in sentiment.""
Nomura's Foster said clients had been buying large numbers of euro call options -- which give traders the right to buy euros in future at pre-determined prices -- between 1-month and 1-year maturities.
This includes call options on euro/dollar, on euro/Swiss franc and against Britain's sterling, which had hit a two-year high versus the single currency before the ECB meeting.
""The BoE seems to have moved early and that's been priced. But there could be a lot further for euro pricing to go,"" Foster added, referring to the Bank of England's rate increases in December and this month.
Industry data shows a shift in positioning in derivatives markets on euro/dollar -- a currency pair that has been stuck in a relatively tight trading range since 2015, frustrating bank traders that profit from higher volatility.
Three-month risk reversals on euro/dollar, a ratio of calls to puts on the single currency, have bounced from -0.7 to -0.2 this week, the highest level since July.
MORE MOMENTUM
Not everyone is bullish on the euro, and Thursday's forecast-beating U.S. inflation reading has markets once again betting on even faster tightening in the United States.
Analysts at HSBC argue that the United States has higher growth and high inflation that justifies ""persistent tightening"", whereas hiking euro zone rates would do little to resolve its stagflation.
Euro zone labour markets have much more slack to absorb workers before wage pressures build and ECB policymakers could easily flip back towards their decade-long dovish setting if inflation subsides.
The ECB will also be wary of any hawkish pricing that whacks up borrowing costs in the likes of Italy and Greece, where government bond yields have risen this month.
Speculative euro long positioning in futures markets has not increased in recent months, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows, even as economic data in the region has improved.
But it means the euro should have further to climb if positioning shifts.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this week said euro/dollar ""fair value"" was $1.30. 

Faster Fed rate increases could hold back the euro in the short term, Goldman's analysts said, but they raised their year-end euro/dollar forecast to $1.20 from a previous $1.15, with a further rise to $1.25 predicted for end-2023 and $1.30 at end-2024.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar climbed strongly Friday, after soaring consumer prices lifted expectations the Federal Reserve will aggressively hike interest rates this year, starting next month. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% higher at 95.915.
Data released Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices rising 7.5% year-on-year in January, the highest annual increase in 40 years, and the fourth straight month above 6%.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard followed the release by stating that he has become ""dramatically"" more hawkish, calling for a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three U.S. central bank policy meetings.
The market has responded, with the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury climbing past 2% for the first time since August 2019, and rates futures are now pricing in a better-than-two-in-three chance of a 50 bp hike next month.
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs now expects seven 25 basis point interest rate rises from the Fed, up from its previous forecast of five.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 116.06, after climbing to a five-week high of 116.34 overnight, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.6% to 0.7126.
EUR/USD fell 0.4% to 1.1385, with the euro already weakened by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde rowing back on the hawkish impression made at the central bank’s policy meeting last week, warning that the Governing Council would harm the Eurozone economy’s rebound from the pandemic if it were to rush to tighten monetary policy.
GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3537, with sterling receiving some support from economic data showing the U.K. economy expanded at the fastest pace since World War II last year after suffering a milder hit than expected in December.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2% in December as the Omicron variant hit restaurant and hospitality sectors, but the economy still expanded by 7.5% last year, the most since 1941.
Elsewhere, EUR/SEK traded 0.1% lower at 10.6092 while USD/SEK rose 0.3% to 9.3164 after the Riksbank maintained its dovish monetary policy stance despite the global shift toward tightening.
“Even if the risk of too low inflation is assessed to have declined, it still remains,” the Riksbank said in a statement on Thursday. 
USD/RUB traded 0.1% lower at 74.9597 ahead of the latest policy-meeting by the Bank of Russia. The central bank is expected to deliver a third 100 basis-point increase in its key interest rate in less than a year later Friday to 9.5%, with inflation still seen as a major issue."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, with higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data and hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve policymaker accelerating expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes. However, similar pressures globally capped gains.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.32% to 95.852 by 10:19 PM ET (3:19 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 116.08, with Japanese markets closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.27% to 0.7146 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.6654.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.3604 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3546.
The U.S. inflation data showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 7.5% year-on-year, and 0.6% month-on-month, in January. The core CPI grew 0.6% month-on-month and 6% year-on-year. It also prompted St. Louis Fed President James Bullard to say that the Fed should hike rates by 100 basis points over the next three meetings.
U.S. Treasuries climbed and the dollar rose to a five-week high against the yen during a volatile session overnight. The U.S. currency also vacillated against other currencies, before broadly firming earlier in the Asia session.
""There is definitely a feeling of urgency at least for some (Fed) members,"" Commonwealth Bank Of Australia strategist Kim Mundy told Reuters.
""But the Fed isn't the only central bank facing this inflation conundrum,"" with a hawkish pivot at the European Central Bank (ECB) during the previous week potentially capping dollar gains by removing a headwind for the euro, Mundy added.
The ECB will update its economic projections in March 2022, where bond markets expect an even more hawkish turn. Swaps pricing is also pointing to a nearly 30% chance the Bank of England will hike interest rates by 50 bps next month.
Even central banks that have stuck to a more dovish approach, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), are changing their tune. RBA Governor Philip Lowe said earlier in the day that if the economic recovery hits forecasts, interest rate hikes could potentially take place in 2022.
The Australian dollar is set for a weekly rise of nearly 1% despite the dollar's Friday strength, while its New Zealand counterpart is also heading for a second consecutive weekly gain.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan also committed to buying an unlimited amount of 10-year bonds at 0.25% on Thursday, in response to several days of selling pressure in the Japanese bond market."
262,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 06:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that the Governing Council would harm the economy’s rebound from the pandemic if it were to rush to tighten monetary policy.   
Raising interest rates “would not solve any of the current problems,” she told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland in an interview released on Friday. “On the contrary: if we acted too hastily now, the recovery of our economies could be considerably weaker and jobs would be jeopardized.” 
While Lagarde said that the ECB “will act if necessary,” she went on to reiterate her view expressed to lawmakers on Monday that “all of our moves will need to be gradual.”
The remarks continue a softer message since Lagarde’s surprise pivot last week where she no longer excluded a rate hike this year, a shift toward the stance of global peers that prompted bets on faster tightening. That followed a run of surging inflation including the highest readings since the euro was created. 
Lagarde stressed that the euro zone can’t be compared to other major jurisdictions.
“The U.S. economy is overheated, whereas our economy is far from being that,” she said. “That’s why we can -- and must -- proceed more cautiously. We don’t want to choke off the recovery.”
Policy makers privately see a change in formal guidance materializing as soon as next month, when they’ll get new economic forecasts and reassess their bond-buying. 
“Inflation may turn out to be higher than we projected in December,” Lagarde said. “We will analyze that in March, and then take it from there.”
A growing number of ECB policy makers are losing faith in the institution’s current inflation forecasting, emboldening their shift toward hiking rates, officials with knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg.
Lagarde cautioned that inflation is only likely to exceed the 2% goal in the medium term if wages were to “significantly and persistently” breach that level. 
“We are not seeing that at the moment at all,” she said. “In most euro-area countries, including Germany, wage demands are very moderate.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar swung in choppy trade on Thursday after U.S. consumer prices rose higher than forecast in January, leading markets to boost expectations for the Federal Reserve to aggressively fight soaring inflation.
The consumer price index rose 0.6% from December, the Labor Department said, while in the 12 months through January, CPI jumped 7.5%, the biggest year-on-year gain since February 1982.
The data marked the fourth straight month of annual gains in excess of 6% and made St Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee, ""dramatically"" more hawkish, he said.
The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against six major currencies, initially rose almost 0.5%. It then slumped 0.4% and ended almost flat. It was last up 0.08%.
Higher interest rates typically would lift the dollar, but the market is already sufficiently long dollars, said Bipan Rai, head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. 
""Markets are keen to take profits on those existing long dollar positions,"" Rai said. ""The market has the Fed priced fairly aggressively not just for this year but for next year as well."" 
Chances of a 50 basis point interest-rate hike rose to more than the likelihood of a 25 basis point increase as was expected before. 
The market also considered how other central banks will fight inflation that's on the rise globally, driven especially by rising commodity prices. 
""This broader, widespread pricing pressures is a global story,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. ""We're starting to see a lot of these other advanced economies are now becoming more aggressive in tackling inflation.""
Rates, especially at the short end, soared after the CPI data was released. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with rate expectations, rose 26.1 basis points to 1.609%. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes topped 2% for the first time in 2-1/2 years.
The rates market was questioning the extent of inflation, said Nancy Davis, managing partner and chief investment officer at Quadratic Capital Management LLC.
""I don't think CPI is giving us the whole picture. Given the forward guidance from the Fed, the rates market is priced for disinflation.""
Earlier in Europe, the Swedish central bank kept its monetary policy plans broadly unchanged and stressed its view that surging inflation is temporary. 
The dovish stance by the Riksbank led the dollar to post its biggest gain among major currencies, leading the Swedish crown to fall 2.01% versus the greenback at 9.31 per dollar.
The euro rose 0.11% to $1.1434.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.43% at 115.99 per dollar to hit a five-week low. The Bank of Japan said it would intervene in markets by offering to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year Japanese government bonds at 0.25%.
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last fell 1.11% to $43,985.20.

264,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 04:06PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback on Thursday as data showing that U.S. inflation soared to a 40-year high in January raised expectations for aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
U.S. bond yields climbed and the greenback rallied against a basket of major currencies as the U.S. consumer price index climbed at an annual rate of 7.5%, fueling speculation of a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Fed next month.
The Canadian dollar was down 0.3% at 1.2707 to the greenback, or 78.70 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2666 to 1.2717.
The decline for the currency came as the shutdown of a vital U.S.-Canada trade route due to protests against Canada's pandemic measures began to weigh on automakers' operations. 
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, was pressured by the potential for U.S.-Iran nuclear talks to lead to an increase in global crude supplies. U.S. crude prices fell 0.5% to $89.26 a barrel.

Canadian government bond yields were higher across the curve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries.
The 10-year rose 4.7 basis points at 1.894%, moving closer to the 1.905% peak it reached in January, which was its highest level in nearly three years.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded largely unchanged Thursday with the focus on the release of the latest U.S. inflation report later in the day which should provide clues about the pace of the Federal Reserve’s policy tightening. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded flat at 95.505, having moved little this week, in contrast to the volatile two weeks prior.
The January U.S. consumer prices release is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and the headline CPI is seen rising 0.5% on the month and 7.3% on the year in January, the highest number since 1982.
The Federal Reserve is expected to lift interest rates by 25 basis points in March to combat these surging prices, and the question in most traders’ minds is whether this CPI number will be enough to nudge the Fed towards a 50 bp hike.
Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday that it is time for the central bank to begin raising interest rates, but “I don't think there's any compelling case to start with a 50 basis point"" rate increase. 
This view seems to match the majority of her fellow policymakers who have commented, but a very high CPI print could still sway the argument.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1428, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3541, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 115.60, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7182, nearing a three-week high.
The Riksbank holds its latest policy-setting meeting later Thursday, and the hawkish pivot by the European Central Bank last week has started to put pressure on Sweden’s comparatively dovish central bank.
“Inflation is heating up, but the Riksbank is still lukewarm. The Riksbank takes notice of the strong economy and the uncertain inflation prospects, but the bank is probably not particularly worried about the situation,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. 
EUR/SEK traded 0.1% lower at 10.4035 and USD/SEK also down 0.1% at 9.1061.
Earlier in the day, the Reserve Bank of India kept its policy rates unchanged, and provided a dovish outlook for inflation for FY23, forecasting it at 4.5%. This surprised many in the market, resulting in USD/INR rising 0.2% to 74.952.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, holding a narrow range, while the riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars were near multi-week highs. Investors now turn their attention to the latest U.S. inflation data.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 95.552 by 12:39 PM ET (5:39 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.10% to 115.61.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.7174, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6883.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to inched down 6.3588 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3531.
The Australian dollar was not far from the $0.7194 touched the day before, which was near a three-week high.
Westpac analysts said in a note that the ""explosion higher in metals markets, lift in global risk sentiment and a softish U.S. dollar"" was supporting the Australian currency, adding ""a close above $0.7183 would suggest a further extension towards $0.7225 and possibly $0.7275.""
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar was near the two-week high of $0.66975 hit on Wednesday. The improved risk sentiment also weighed slightly on the safe-haven yen, which traded near the weak end of a recent range.
However, currencies were broadly stuck in a holding pattern ahead of the U.S. data, which includes the consumer price index and due later in the day. The data could also provide further clues about the U.S. Federal Reserve's timeline to tighten its monetary policy.
Investors are ramping up bets that the Fed will hike interest rates when it meets in March. However, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester on Wednesday said that she did not see a compelling case to start with a 50-basis point rate increase.
However, Mester added that future rate increases after March would depend on the strength of inflation and how much it moderates or persists.
Both U.S. and European government bond yields have been on an upward trend as expectations of interest rate hikes increase. These expectations quietened on Wednesday and Thursday morning, however, with yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year notes at 1.9354% in early Asian trading Thursday. This was slightly below Tuesday's 1.970%, which was a 27-month high.
The euro traded at 1.1416, edging lower throughout the week after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday that she saw no need for an excessively tight monetary policy, calming expectations of a hike in 2022."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slid further on Wednesday and the euro extended gains following a hawkish shift from the European Central Bank last week and ahead of key data on U.S. consumer prices due on Thursday.
The CPI print may offer new indications about the pace of the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening, and investors are bracing for higher-than expected numbers that would signal more aggressive interest rate hikes. 
That readout is expected to show a 0.5% month-over-month increase in January, and 7.3% for the year, according to economists polled by Reuters. 
Investors have been revising their forecasts for ECB rate hikes after the bank caught them off guard last week, with President Christine Lagarde flagging for the first time that monetary tightening was a possibility this year.
Seeking to temper investors' growing expectations for hard-line action, Lagarde calmed markets when she said on Monday there was no need for extensive tightening.
But the big shift in central bank policy expectations over the past week, in particular from the ECB, has dampened the dollar's recent upside. 
As the markets work through Lagarde's comments and what Thursday's inflation numbers mean for the Fed, the dollar will likely remain range-bound, said Thomas Anderson, managing director at Moneycorp.
""I think the market is kind of scratching its head and saying, 'OK, corporate earnings are over, the Lagarde comments — we're still kind of scratching our head. Does this mean this is the inflection point and we go up from here?'"" he said.
The dollar index fell 0.056%, with the euro up 0.1% to $1.1425.
While the markets await clarity, the dollar and the euro were ""consolidating within yesterday's ranges,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
""I think that the bottom line for the ECB and the Fed is there's a lot of uncertainty, and so they want to maintain maximum flexibility,"" he said. ""The Fed and the ECB need to maintain flexibility and people read into it what they want to.""
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday that future rate increases after March will depend on the strength of inflation and how much it moderates or persists.
Also on Wednesday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the U.S. economy may be nearing a turn lower in inflation, though he added he was still leaning toward a slightly faster pace of interest rate increases this year.

Investing.com -- The U.S. dollar edged lower Wednesday, but remained in a tight range the day before the release of key inflation data which could confirm the start of the Federal Reserve’s policy tightening process. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.580, after bouncing off a 2-1/2-week low of 95.136 reached Friday. 
The speed and timing of when central banks across the world start to lift interest rates is the main factor driving the foreign exchange markets these days, and in particular the Federal Reserve given the importance of the U.S. economy to global growth.
The dollar received a boost at the end of last week with the release of a much stronger than expected jobs report, and Thursday’s consumer price index should cement expectations that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates next month.
The headline CPI is seen rising 0.5% on the month and 7.3% on the year in January, climbing to a four-decade high. Most in the market expected the Fed to lift interest rates by 25 basis points in March, a stronger print could offer support to those tipping a larger 50 basis point rise.
“We think that Friday’s payrolls numbers have helped build a floor under the dollar as markets should continue to cement their hawkish views on Fed tightening into the March meeting,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1412, retreating from the highs seen last week after the European Central Bank policy meeting, as President Christine Lagarde tried Monday to rein in these expectations for aggressive action with growth in the Eurozone still fragile.
“We still think that the market pricing of more than 50bp of higher overnight rates, i.e. around two 25bp rate hikes, until the end of the year looks excessive,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Additionally, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3538, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 115.45, after the pair briefly touched a one-month high, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7148.
USD/PLN rose 0.1% to 3.9652 and EUR/PLN was flat at 4.5240, the day after Poland’s central bank lifted its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 2.75%, increasing interest rates for a fifth consecutive month to an almost nine-year high in an attempt to curb record inflation levels.
Later Wednesday, the Riksbank holds its latest policy-setting meeting, with the markets increasingly looking at still-dovish central banks given the recent shift in many of their peers.
“The Swedish economy has overall developed better than projected by the Riksbank,” said Nordea, and “the development is strong enough for the Riksbank to trim its balance sheet.”
“However, we do not expect inflation to remain high long enough for the Riksbank to consider a rate hike.”
EUR/SEK traded 0.1% lower at 10.4226 and USD/SEK also down 0.1% at 9.1358.

The bank said it sold $696 million to facilitate a transfer from the National Fund to the state budget, while state-controlled companies sold $346.5 million.
The regulator also sold $239.8 million from its own reserves on Jan. 12-13 to support the local tenge currency when trading resumed after violent unrest in the oil-rich Central Asian nation.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia despite U.S. Treasury yields climbing to multi-year highs. Investors now await U.S. inflation data due on Thursday for clues of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s timeline on interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.16% to 95.490 by 10:42 PM ET (3:42 AM GMT).
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to as high as 1.97% on Tuesday, not seen since Nov.2019.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 115.38.
The AUD/USD pair jumped 0.24% to 0.7162 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.6659.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.08% to 6.3614 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 1.3564. Chinese state-backed funds stepped into the stock market to buy local stocks Tuesday afternoon after the biggest intraday drop of the benchmark index since August 2021.
European Central Bank’s president Christine Lagarde said on Monday that there is no need for extensive tightening, tapping down rising expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes.
The euro jumped 2.7% during the previous week after Lagarde opened the door a crack to a potential interest rate hike in the same week.
The dollar index is ""in a holding pattern while markets weigh up the prospect of an abrupt Fed policy tightening against the ECB's hawkish backflip,"" Westpac analysts wrote in a client note.
Although a more hawkish ECB might cap dollar gains near-term, the dollar's “medium-term bull trend is still intact,” and the dollar index is a buy on dips to the low 95 level, the notes added.
Investors now await U.S. inflation data, including the consumer price index, due on Thursday for more clues on the timeline of the interest rate hikes.
Investors are betting on more than a 70% chance of a 25 basis point hike and a near 25 basis point hike and a nearly 30% chance for a 50 basis point hike when U.S. policymakers meet in March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Tuesday that U.S. inflation might even go higher before getting better."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, giving back some of the previous day's sharp gains, as oil prices fell and domestic data showed a surprise trade deficit.
The loonie was trading 0.3% lower at 1.2706 to the greenback, or 78.70 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2665 to 1.2721.
""Some of that weakness has been attributed to the pullback we're seeing with crude prices,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. ""The relentless rally with oil it seems to be showing some exhaustion.""
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell as investors worried the resumption of indirect talks between the United States and Iran could revive an international nuclear agreement and allow more oil exports from the OPEC producer.
U.S. crude oil futures settled 2.2% lower at $89.36 a barrel, while the U.S. dollar advanced against a basket of major currencies. It was supported by the Federal Reserve's recent hawkish tone. 
""Markets are bracing for an aggressive Fed and that could be confirmed with the inflation report later this week.""
U.S. consumer price index data for January is due on Thursday.
On Monday, the loonie climbed 0.8%, its biggest gain in nearly four weeks.
Canada posted a trade deficit of C$137 mln in December, much different than the C$2.5 billion surplus that economists had expected, as imports hit a new record high and exports fell from November. 

Canadian government bond yields were higher across much of the curve, with the 10-year up 1.6 basis points at 1.854%.
It fell 2.5 basis points further below its U.S. equivalent to a gap of 10.3 basis points in favor of the U.S. bond, the biggest gap since September last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar strengthened and the euro weakened in sideways trade on Tuesday, a day after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tapped down expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes that have spooked bond markets.
A more hawkish tone from both the ECB and the Federal Reserve last week caught markets off guard and sent yields soaring on euro zone and U.S. debt in anticipation rates could rise faster and higher than previously expected. 
Currencies broadly traded little changed as the market awaits U.S. consumer price data on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the year-over-year CPI in January was 7.3%.
The dollar index rose 0.2%, with the euro down 0.21% to $1.1418.
Expectations of a rate rise in tandem have caused some topsy-turvy market response not fully fleshed out in the price action, said John Kicklighter, chief strategist at DailyFX.
""It inevitably has to snap back to some sense of normalcy,"" Kicklighter said, suggesting the notion of up to seven Fed rate hikes this year is too aggressive and unlikely to happen.
""Eventually the markets will have to back off of their extreme expectations and that's probably what's going to settle some of this drive and volatility,"" he said. 
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries topped 1.97% on Tuesday, the highest since November 2019 and a jump from about 1.73% just two weeks ago. 
Markets are pricing in more than a 70% chance of a 25 basis point hike and a nearly 30% chance for a 50 basis point hike when U.S. policymakers meet in March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.
""The market is broadly sideways as we wait for Thursday’s CPI, which everybody knows is going to be up,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. 
""It's all about what's going on in the debt market,"" he said. ""For the second day in a row the two-year German yield is softer, and that stops a nine-day increase. It had to do with Lagarde's pushback yesterday.""
The German two-year bund surged to -0.328% on Monday, up from -0.654 on Jan. 25. The yield slid 0.4 basis points lower on Tuesday to -0.30%. 
Bond concerns were particularly acute for the so-called peripheral economies in Europe where inflation-adjusted Italian yields are close to entering positive territory.
Lagarde struck a more cautious tone, saying high inflation is unlikely to get entrenched and ECB council member Pablo Hernandez de Cos on Tuesday said any central bank move ""has to be gradual"".
""Can the euro go higher if periphery spreads blow out and if Italian 10-year real yields turn positive? Can the economy cope with that?"" said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London. ""That is the million dollar question investors are asking.""
Investors are looking carefully at the future trajectory between European and U.S. rates, as the Fed is likely to lift rates more than the ECB in coming months.
While money markets were pricing in as much as 134 bps in cumulative rate hikes from the Fed this year, analysts were expecting 50 bps in hikes from the ECB.
Still, the short-term outlook has tilted in favor of the single currency, with the widely watched bond yield spread between U.S. and German 10-year debt narrowing in late January to around 170 bps from an April high of 194 bps.
Bitcoin punched through its 50-day average to top $44,000 for the first time in nearly a month on Monday and held there in Asia for a gain of more than 17% in four sessions. 
Bitcoin last fell 1.72% to $43,346.00.

The dollar has made something of a comeback this week, after a strong bout of selling last week, as Friday’s very strong jobs report, with 467,000 nonfarm payrolls recorded, fortified rate hike expectations for March.
“A surprisingly strong U.S. January NFP jobs report provided some support to the dollar and reminded us that the Fed is still likely to lead the hawkish re-assessment of central bank policy underway around the world,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
These expectations are likely to be further bolstered by Thursday's U.S. consumer price index release.
“The U.S. CPI figure … is the main event for this week and it is set for another upbeat figure,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “The consensus points to a headline of 7.3% with underlying prices to reach 5.9%. Our models point towards an upside risk.”
Futures markets are pricing an almost 1-in-3 chance of a 50 basis point rate rise in March, and a CPI number at a four-decade high would boost this likelihood, further supporting the dollar.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1401, dropping further back from its highest level since mid-January which it reached late last week after the European Central Bank hinted at policy action in the form of rate hikes later in the year.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde attempted to rein in these expectations in a speech late Monday, acknowledging that Eurozone inflation risks are on the rise but adding price pressures could still subside before becoming entrenched in expectations.
""We have to bear in mind that demand conditions in the euro area do not show the same signs of overheating that can be observed in other major economies,"" Lagarde told the European Parliament's committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Additionally, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3525, USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 115.52, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7117.
USD/PLN rose 0.4% to 3.9790 and EUR/PLN climbed 0.1% to 4.5358, with Poland’s central bank likely to raise borrowing costs later Tuesday for a fifth consecutive month in an attempt to curb record inflation levels.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia. A strong euro remained just below strong resistance levels as U.S. inflation data due later in the week, wary that it could trigger gains for the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.22% to 95.605 by 1:36 PM ET (5:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.28% to 115.44.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.7108 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.6631.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.3606 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 1.3514.
The euro jumped 2.7% during the previous week after the European Central Bank (ECB) sprang a surprise hawkish shift in tone during the previous week. The single currency has held gains but was unable to beat resistance around the $1.1483 mark. European bond yields were on an upward trend and the euro last bought $1.1441.
A much stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report during the previous week emphasized the spotlight on inflation, as investors bet on the implications for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening deadline.
Futures markets are pricing a 1-in-3 chance that the Fed will hike interest rates by 50-basis points in March 2022, and the probability of aggressive hikes afterward has given the dollar a boost.
""The surprise beat by the non-farm payroll numbers (which we were warned by Fed officials and the White House would be very weak due to Omicron) leaves the Fed in an unexpected territory,"" NatWest Markets rates strategist Jan Nevruzi told Reuters.
""The CPI will be critical on how the narrative develops until the March (meeting),"" he added, while also predicting that barring a big surprise, March will probably bring only a 25-basis points hike.
Although Tuesday looks to be quiet in terms of data releases, investors are already looking ahead to the U.S. inflation data, including the consumer price index, due on Thursday.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose above its 50-day average to top the $44,000 mark for the first time in nearly a month on Monday. It is currently up more than 17% in four sessions."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves fell by $3.6 billion in January to $141.3 billion, a level equivalent to 7.6 months of imports, the central bank said on Tuesday.
Bank Indonesia in a statement attributed the drop to repayment of public debt and a reduction in the level of commercial banks' foreign currency placement at the central bank. It said the end-January level of reserves remained adequate to support macroeconomic and financial system stability.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar and the euro both eased on Monday after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde calmed market expectations of a quick hike in interest rates that pushed regional bond yields in Europe up to multi-year highs. 
There is no need for big monetary policy tightening in the euro zone as inflation is set to decline and could stabilize around the ECB's target of 2%, Lagarde told a European Parliament hearing.
Last week the ECB opened the door to a rate hike later in 2022 as inflation risks rose, while data showing an unexpected jump in U.S. jobs created in January also raised speculation of a faster timetable for the Federal Reserve to hike rates.
The new rate expectations for both the Fed and ECB pit the dollar and euro against each other as to which will gain an upper hand. U.S. consumer price data to be released on Thursday is poised to be a key data point determinant. 
""The euro-dollar will be in a kind of tug of war between these two forces, but ultimately with CPI in the U.S., we're probably due for a bit more of a dollar recovery,"" said Kathy Lien, a managing director at BK Asset Management. 
A Reuters poll of economists showed they expect year-over-year CPI to have climbed to 7.3% in January.
The major currencies traded in a tight range near break-even. The dollar index fell 0.045%, with the euro down 0.03% to $1.1443.
The ECB last week got the ball moving in a positive direction for the euro, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
""Now the focus has shifted to U.S. inflation, which the market will use to figure out whether the Fed goes by 25 basis points or 50 basis points next month,"" Manimbo added.
Markets have now priced in a one-in-three chance the Fed might hike by a full 50 basis points in March, and a reasonable chance rates will reach 1.5% by year end. [FEDWATCH]
The European common currency hit its highest since mid-January on Friday, driven by the hawkish turn from the ECB.
Not everyone is convinced of a hawkish ECB tilt.
""We don't believe the ECB is bracing for a sudden acceleration of tightening. We still see the Fed as being on track to move well ahead of the ECB, providing support for the dollar,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Haefele said he expects the euro to fall to $1.10 by year-end and the dollar gaining versus the Swiss franc to finish the year at 0.98 francs per dollar, from 0.92 currently.
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 2.4 basis points at 1.298%. The yield on two-year German bonds fell by 3.5 bps to -0.29%, after hitting its highest since September 2015 at -0.21%.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 115.06 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3536, up 0.05% on the day. 
Bitcoin rose to a four-week high, driven in part by liquidation of some short positions that have accumulated in the virtual currency's recent three-month downtrend.
The cryptocurrency climbed 8.94% to $44,279.81, after jumping 11% late on Friday.

At 1134 GMT, the rouble gained 0.5% to 75.44 against the dollar, its strongest level since Jan. 13.
The most likely range for the rouble in coming days is 74.50-76.50, Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at LockoInvest, said.
Versus the euro, the rouble firmed 0.6% to 86.38 .
The rouble has moved away from a near 15-month low of 80.4125 hit last month when Western powers threatened to impose more sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied having any such plans.
The market will be keeping an eye on President Vladimir Putin's meeting with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Monday. The Kremlin said there could be an announcement about the meeting after 1600 GMT.
Traders will also be looking ahead to Friday, when the Bank of Russia is widely expected to raise its key interest rate from 8.5% in its fight against stubbornly high inflation.
Higher rates support the rouble by making investment into rouble-denominated assets more attractive.
Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.4% at $92.90 a barrel but traded near its highest levels since 2014 of $94.00 it reached earlier on Monday. [O/R]

The dollar-denominated RTS index rose 1.1% to 1,451.3 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.2% higher at 3,477.8 points.

Investing.com -- The U.S. dollar edged higher Monday, helped by the strong U.S. jobs data, while the euro edged off Friday’s three-week peak as traders continued to digest the European Central Bank’s hawkish turn. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.1% higher to 95.615.
The dollar has been helped by Friday’s very strong jobs report, with 467,000 nonfarm jobs added in January, way more than expected, while, even more strikingly, the government revised up payroll data for November and December by a combined total of over 700,000.
This has embolden rate hike expectations, said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The market sees more than an almost 45% chance of a 50 bp hike in March and nearly 145 bp of tightening over the next 12 months. At the end of last year, about 85 bp of tightening was discounted.”
These expectations could be bolstered by the U.S. consumer price index due Thursday, with both the headline and core monthly CPI figures seen rising by 0.5%, resulting in annual numbers of 7.3% and 5.9%, respectively. 
Also helping the dollar is its safe haven status, after the White House warned on Sunday that Russia could invade Ukraine any day, with diplomacy struggling to contain the situation even as French President Emmanuel Macron heads to Moscow.
The euro has drifted lower Monday, with EUR/USD trading 0.1% lower at 1.1432, having hit its highest level since mid-January on Friday after the European Central Bank expressed more concern over the region’s inflationary pressures than expected last week.
Klaas Knot, the Dutch central bank president and a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, continued the theme on Sunday, stating that he expects the ECB to raise interest rates in the fourth quarter of this year.
That said, Knot is known as one of the more hawkish members of the ECB's board, and a broader range of members will need to be persuaded before the central bank starts lifting rates.
“The ECB found its inner hawk and joined many other central banks in hinting at tightening ahead. We note that the inflation outlook remains very uncertain but conclude that market pricing has become too aggressive,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3542, just off the two-week high of 1.3626 reached on Thursday after the Bank of England raised rates by 25 basis points, USD/JPY edged higher to 115.23, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.4% to 0.7105, rebounding from last week’s selling after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe preaching patience in terms of rate hikes."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with the euro near a three-week high hit during the previous week. Investors continued to digest the European Central Bank (ECB)’s hawkish turn while saying further short-term gains are less likely as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s imminent interest rate provided support to the dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 95.545 by 11:03 PM ET (4:03 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 115.28.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7078, with Australia releasing retail sales data earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.6616.
The USD/CNY pair fell 0.44% to 6.3328, with Chinese data released earlier in the day showing that the Caixin services purchasing managers index was 51.4 in January.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3527.
Investors now await U.S. inflation data, including the consumer price index, due on Thursday. A strong reading could escalate bets of a Fed interest rate hike in March 2022.
The euro traded at $1.1451, not far from the high of $1.4183 hit during the previous week and near levels last hit in mid-January 2022. The dollar, meanwhile, received a late boost at the end of a bruising week from a strong U.S. jobs report.
The report showed that non-farm payrolls were at 467,000 in January and the unemployment rate was 4%. The safe-haven U.S. currency could also see further gains, according to some investors.
""We see the risk of more dollar upside in the near-term if interest rate markets price a greater chance of a 50bp hike in March. But the previous week’s hawkish turn by ECB President Christine Lagarde suggests any upside in the dollar will be capped,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia head of international economics Joe Capurso said in a note.
In the short term, ""with little fresh information from Europe likely this week to further boost market pricing for ECB hikes, material further upside to the euro is unlikely,” the note added.
Markets are pricing in a one-in-three chance that the Fed could start hiking interest rates in March, with a reasonable chance that rates will reach 1.5% by the end of 2022.
U.S. two-year yields were higher and near a two-year high at 1.32% on Monday, while benchmark 10-year yields were at 1.9049%.
Investors now await speeches from the Fed, ECB, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), and the Bank of Canada throughout the week. Klaas Knot, Dutch Central Bank president and a member of the ECB's governing council, said on Sunday he expects a hike in the fourth quarter of 2022."

Policymakers could increase yuan's flexibility, expand capital outflows, or control capital inflows to rein in the yuan, which could deviate from economic fundamentals in the short term, wrote Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International and a former official at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
The yuan also faces downward pressure from several market factors, including further strengthening of the dollar index, the shrinking spread between U.S. and Chinese yields, and the narrowing difference in the growth between the two economies, Guan wrote in an article published in the Shanghai Securities News on Monday.
Guan, who previously headed SAFE's balance of payments department, said that the yuan is already losing some momentum, citing shrinking trading volumes in the interbank forex market.

China's yuan hit a near four-year-high against the dollar on Jan. 26 and an index tracking yuan's value against a basket of currencies is flirting with the highest level since late 2015.
China has already taken some measures, including directing financial institutions to hold more foreign exchange in reserve, to slow down yuan's rapid appreciation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar advanced from two-week lows on Friday after data showed the world's largest economy created far more jobs than expected, raising the chances of a larger Federal Reserve interest rate increase at the March policy meeting.
The dollar index, a gauge of its value against six major currencies, rose 0.1% to 95.446, after falling to a two-week low of 95.136 earlier amid a resurgent euro.
But the dollar was still down 1.8% on the week, on pace for its largest weekly percentage decline since November 2020.
Data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew 467,000 jobs last month. Data for December was revised higher to show 510,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 199,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 150,000 jobs added in January. Estimates ranged from a decrease of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000 jobs.
Market participants were prepared for a weaker-than-forecast reading given the decline in the ADP U.S. private payrolls report released earlier this week. That report showed a decline due to the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Average hourly earnings, a measure of wage inflation and a closely-watched metric, also rose 0.7% last month, and 5.7% on a year-on-year basis.
""It is the 0.7% month-on-month gain in wages that is most hawkish,"" wrote Daragh Maher, head of FX strategy, at HSBC. ""This helps counter dollar-bearish real income squeeze concerns and the stagflation theme, and will likely energize FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) hawks. 
The dollar also tracked the surge in U.S. Treasury yields.
U.S. two-year and five-year yields, both of which reflect interest rate expectations, rose to 1.2970%, the highest since late February 2020, and 1.79%, its best level since July 2019, respectively.
In the afternoon session, U.S. rate futures implied more than five rate hikes this year, or about 134.4 basis points in policy tightening. The probability of a 50 basis-point increase next month rose to nearly 40%, from just 18% before the data release.
The euro was still up on the day, rising 0.1% at $1.1455. It was up 1.7% on the week, on track for its best weekly performance since late March 2020, benefiting from a hawkish turn by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The euro stalled around the resistance level of $1.1480 because of dollar gains following the U.S. employment report.
HSBC's Maher said the euro/dollar pair is likely to resume its upward momentum given that the market seems more fixated on the ECB's hawkishness, which surprised markets, than the Fed.Sterling also has been among the big currency movers this week, after the Bank of England raised rates to 0.5% on Thursday - marking the first back-to-back increases by the central bank since 2004. The pound though fell 0.5% to $1.3536. On the week, it was up 1% this week.

(Reuters) - A leading Senate Republican is urging the Biden administration to closely monitor the use of China’s recently launched digital currency during the Beijing Winter Olympics, where the country is expected to showcase the project to foreign visitors. 
In a letter sent Thursday to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Senator Pat Toomey expressed concern that the Chinese government could use the global event to help its digital yuan, dubbed e-CNY, gain a global foothold. Such an effort could be used to set standards in cross-border payments, as the People’s Bank of China looks to get out ahead of other countries in the race to develop central bank digital currencies, he warned. 
“The importance of remaining a leader in the global digital economy and supporting new innovations like digital currencies is a significant domain of strategic competition with other countries, including China,” Toomey said. 
Toomey asked the Treasury and State Departments to report back on the adoption rate of the digital yuan by foreign visitors compared to Chinese citizens, the total issuance of e-CNY during the 2022 Winter Olympics and if the rollout of e-CNY can offer any lessons to the U.S. government as it considers developing its own central bank digital currency.
A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment and the State Department did not respond to a request for comment. 
A pilot version of the digital yuan wallet application has been available for downloads in mobile phone app stores in China since Jan. 4.  
The use of e-CNY is still limited to 10 major ""pilot"" cities, plus the site of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which officially began Friday, but has been hampered by people's preference for Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay, which dominate China's online payments.
The U.S. is still undecided on developing its own digital currency, with the Federal Reserve pledging not to move forward on any such effort without congressional authorization. 

On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) unveiled long-awaited technical research and open-source code that could be used as the groundwork for a potential central bank digital currency. 
The team behind that effort developed technology that can be adjusted in the future as more policy questions regarding the structure and purpose of a U.S. CBDC are addressed, including how a digital dollar would be intermediated.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar weakened Friday, as strong gains in U.S. equity futures diluted the need for the safe haven and after a hawkish turn by the European Central Bank boosted the single currency. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.1% lower to 95.285, having fallen around 2% this week - its biggest weekly drop since March 2020.
Strong corporate earnings from retail online giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the close of the bell on Wall Street Thursday have prompted hefty gains in U.S. equity futures, as well as stock markets in Asia and Europe. This increased confidence has hit demand for the greenback, which is often seen as a safe haven in times of stress.
The currency which has benefited the most is the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.2% to 1.1456, on course for its best week since March 2020. 
That said, the main reason for the euro’s gains was ECB President Christine Lagarde’s press conference following the central bank policy meeting, where she acknowledged the mounting inflation risks and declined to repeat previous guidance that an interest rate increase this year was extremely unlikely. 
“All this has clearly paved the way for markets to speculate quite freely on a change in forward guidance in March (i.e. explicitly signalling the chance of a 2022 hike) and by extension on the pace, size and timing of ECB tightening, “ said analysts at ING, in a note.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now expects the European Central Bank to raise interest rates by 25 bps each in September and December.
“We think that the post-FOMC 1.11-1.13 range in EUR/USD has now given way to a 1.13-1.15 range, which may hold into the March ECB meeting.”
The release of U.S. nonfarm payroll data later Friday could impact this thinking, but with the focus more on inflation a sharp slowdown in jobs growth in January due to the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant is unlikely to move the dollar too much.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3590, just off the two-week high of 1.3626 reached on Thursday after the Bank of England raised rates by 25 basis points, as widely expected. 
There could be more gains ahead of sterling as nearly half of the BOE policymakers voted for a bigger increase with inflation set to top 7%, more than triple the central bank’s 2% target and over a full percentage point higher than they forecast in December.
AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7117, weighed by Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe preaching patience in terms of rate hikes following the publication of the central bank’s quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 115.09, with the Bank of Japan seen as the most dovish of the major central banks, especially after the ECB’s change in stance.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning and was set for the worst week in nearly two years, as the Bank of England (BOE) and European Central Bank (ECB) tightened their monetary policies.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.19% to $95.19 by 10:31 PM ET (3:31 AM GMT), falling to a three-week low.
This comes after the dollar's gains during the previous week, with investors bracing for faster-than-expected interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed took a hawkish stance of its own as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the month.
""On the face of it, both the BOE and  ECB met market expectations, with BOE raising rates 25bps to 0.50% and ECB keeping policy unchanged. However, both meetings unveiled substantial hawkish shifts,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 114.93. Analysts expect that the Bank of Japan might follow its peers to tighten monetary policy when it hands down its policy decision in the following week.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7143. Although the Reserve Bank of Australia foresees faster inflation, the central bank said it will keep a dovish policy as it looks to continue recovery in wages and living standards.
The NZD/USD pair was up 0.27% to 0.6676.
The USD/CNY pair stay unchanged at 6.3610, with Chinese markets still closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3611. The BOE handed down its policy decision on Thursday, with nearly half of its policymakers preferring a bigger hike to curb high inflation.
The euro reached its highest since January 14, 2021. ECB president Christine Lagarde said it is unlikely to continue increasing interest rates due to growing inflation risks.
""It’s not unreasonable to conclude that the peak of the Fed-ECB policy divergence is past us,"" ING analysts told Reuters. They added the previous week's low for the euro possibly marked its bottom in this cycle as the market moves had been driven by the different policy stances of the two central banks.
On the data front, investors await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day."

JOHANNESBURG/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies will struggle to stem losses in the near-term as the U.S. Federal Reserve lifts interest rates off the zero bound, but currencies from countries where central banks have already begun raising rates will outperform the rest.
A Reuters poll of market strategists taken Jan. 31-Feb. 3 suggests there will be no repeat of the mayhem in 2013, when the U.S. Fed's decision to trim bond purchases punished emerging market currencies across the board.
More than 70% of respondents to an extra question - 23 of 32 - said front-loaded rate hiker currencies such as Brazil's real and Russia's rouble will weather the storm better than emerging market currencies did during that episode.
While those two central banks have already raised rates by 875 basis points and 425 basis points, respectively, the Fed has only cut back on its bond purchases, although is widely expected to deliver a rate rise at its March meeting.
Emerging market currencies began the year firmly, partly due to a broadly weaker dollar, with the Colombian peso, the Brazilian real and the South African rand gaining up to 5%, to top a list of 20 currencies tracked by Reuters against the dollar.
But these gains are forecast to be torpedoed in three months by an expected 25 basis point Fed hike in March, likely attracting inflows to the U.S. and keeping the mighty dollar in the driving seat.
Historically, high-risk, high-reward currencies have almost always weakened at the beginning of a Fed hiking cycle. The backdrop of a slow emergence from a deadly pandemic appears to be no exception.
""A hawkish Fed will keep EM local markets on the back foot, with rising carry likely to come into play as a major driver for currencies only later,"" Jonny Goulden, emerging market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said.
""The wide range of possible outcomes from Russia-Ukraine tensions remains a significant source of two-way risk for EM assets,"" he added.
(Reuters poll graphic on emerging market currencies outlook, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/mypmnjarbvr/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20Emerging%20market%20currencies%20outlook.png)
In the longer term, competition for capital inflows is likely to intensify as central bankers around the world reign in on rising inflation locally, with the U.S. wrestling its own quickest inflation since 1982.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote that in emerging markets, most central bank tightening cycles are underway and thus expectations for future rate paths are more established. Prospects for real yield should drive relative EM currency performance in the long run.
""We expect the proactive central bank tightening cycles in BRL and MXN to be rewarded with currency appreciation as inflation begins to decline, raising the real yield offering,"" the note added.
Brazil and Russia's central banks hiked the most last year in the list of those tracked by Reuters while South Africa and India remained accommodative to a large extent, moving only once with rates and not at all, respectively.
The South African rand and the Indian rupee were expected to weaken between 1-2% to 15.72/$ and 75.5/$ in six months while the Russian rouble, which has slumped nearly 3% so far this year amid tensions between Russia and the United States over Moscow's troop build-up near Ukraine, will gain nearly 5% to 73.1/$.
""We still expect a diplomatic solution and for the tensions to de-escalate. It will allow the rouble to rebound in the year ahead. The rouble is trading much weaker than traditional fundamental drivers such as the price of oil and yield spreads,"" Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said.
""If we are wrong, and there is another Ukraine invasion then the rouble will be sharply weaker.""
Turkey's battered lira plunged 44% last year, making it by far the worst performer in emerging markets and marking its worst year since President Tayyip Erdogan came to power nearly two decades ago.

It is forecast to plunge another 15% to 16.0/$ in a year as it grapples with rampant inflation, last measured at just below 50%.
""We didn't have long to wait for things to become worse, with the lira see-sawing in a wide range ... inflation will creep even higher in the months ahead, and real rates will slide deeper into negative territory,"" Maya Senussi, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Thursday, benefiting from a degree of risk aversion after disappointing results from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms, but the focus will be on central bank meetings in the U.K. and Europe. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.2% higher to 96.095.
The dollar, seen as a safe haven in times of stress, has received some support after Meta Platforms reported disappointing earnings and a weak outlook, prompting a selloff in tech and social media stocks.
Risk-sensitive currencies, like the Australian and New Zealand dollars, struggled, with AUD/USD down 0.2% to 0.7119 and NZD/USD 0.1% lower at 0.6622.
The dollar index is up another 0.5% this year so far, having climbed nearly 7% in 2021, its best performance since 2015, as the Federal Reserve moved slowly to withdraw its extraordinary pandemic-era monetary support for the economy.
A Reuters poll of strategists found that the U.S. dollar is expected to reign supreme for at least another 3-6 months, but it will take a significant change in market expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes to push it higher.
Away from the Fed, policy decisions from the Bank of England and European Central Bank are due at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT) and 7:45 AM ET respectively, and a news conference with ECB President Christine Lagarde is scheduled at 8 AM ET.
GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3550, ahead of the Bank of England meeting. With inflation at a three-decade high, the central bank is widely expected to deliver the first back-to-back interest-rate increase since 2004, after a 15 basis-point hike in December.
“Presumably the inflation forecast will be revised a lot higher and the market will be interested in reading whether the BoE still feels CPI will be above the 2% target in 2-3 years’ time – even with all the tightening priced in,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Inflation is also an issue in the Eurozone after data released on Wednesday showed consumer prices unexpectedly surged by a record 5.1% in January, more than double the ECB’s 2% target. The surprise was largely due to an overshoot in Italian inflation on Monday.
The ECB isn't expected to move at this meeting, but investors will carefully listen to President Christine Lagarde’s press conference for any changes to the outlook for its bond-buying, which will continue in reduced form even when the emergency pandemic program ends in March.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.59 after Japan's services sector activity contracted at the fastest pace in five months in January, with the services PMI falling to 47.6 from the prior month's 52.1 and a 48.8 flash reading.
The world's third-largest economy has seen Covid-19 cases surge in recent weeks, forcing the government to roll out tougher curbs across much of the country.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar declined to a more than a one-week low on Wednesday after data showed a drop in U.S. private sector employment in January due to the increase in COVID-19 infections.
However, the data is unlikely to prevent the Federal Reserve from hiking interest rates at the March 15-16 policy meeting. But the report has eased expectations of a large interest rate increase of half a percentage point.
In contrast, the euro gained for a third consecutive day, coming off a 20-month low last week, as euro zone inflation rose to a new record high last month. That fuelled bets the European Central Bank could raise interest rates sooner than expected.
The dollar index, with the euro as the largest component, fell 0.3% to 95.9260. It is on track for its largest weekly percentage loss since November 2020, at 1.3%.
ADP reported on Wednesday that U.S. private payrolls dropped by 301,000 jobs last month. Data for December was revised lower to show 776,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 807,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 207,000 in private payrolls.
""Markets are well-prepared for an Omicron-driven drop in January payrolls, and in recent days a number of Fed officials have signalled comfort with the underlying economy's direction,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto. 
""Until financial conditions tighten meaningfully, the Fed will retain a hawkish bias - and momentum should support the dollar. A peak is coming, but we're not quite there,"" he added.
In late afternoon trading, U.S. rate futures priced in about 4.7 hikes this year, or 118.6 basis points of policy tightening, down from the five rate increases seen over the last two days. Futures also showed the probability of a 50-basis-point hike in March have settled at 12.5%, from as high as 32% late last week. 
Fed officials this week also backtracked on some of the central bank's hawkish comments, pushing the dollar lower.
Although they said the Fed would raise interest rates next month, these officials have all but ruled out a 50-basis-point increase in the benchmark overnight interest rate in March and will keep their options open after that.
Even St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voter this year on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee and one of the more hawkish Fed officials, also pushed back against a larger rate hike in March, noting that markets have on their own started to push up borrowing costs already.
In the euro zone, markets are expecting the ECB to turn hawkish after an annualized inflation number of 5.1% in January, up more than twice the ECB's 2% target.
The euro firmed 0.3% to $1.1310, after earlier touching more than a one-week high, on growing expectations the ECB might signal a faster path for policy tightening at Thursday's meeting on Thursday. 
In the short term, the euro depends depend on what ECB President Christine Lagarde says on Thursday. Some analysts believe the bank will stick to its guidance of no hikes this year, which should weigh on the euro.
Sterling rose 0.4% to $1.3584, after earlier hitting a nearly two-week peak against the dollar at $1.3587 ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday. 

Investors have fully priced in an expected increase in the BoE base rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% on Thursday.

""We have taken many different steps, stabilized the hryvnia, calmed the markets,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. ""I can responsibly state that today we see that the national currency is strengthening.""
Zelenskiy's government has criticized what it described as alarmist statements from Western allies about an imminent Russian invasion, saying such warnings were hitting confidence in the Ukrainian economy.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Wednesday as gains in global equity markets boosted risk sentiment while Federal Reserve officials reined in interest rate hike expectations. 
At 3:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.2% lower to 96.135, retreating from the 18-month high of 97.441 seen at the end of last week.
The dollar, often seen as the ultimate safe haven in times of stress, has seen selling Wednesday following gains on equity markets around the globe on the back of strong results from tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
Risk-sensitive currencies, like the Australian dollar, have benefited, with AUD/USD up 0.1% to 0.7135, while EUR/USD has gained 0.1% to 1.1275 ahead of the release of the annual Eurozone CPI figure for January.
Also weighing on the dollar have been recent moves by a series of Fed officials to dilute expectations of a hefty 50 basis points hike in March by the U.S. central bank even with inflation at a 40-year high.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, often seen as one of the more hawkish of the Fed policymakers, said on Tuesday he favors successive rate increases at the Fed's March, May and June meetings. 
But he disagreed with the idea of starting with a half-percentage point hike in March, saying markets have already started to push up borrowing costs.
Additionally, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George, another hawk, said the central bank should be cautious and could take less aggressive actions in raising interest rates by shrinking the balance sheet more forcefully.
Traders will keep an eye on the release of the ADP private payrolls, at 8:15 AM ET (1315 GMT), ahead of Friday’s monthly official jobs report. Private job growth is likely to have decelerated to 207,000 in January after recording its fastest pace in seven months in December, when it rose 807,000.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3539, with sterling maintaining recent strength ahead of Thursday’s Bank of England meeting, where a second hike in less than two months is widely expected.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 114.56, continuing to move away from last week's top at 115.68, while USD/CNY was flat at 6.3610.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell for a second straight session on Tuesday, after hitting a 19-month peak at the end of last week, on weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data and after Federal Reserve officials pushed back against aggressive rate hikes this year, lifting risk appetite.
As the dollar eased, risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar, euro, and British pound gained. 
After falling nearly 5% in January, world equities started February slightly firmer and currency markets have also changed course.
A chorus of Fed officials said on Monday they would raise interest rates in March, but spoke cautiously about what might follow and indicated a desire to keep options open given an uncertain inflation outlook.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker was equally cautious on Tuesday as he pushed back on a rate increase of half a percentage point in March, saying he would have to be convinced it was needed.
Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier and Associates said the latest remarks revived ""the belief that the 'Fed put' was still alive,"" referring to the tendency of the Fed to ease monetary policy, or push back the timeline on raising rates, in response to falling stock markets. 
In addition, as the Fed sought to put brakes on faster rate hike forecasts, central banks around the world have either raised their policy rates already or flagged their own tightening plans.
""Given that yield differentials have shifted further in favor of the U.S. in that period, the greenback's failure to make further headway is somewhat perplexing,"" wrote Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist, at Capital Economics.
""But the key factor is probably that the most recent shift in the Fed's stance has been broadly matched by other advanced economy central banks,"" 
Central banks in Norway, New Zealand, and Britain have already tightened their policy rates and signalled further hikes are coming.
U.S. rate futures late on Tuesday have slightly pulled back on faster rates hikes, pricing about less than five hikes this year, starting in March. A 50 basis-point rate increase showed a roughly 16% probability, down from as high as 32% late last week, according to Refinitiv data.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index fell 0.3% to 96.423 (=USD), after hitting a 19-month high last week.
U.S. manufacturing data on Tuesday came in below expectations and added to the dollar's losses.
A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity fell to a 14-month low in January, dropping to a reading of 57.6 from 58.8 in December amid an outbreak of COVID infections. U.S. construction spending was also less than forecast, down 0.2%.
The euro rose 0.1% to $1.1244. 
Some market participants believe the euro may be more attractive than previously thought when it comes to its rate hike trajectory and the difference between the European Central Bank and the Fed could narrow.
The ECB though maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy stance and has pushed back against any expectations for rate hikes this year.
German inflation data on Monday, however, was well above expectations, with consumer prices rising 5.1% year on year in January, backing a view of a potential hawkish shift from the ECB. [nL1N2UB0VP]
Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.6% versus the yen.
The Australian dollar dropped overnight after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) pushed back against expectations for near-term rate hike. But the Aussie was last up 0.6% at US$0.7114
Britain's pound was up 0.5% at $1.3517.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday, continuing the previous session’s hefty losses, while the Australian dollar recovered after early selling on the back of the Reserve Bank of Australia indicated it would keep interest rates at record low levels for longer than expected. 
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.2% lower to 96.340, after dropping 0.6% in the previous session, backing off from hit the 18-month high of 97.441 seen at the end of last week.
The dollar had soared last week on expectations of a sharp 50 basis points hike by the Federal Reserve at its March meeting as the central bank looks to combat inflation rising at levels not seen for decades.
However, Fed officials attempted to damp down these expectations on Monday.
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George said the central bank could take less aggressive actions in raising interest rates by shrinking the balance sheet more forcefully, while Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly cautioned against overreacting and tightening policy too fast.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7076, rebounding after earlier dropping around 5% to 0.7036, following the February policy-setting meeting by the RBA.
The Australian central bank earlier Tuesday kept its cash rate at a record low of 0.1% and ended its A$275 billion bond-buying program as widely expected, but also surprised the market by indicating that it would be patient in terms of raising interest rates despite soaring inflation levels.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1252, even after German retail sales dropped more than expected in December, slumping 5.5% on the month in real terms, compared with expectations for a fall of 1.4%.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 114.94, while GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3477 after British house prices grew 0.8% in January, marking the strongest start to any year since 2005, according to mortgage lender Nationwide Tuesday.
The Bank of England holds its policy meeting on Thursday, and these strong housing prices can only add to the pressure on the central bank to hike interest rates for a second rate hike in less than two months.
An increase is almost fully priced in by money markets, limiting the scope for sterling upside, according to Dominic Bunning, HSBC’s head of European currency research, but the central bank could still deliver a hawkish surprise through its inflation forecasts and any discussion of active quantitative tightening. 
“A key reason for our long-held skepticism on GBP has been the flatness of the rates curve,” he said in a note. “If the terminal rate were to be adjusted much higher, due to either of the above forces, it would provide more ammunition for rate hikes and would create a less negative backdrop for sterling.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar fell on Monday, posting its largest daily fall since last November as investors consolidated gains after hitting a 1-1/2-year high on Friday on expectations of a faster pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
With the Fed clearly signalling last week that it intends to raise interest rates as early as the March 15-16 policy meeting, Wall Street banks are now expecting are now expecting about five to seven rate hikes this year.
Fed funds futures late Monday have priced in just under five hikes for 2022, or about 121 basis points of tightening. They also showed a 17% chance of a 50 basis-point increase in March, down from as high as 32% on Friday.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, a non-voter on the Federal Open Market Committee told the Financial Times in an interview over the weekend the Fed could super-size a rate increase to half a percentage point if inflation remains stubbornly high.
The dollar index slid 0.7% on the day, its highest daily percentage rise in two months. For January, the greenback was up nearly 1%.
""Dollar dominance has been mostly priced in as the Fed now seems poised to deliver 5-7 rate hikes this year,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at OANDA, in a research note.
The dollar could start to see ""some underperformance against advanced economies that grow more aggressive in tightening,"" he added.
Investors are also looking to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls for an indication of how aggressive the Fed can be on its tightening path. U.S. payrolls are forecast to show a gain of 153,000 jobs for January, down from 199,000 in December, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.9%, according to a Reuters poll. (EM) 
""The buck appears to have peaked for now as Friday's jobs report is forecast to show another month of tepid hiring,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
A quicker pace of rate hikes is also seen as dampening future growth expectations, a scenario playing out in bond markets where spreads between 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields fell below 59 basis points for the first time since early November, a phenomenon known as ""bear-flattening."" [US/]
In other currencies, the Australian dollar led gains, rising 1% to US$0.7068 before a Reserve Bank of Australia policy meeting on Tuesday.
Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.2% to 115.045 yen.
The Bank of England also holds its policy meeting on Thursday, with a Reuters poll predicting a second rate hike in less than two months after UK inflation jumped to its highest in nearly 30 years.
Sterling was last up 0.4% at $1.354
The European Central Bank also meets on Thursday. While no policy change is expected, analysts said the Fed's looming rate hikes will narrow the ECB's window for action.
The euro last traded up 0.8% at $1.1240, its best daily percentage gain in two months.

KINGSTON (Reuters) - Jamaica will roll out its digital currency across the country in the first quarter of this year as part of an effort to lower transaction costs and provide financial services to citizens who do not use banks, a central bank official told Reuters.
The Bank of Jamaica said in December that it completed a pilot project that issued 230 million Jamaican dollars (US$1.5 million) of the new currency, an effort that comes on the heels of a similar project launched by a group of Eastern Caribbean nations.
""The majority of Jamaicans are financially excluded,"" Natalie Haynes, a deputy governor with Bank of Jamaica for banking and currency operations and financial markets infrastructure, told Reuters in an interview late last week.
""To get those persons into the formal financial system, we decided that the central bank digital currency would be a good opportunity.""
Haynes said the bank hopes to replace 5% of Jamaican dollars with the new digital currency each year.
Five million Jamaican dollars ($38,000) was issued to Jamaica's National Commercial Bank, a private financial institution, and JMD $1 million ($6,000) to Bank of Jamaica employees. 
NCB signed up 57 customers to use the new currency, the Bank of Jamaica said.
""It's a different way to pay and allows for easy peer-to-peer transactions,"" said John-Matthew Sinclair, chief product officer for TFOB (2021), an NCB subsidiary.
Customers sign up for a digital wallet, where they can deposit funds in exchange for digital currency that can then be used in transactions. 
Jamaica's digital currency follows a similar program by a group of Eastern Caribbean nations launched last year called DCash. 

Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent are now using DCash. In 2020, Bahamas was the first country in the region to issue digital currency.

The devil is in the detail for pound watchers at HSBC Holdings Plc going into Thursday’s Bank of England decision. 
Economists expect the BOE to hike its key rate to 0.50%, at the same time triggering passive balance-sheet reduction. While the increase is almost fully priced in by money markets, limiting the scope for sterling upside, the central bank could still deliver a hawkish surprise through its inflation forecasts and any discussion of active quantitative tightening, according to Dominic Bunning, HSBC’s head of European currency research. 
“A key reason for our long-held skepticism on GBP has been the flatness of the rates curve,” he said in a note. “If the terminal rate were to be adjusted much higher, due to either of the above forces, it would provide more ammunition for rate hikes and would create a less negative backdrop for sterling.”
The pound is trading around its strongest level in almost two years against the euro, buoyed by expectations the BOE’s tightening cycle will far outpace the European Central Bank’s process. Money markets are betting on close to 125 basis points of hikes this year in the U.K., compared with around 25 basis points in the eurozone.
The pound rallied to 83.05 pence per euro on Monday before paring gains, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson due to make a statement to Parliament later.
The latest BOE forecasts had inflation receding to its 2% target in 2024. If the new projections do not show a return to target or a slower return, it may flag that officials would like to see a more aggressive hiking cycle priced in that would support the pound, according to Bunning. 
A signal that active gilt sales are on the horizon, meanwhile, could push U.K. yields and sterling higher, he said. The BOE has said it will consider actively selling its bond holdings once the policy rate hits 1%, which is priced in for June. It’s uncertain whether the BOE will start active sales straight away at that level or wait. In the August policy report, officials said their preference is to use the Bank Rate as the “active instrument in most circumstances.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Monday, handing back some of last week’s gains at the start of a week dominated by central bank meetings. 
At 3:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.2% lower to 97.035, retreating from Friday's 18-month peak of 97.441.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1166, having fallen to 1.1119 on Friday, its weakest since June 2020. USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.41, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3422 and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD soared 0.6% to 0.7031, after falling to its lowest since July 2020 on Friday. 
Traders are banking some profits Monday after the dollar had its best week in seven months on the back of comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell which suggested the U.S. central bank was looking at more interest hikes this year than the three that had previously been factored in.
“Because of strong growth, elevated inflation, and a tight labour market, we now expect six rate hikes in 2022 of 25bp each instead of four, to be followed by four further such hikes in 2023 and one move in 2024,” said analysts at Berenberg, in a note.
Despite Monday’s weakness, the dollar can extend its rally until after the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates, according to JPMorgan Chase.
“The market is still going to be in some sort of price discovery mode,” and “typically the peak of the dollar comes about one to two months after Fed liftoff,” said Daniel Hui, executive director of global FX strategy at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. 
Still, the focus this week is set to shift a little away from the Federal Reserve, with central bank policy-setting meetings due in Australia, the U.K. and the Eurozone in the days ahead. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday amid rising expectations that it will take another step towards policy normalization, potentially by announcing an end to its quantitative easing program. 
The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are both set to meet on Thursday, but with likely different results. While the ECB is seen delivering no policy change, the BOE is widely expected to hike interest rates for the second time in less than two months, after inflation jumped to its highest in nearly 30 years.
“Presumably the inflation forecast will be revised a lot higher and the market will be interested in reading whether the BoE still feels CPI will be above the 2% target in 2-3 years’ time – even with all the tightening priced in,” said analysts at ING, in a note.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia. Investors are awaiting central bank meetings from places such as Australia, the UK, and Europe.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 97.155 by 10:41 PM ET (3:41 AM GMT).
Analysts believe there is an over 90% chance that there will be at least four interest rate hikes by the end of 2022 and 67% chances of at least five.
""The USD 'smiled' again, drawing on a combination of rates repricing and much weaker risk sentiment,"" analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) told Reuters
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.26% to 115.54.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.36% to 0.7011. Analysts await the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) meeting on Tuesday morning as they are expecting an announcement to end its quantitative easing program.
Meanwhile, the central bank’s governor will speak on Wednesday and a statement on monetary policy will be released on Friday.
The week ""will go far to define the psychology of the market for the next few months,"" Westpac analysts told Reuters. ""That QE will cease will not be a surprise, so the real focus is on the RBA’s shifting economic view and its implications for the (benchmark) cash rate.""
The NZD/USD pair increased 0.46% to 0.6564.
The USD/CNY pair stay unchanged at 6.3610. Data released on Sunday showed that China’s January manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.1, and the non-manufacturing PMI was 51.1.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3412. The Bank of England (BOE) has a meeting on Thursday. Investors expect the BOE will increase the interest rate for the second time in less than two months. The country’s inflation surged to its highest point in nearly 30 years and the central bank phased out some stimulus policies in place since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) will also have a meeting on Thursday, but analysts do not expect any policy change."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar consolidated gains on Friday and posted its biggest weekly rise in seven months as markets priced in a year ahead of aggressive hikes in U.S. interest rates.
Money markets priced in a 28.5-basis-point interest rate hike in March and as many as 119.5 basis points in cumulative increases by year's end as the dollar steadily rose in a week highlighted by a more hawkish tone coming out of a Federal Reserve meeting.
The dollar index rose a scant 0.04%. The index, which measures the dollar's value against other major currencies, rose about 1.7% for the week to mark its biggest weekly gains since June. It shot above 97 for the first time since July 2020.
""I look for some consolidation, but nothing to say that the dollar's up move is over,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. 
U.S. labor costs increased strongly in the fourth quarter, but less than expected, the Labor Department said. The Employment Cost Index (ECI), the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 1.0% after increasing 1.3% in the prior quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 1.2% advance in the ECI, widely viewed as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation.
""The Employment Cost Index, which (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell has referred to specifically, was a bit softer than expected and has spurred some position adjusting ahead of the weekend,"" Chandler said.
U.S. Treasury yields eased, with 10-year yields falling to about 1.77% for the day, well below two-year highs of nearly 1.9% hit on Monday.
The two-year Treasury yield, which often moves in step with rate expectations, slid 2.8 basis points to 1.164%, but was still much higher for the week.
The euro nursed losses on Friday with the single currency little changed at $1.1143, a bit up from Thursday's 20-month low of $1.1131.
Major currencies drifted sideways in Asian trading before Lunar New Year holidays next week even though U.S. yields were marginally higher. 
Data has been supportive of the dollar as the U.S. economy registered its best annual growth in nearly four decades.
The greenback is poised to gain further versus the euro and yen as the Fed raise rates but the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan likely stand pat. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Friday it was premature to raise the bank's rate targets.
A preliminary estimate next week of euro zone consumer prices in January is expected to lower the year-over-year rate toward 4.3% from 5.0%, allowing ECB President Christine Lagarde to keep the hawks at bay, Chandler said.
The yen rose 0.14% to 115.21 per dollar, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars languished, with the kiwi dipping slightly to a fresh 15-month low of $0.6570.
Sterling was pushed to a one-month low of $1.3360 on Thursday but has bounced back a bit as traders await the Bank of England's meeting next week. Rates markets have priced a 90% chance of a hike.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher in early European trade Friday, heading for its best week in seven months as the market priced in several interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged 0.1% higher to 97.345, after breaking through 97 earlier this week for the first time since July 2020.
The greenback has seen strong demand this week after comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pointed to more interest hikes this year than the three that had previously been factored in, likely starting in March.
Data showing U.S. GDP growing a better-than-expected 6.9% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as the best annual growth in nearly four decades, raised expectations that the first interest rate increase could be as much as 50 basis points instead of the traditional 25 bps. 
These gains have continued in European hours Friday but in a limited manner after data showed France’s economy, the second largest in the euro area,  continued to grow at the end of last year, with gross domestic product climbing 0.7% in the fourth quarter thanks to strong domestic demand. Spanish GDP also grew more than expected, by 2.0% on the quarter and 5.2% year-on-year.
EUR/USD still fell 0.1% to 1.1131, around a 20-month low, with German GDP, due later Friday, expected to show a fall of 0.3% on the quarter in the fourth quarter. The German economy, usually the region’s powerhouse, could be heading toward its second recession of the pandemic.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 115.64, with a Reuters poll suggesting Japan's factory output likely slid in December for the first time in three months due to lingering supply bottlenecks.
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3394 ahead of the Bank of England's meeting next week, with rates markets pricing a 90% chance of a hike following an unexpected surge of inflation in December, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7020, hard hit this week.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3653 with the yuan rebounding a touch after the Chinese currency suffered its worst session in seven months on Thursday as weakening industrial profit growth in China bolstered the case for monetary easing, just as the Federal Reserve looks to hike.
Attention will turn  later in the session to the release of sentiment surveys in the United States as well as more inflation data in the form of the monthly PCE Price Index and the employment cost index, which will be scanned for signs of emerging wage inflation.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia but was headed towards its best week in seven months. The U.S. currency broke through key levels against the euro after investors increased bets on multiple U.S. interest rate hikes in 2022.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 97.127 by 10:12 PM ET (3:12 AM GMT). The index passed the 97-mark for the first time since July 2020.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 115.41, with Japan’s Tokyo core consumer price index growing 0.2% year-on-year in January.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.7046, with Australia’s producer price index growing 1.3% quarter-on-quarter and 3.7% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.6583.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.14% to 6.3593 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 1.3403.
The euro fell almost 0.9% to a 20-month low of $1.1131 during the previous session, while the dollar gained 1.7% on the euro and 2% or more on the riskier Antipodean currencies.
The U.S. Federal Reserve took a hawkish stance as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday, driving bets on five or more interest rate hikes in 2022. Some investors even expect up to six hikes.
Sentiment was also bolstered by the U.S. GDP growing a better-than-expected 6.9% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021.
""So much for all those analysts rushing to conclude that the dollar rally was done, following the early-year divergence between rising U.S. interest rates and the falling dollar,"" National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the prospect of the People’s Bank of China taking the opposite direction to the Fed, made more likely thanks to soft industrial profit growth data earlier in the week, led the dollar to its best session in seven months against the yuan.
Across the Atlantic, the pound was near a one-month low, with the Bank of England handing down its policy decision in the following week. The European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia will also hand their policies.
However, the dollar's rally is starting to lose steam as economies and central banks globally slowly emerge from COVID-19, according to some investors.
""The dollar is on cycle highs and has further to go as rate differentials and increased levels of market volatility provide support. But this is the last stage of the move,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Juckes told Reuters.
""As the global economy emerges from the worst of COVID-19 in 2022, the market focus will shift to monetary policy normalization and growth outside the U.S. and the best currency returns in the second half of 2022 are likely to come from outside the major developed economies."""
301,"<span>Jan 27, 2022 09:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- After rallying to a four-year high, China’s currency is encountering stiff resistance from a Fed-driven dollar. But yuan bulls are undeterred.
PineBridge Investments says the yuan is on track to test 6.24 per dollar for the first time since it was devalued in August 2015 due to China’s sizable current-account surplus. Mobius Capital Partners LLP doesn’t rule out a move to 6.20 this year, which would imply a gain of about 3% from the current level.
Yuan enthusiasts are betting on a stronger currency amid signs that the central bank is loosening its grip to counter the impact of its monetary easing. The policy divergence with the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it’ll start hiking from March, will put Chinese markets in the limelight as an increasing number of banks turn bullish on the nation’s assets.
“The underlying trend is still in favor of a stronger yuan,” said Anders Faergemann, senior portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments in London. “Fed Chair Powell needed to outline the support for front-loaded rate hikes, yet reality may turn out different” as growth could slow in the second half and the U.S. mid-term election approaches, he said.
To be clear, the yuan’s ascent could be gradual as it runs up against a rising dollar. The greenback is expected to strengthen after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled policy makers may ramp up the pace of rate hikes. 
China’s currency fell as low as 6.3699 in onshore markets on Thursday after the Fed meeting. It had rallied to 6.3200 the previous day, the strongest since April 2018.
The Chinese authorities wouldn’t favor “an overly strong currency, especially on a basket basis,” said Hao Zhou, emerging market economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “All told, the battle between markets and policy makers would continue for the time being.” 
Relaxed Stance
But so far, the authorities have shown little inclination to rein in the yuan.
Central bank Deputy Governor Liu Guoqiang said last week that while the yuan could deviate from its equilibrium level, market and policy factors will help correct any perceived imbalance. While it did step in last year to slow the gains, the yuan is benefiting from robust inflows and the nation’s record trade surplus.
The authorities set the yuan’s daily fixing rate at the strongest level since 2018 this week. The currency has gained 1.3% against the dollar in the past 12 months.
Yuan Advances to Record Against Peers as PBOC Seen Relaxing Grip
The yuan’s resilience stands in contrast to the recent spate of negative news emanating from China. The property sector has been hit by a liquidity crisis and a fresh wave of virus cases is weighing on an economy that’s already showing signs of a slowdown.
The central bank lowered its key interest rate for the first time in almost two years this month to counter the weakening growth, and some analysts expect further easing. 
Mark Mobius, veteran emerging-markets investor and founder of Mobius Capital Partners, thinks that a level of 6.20 for the yuan this year “wouldn’t be an earth-shaking development,” although a 10%-15% move in either direction may be a bigger cause for concern. 
“Right now there’s a debate within the Chinese hierarchy,” Mobius said. “They want stability and control, but they know that have to give up some control if they want to be a global currency.”

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar soared to highs last seen in July 2020 against other major currencies on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve said it could deliver faster and larger interest rate hikes in the months ahead.
With the Fed flagging that it was ready to start lifting rates in March to contain surging inflation, money markets moved to price in as many as five quarter-point increases by year-end.
The Fed's hawkish tone on Wednesday brought dollar bulls out in force. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against other major currencies, rose to 97.299, the highest since July 2020. The 0.8% jump was the biggest single-day gain in more than two months.
The euro slumped 0.95% to $1.1133, its lowest since June 2020. The greenback also hit its highest levels in more than a year against the New Zealand dollar, a seven-week peak against Australia's currency and rose broadly against emerging market currencies.
The outlook for aggressive rate hikes has led to a major reset globally, said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
""You just don't know how far the Fed is going to go because we don’t know exactly when inflation will really peak,"" he said.
While there is optimism that inflation will subside by midyear, it could get worse and lead to more aggressive Fed action, he said, adding, ""you got a little bit more left in this dollar move.""
The Fed indicated it was likely to raise rates in March, as widely expected, and reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases that month before significantly reducing its asset holdings.
The Fed also said it may be warranted to increase the federal funds rate ""sooner or at a faster pace"" than had been earlier anticipated.
Chair Jerome Powell later stressed at a news conference that no decisions had been made, but in response to a question about whether the central bank would consider a 50-basis point hike, he did not rule it out.
Much of the Fed's outlook depends on an economy that may be weaker than it appears. U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the economy grew 5.7% in 2021, its strongest since 1984, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. 
Robust growth supports a rate hike in March. But inventory rebuilding accounted for almost three-quarters of the strong GDP number, noted Joe LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. ""This is not the stuff of a robust economy,"" he said.

YUAN HIT
Rising U.S. Treasury yields at the short end provided a further impetus to the dollar's gains. The two-year Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with rate expectations, rose 7.9 basis points to 1.170%.
After rallying 0.7% against the yen on Wednesday in its sharpest rise in more than two months, the dollar firmed further, leading the yen to weaken 0.49% to 115.21 per dollar.
The rouble jumped off a near 15-month low hit on Wednesday to extend gains after Russia said even the idea of war with Ukraine was unacceptable, soothing fears of increased tensions. The rouble strengthened 2.09% to 77.77 per dollar. 
Elsewhere, China's yuan took a hit as data showed Chinese industrial profits grew at their slowest pace in more than 18 months, bolstering the case for policy support.
In offshore trade, the yuan was down 0.52% against the dollar at 6.3668, on track for its biggest one-day fall since last July. [CNY/][EMRG/FRX]
After a battering last week, volatile cryptocurrencies held their ground in the wake of the Fed's meeting, with bitcoin slipping 1.5% to $36,276.

Investing.com -- The dollar hit its highest level this year in early dealings in Europe on Thursday, after the Federal Reserve’s press conference led many to expect more monetary policy tightening than previously expected.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell dodged a question about whether the Fed would hike in successive meetings this year, leaving open the possibility of more than three hikes by the end of 2022. He also all but confirmed that the first hike will be in March, as widely expected.
“The committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so,” Powell said, adding that “the economy no longer needs substantial levels of monetary policy support."" Short-term interest rate futures now imply a 20% risk that the first hike will be 50 basis points, rather than 25 basis points, while interest-rate sensitive U.S. two-year bond yields surged to a two-year high of 1.20%.
By 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed market currencies, was up 0.5% at 96.83, with its biggest gains coming against higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollar.  The Canadian dollar also slipped 0.5% to C$1.2725 after the Bank of Canada kept its key rate unchanged on Wednesday but signalled that its first hike would not be long in coming.
The euro dipped below $1.12 for the first time since November but retraced some of its losses to trade at $1.1199, while the pound also fell 0.4% to $1.3413.
That’s the lowest level for sterling this year, but the pound has enjoyed more support from expectations that the Bank of England will raise its key rate for the second time at its meeting next week.
Analysts at ING said they expected the dollar to remain bid going into the Fed’s next meeting in March.
“This is probably the key debate for FX markets over coming months - whether to just seek dollar strengthening over the low-yielders or buy dollars against everything, ING’s Chris Turner and Francesco Pesole wrote in a note to clients. “While acknowledging that we are going through a rocky period for risk assets, we think it is too early to conclude that Fed tightening or high energy prices severely choke global growth this year and would prefer the former scenario of dollar strength largely being played out against the low-yielders.”
Later Thursday, the South African central bank is expected to raise its key rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%, while Chile’s raised on Wednesday by 150 basis points to 5.5%.
The dollar’s strength will be tested at 8:30 AM ET by the release of fourth-quarter gross domestic product data for the U.S., while weekly jobless claims – which have risen in the last two weeks due to the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 – are due at the same time.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, hitting multi-week highs. The safe-haven U.S. currency got a boost after U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell hinted at imminent interest hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.25% to 96.645 by 10:49 PM ET (3:49 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.04% to 114.68.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.51% to 0.7078 and the NZD/USD pair fell 0.65% to 0.6608. Data released earlier in the day showed that New Zealand’s consumer price index grew 1.4% quarter-on-quarter and 5.9% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.40% to 6.3462, while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 1.3437.
The Fed left its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% as it handed down its latest policy decision on Wednesday. However, Powell signaled a sustained battle to curb high inflation, saying there was ""quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market"" and that the Fed would likely begin hiking interest rates in March 2022.
The dollar gained 0.7% against the safe-haven yen after Powell's remarks, its steepest daily jump in more than two months. The prospect of imminent interest rate hikes unnerved stock markets and saw bond yields climb.
""While communication from Fed members in the lead-up to this meeting meant that the pivot should not have been a surprise, risk appetite shriveled as Powell's press conference progressed and the extent of the Fed's commitment to act in the face of significant inflation pressure became clear,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.
In other data from Asia Pacific, Chinese industrial profit growth slowed to 4.2% year-on-year in December 2021. Investors now await U.S. data, including GDP and core durable goods orders, due later in the day.
Meanwhile, the pound tested support as the following week’s Bank of England policy decision looms and the political turmoil over U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s breaking of COVID-19 lockdown rules.
Cryptocurrencies mostly held their ground after the Fed policy decision after taking a tumble during the previous week. However, bitcoin saw some pressure early in the Asia session, last trading nearly 2% down at $36,100."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a five-week high on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it is likely to raise U.S. interest rates in March as expected and later launch a significant reduction in its asset holdings.
The combined moves, along with reaffirmed plans to end its bond purchases in March, will complete a pivot away from the loose U.S. monetary policy that has defined the pandemic era and toward a more urgent fight against inflation. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will be open-minded as it adjusts monetary policy to keep persistently high inflation from becoming entrenched. While no decisions have been made, ""we'll be humble and nimble,"" he said.
Stocks on Wall Street mostly sold off as the comments raised uncertainty. The Fed's statement at the end of its two-day policy meeting left questions in particular about plans for reducing its almost $9 trillion balance sheet.
""The statement still leaves a lot of questions to be answered particularly when it comes to the balance sheet roll-off. There wasn't a whole lot of detail provided,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP). 
But Fed policy decisions by design result in a very slow-moving ship, said Peter Cramer, senior managing director at SLC Management.
""The market’s rate expectations the last three months has been warp speed in the context of Fed decision-making,"" Cramer said. ""The pace of which the Fed operates is measured in years and maybe quarters, but not months.""
Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets, said ""the idea of the balance sheet reduction as now mentioned in the statement puts us on the table for June.""
The dollar index, as measured against six major trading currencies, rose to a high last seen on Nov. 22 and last traded 0.53% higher. 
Equity markets had been on a roller-coaster ride this week as the combination of a hawkish Fed and slowing growth unnerved investors, prompting them to dump high-flying technology shares and seek refuge in safe-haven assets such as the dollar.
The euro fell 0.51% to $1.1241, while the yen weakened 0.64% to 114.58 per dollar.
The Bank of Canada earlier said it will soon start hiking rates to combat inflation as the Canadian economy no longer needed to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19. The central bank surprised some analysts by leaving its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25%.

The Canadian dollar fell 0.35% versus the greenback to 1.27 per dollar.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The Cuban peso was trading at nearly 100 to the dollar on the informal market Tuesday, according to a trader and online trackers, a depreciation of more than 30% in less than a month and four times the fixed official rate.
The peso's free fall is bad news for a population that for two years has confronted a grave economic crisis https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/roaring-inflation-compounds-cubans-economic-woes-2021-06-16 and unusually severe shortages of food, medicine and other goods, a predicament made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and the Cold War-era U.S. embargo.
Local economists and business leaders attributed the recent depreciation to a growing perception that Cuba's economy https://www.reuters.com/business/cuba-sees-slow-economic-recovery-4-2022-official-2021-12-12 continues to weaken, with runaway inflation, while the government appears unable to reverse the trend. 
Independent online news outlet El Toque tracker, the most watched in the communist-run country, had the greenback trading for 97.50 pesos on Tuesday, compared to 72 when the year began.
The local electronic currency, called the MLC, which Cubans use on par with U.S. dollars to purchase goods in domestic specialty markets, was rising in tandem with the U.S. currency. It was trading on the informal market at 95.90 on Tuesday, the online trackers showed.
The peso and MLC have no value outside of Cuba. The government fixes the exchange rate, currently 25 to a dollar, but has stopped trading dollars and other exchangeable currencies because it says it has no cash.
""We have to deepen the political discussion with those who are increasing prices in the state and non-state sector,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel told a Communist Party meeting last week, blaming speculation and greed for rising prices.
Cuba's government late last year put annual inflation at 70%, but at least three economists consulted by Reuters say the rate is between 300% and 500%. Soaring prices have squeezed consumers already hard hit by economic crisis and the pandemic.
The state controls most wholesale and retail trade in Cuba, offering the most basic goods in pesos and virtually everything else in MLC, while all wages are in pesos as are subsidized utilities and fuel. Health care and education are free.
Cuban officials in December said they hoped to ease the burden by driving down inflation https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cuba-says-taming-inflation-priority-recovery-begins-2021-12-21 in the coming months, but sources told Reuters that the government was increasingly hobbled by the crisis.
Three foreign businessmen, requesting anonymity, said that some government entities that had managed during most of the crisis to meet obligations to suppliers and other foreign partners were for the first time falling behind on payments.
""This has led people to realize the situation continues to deteriorate and MLCs, like the peso or letters of credit, have no real backing so there is a flight to exchangeable currency,"" one of the businessmen said.
That flight, they said, has further weakened the peso.
The government, meanwhile, had pinned its hopes of 4% growth in 2022 on the recovery of the Caribbean island's all-important tourism sector.

“I think there was an expectation that the reopening of borders, airports, hotels, and travel would bring in more dollars and improvements in the economy, and that was holding back a further depreciation of the Cuban peso,” Pavel Vidal, a former economist at Cuba's central bank, said.
“But this recovery is turning out to be slower than expected and there is great pessimism everywhere, which is expressed in the exchange rate,” Vidal, who currently teaches at Colombia's Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia and the euro was near its weakest in a month versus the safe-haven dollar and Japanese yen. Investors remain concerned about a potential armed conflict in Ukraine, and faster-than-expected U.S. policy decision monetary policy tightening.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01 % to 95.920 by 10:19 PM ET (3:19 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 113.89.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7158, with Australian markets shut for a holiday. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.6682.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.08% to 6.3227 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3512. The U.K. is also dealing with an investigation into whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson potentially breached COVID-19 lockdown rules. The findings of an internal inquiry could be announced later in the day.
The euro was about flat at $1.1303 after falling to $1.1264 overnight for the first time since Dec. 21, 2021. The single currency also inched down 0.06% to 128.64 yen after hitting the 128.25 mark during the previous session, also a first since Dec. 21.
Western leaders continue to accelerate preparations to counter any Russian military action in Ukraine, while Russia expressed “great concern” after 8,500 U.S. troops were put on alert to deploy to Europe if an escalation takes place.
The focus was also on the Fed, which will hand down its policy decision later in the day. Investors will be looking for clues for the timing of interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening (QT), but money markets are currently priced for a first hike as early as March 2022.
""Market sentiment remains fragile,"" TD Securities analysts said in a note.
From the Fed, ""any hints around the starting point for QT or 'sooner' and 'faster' on hikes could be market-moving,"" but ""we don't expect definitive signals, unfortunately, and the result could be mixed messages.”
The Bank of Canada will also hand down its policy decision later in the day, with the Canadian dollar edging up to CAD$1.2622 against its U.S. counterpart.
""There is a huge amount of uncertainty around the January Bank of Canada rate announcement, as policymakers attempt to balance very strong realized data on employment and inflation from Q4 versus the sharp increase in COVID infections and subsequent lockdowns in late December and January,"" according to TD Securities analysts.
The South African Reserve Bank will hand down its policy decision on Thursday, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will follow in the following week."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The euro fell to a one-month low on Tuesday as tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine drew investors to the dollar, a day before the Federal Reserve is expected to reveal details on its plans to tighten monetary policy.
Western leaders stepped up preparations for any Russian military action in Ukraine while Moscow said it was watching with great concern after 8,500 U.S. troops were put on alert to deploy to Europe in the event of an escalation.
Tensions remained high after NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to Russia's troop build-up near its border with Ukraine.
The rouble rebounded to strengthen 0.54% to 78.62 per dollar after earlier weakening toward a more than 14-month low.
Ukraine tensions have exposed the euro and Europe, especially regarding energy, but the dollar's strength has more to do with Fed policy tightening, said Alvise Marino, director of FX strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
""The market was pricing in one hike by the Fed in 2022. Now we're pricing four. That is ultimately the major driver of the dollar strength we've seen the past three months,"" he said.
""This accelerated a bit on the back of weakness in the broader equity markets and risk appetites that you've seen in particular since last Wednesday,"" Marino said.
The dollar's strength indicates its role as the ultimate safe-haven currency, said Marshall Gittler, head of Investment Research at BDSwiss Holding Ltd.
Currencies usually gain when rates are expected to go higher and fall when expectations of future rate hikes increase, Gittler said. ""It's not just that (the dollar) rose during a risk-off period but also that it rose even as expectations for Fed tightening were pared back.""
With other central banks poised to raise rates too, dollar volatility has abated as the Cboe volatility index for the S&P 500 stocks has doubled so far in 2022, Marino said.
The dollar index pared some gains to rise 0.097%, with the euro down 0.23% to $1.1297. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01% at 113.92 per dollar.
The Fed could firm up plans to raise interest rates and shrink its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which have swollen its balance sheet to about $9 trillion. The Fed's two-day meeting ends Wednesday. 
Analyst views of the meeting are mixed, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) flagging a potentially hawkish surprise over the coming months, with as many as six or seven increases this year.
But ING analysts say that if the Fed's balance sheet reduction does the heavy lifting of policy normalization, that could scale back forecasts for the number of rate hikes.
Fed funds futures have fully priced in a quarter-point tightening for the Fed's March meeting, plus three more for 2022.
The Swiss Franc fell 0.29% against the euro at 1.0379, just off the 1.0298 it hit recently for its strongest since 2015.

Bitcoin, which has almost halved in value since touching a record high of $69,000 in November, rebounded about 0.78% to trade at $37,010 as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pared steep looses.
Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, rose 0.47% at $2,454.91.

Investing.com -- The dollar pushed higher in early dealings on Tuesday, as the violent snap back in U.S. stocks in the second half of Monday’s trading failed to convince global markets that the recent volatility has run its course.
Risk aversion was in evidence across equity and commodity markets in Asia and Europe, nudging the dollar index back toward a two-week high. The index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, was up 0.1% at 95.995 by 3 AM ET (0800 GMT).
The euro was the weakest of the major currencies, falling 0.2% to $1.1305, while the pound was also extending its losses, albeit in narrow ranges, down less than 0.1% at $1.3470, after disclosures of yet another unauthorized party in 10 Downing Street put further pressure on beleaguered Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Also hurting sterling were figures showing another bigger-than-expected government borrowing requirement in December.
Ranges are likely to stay narrow as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy meeting, where the focus will be on the guidance given by Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference on Wednesday. The Fed isn’t widely expected to change its policy settings, but its ‘dot plot’ and Powell’s comments will indicate whether the central bank feels it needs to speed up the process of withdrawing stimulus.
Before that, the focus in Europe will be on the German business confidence index published by Ifo at 4 AM ET (0900 GMT). The ZEW Economic Sentiment index for January had risen surprisingly strongly last week, while IHS Markit’s purchasing managers index also pointed to a bright start to the year for Europe’s biggest economy. However, the Ifo survey is usually the most granular and reliable guide to economic trends there.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bundesbank had warned that the economy had likely contracted in the fourth quarter, as industry struggled with sustained chip shortages and, from December, a fresh wave of Covid-19.
Also of interest later will be the Hungarian central bank’s regular meeting. The NBH is expected to keep its key rate unchanged at 2.40%, after raising it in each of its last six monthly meetings from a base of 0.9%. That had appeared to stop the forint's steady decline through the second half of 2021. However, it has come under fresh pressure from the volatility coming out of the U.S., losing 2.5% against the euro in the last two weeks.
Central European currencies continue to struggle by regional association with Ukraine, where there has been no meaningful change in the situation overnight. The Polish zloty fell 0.4% against the euro to test a new low for the year, while the Russian ruble recovered a little from its sharp selloff on Monday to trade at 78.83 to the dollar."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, with the safe-haven asset remaining near a two-week high. Concerns about faster-than-expected U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening and possible armed conflict in Ukraine also continued to mount.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 95.935 by 11:23 PM ET (4:23 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.17% to 113.72.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7142. Australian data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index grew 1.3% quarter-on-quarter and 3.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. Meanwhile, the National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) Business Confidence index was at –12 for December.
The higher-than-expected number boosted the case for a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate hike in 2022, despite the central bank’s governor Philip Lowe previously maintaining that such an eventuality was extremely unlikely.
However, money markets have long disagreed with the RBA's stance and are priced for a rate hike by June 2022.
""The numbers are clearly well above the RBA's own forecasts for inflation, so the chances they will have to capitulate on their previous guidance are rising by the day,"" NAB head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
At the same, ""the numbers simply validated the position of the money markets,"" which explains why the Australian dollar did not have a sustained rally, he added.
The NZD/USD pair was down 0.33% to 0.6676.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.3297 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 1.3477.
The Fed will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday, which will be scrutinized for clues on a timetable for interest rate hikes and asset tapering. Money markets are priced for a first hike in March, with three more quarter-point increases by the end of 2022.
""The case for the Fed potentially following up a March rate rise before the June meeting - even as early as April - is a very compelling one, and there is a risk that the market will still have to reprice,"" said NAB's Attrill.
""The geopolitical risk has just added a new layer of safe-haven support.""
This geopolitical tension between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine that Attrill is referring to continues to mount. NATO said it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, a move denounced by Russia as an escalation of tensions.
Markets had largely ignored this tension until recently but are pricing more of a risk premium into the euro, according to ING Bank strategist Francesco Pesole. Concerns are also mounting that the tensions could prompt Moscow to cut energy supplies to Europe, he added."

Bloomberg’s real-time replica of the CFETS yuan index climbed to 103.47 on Monday, the highest ever in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2007. It traded around 103.38 on Tuesday.
The yuan has charged ahead even as China’s monetary easing narrows its yield advantage over the U.S. A hefty trade surplus and strong seasonal demand for the currency are fueling the gains, and the authorities have indicated they won’t stand in the way of an advance.
“The authorities have been more tolerant of yuan strength than we expected, but we still see this as being seasonal demand driven ahead of the Lunar New Year and the gains can retrace after that,” said Eddie Cheung, a senior emerging-markets strategist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) CIB in Hong Kong.
The onshore yuan rose to 6.3238 per dollar on Monday, the strongest since April 2018. China’s currency tends to get a boost at this time of the year when exporters’ dollar sales intensify ahead of the Spring Festival holiday.
The PBOC has shown little discomfort with the yuan’s strength and set the currency’s daily fixing rate at the strongest level since 2018 this week. The fixing limits the onshore yuan’s moves by 2% on either side.
China Shows Signs of Loosening Yuan Grip as It Starts Easing (1)

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a two-week high on Monday against a basket of currencies, lifted by rising geopolitical risk over Ukraine and a likely hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve at its policy meeting this week. 
Markets until recently had mostly shrugged off the massing of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders, but tensions have ratcheted up lately. NATO said it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, in what Russia denounced as an escalation of tensions.
The United States is considering transferring some troops stationed in western Europe to eastern Europe in coming weeks, a NATO diplomat told Reuters, and U.S. President Joe Biden ordered diplomats' families to leave Kyiv.
""Given people have lost money, whether it's in crypto or the stock market, people want to find a culprit and I think that people are torn between two possible candidates: the Federal Reserve and Russia,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. 
""I’m skeptical that all of this is Russia driven,"" Chandler said, referring to the sell-off in equity markets. ""But it doesn't mean when the first shots are fired, there won't be a dramatic market reaction.""
ING Bank strategist Francesco Pesole said markets were pricing more of a risk premium into the euro, with fears increasing that Russia's stand-off over Ukraine with the West could prompt Moscow to curb energy supplies to Europe.
The dollar index rose 0.25%, with the euro down 0.14% to $1.1324.
The euro also lost ground against the safe-haven Swiss franc, falling to 1.0298 at one point, the lowest since May 2015. But the single currency later traded up about 0.04%. 
Another safe-haven currency, the yen, earlier firmed a bit against the dollar, but later weakened 0.01% versus the greenback at 113.69 per dollar.
The dollar index has gained some 1.5% since Jan. 14. During this period, several banks have raised forecasts for the speed and size of the Fed's policy tightening, a picture that should be clearer at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. 
The Fed is expected to signal the start of interest rate hikes in March, while potentially indicating how fast it will shrink its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage debt that have swollen its balance sheet past $8 trillion. 
Most expect the first hike to be 0.25% in March and three more to 1.0% by year-end..
Data showed on Friday speculators cut net long positioning on the dollar to the lowest since September and instead added a net $2.6 billion of euro positions.
Leaving aside Ukraine tensions, the dollar's recovery could stall if the Fed signaled a preference for balance sheet reduction as a means to tighten policy, Pesole said. 
""If markets see the Fed willing to let balance sheet reduction do the heavy lifting, that may force a scaleback in forecasts for the number of rate hikes,"" he said.
""The dollar will find more support from actual rate hike expectations than expectations of draining liquidity out of the market.""
YUAN BUCKS TREND
The Chinese yuan was one of the few to withstand dollar gains, touching the highest since May 2018 at 6.324.
With China's central bank in rate-cutting mode and property sector concerns easing, flows to Chinese markets have picked up, especially into government debt.

Bitcoin, which has halved in value since touching a record $69,000 in November, fell below $34,000 for the first time since last July.
It traded as low as $32,967, while ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, slipped to around $2,244, the lowest since July.

Policy makers are suspending buys of foreign exchange on the open market in order to “reduce financial market volatility,” according to a website statement. The central bank conducts the transactions for the Finance Ministry as part of Russia’s fiscal rule, which is aimed at reducing the economy’s exposure to fluctuations in oil prices.

The latest pause comes amid mounting tensions with the West over Russia’s troop buildup near the border with Ukraine. The last time the central bank halted the buying was over two years ago, when the covid pandemic was first spreading, hobbling markets globally. 
While President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Russia has no plans to invade, local markets took a fresh leg lower on Monday after the U.S. ordered family members at its embassy in the Ukrainian capital to leave. 
“The central bank doesn’t want regular FX purchases linked to the budget rule to be an additional source of the selling pressure on the ruble,” said Piotr Matys, a senior currency strategist at InTouch Capital Markets Ltd. in London. 
“Unless investors witness concrete steps to de-escalate and Russia withdrawing or at least reducing its troops at the border with Ukraine, the path of the least resistance should remain to the upside in USDRUB,” he said.
The Russian currency pared losses after the announcement, trading down 1.9% at 78.68 per dollar as of 4:36 p.m. in Moscow, still the steepest slump in emerging markets on the day.  
At times when oil prices are high, the central bank buys foreign currency for its reserves. Purchases have been running at the equivalent of 36.6 billion rubles ($463 million) a day. Rebounding commodity prices have seen central bank reserves, which include the government’s wealth fund, swell to more than $600 billion.

Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex, noted that the dollar’s breakout earlier in the month has clearly been a false one, leaving the yen as the biggest gainer of the year to date among G10 currencies, with a 1.2%.
However, the usual correlations between risk assets have broken down, Chandler added. The second-best performing currency so far this year, he notes, is the risk-sensitive Canadian dollar.
The paradox is nowhere clearer than with the Russian ruble, which tested another nine-month low against the dollar in early dealings in Europe on concerns that last week’s diplomatic breakthrough won’t be enough to stop a second Russian invasion of Ukraine in eight years.
The State Department has instructed the families of U.S. diplomats in Ukraine to leave the country, suggesting that the U.S. still attaches a high probability to the risk of conflict. The U.K. followed suit on Monday.
The ruble fell to 77.479 to the dollar, despite ongoing strength in the price of crude oil, which typically determines its direction.
Developments in eastern Europe are, however, likely to take a back seat to those in Washington DC later in the week. The Federal Reserve’s policy-making committee starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday and is sure to give the dollar fresh direction.
For now, short-term interest rate futures suggest a possibility that the Fed will raise the Fed Funds target range by more than 25 basis points by the end of the quarter, implying a small risk of either a rate hike this week, or a 50-basis point hike in March. The overwhelming consensus, however, remains a first 25 basis point hike in March, which means that the most important developments at the Fed will be its guidance, especially with regard to when – and how fast – it will start to sell its accumulated bond portfolio back into the market.
U.S. Treasury yields rose in the first three weeks of the year, in part due to expectations of higher net supply driven by Fed sales of bonds during the year. But having peaked at over 1.80% last week, the 10-year Treasury yield is now back down at 1.76%.
In Europe, the main focus on Monday is likely to be on preliminary purchasing managers indices for January.  Also of note will be the Deutsche Bundesbank's monthly report, given German concerns about the 30-year high in inflation in the country and the lack of European Central Bank willingness to react by tightening monetary policy."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision due later in the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.10% to 95.735 by 12:11 AM ET (5:11 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.23% to 113.94.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7178 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.6719.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.3326 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3555.
""The Fed has got markets by the leash. And this week, it will once more tug and yank,"" HSBC co-head of Asian economics research Frederic Neumann said in a note.
A key driver currently driving the currency markets is when and how quickly central banks will hike interest rates and begin asset tapering.
""What will prompt investors to scurry about will be the guidance Chair Powell might give at his press conference about quantitative tightening later in 2022,"" said Neumann’s note, which added that he does not expect a policy change.
The Fed will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday, with some investors starting to speculate that it is possible, although unlikely, that the central bank will hike interest rates for the first time since early 2020.
""We consider the higher risk is the Fed’s statement portrays an urgency to act soon, likely in March 2022, in the face of very high inflation. The urgency could culminate in a decision to abruptly stop quantitative easing (QE) by mid-February,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts said in a note.
""A bullish statement and/or a faster end to the QE program could even encourage markets to price a risk of a 50bp rate hike in March,"" the note added, with the analysts predicting this would lead to a knee-jerk reaction higher in the dollar.
Investors also await the Bank of Canada’s policy decision, due to be handed down just ahead of the Fed’s. In Asia Pacific, Australia releases its consumer price index on Tuesday which will guide the Reserve Bank of Australia's stance in its policy decision to be handed down in February.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded at $36,026, after tumbling 10% on Friday and dropping as low as $34,000 on Saturday. Institutional investors’ increased exposure to cryptocurrencies means that their moves are more closely correlated with other risk assets, some investors warned."

Advisors to President Nicolas Maduro's administration spoke to investors and bondholders from Europe and the United States about their country's economic potential during a call organized by the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in Venezuela on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
Included in data discussed on the call were economic indicators and information showing that the flow of foreign currency to Venezuela's central bank hit $3.39 billion in 2021, up from $743 million the year before, the document showed. 
Some of the foreign currency was used to maintain stability in the exchange rate between the bolivar and the dollar, as well as to cover government expenses. 
The rise in foreign currency sales to the monetary authority follows an uptick in PDVSA's oil production and exports, despite U.S. sanctions. Venezuela's oil output hit 871,000 barrels per day in November, the same document said. 
Venezuela suspended payments to bondholders in 2017 when it proposed debt negotiations. However, that plan was put on ice by the country's unfolding crisis, while sanctions prevented U.S. citizens and companies from dealing with Venezuelan officials.
Venezuela tried a similar renegotiation in 2020 without success.
Neither Venezuela's ministry of communication nor the Spanish Chamber of Commerce responded to requests for comment.

Advisors to Vice President Delcy Rodriguez reminded bondholders during the call of economic policy changes and raised the possibility of injecting capital into sectors such as oil, mining, tourism and agriculture. They also highlighted that Venezuela's third-quarter economic growth hit 7.6% last year, the sources said. 
The country has struggled amid a long-running recession and high prices. In 2019 the government loosened financial regulations to aid businesses, which helped but are not enough to provide a full recovery, analysts say.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar declined on Friday, along with U.S. Treasury yields, while investors looked ahead to next week's Federal Reserve meeting for more clarity on the outlook for rate hikes.
Expectations that the Fed will tighten monetary policy at a faster pace than previously anticipated had driven a rise in yields and the dollar earlier this week, and the U.S. dollar index was set for biggest weekly percentage gain since mid-December.
U.S. Treasury yields fell as stock market declines reflected poor risk appetite, while concerns about potential conflict in Ukraine drove demand for the safe haven debt. 
Markets are pricing in as many as four rate hikes this year, starting from March and expect the Fed to start trimming its $8 trillion-plus balance sheet within months. Next week's Fed meeting could shed some light on how fast it will tighten.
""Everything is going to be somewhat calm"" until the Fed releases its statement on Wednesday after the two-day meeting, said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
""It makes sense the dollar is somewhat muted today given the lack of real impetus from the data front.""
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against major peers, was down 0.1% on the day at 95.650 but up 0.5% for the week.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was also dragged lower and hit its lowest level since August. It was last down 6%, while ether was down more than 8%.
Against the yen, the dollar was last down 0.4% at 113.680. For the week, the dollar was down about 0.5% against the yen. The euro was last up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.1341, while it was down about 0.6% for the week. 
Retail sales in Britain added to recent weaker economic data. The pound was down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3553.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged lower in early Friday dealings in Europe but remained well supported after another sharp selloff in U.S. equities on Wednesday damped risk appetite around the world.
By 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, was down 0.1% at 95.67, but was still on course for a gain of around 0.5% over a week that has been dominated by fears of inflation, higher interest rates and, latterly, signs of a soft patch for the U.S. economy due to the Omicron variant of Covid-19.
Initial jobless claims surged to their highest level in three months last week, while earnings disappointments from the banking sector and, on Thursday, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have cast doubt on the prevailing growth narrative of the last couple of years.
Geopolitical concerns are also keeping risk appetite limited, with U.S. President Joe Biden warning on Wednesday that he expects Russia to invade neighboring Ukraine again. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken meets with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov for talks later Friday to defuse the situation. The Russian ruble was unchanged at 76.64 to the dollar but is down over 3.5% this week.
The European day got off to a gloomy start, as the U.K. recorded a sharp drop in both retail sales and consumer confidence, amidst surging Covid cases and household energy costs. The GfK confidence index fell to its lowest level since February while retail sales fell 3.7% on the month in December. November's figures were also revised down. 
Analysts said the figures likely reflected a change in spending patterns due to the pandemic, with consumers having completed their Christmas shopping earlier than usual due to fears of product shortages. October's sales had been exceptionally strong.
""Total consumer spending may not decline this year, given high savings levels and room for some further catch-up in certain services categories,"" said ING economist James Smith in a note to clients. ""But retail looks more vulnerable, particularly after two years of above-average spending on goods. The latest fall in consumer confidence is a potential warning sign.""
The pound fell 0.2% to $1.3565 and was also down 0.4% against the euro in response. The euro, meanwhile, was up 0.2% at $1.1362, having lost 1.5 cents against the dollar in the last week as the gap between ECB policy and that of the Federal Reserve widens. ECB President Christine Lagarde again pushed back against calls for an early rise in interest rates in a keynote speech on Thursday, despite headline inflation running over 5% in the Eurozone, its highest since the creation of the single European currency.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia. Fears that inflation will remain high and that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten its monetary policy soured investor sentiment, driving gains for the safe-haven Japanese yen vis-a-vis the riskier Australian dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 95.665 by 10:41 PM ET (3:41 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.37% to 113.66, a one-week low.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.50% to 0.7189 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.36% to 0.6730.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3430. The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3593, near its lowest level since Jan. 11.
The U.S. currency took a breather from its recent gains as a rally in U.S. Treasury yields cooled. However, it was still headed for its best week in two months.
The Australian dollar fell as much as 0.57% to 82.02 yen, its weakest level in a month, and as last down 0.32% to trade at $0.72035.
U.S. shares suffered a sharp selloff overnight in the final hours of trading, while Asian counterparts were down on Friday. U.S. Treasury yields retreated from multi-year highs. However, U.S. yields advanced, driven by market expectations that the Fed will tighten monetary policy faster than anticipated.
Fed funds futures have already fully priced in an interest rate hike in March 2022 and a total of four hikes within the year.
The Fed will convene for a two-day policy meeting to hand down its policy decision starting Tuesday. Investors will be on the lookout for clues to the Fed’s timeline for both interest rate hikes and asset tapering.
The greenback hit a more-than one-week high on Thursday and was up 0.65% for the week. It rebounded from the previous week's 0.61% slide.
Despite recent volatility, the dollar could rise further as the Fed tightens its monetary policy, according to some investors.
The currency ""should continue to firm into next week's Fed meeting,"" Westpac said in a client note, adding they ""wouldn't be surprised"" if the dollar index tops its 2021 high at 96.938.
""Admittedly, a lot is priced in now,"" the note continued, ""but a straight comparison of the dollar index versus yield spreads shows that the dollar has not fully priced in this story."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fluctuated but remained rangebound on Thursday as this week's upward trajectory of U.S. Treasury yields took a breather.
While the dollar initially edged lower following the release of disappointing economic data, the greenback reversed its losses after benchmark Treasury yields partially recovered in the wake of a 10-year TIPS auction which showed soft foreign demand for the notes. 
Against a basket of world currencies, the dollar was last up 0.13%. 
U.S. 10-year note yields were at 1.8325%, off their two-year high of 1.902% reached on Wednesday.
""While yields are softer, they’re still at elevated levels, and the dollar continues to draw support ahead of next week’s Fed meeting,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington. ""We’ve seen ebbs and flows this month, but the underlying fundamentals remain bullish for the dollar on the view that the Fed is going to adopt a more hawkish policy stance going forward."" 
The benchmark yield's advance has been driven by market expectations that the U.S. Federal reserve will tighten monetary policy at a faster pace than previously anticipated. Fed funds futures have fully priced in a rate hike in March and a total of four in 2022.
The central bank's Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) is expected to convene its two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, at the conclusion of which market participants will closely parse the committee's statement regarding the tightening timeline.
""Currencies are sticking to the range, waiting on central banks next week,"" Manimbo said, adding that ""market expectations have arguably become overly aggressive with respect to hawkish Fed policy.""
The Euro was last at $1.1313, below an earlier high of $1.1369.
The pound was 0.03% higher at $1.3615 and the yen was nominally lower at 114.14 per dollar.
The Aussie firmed 0.41% to $0.7241, extending advances from the previous day, and the Canadian dollar reversed earlier gains, with one U.S. dollar worth C$1.2474.
The Norwegian crown fell after the central bank voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% and said it was on track for an interest rate hike in March.
The crown was last down 0.16% against the dollar.
Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was most recently up 3.0% at $42,916, while smaller rival ether gained 4.3% to $3,215.

Investing.com -- The dollar was broadly unchanged on foreign exchange markets on Thursday, ahead of a busy day for central bank and economic news. 
By 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, was effectively flat at 95.47. That has been the pattern for the year so far, despite a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields which would normally be more supportive for it. Year-to-date, the dollar index is actually down 0.1%.
The sideways drift is even more surprising, given the increasingly stark contrast between monetary policy in the U.S. and in other big parts of the world economy. The Chinese central bank continued its easing of monetary policy to help a troubled real estate sector earlier, cutting its Prime Loan Rate to 3.7% from 3.8% and promising more support in future. Central banks in Norway, Turkey and Ukraine all meet in the course of the day.
That move comes only days after the Bank of Japan again reiterated there was no chance of a near-term rise in interest rates, seeing inflaton as likely to stay well below target for another two years at least. 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde also took up the theme on Thursday, telling the virtual World Economic Forum that the conditions that are forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates are not present in the Eurozone, where wages are rising much more slowly and that over half of the inflation being currently reported is due to energy prices, and thus likely to reverse. The ECB releases the accounts of its last meeting later Thursday. 
The market took that message with a pinch of salt: EUR/USD was up 0.2% at $1.1369, after the German statistics office Destatis reported that producer prices rose 5.0% in the month of December alone, and were up 24.2% on the year, well above inflation. Most of that increase was due to the fact that natural gas prices more than doubled. Eurozone consumer price data for December are due at 5 AM ET.
Gas deliveries to Germany are a central part of another major issue keeping markets occupied at the moment. The Russian ruble fell 0.5% to 76.49 to the dollar, after U.S. President Joe Biden suggested he expects Russia to invade Ukraine in the near future, in what would be its third invasion of a neighboring state in 14 years.
Other points of interest for the market on Thursday include U.S. jobless claims data, which last week showed the first real impacts from the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 across the country. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve will also release its monthly business survey, while existing home sales data for December are also due.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia but retreated as the week’s rally in U.S. Treasury yields also cooled. However, higher commodity prices supported Canadian and Australian equivalents.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 95.528 by 12 AM ET (5 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 114.43. Japanese trade data released earlier in the day showed that the trade balance was –JPY582.4 billion ($5.09 billion) and the adjusted trade balance was –JPY0.44 trillion in December. Exports grew 17.5% and imports grew 41.1%.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.40% to 0.7238, with Australian data released earlier in the day showing that the employment change was 64,800. The data also showed that the full employment change was 41,500 and the unemployment rate was 4.2% in December.
The NZD/USD pair was down 0.27% to 0.6767.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.3437, with the People’s Bank of China cutting the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) from 3.8% to 3.7%, and the five-year LPR from 4.65% to 4.6%, earlier in the day.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 1.3624. The two-year gilt yield rose to 0.958% on Wednesday, the highest level since March 2018, and gave the pound a boost.
The Australian dollar extended Wednesday’s gains, while the Canadian dollar hit a 10-week high the same day before paring gains.
""Overnight commodity prices were the big driver for commodity currencies, but you've still got the undertone that the omicron COVID-19 variant is not going to have a lasting detrimental impact on the global economic outlook,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) senior economist and currency strategist Kim Mundy told Reuters.
Oil was mixed on Thursday but broadly remained near October 2014 highs. Newcastle coal futures are at their highest since October 2021.
Governments worldwide are beginning to ease quarantine rules and reviewing COVID-19 curbs despite the spread of omicron continuing. This attempt towards a semblance of normalcy was motivated by omicron's lower severity and boosted a rally in commodities.
Meanwhile, investors are also bracing for the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than expected in its policy decision to be handed down on Jan. 26. Fed funds futures have fully priced in an interest rate hike in March 2022, with four hikes expected within 2022."

Investing.com – Gold was down, on Thursday morning in Asia, with higher U.S. Treasury yields blocking gains as investors remain cautious in preparation for the U.S. Federal Reserve's next policy decision.
Gold futures edged down 0.18% to $1,839.85 by 10:49 PM ET (3:49 AM GMT), remaining near its highest level since Nov. 22, 2021. The safe-haven yellow metal recorded its best session in three months on Wednesday, boosted by a weakening dollar and intensifying U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose on Thursday, gently pressuring gold.
The Fed is widely expected to tighten monetary policy at a much faster pace than expected a month ago to curb continually high inflation. This inflation is now the biggest threat to the U.S. economy in 2022, according to economists polled by Reuters.
Investors now await the Fed’s next policy decision, due to be handed down on Jan. 26. Policy decisions from central banks in Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Turkey, and Ukraine are due later in the day.
In other commodities, crude oil prices were on an upward trend and contributed to inflation concerns.
In the U.K., Wednesday’s inflation data showed that the consumer price index grew 5.4% year-on-year and 0.5% month-on-month in December. The producer price index input grew 13.5% year-on-year but contracted 0.2% month-on-month.
The higher-than-expected figures could pressure the Bank of England to hike interest rates.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China looks set to embark on a divergent path from its U.S. counterpart. China’s central bank cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) from 3.8% to 3.7%, and the five-year LPR from 4.65% to 4.6%, on Thursday.
In other precious metals, silver inched down 0.1% and palladium fell 0.4%, while platinum inched up 0.1%."

Investing.com – The pound has racked up gains against the dollar since bottoming in early December, and now is setting up to challenge last year’s high, Bank of America said in a note.
GBP/USD was up 0.2% to $1.3624.
“GBP/USD is breaking out of a bull flag pattern with a bullish MACD cross. We think GBP/USD has medium term upside while above the 1.32s which can equate to a rally above the 2021 highs,"" BofA said.
Beyond the technical indicators, sentiment on the pound has been supported by ongoing expectations that the Bank of England may be forced to hike rates again in February to tackle surging inflation.
Data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to 30-year high of 5.4% on broad-based prices increases.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slid on Wednesday, with U.S. Treasury yields retreating as well after hitting roughly two-year peaks on 2-year and 10-year notes, but the greenback remains well-supported as investors prepared for a widely expected interest rate increase in March.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields touched a new two-year high of 1.902% on Wednesday, but was last down 4 basis points at 1.8271%.
Bond yields in other major economies rose as well, with the euro, sterling, the Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, among others, gaining versus the U.S. currency.
Sterling, meanwhile, rose after data showed British inflation rose 5.4% in December, its highest level in 30 years, raising rate hike expectations. Talks of a leadership challenge to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, however, have kept the pound in check.
""Central banks are now getting evidence that Q4 did not necessarily slow the pace of inflation and in fact, places like the U.K. are experiencing CPI numbers not seen since the early 1990s,"" said Juan Perez, senior FX trader and strategist, at Monex USA in Washington.
""We see the buck gaining short term, but do not sleep on other currencies as the pricing in of Fed hikes becomes an after-thought,"" he added.
The Fed will meet next week and will likely provide clarity and details on the end of quantitative easing, possibly in March. The U.S. central bank could also signal it will raise interest rates in March as well, right after ending QE.
Fed funds futures have fully priced in a rate hike in March and four in all for 2022.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index was down 0.2% at 95.528.
The greenback trimmed losses after data showed U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly increased in December amid unseasonably mild weather. Housing starts rose 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.702 million units last month.
The euro, the largest component in the dollar index, was up 0.2% at $1.1348, after the previous day's sharpest daily drop in a month. 
The single European currency was underpinned overall after Germany's 10-year bond yield rose above 0% for the first time since 2019 on Wednesday, marking a potential turning point for euro area debt characterised for years by negative yields. [GVD/EUR]
The German 10-year yield, considered a benchmark for the whole euro zone, rose as high as 0.025%, and was last little changed on the day at -0.007% .
The euro, meanwhile, dropped to a 23-month low versus sterling after the red-hot UK inflation data. It was last flat at 83.29 pence. Against the dollar, the pound rose 0.2% to $1.3624 .
The pound was also supported by the surge in UK yields, with the two-year gilt yield rising to 0.958%, its highest level since March 2018.
The Australian dollar rose 0.5% to US$0.7224.
The U.S. dollar edged 0.2% lower versus the Canadian currency to C$1.2492 after Canada's annual inflation rate climbed to a 30-year high of 4.8% in December.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Currency market investors are less sure about the U.S. dollar's outlook now than they have been for many months, prompting sharp gyrations by the greenback last week despite red hot inflation data and a hawkish Federal Reserve. 
""Everybody had been positioned for a stronger dollar"" going into the new year, said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. Then last week, the U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, fell as much as 1.2% before paring loses to finish the week down 0.6%. 
The drop came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is ready for the start of tighter monetary policy and data that showed the largest annual rise in inflation in nearly four decades. 
Dollar bears view the recent volatility as evidence that a lot of good U.S. economic news was already priced in after international Monetary Market speculators exited 2021 with a net long position in the dollar valued at about $20 billion, close to the most bullish in two years.
(GRAPHIC: USD positions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akpezelqevr/USD%20positions.JPG) 
For months, the dollar had been supported by the idea that monetary policy in the United States was likely to normalize at a faster pace than in many advanced economies. Now investors are growing more confident about other parts of the world, and looking for economies where growth could surprise to the upside. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently said the euro area will outgrow the U.S. economy over the next two years.""I think we are seeing a transition in currency markets. It's less to do with relative monetary policy and more about relative growth,"" McIntyre said. 
""It's not going to a straight line .. but at the end of 2022 the dollar will be weaker,"" McIntyre, who after having been generally neutral on the dollar for months has started selling dollars to fund the purchase of higher yielding currencies. 
McIntyre said he is long the Australian dollar and the Swedish krona.
Investors were not rushing to buy dollars even as short-term U.S. Treasury yields climbed. A year-opening selloff in bond markets sent 2-year yields up by about 23 basis points this year. Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management, noted that flies in the face of the trend during 2021.
""This might signal a regime change in which the dollar peaks and begins reflecting a compression in relative growth and real yields versus the rest of world,"" Shalett said in a note.
The dollar could come under more pressure if global stocks start attracting money away from the United States, said Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, noting the greenback was supported last year by strong capital flows into Wall Street.
International stock indexes that are off to a strong start this year include India's S&P BSE Sensex, up 4.3%, the UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, with a 2.4% gain and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, up 3.1%. The S&P 500 Index is down 4.0%.
""International investors hold a huge amount of dollar assets,"" Rose said. ""We have thought for a long time that the dollar is vulnerable to capital flows suddenly reversing."" 
Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy at Amundi Pioneer, believes the dollar's safe haven-allure may falter if COVID-19 becomes less deadly and investors are less worried about severe economic ramifications. 
""If we make that transition, all of a sudden the risks to growth diminishes,"" Upadhyaya said. 
""The dollar loses that flight to quality sheen,"" he said.
HEALTH WARNING
Upadhyaya, however, has a health warning for those looking to jump on the dollar bear market band wagon, he said.
Markets may have not factored in the full extent of possible Fed hawkishness, including the potential some investors see for a 50-basis point interest rate hike as soon as March, Upadhyaya said. 
""Given how fast the Fed were to react in terms of easing policy ...I also wouldn't rule out the possibility that the Fed may hike aggressively,"" he said.
A more aggressive Fed could also bolster dollar-focused carry trades, a strategy where investors sell low-yielding currencies to buy a higher yielding one and pocket the difference, analysts at HSBC said in a note last week.
Indeed, some investors used last week's dollar weakness as a buying opportunity.

""We have see some clients opportunistically buying dollars on this pullback,"" Peter Ng, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank, said.
Despite the dollar's recent wobble, the spread between Treasury and German 10-year yields is at 185 basis points, about as favorable it was to the dollar as it was two months ago. ""It has been a tough start to 2022 for the USD, but we view the fashionable disregard for relative monetary policy as unsustainable,"" analysts at HSBC said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey and the United Arab Emirates said on Wednesday they had agreed a nearly $5-billion swap deal in local currencies, in a sign of warming diplomatic relations that provides Ankara financial support as it faces economic turmoil. 
The agreement between the countries' central banks comes after the regional rivals sought in recent months to repair relations that were badly strained in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.
Turkey could tap the foreign currency to bolster its reserves, which on a net basis are at a two-decade low, after the central bank began costly market interventions last month to prop up the tumbling lira. 
The lira, which lost 44% to the dollar last year, was 0.5% weaker at 13.6 at 1039 GMT. Some economists were skeptical the swap deal would bring reprieve. 
""We do not see the swap agreement as a meaningfully positive development as it only boosts the headline gross reserve series but does not add to the (central bank) hard currency reserves,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
The two central banks said in a statement the accord was for three years with the possibility of extension. Its nominal size is 64 billion lira ($4.71 billion)and 18 billion dirham. 
""This agreement demonstrates the two central banks' commitment to deepen bilateral trade in local currencies in order to advance economic and financial relations between our countries,"" said Turkish Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu.
Last month Reuters reported, citing officials, that the Turkish central bank was wrapping up talks with its UAE and Azeri counterparts with at least one deal likely soon. 
The accord follows a visit by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan to Turkey in November, when preliminary talks on a swap deal took place.
Turkey has swap deals with China, Qatar and South Korea worth about $23 billion. 
Turkey's foreign reserves have been thin since a series of currency market interventions in 2019-2020 in which some $128 billion was sold via state banks, backed by the central bank. Ankara at the time sought swap deals with the United States, Britain, Russia and Malaysia, Reuters reported. 

The central bank's net international reserves fell below $8 billion on Jan. 7 to their lowest level since 2002.

Investing.com -- The dollar was marginally lower in early trade in Europe Wednesday, consolidating after being pulled higher by rising bond yields and a broad drop in risk appetite as the U.S. returned from a long holiday weekend on Tuesday.
By 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, was down less than 0.1% at 95.677, after hitting its highest level in a week on Tuesday at 95.805. 
The main driver for that upward move had been fears of inflation and expectations of aggressive action by the Federal Reserve to contain it. While talk of a 50-basis point hike in official interest rates at the Fed's March meeting is still confined to a small minority, short-term money market futures have implicitly started to price in that risk. 
The yield on the 10-Year benchmark U.S. Treasury continued to grind higher in early dealings, however, rising two basis points to a new two-year high just under 1.90%. 
The sell-off in bonds has not been limited to the U.S.  Germany's 10-Year benchmark bond traded above 0% for the first time since 2019, after German inflation was confirmed at 5.3% - the highest since the reunification boom over 30 years ago - in December. At a Eurogroup meeting on Tuesday, Germany's new finance minister Christian Lindner had warned of the need to rein in fiscal stimulus in the Eurozone and reintroduce some more effective limits on government borrowing, in a year when the European Central Bank is set to start winding down its support for Eurozone bond markets.
The euro was flat at $1.1332, after falling over 0.5% on Tuesday. 
The pound was also struggling to make headway against the dollar, drifting just under $1.3600, despite another 30-year high in U.K. inflation that raised the prospects of the Bank of England raising interest rates again in the near future - possibly as early as its next meeting on February 3. 
Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed both core and headline consumer prices rising 0.5% in December, well above forecasts. That pushed the annual CPI up to 4.2% and the annual core CPI up to 5.3%.
Other factors supporting the dollar have been the sharp rise in oil prices in recent days, which raises the dollar needs of non-U.S. who have to buy fixed amounts of oil. That factor may ebb a little Wednesday after Turkish officials said that a key export pipeline which had been taken offline after a mystery blast on Tuesday is now pumping at its usual rate again.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, with rising U.S. yields pushing it back above support levels that have not been hit in the past few months. Investors also continue to anticipate a hike in U.S. interest rates.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 95.737 by 10:17 PM ET (3:17 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 114.63. The moves in the U.S. bond market unsettled equity investors and boosted the safe-haven yen.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7187. Australian data showed that the Westpac Consumer Sentiment index contracted 2% in January, compared to the 1% contraction from the previous month.
The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.6781, with New Zealand’s electronic card retail sales growing 0.4% month-on-month and 4.2% year-on-year in December 2021.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3531. The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3598, with the U.K. due to release the latest consumer and producer price index figures later in the day.
Two-year Treasury yields climbed 15 basis points over two sessions to cross the 1% mark and benchmark 10-year yields were at a two-year high of 1.8842%.
With the U.S. Federal Reserve due to hand down its policy decision in the following week, investors are nervous about further hawkish moves.
""A lot of Fed officials left us with hawkish impressions right before going quiet ahead of the meeting,"" NatWest markets strategist Jan Nevrusi told Reuters.
""After Tuesday's price action, there is slightly more than one hike priced in for the March meeting, and going into next week, I would imagine it oscillates within the lower end of the 25-50 basis point range.""
The Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates three more times within 2022. The dollar’s gains could continue if investors start expecting interest rates to rise not just faster but further as well.
""We expect the U.S. rate rethink, and this latest shift higher in yields reflects a push higher in the implied terminal rate, rather than just a faster pace of increases initially, to support the dollar in the first half of the year,"" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes told Reuters.
Across the Atlantic, U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine are also on investors’ radars. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar posted its best daily gain in two weeks on Tuesday following a jump in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, while the yen steadied after initially sliding as the Bank of Japan said it would stick to its ultra-loose monetary policy. 
The U.S. currency also rose to a one-week high against a basket of currencies.
Investors are focused on next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will likely signal that it will raise interest rates in March for the first time in more than three years. The fed funds futures have fully priced in the March tightening and four rate hikes in 2022.
""The Federal Reserve will have to become more hawkish with their rate statement in January's meeting following the progress made in the labour market in December and the rise in inflation to a near 40-year high,"" Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe, said in a research note.
""We expect this to provide a floor under the dollar, which has been under pressure over past weeks as the market starts to settle on a more balanced outlook for Fed normalisation.""
As investors prepared for the possibility of the Fed being more hawkish than expected, Treasury yields jumped, with two-year yields -- which track short-term rate expectations -- crossing 1% for the first time since February 2020. [US/]
The U.S. 10-year yield also hit a two-year peak of 1.856% overnight.
In line with Treasury yields, the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, hitting a one-week peak of 95.832, and was last up 0.6% at 95.772.
Chester Ntonifor, chief foreign exchange strategist at BCA Research in Montreal, said the dollar's gains are not sustainable over the longer term, beyond three to six months.
""If the Fed is getting more hawkish than other central banks because of inflation, then there is a dissonance there because inflation is a global problem,"" he said.
""What the market is telling you is that the Fed will catch up to those central banks that have already hiked rates, but since inflation is a global problem, the Fed cannot hike much faster than other central banks. Therefore, the dollar's rate advantage will narrow against other currencies.""
The euro hit a one-week low of $1.1319 and was last down 0.7% at $1.1325.
The currency was largely unmoved by data showing German investor sentiment hit its highest in six months in January on expectations COVID-19 cases will fall by early summer, allowing growth in Europe's largest economy to pick up.
YEN SLIPPED
The yen slid against the dollar after the Bank of Japan said it would maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy even as its global counterparts move towards exiting crisis-mode policies.
By afternoon trading, the dollar was flat against the yen at 114.61 yen , having reached as high as 115.06 overnight.
The Australian dollar, meanwhile, fell 0.4% to US$0.7181, while the New Zealand dollar dropped 1.1% to US$0.6768.

Investing.com -- The dollar rose in early dealings in Europe on Tuesday, pulled higher as concerns over inflation pushed 10-year U.S. government bond yields to their highest in over two years. 
The yield on the 10-year U.S. benchmark rose as high as 1.86% in the overnight session, a level it last saw when practically no-one outside China had heard of Covid-19.  The two-year benchmark yield, which is more sensitive to expectations for short-term interest rates, also broke above 1% for the first time in two years.
By 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, was up 0.1% at 95.287. 
The dollar returned briefly above the 115 yen level after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the bank hadn't discussed the possibility of raising interest rates, as had been reported by newswires last week. That was despite the fact that the bank raised its outlook for inflation slightly to 1.1% for the next two years. That is still well below the bank's 2% target.
""For the foreseeable future, we see little chance of the BoJ adjusting policy rates,"" said Oxford Economics analyst Shreena Patel. ""We believe the yen will remain weak this year but that room for further depreciation is limited.""
USD/JPY traded at 114.79, up 0.2% on the day. 
The dollar had hit a five-year high against the yen earlier this month, amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy much more this year than the BoJ. The Fed's first policy meeting of the year takes place next week, and policymakers have now entered their usual blackout period ahead of it. 
In Europe, the pound was flat against the dollar at $1.3639 but edged up against the euro despite numbers showing that unemployment fell by less than expected in the three months through November. Analysts zeroed in on a sharp downward revision to the claimant count in November and to a bigger-than-expected drop again in December, suggesting that the U.K. economy rode out the first part of the winter wave of Covid-19 comfortably enough.
The euro was also little changed against the dollar at $1.1402, ahead of the release of the German ZEW economic sentiment index for January.
In emerging markets, the ruble weakened again amid growing fears that President Vladimir Putin will send his tanks across the Ukrainian border again. USD/RUB rose 0.4% to 76.40, although the movement was largely in line with other emerging market currencies as the dollar strengthened again. 
The ruble typically reacts badly to geopolitical shocks emanating from Russia, but the country's foreign exchange reserves stand at a record high, while its public debt is low and foreign currency borrowing by its corporates has fallen by nearly half since the last time it invaded Ukraine in 2014. With prices for oil and other commodity prices still high, the ruble has various pillars supporting it.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, while the latest policy decision from the Bank of Japan dictated the yen’s moves.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 95.127 by 10:08 PM ET (3:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 114.73.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7222 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.6806.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.11% to 6.3410 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3659.
The Bank of Japan handed down its policy decision earlier in the day, with the interest rate steady at –0.10%.
The dollar’s weakness came despite a continual rise in U.S. Treasury yields. Two-year yields rose above 1% for the first time since February 2020 as the Asian session opened and as trade resumed after a holiday in the U.S. Five-year yields rose 3.6 bps to 1.5960%, the highest since January 2020.
Yields have been on an upward trend in 2022, with investors expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin interest rates hikes as soon as March.
""The conundrum everyone is grappling with is either the dollar is a screaming buy relative to yields, or there is a lot of dollar supportive news priced in,"" National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
Theories for the anomaly included investors reacting early to the fact the dollar has historically peaked around the time the Fed has raised rates, or they were trading in anticipation of a surge in global economic growth, he added. However, Attrill was not convinced by either argument.
Meanwhile, expectations that the Bank of England will hike its own interest rates gave the pound a boost. Any weakness in the currency as Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces calls to resign would be contained, according to ING analysts.
Although no major economic data is due from the euro zone throughout the week, investors look to speeches from European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde and colleagues, as well as the minutes from the central bank's December policy meeting due on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Monday as traders continued to hold on to dollars but took the view that Federal Reserve tightening plans were largely priced in, while the euro eased from Friday’s two-month high.
An unexpected cut to key lending rates in China highlighted it as the outlier, with other major central banks in talks to raise rates. China's move only briefly weighed on the yuan.
The U.S. dollar index, which declined sharply last week until Friday's leap, rose 0.1% to 95.323 at 1340 GMT. The cash Treasury market was closed for a holiday on Monday.
""With 3.7 Fed rate hikes priced in for 2022 and 2.3 for 2023, market participants seem to be inferring that the risks to policy pricing are now more balanced,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) told clients. 
The Fed meets on Jan. 25-26 and is not expected to move rates yet. 
Speculators’ net long U.S. dollar positions, or bets that the dollar will rise, edged lower in the week to Jan. 11, but they remained close to recent highs, suggesting investors are keen to hold the greenback amid ""hawkish rhetoric from the Fed in recent months"", Rabobank told clients.

Investing.com -- The dollar started the week in subdued fashion after news of a Chinese interest rate cut supported risk assets.
By 3:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market economies, was down 0.1% at 95.10, taking its losses for the year-to-date to 0.5%. Its only notable gain was against the safe-haven yen, a day ahead of the Bank of Japan’s regular monetary policy meeting. USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 114.35.
The biggest gainers were higher-yielding commodity-linked currencies, which rose on perceptions that the move will support demand for raw materials - the Australian dollar rose 0.1% to 0.7214, while USD/CAD fell 0.2% to C$1.2523. In emerging markets, the South African rand and Turkish lira both profited from the dollar's lack of direction.
The yuan rose 0.1% to trade at 6.3491 to the dollar, still near a three-year high after the People’s Bank of China cut its one-year rate for the first time in nearly two years, by 0.1% to 2.85%. 
The move came on the same day that fresh data showed the Chinese economy slowed in the fourth quarter, with a spate of Covid-19-related lockdowns and a spreading crisis in the key real estate sector both hitting output and consumption.
Chinese retail sales slowed sharply in December, although industrial production and fixed asset investment held up slightly better than expected.
Further lockdowns this year, coupled with signs of easing inflation, have raised expectations of further policy easing by the PBoC, a sharp contrast with much of the rest of the world, where central banks are scrambing to rein in inflation.
Short-term interest rate futures in Europe imply that even the European Central Bank will be forced to raise its key rate before the year-end, despite strenuous signalling to the contrary from the bank’s top management.
In Europe, the euro and sterling have failed to build on the two-month highs that they hit last week, and started the week largely adrift. The euro was up 0.1% at $1.1425, while the pound was up 0.1% at $1.3682, still untroubled by reports suggesting that Prime Minister Boris Johnson may be forced out of office for presiding over repeated breaches of Covid regulations by both himself and his staff.
Elsewhere, the Russian ruble was flat, but still under pressure from tensions surrounding Ukraine. Talks broke down late last week over Russian demands for guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO, and Russia's foreign minister warned over the weekend that it ""will not wait forever."" The ruble, which usually strengthens when oil prices are as strong as they are currently, traded at 76.20 to the dollar.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) springing a surprise benchmark cut. Investors are also looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's January policy decision and the timetable for interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 95.153 by 10:58 PM ET (3:58 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.20% to 114.43 with the Bank of Japan handing down its policy decision on Tuesday.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7211 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.6803.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.08% to 6.3478, with Chinese data released earlier in the day showing that the GDP grew 4% year-on-year and 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021. The data also showed that industrial production grew 4.3% year-on-year and retail sales grew 1.7% year-on-year in December, while the unemployment rate was at 5.1%.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3678.
Chinese bonds rose, while the yuan fell after the PBOC cut borrowing costs for medium-term loans for the first time since April 2020. Ten-year government bond futures rose to their highest since June 2020 after the move, and the yuan began onshore trade marginally softer at 6.3555 per dollar.
Meanwhile, the dollar's move follows its jump on Friday along with U.S. yields. The hawkish interest rate provided support for the U.S. currency even as momentum for gains started to wane.
""Friday's move suggests to me that the interest rate driver for dollar strength is not dead and buried. It may not necessarily return to drive new dollar highs, but ""we've had a hawkish twist out of every Fed meeting since June 2021,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill.
Investors are also looking ahead to the Fed’s next policy decision, due to be handed down on Jan. 26. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon remarked that there could be ""six or seven"" interest rate hikes in 2022, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman floated tweeted over the weekend that he expects an initial 50 basis point hike.
U.S. markets are closed for a holiday on Monday, but benchmark 10-year futures were sold to a two-year low, and Fed funds futures also fell.
Elsewhere a month-long rally for sterling petered out, but some investors believe it could resume gains should inflation data prompt the Bank of England (BOE) to hike interest rates.
""Interest rate markets are currently pricing an 80% plus chance of a 25 bp rate hike by the BOE on Feb. 3,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joe Capurso.
""A quicker pace of inflation could see pricing move closer to 100%."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar snapped a three-day losing streak on Friday as the recent selling spree driven by the view that Federal Reserve tightening moves were largely priced in abated, and as weaker risk appetite in financial markets led investors to shun riskier currencies.
The U.S. dollar index was 0.3% higher at 95.157, but still looked set to finish the week down about 0.6%, its worst weekly showing since early September.
The greenback, which rose more than 6% against a basket of currencies in 2021, came under pressure this week despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that the U.S. economy is ready for the start of tighter monetary policy and data showing the largest annual rise in inflation in nearly four decades.
""Investors appear to be taking the view that the USD has peaked and that Fed tightening moves are priced in and the likes of the euro offer better potential returns down the road,"" Scotiabank foreign exchange strategists said in a note.
""We do not concur but have to acknowledge that the USD has suffered a setback — psychologically, at least — by breaking with supportive yield spreads versus its peers and by breaking below the base of its recent consolidation range,"" they said.
Hedge fund dollar positioning close to the highest levels since early 2020 has added to the selling pressure on the dollar this week, analysts said.
U.S. retail sales dropped by the most in 10 months in December, likely the result of Americans starting their holiday shopping in October to avoid empty shelves at stores. [nL1N2TU18H]
On Friday, the dollar struggled to advance against the Japanese yen, with the U.S. currency falling 0.02% to more than a three-week low of 114.15 yen.
The safe-haven Japanese currency has benefited from the recent souring of risk sentiment in global financial markets. 
Bank of Japan policymakers are debating how soon they can start telegraphing an eventual interest rate hike, which could come even before inflation hits the bank's 2% target, Reuters reported on Friday.
With global stock markets under pressure on Friday and Treasury yields higher, the Australian dollar, seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, fell 0.99% to a two-day low.

Sterling was 0.22% lower against the dollar as investors assessed the impact of a potential leadership change in the country as Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces the gravest crisis of his premiership after revelations about a series of gatherings in Downing Street during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Cryptocurrencies struggled to make a meaningful rebound after sharp losses at the start of the week. Bitcoin was up about 1% on the day at $43,086.34, not far from the five-month low of $39,558.70 touched on Monday.

337,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 12:38PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIRUT (Reuters) -Lebanon's central bank said on Friday it aimed to boost the Lebanese pound's value by easing restrictions on dollar purchases after the currency hit a record low, fuelling fresh protests about rising prices and a collapsing economy.
The pound, which has lost more than 90% of its value since Lebanon's financial crisis erupted in 2019, dropped beyond 33,000 to the dollar, though it had clawed back some ground to around 27,200 by Friday.
Before the crisis, which has driven a significant proportion of residents into poverty, it traded at 1,500 to the dollar. 
In response to the sharp decline, the central bank said it was removing a ceiling related to bank purchases of dollars using the official Sayrafa exchange rate platform.
""This initiative aims at curbing the volatility of the exchange market and aims at strengthening the pound's value against the dollar,"" bank Governor Riad Salameh told Reuters, 
""...The operation consists of decreasing the amount of bank notes in Lebanese pounds.""
Salameh also said there had been ""signs of manipulation of the prices of the dollar to the pound,"" without giving details.
One analyst has described the central bank move as like taking ""a Panadol pill to treat a major crisis"", saying the government needed a programme of reforms to tackle deep economic problems.
Commercial banks have all but shut their doors to depositors amid a liquidity crunch caused by the economy crumbling under a mountain of state debt.

A new cabinet was formed in September, promising to start fixing the economy and restart talks with the International Monetary Fund, but ministers have not met for three months because of dispute over the conduct of an investigation into a huge explosion in Beirut port in 2020.
Salameh is facing multiple domestic and international investigations into his conduct at the head of the central bank, which he has led for three decades. He denies any wrongdoing.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar weakened in early European trade Friday, heading for its worst week in more than a year as traders now consider Federal Reserve interest rates hikes this year as being fully priced in. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 94.735. The index is down over 1% for the week, on course for its largest weekly percentage fall since December 2020.
This dollar selloff has come in a week that has seen annual U.S. consumer inflation climb to levels not seen since the early 1980s and several Fed officials talk about the need for the central bank to hike interest rates and reduce its balance sheet to combat inflation.
The latest policy maker to suggest prompt Fed action was Governor Lael Brainard, who said during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, that “we do have a powerful tool and we are going to use it to bring inflation down over time.”
USD/JPY traded 0.4% lower to 113.72, pushing as low as 113.64 for the first time since Dec. 21, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1467, climbing to its highest level since mid-November, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged lower to 0.7280, just off an almost two-month high.
“A well-telegraphed jump in U.S. inflation to 7% was taken as a ‘sell the fact’ opportunity for FX investors, with a substantial unwinding of dollar longs triggering widespread dollar weakness,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
“The technical break higher in EUR/USD likely put some extra pressure on the dollar in other crosses: whether the 1.1500 resistance holds is key for dollar bulls at the moment.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3721, helped by data showing the U.K. economy grew by a much stronger-than-expected 0.9% in November, finally taking the world’s fifth-largest economy above its size just before the country went into its first Covid-19 lockdown.
Sterling has been pretty resilient of late, withstanding the political turmoil surrounding Prime Minister Boris Johnson after the Bank of England raised interest rates in December. The market is also pricing in a strong likelihood of another hike in February.
USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3460 after China posted a record trade surplus in December and in 2021, as exports outperformed expectations during a global pandemic while import growth slowed sharply.
USD/KRW traded largely flat at 1186.81 after the Bank of Korea raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, as widely expected.

339,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 02:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"A look at the day ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe.
Let's take a break from just how quick is the Fed going to slam on the brakes to contain inflation and talk about sterling.
The pound is proving to be one of the best performing major currencies in the early days of 2022. It's trading near its highest levels in over two months above $1.37, thanks to signs the Omicron COVID surge is abating and on expectations that UK interest rates could rise again as soon as February.
Data on Friday shows Britain's economy grew a faster-than-expected 0.9% in November.
Yet, as week draws to an end, there's a question mark over how long the rally will last given rising political uncertainty. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership is in the balance as he faces calls to resign from some in his party over Wednesday's admission that he attended staff drinks during the May 2020 lockdown. Fresh revelations about parties in Downing Street were being reported on Friday.
If the number of bank research notes this week reminding clients of the rules of a potential leadership challenge to Johnson are anything to go by, sterling bulls be warned.
At the Fed, Governor Lael Brainard became the latest and most senior U.S. central banker on Thursday to signal that rates will rise in March to combat inflation.
Asian shares took a beating from rate-hike unease; Japan's Nikkei fell 1.3%. European shares are tipped to open lower although U.S. stock futures are moving up.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are slightly higher at 1.73% and the dollar index is near two-month lows -- a sign that tighter policy is already well priced into the greenback now.
December U.S. retail sales numbers out later in the day is the next focus.
Lastly, China Evergrande shares edged up after the world's most indebted developer secured a crucial approval from onshore bondholders to delay payments on one of its bonds as more developers race to avert defaults.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:
- China posted a record trade surplus in December and in 2021
- Germany 2021 GDP
- Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves
- ECB: President Christine Lagarde
- Fed: Philadelphia President Patrick Harker; New York President John Williams

340,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 10:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea raised interest rates on Friday for the third time since the summer, underscoring the board’s determination to swiftly curb inflation and financial risks, and its belief that the economy can weather virus outbreaks with less central bank support.  
The quarter-percentage-point increase to 1.25% brings the rate back to where it was before the pandemic struck. The decision was expected by 14 of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest forecast a hold. 
Bond futures fell as the monetary policy statement suggested rate hikes will continue. The BOK said in a statement that it expected inflation to stay in the 3% range “for a considerable time.” That view is in stark contrast to its stance in November and an indication of how price concerns have ballooned since then.  
The rare back-to-back rate hike likely indicates that Governor Lee Ju-yeol had become increasingly uncomfortable about waiting to move again, following recent signs that the Federal Reserve will probably raise borrowing costs earlier and more aggressively. 
An easing of daily Covid infections from a recent peak in December also helped create a window of opportunity that Lee was apparently keen to take before the end of his term in March and a presidential election the same month. Government plans for an extra budget indicate there will be continued fiscal support for the economy, adding to the case for a hike.
The rate decision shows that the BOK saw omicron’s economic impact as limited and was concerned the variant will likely add upward pressure on inflation, said Cho Yong-gu, a fixed income strategist at Shinyoung Securities. 
“Financial imbalances are yet to be fully resolved, and the Fed bringing forward its tightening timing was also likely a factor,” Cho said.
Moving Ahead 
Korea’s 10-year government yields rose three basis points to 2.43% on Friday, following the BOK’s inflation forecast and as Finance Minister Hong Nam-Ki said the extra budget will be funded by bond issuance. The won was little changed at 1,188.40 as of 10:37 a.m. in Seoul. 
The latest rate move puts the BOK further ahead of global peers in pulling back from pandemic stimulus settings as an increasing number of central bankers consider the timing of their own actions.  
Lee has said that the BOK doesn’t need to match the Fed on rate hikes, but no action taken this quarter despite the hawkish signals from the Fed could have unsettled financial markets expecting rate increases.
Maintaining a premium over U.S. interest rates can help maintain stability in local markets and prevent a further weakening of the won. Finance Minister Hong ordered officials to closely monitor foreign exchange movements on Monday after the currency reached its weakest level since July 2020 last week. 
While the Korean central bank largely justified its initial rate hike in August as a move to avoid financial imbalances building up from prolonged stimulus, it has since added its concern over rapid price growth into the mix. At 3.7%, inflation is hovering near a decade-high, providing a key motive for early action. 
Faster Inflation 
In Friday’s statement, the BOK said inflation will average above the mid-2% level this year, higher than the 2% it forecast in November. The bank still expected economic growth of around 3%. It added the board will judge when to further adjust policy accommodation, indicating more tightening ahead. 
The economic backdrop has been supportive of a hike. Despite strict virus curbs in place, the broader economy appears to be holding up better than in previous waves, with export strength continuing and consumption taking less of a hit. 
Attention now will turn to whether the BOK can continue to raise rates at such a pace -- three times in five months -- or whether there will be a lengthy hiatus before the next move. 
Lee has repeatedly characterized the rate hikes since August as a backing away from extraordinary stimulus rather than a tightening of policy. With rates back at pre-pandemic levels, the BOK may now move at a slower pace over the coming months, a view shared by economists.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, set for its largest weekly fall in eight months. Investors trimmed long positions as they bet that several U.S. interest rate hikes are fully priced in for 2022.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 94.173 by 10:10 PM ET (3:10 AM GMT). It is down about 0.9% for the week and set for its largest weekly percentage fall since May 2021, halting an around six-month rally.
The JPY/USD pair was down 0.33% to 113.80.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7275 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.6855.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3605. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 20.9% year-on-year and imports grew 19.5% year-on-year in December. The trade balance was at $94.46 billion.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 1.3725. Confidence that the U.K. economy can withstand the latest COVID-19 outbreak and that the Bank of England could hike interest rates beginning in February 2022 has sustained the pound, despite the political crisis threatening Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s position.
With U.S. inflation at its highest level since the early 1980s, selling forced the dollar through key support against the euro. The single currency is up more than 0.8% for the week so far, trading at $1.1457.
Meanwhile, U.S. interest rate futures have all but locked in four interest rate hikes in 2022, supported by Fed officials including vice-chair nominee Lael Brainard.
""Investors appear to be signaling that ending quantitative easing, hiking rates four times, and commencing quantitative tightening all in the space of nine months is so aggressive that it will limit the scope for hikes further out,"" MUFG head of global markets research Derek Halpenny said in a note.
""It has in fact reinforced the belief that peak Fed funds will be below 2%… what can change this? We will need to see data on the economy that convinces the market of stronger growth. That could see thinking on the terminal fed funds rate shift higher. That would be the catalyst for renewed dollar strength,” the note added.
For the riskier Antipodean currencies, investors await labor and inflation data in both Australia and New Zealand later in the month.
""Further evidence of strength in the labor market will trigger expectations... for a potential positive shift in Reserve Bank of Australia rhetoric which will underpin the outlook for the Australian dollar,"" Rabobank FX strategist Jane Foley told Reuters.
""We expect AUD/USD to push higher to $0.74 in the second half of 2022.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on Thursday to a two-month low, a day after data that showed an expected surge in U.S. consumer prices in December fell short of offering any new impetus for the Federal Reserve's policy normalization efforts.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.2% at 94.791, its lowest since Nov. 10. The index, which rose 6.3% in 2021, is down about 1% for the week, on pace for its worst weekly performance in about eight months.
""Coming into the new year the dollar positioning was very much skewed to being long,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities.
""Yesterday's inflation numbers, in conjunction with (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell's testimony for his nomination hearing, were basically just in line with what markets had already positioned for,"" Issa said. ""There wasn't anything materially new.""
December's monthly U.S. consumer inflation figures, published on Wednesday, were a fraction higher than forecast and the increase in year-on-year consumer prices was, as expected, 7% - its biggest jump since June 1982.
Nevertheless, traders do not see these inflation readings as urgently shifting an already hawkish Fed too much. With at least three interest rate hikes already in the market price, some investors pared bets on further dollar gains.
Powell on Tuesday gave no clear indication that the Fed was in a rush to speed up plans for tightening monetary policy, putting some downward pressure on the greenback, which has benefited in recent weeks from expectations for a rapid pace of policy normalization.
U.S. producer price inflation slowed in December as the cost of goods fell amid signs that stretched supply chains were starting to ease, hopeful signs that inflation has probably peaked.
As continued high inflation eats further into Americans' pocketbooks, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Thursday became the latest, and most senior, U.S. central banker to signal that the Fed is getting ready to start raising interest rates in March.
TD Securities' Issa attributed part of the selling pressure on the greenback to technical factors, with the euro on Wednesday rising above the $1.14 level for the first time since mid-November.
""Once we got through that $1.14 level, momentum players likely flipped to sell dollars on that move,"" he said.
International Monetary Market speculators exited 2021 with a net long position in the dollar that was close to the largest it has been in two years.
""The scale of the dollar sell-off must surely be partially indicative of positioning,"" MUFG analyst Derek Halpenny wrote in a research note. (Graphic: Bullish on the buck, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomaywavd/Pasted%20image%201642087117672.png) 
Sterling, which has been rallying as traders reckon Britain's economy can withstand a surge in COVID-19 cases and that the Bank of England is going to hike rates again as soon as next month, rose 0.11% to $1.372, its highest since late October.
The Australian dollar, often considered a liquid proxy for risk appetite, was 0.07% higher at $0.7289, its strongest since mid-November.

The broadly weaker greenback helped lift the Canadian dollar for a third day.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble fell sharply on Thursday and government bonds fell to more than a three-year low amid growing geopolitical concerns about Moscow's standoff with the West.
The rouble dropped after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Washington's rejection of Moscow's key security demands was leading talks into a dead end. Russian military specialists were giving President Vladimir Putin options in case the situation around Ukraine worsened, he said.
Russia said its talks with the West had so far failed to bridge fundamental differences over the Ukraine crisis and Moscow's demands that NATO pull back from central and eastern Europe.
At 1519 GMT, the rouble was 2.2% weaker against the dollar at 76.36, heading away from the session peak of around 74.4625.
Versus the euro, the rouble fell 2.4% to 87.59 after hitting 87.62, its weakest since July 2021.
""Ryabkov's comments spooked the market ... sparking a sell-off in the rouble and OFZ bonds,"" said a forex dealer at a major Russian bank in Moscow.
Yields on Russian 10-year benchmark OFZ government bonds, which move inversely with their prices, rose to 9%, a level last seen in late 2018.
The central bank did not immediately comment on a Reuters question about the rouble drop and its implications.
The rouble has been under pressure since October, as Western countries expressed concerns about Russia's military build-up near Ukraine. Moscow has said it can move its army within its own territory as it deems necessary.
On Wednesday, NATO said it was willing to talk to Russia about arms control and missile deployments to avert the risk of war in Europe, but Moscow said the situation was ""very dangerous"" and the way forward was unclear.
The Russian finance ministry also added to the pressure on the rouble by increasing state purchases of foreign currency for the state coffers in the month ahead.
The finance ministry's increased FX purchases will limit the room for the rouble recovery, and the Russian currency is expected to firm only to 74 against the dollar by the end of the month, Sinara Investment Bank said in a note.
But the rouble still retains fundamental support from globally high commodity prices and central bank rate hikes at home.

Russian stock indexes fell, shrugging off a recovery in Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, to $84.64 a barrel. 
The dollar-denominated RTS index dropped 5.5% to 1,524.2 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 3.5% lower at 3,696.6 points, its lowest since Dec. 24.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's sol currency, which plunged last year due to political risk, is bouncing back so far in 2022 and likely to keep strengthening, analysts and traders said, as interest rates rise and copper prices soar.
The currency has risen more than 2% against the dollar this month, hitting its strongest level since outsider leftist Pedro Castillo become president of the world's no. 2 copper producer last July. 
The sol hit a record low against the dollar last year and ended down over 10%, one of Latin America's worst performers.
Now, despite the ongoing risk of potential political disruptions, its outlook has turned rosier on a recent series of interest rate hikes, a weaker dollar, strong commodities prices and a better outlook for government tax incomes.
""A structural factor is that there is a lot of dollar inflow from exports,"" said Hugo Perea, chief Peru economist for BBVA (MC:BBVA) Research. ""Monetary policy also looks to be moving rapidly towards levels of neutrality.""
Peru has hiked its interest rate for six consecutive months, lifting it to 3% last week in a cycle that is expected to continue as the central bank seeks to rein in inflation. Higher rates encourage investment and savings.
""I think the main factor that would help the exchange rate is if the benchmark interest rate continues to rise,"" said Asvim Asencios, a currency trader at Renta4 SAB Peru.
Of six analysts and traders Reuters spoke to, four projected that the sol, now at a seven-month high of 3.9 per dollar, would strengthen this year to as high as 3.8 per dollar. One said it would weaken to 4.15 per dollar. The sixth was on the fence.
POLITICAL UNKNOWNS
Analysts said positive technical fundamentals were for now outweighing political factors, but that investors remained wary.
Castillo, a relative moderate within a more radical Marxist party, is battling a fragmented Congress, ongoing protests in the mining sector and an official investigation into alleged corruption and influence peddling.
""This year we have regional elections and we could see more radical groups begin to take over the political map of Peru. This would affect the sol,"" said Perea, adding: ""Institutional checks for now are containing populist or radical outbursts"". 
Rising global copper prices could also offset political volatility, with an injection of mining tax dollars expected in March. 
""We saw mining companies selling (dollars) practically until the last day of last year in a context where the exchange rate looked attractive,"" said a currency trader at a local bank. 
Another currency trader said non-mining firms also ""already have enough dollars in their balance sheets and portfolios.""
The sol hit an all-time low of 4.138 against the dollar in October. 
Its rise started in December when local corporate demand for dollars began to ebb, allowing the central bank to reduce intervention in the market.
""What we are seeing right now is a recomposition of portfolios,"" said Eduardo Jiménez, head of the information systems at Lima-based consultancy Macroconsult.
""People are recognizing that with these fundamentals you cannot have an exchange rate of 4.0 soles per dollar.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A digital pound used by consumers could harm financial stability, raise the cost of credit and erode privacy, though a version for wholesale use in the financial sector demands greater appraisal, British lawmakers said on Thursday. 
Britain's central bank and finance ministry said in November they would hold a consultation this year on whether to move forward on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that would be introduced after 2025 at the earliest.
Central banks across the world have stepped up work on CBDCs to avoid the private sector dominating digital payments as cash use falls. The prospect of widely-used cryptocurrencies issued by Big Tech has also galvanized such efforts. 
But an e-pound used by households and business for everyday payments could see people move cash from commercial bank accounts to digital wallets, said the report by a committee in the House of Lords, parliament's unelected upper chamber. 
That could spark financial instability in times of economic stress and increase borrowing costs as a key source of lenders' funding would dry up, it said.
A digital pound could also harm privacy, the report added, by allowing the Bank of England to monitor spending.
""We were really concerned by a number of the risks that are posed by the introduction of a CBDC,"" Economic Affairs Committee Chair Michael Forsyth told Reuters.
ROLE OF PARLIAMENT
The potential benefits of a CBDC - from tackling the decline to cash to supporting payments innovation - laid out by the Bank of England in 2020 were ""overstated"" or could be ""achieved by alternative means with fewer risks,"" Forsyth said. 
He said, for instance, that regulation was a better tool to ward off the threat of cryptocurrencies issued by Big Tech firms.
The Bank of England did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Still, a wholesale CBDC used to transfer large sums could make securities trading and settlement more efficient, the report said. Britain's central bank and finance ministry should consult on its advantages over the expansion of the existing settlements system, the report said.
Britain's parliament should have the final say on any decision to launch a e-pound, it said, calling for lawmakers to also vote on how such a currency would be governed. 
Forsyth said financial services minister John Glen had failed to give assurances that a CBDC ""was not just something that the Bank of England and the Treasury would cook up and decide on the governance.""

A CBDC would have ""far-reaching consequences for households, business and the monetary system,"" Forsyth said. ""That needs to be approved by parliament.""
Responding to a request for comment on Forsyth's comments, a spokesperson for the Treasury, which runs Britain's financial and economic policy, said no decision had been made on whether to introduce a CBDC.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, adding to the previous session’s sharp losses after the release of the latest inflation data failed to encourage any further bets on aggressive Federal Reserve policy tightening. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 94.800, hovering near a two-month low.
USD/JPY traded 0.2% lower to 114.43, near a two-week low, EUR/USD climbed 0.2% higher to 1.1463, climbing to its highest level since mid-November, and GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3729, with sterling showing strength after the Bank of England's recent rate hike, and shrugging off Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s political travails. 
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7300, climbing an almost two-month high.
Wednesday’s U.S. data showed that the headline consumer price index grew 7% year-on-year and the month-on-month figure rose by 0.5%. Stripping out the volatile energy and food sectors, the core consumer price index grew 0.6% month-on-month and 5.5% year-on-year in December.
While the headline figure showed consumer prices rising at their fastest rate in nearly 40 years, it was largely as expected and is not seen changing the thinking of the Fed policy makers significantly. With at least three rate hikes already in the market price, some traders pared bets on further dollar gains.
That said, “it should allow consolidation for a floor below the dollar in the near term – further cementing expectations for three Fed hikes and leaving the door open to speculate for four in 2022,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “We think this is a reason for markets to keep buying the dips in the dollar for the time being.”
There are more U.S. inflation numbers on the economic data slate later Thursday, with December PPI due, but a lot of attention is likely to be on Fed Governor Lael Brainard as she appears at a hearing on Capitol Hill into her nomination as deputy chair.
In prepared remarks before her appearance, Brainard said tackling inflation and getting it back down to 2% while sustaining an inclusive recovery is the U.S. central bank’s most pressing task.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had dampened overly aggressive tightening expectations in his renomination testimony on Tuesday, stating that the Fed was still debating the time frame involved in reducing the central bank’s balance sheet.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, clawing back from new lows hit overnight. Although data showed that U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest rate in nearly 40 years, it is likely not worrying enough to change an already hawkish monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 94.970 by 10:19 PM ET (3:19 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.07% to 114.55.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7283 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.6855.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3605 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3716. The pound had been rallying over bets that the Bank of England could hike its own interest rates as soon as February 2022, and investors are also optimistic that the economy will survive the latest surge of COVID-19 cases.
A developing political crisis, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologizing for attending a party during Britain's first -19 lockdown, has so far had a minimal impact.
Wednesday’s U.S. data showed that the core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month and 5.5% year-on-year in December. The CPI grew 7% year-on-year, the fastest pace since June 1982, and 0.5% month-on-month.
""I don't think it was anything within the components of the CPI that caused the market to take a sigh of relief,"" NatWest markets strategist Jan Nevruzi said in a note.
""A few tenths of basis points of a difference on either side of consensus carries a much lower significance when CPI was running at a third of the current pace... would a 6.7% or 7.3% print really have changed the Fed's trajectory in the next few months or in 2022? I do not think so.”
With the U.S. Federal Reserve already indicating interest rate hikes and asset tapering in 2022, other investors agreed with Nevruzi.
""The dollar does not have to increase because the Fed is readying a tightening cycle. It is not a simple equation of Fed hikes equals dollar increases. The dollar is a counter-cyclical currency which decreases as the world economy recovers,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Joe Capurso told Reuters.
Investors also await the U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing for Fed vice-chair nominee Lael Brainard, taking place later in the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell to a two-month low against a basket of currencies on Wednesday after data, which showed an expected surge in U.S. consumer prices in December, fell short of offering any new impetus for the Federal Reserve's policy normalization efforts.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.7% at 94.944, after slipping as low as 94.903, its lowest since Nov. 11.
U.S. consumer prices surged in December, with the annual increase in inflation the largest in nearly four decades, which could bolster expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates as early as March.
The consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after advancing 0.8% in November, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through December, the CPI surged 7.0%, the biggest year-on-year increase since June 1982. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.4% and shooting up 7.0% on a year-on-year basis.
    ""The U.S. economy appears ready for interest rate lift-off to start in March,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
""The dollar's problem though is that the market already has highly hawkish expectations for Fed policy this year. So as hot as today's CPI price was, it merely reinforced what's already baked in for the dollar and Fed policy,"" Manimbo said. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday gave no clear indication that the Fed was in a rush to speed up plans for tightening monetary policy, putting some downward pressure on the greenback which has benefited from U.S. rate-hike expectations in recent weeks.
""(It's) just a case of the market currently getting too ahead of itself with Fed normalization; we will need to see this inflationary impact from Omicron really play out for the Fed to hike four times and embark on quantitative tightening this year I think,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe.
""While we don’t think today’s CPI release will derail the Fed’s likely liftoff in March, continued reports of narrow inflation pressures will likely lead markets to trim expectations of the normalization cycle across 2022 as a whole, which will undoubtedly result in sustained USD depreciation,"" Harvey said.
Traders have priced in an about 80% chance of a rate hike in March, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. 
The Australian dollar, often considered a liquid proxy for risk appetite, rose 1.04% to a one-week high against the U.S. dollar. The weaker greenback and higher oil prices helped lift the Canadian dollar to its highest level in nearly two months. 

And sterling was 0.56% higher, helped by the weaker dollar and a view that the worst of the Omicron COVID-19 surge may be passing in Britain - helping pave the way for another near-term rise in UK interest rates.
Elsewhere, bitcoin was 2.3% higher at $43,717.08, extending its rebound from the five-month low touched on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a fresh two-month low against a basket of currencies on Wednesday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in December, but in line with economists' expectations.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.3% at 95.339, its lowest since Nov. 15. 
 
"
350,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 03:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As waves of volatility lash bond and stock markets, currencies are an island of relative calm. Wall Street says that’s about to change as rifts open between central banks the world over.
At Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas SA, strategists are predicting greater price swings as policy makers scale back on stimulus at different rates, opening fault lines under usually stable Group-of-10 currencies. BNP’s Oliver Brennan is predicting one-year implied volatility between the euro and the dollar will advance to around 9%, a level last seen at the height of the pandemic -- and before that, back in 2017, when the Federal Reserve’s previous hiking cycle was in full swing.
It’s a sea change for traders accustomed to near-united monetary largesse that’s kept borrowing costs low -- and markets boring. Yet for many, disparities including those between the newly hawkish Fed and more dovish peers such as the European Central Bank are an unmistakable signal that it’s time to abandon short-volatility bets and switch to strategies that profit from dramatic ups and downs.
“We are in this inflection point and if you don’t start reducing your short vol exposure, it’s very likely you’re going to end up erasing your gains,” said Andres Jaime, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, who entered the currency market in 2006. While he’s seen central-bank policy divergence before, what would be unique this time is the “potential pace of tightening of the Fed,” he said.
Morgan Stanley's Jaime sees global FX volatility readings rising to around 10.5 during 2022 -- that compares to about 7.2 on JPMorgan’s Global FX Volatility gauge currently. The bank expects higher volatility in high beta currencies in particular, such as the New Zealand kiwi, which should bear the brunt of price swings as a shift in monetary policy gets underway, he said.
The Fed caught markets off guard when the minutes to its latest meeting showed officials’ increasing preference for quicker rate hikes to help tame inflation running at fastest pace in four decades. Traders are now pricing in more than three 25-basis-point hikes this year, compared with just one 10 basis-point increase by the ECB, which has close to ruled out any hikes until at least 2023.
Central banks in Norway, New Zealand and the U.K. meanwhile have already started raising rates, while Canada is hot on their tails. That’s in contrast to the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank where hiking rates will likely be pushed beyond this year.
So far, the bond market has felt most of the heat, with a gauge of volatility in U.S. Treasuries hovering close to levels last seen in March 2020. In contrast, the JPMorgan Global FX Volatility index has slipped back to just above its average for 2021.
Bank of America analysts expect currency volatility to pick up though, citing historical analogs from 2008, 2011, and 2018, when it trailed the rise in inflation by about three months. 
They recommend positioning for higher volatility in the euro and Canadian dollar pair, given the interest-rate path for the economies is diverging and the outlook for the energy market -- a key driver for the loonie -- remains uncertain. 
For Unigestion SA portfolio manager Jeremy Gatto, pairs including Britain’s pound and Norway’s krone might offer enticing volatility plays given their sometimes unpredictable central banks. The Bank of England surprised markets with a rate increase in December despite headwinds from omicron.
“Before Covid-19 you could be a generalist, it was pretty much every central bank on the same page,” said Gatto, 38, who started in the industry in 2007. “Now you can’t just say I’m going to be long the dollar, or long or short vol. You’re going to have to pick which cross you’re going to apply that logic to.”
Liquidity Concerns
Political machinations are also feeding into the mix. Eimear Daly, an FX strategist at Barclays, is betting on increased volatility in the euro-dollar pair, stemming from French and Italian elections.
Traders are especially wary of a sudden increase in volatility given financial conditions are becoming less forgiving. Since the financial crisis in 2008, one-year implied volatility in the euro-dollar cross has collapsed from over 20% to 5.8% on Tuesday, weighed down by bond buying programs and record-low interest rates.
“People who have come into the business in recent years have lived in a world of low rates and massive liquidity provision that has been insurance against volatility spikes,” said Michael Melvin, executive director at the Rady School of Management, University of California San Diego and former multi-asset strategist at BlackRock, who has been studying and working in the currency market for 40 years. 
Not everyone is ready to abandon short-volatility strategies that netted gains of 15.4% across assets in 2021, their best year since 2009, according to provisional Eurekahedge data compiled by Bloomberg.
“The sweet spot for us is a little bit of elevated volatility and markets trading sideways,” said Tom Pansegrau, 35, who focuses on short-volatility strategies at 7orca Asset Management. He doesn’t foresee “any major surprises” because the Fed has been “straightforward with its path on raising interest rates,” he said.
But the response to the ins and outs of the Federal Open Market Committee’s debate about policy tightening showed how even well-telegraphed moves can surprise markets. The Nasdaq 100 Stock Index, which includes interest-rate-sensitive technology shares, fell as much as 7.1% in the first six trading days of the year.
“There’s complacency around how much central banks are willing to do to stop inflation -- there’s a belief that the Fed is not going to be able to hike rates a lot,” said Morgan Stanley's Jaime. “For me that’s a risk and that’s where I see most of the pain coming from.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, stabilizing after the previous session’s weakness as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell soothed fears the central bank will tighten monetary policy aggressively this year.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded just higher at 95.675, after falling to 95.535 in the Asian session, the lowest since Nov. 18.
USD/JPY traded 0.1% higher to 115.41, recovering from a one-week low of 115.04 at the start of the week. EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1357, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3632, just off a one-month high. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7217, climbing to its highest in a week.
Powell expressed confidence, in his renomination testimony on Tuesday, that the U.S. economy was strong enough to cope with higher interest rates and a runoff of its asset holdings to combat inflation. However, he added policymakers were still debating their plans on reducing the central bank’s balance sheet, allaying market fears for a sudden withdrawal of monetary support.
“What he didn’t say was also important. He didn’t back four rate hikes in 2022, nor a March start to hikes, nor did he give any details on when the Fed balance sheet run-off would start,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA.
Previous Fed speakers had taken a more hawkish line, with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and his Kansas City counterpart Esther George saying this week that high inflation and a strong recovery warrant a rapid rundown of Fed asset holdings. 
Attention will now turn to the release of the latest U.S. consumer inflation data later in the session, with headline CPI expected to come in at a hefty 7% on a year-on-year basis.
“The U.S. inflation data later today will either confirm a period of U.S. dollar weakness or result in a nasty whipsaw in price action,” Halley added.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3646 after the release of China’s consumer and factory-gate inflation for December.
The consumer price index grew 1.5% year-on-year, lower than November’s 2.3% growth, while the producer price index rose 10.3%, a slowdown from November’s 12.9%. The figures give the People's Bank of China space to loosen monetary policy further to cushion the impact from a slowdown in the giant real estate sector.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, dropping to its weakest since November 2021 after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s warning that it could take several months to decide on running down the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 95.560 by 10:07 PM ET (3:07 AM GMT), its lowest level since Nov. 30.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 115.35. The dollar recovered against the yen from a one-week low of 115.045 hit earlier in the week.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.09 % to 0.7216, with the riskier Australian dollar hitting its highest level in almost a week. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.6791.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.13% to 6.3655. Wednesday’s Chinese data showed that the consumer price index (CPI) contracted 0.3% month-on-month while growing 1.5% year-on-year, and the producer price index (PPI) grew 10.3% year-on-year in December.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3645, with the pound rising to $1.3641 for the first time since Nov. 4, 2021.
Powell was speaking at a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing for his re-nomination at the Fed’s helm. He said the U.S. economy was ready for higher interest rates and a runoff of its asset holdings, or quantitative tightening, to tackle inflation. However, he added that approaches to reducing the Fed's balance sheet are currently being debated, and it could take anywhere from two to four meetings for the decisions to be made.
However, other Fed officials adopted a more dovish tone, which soothed market fears of a sudden quantitative tightening. One such official was Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who said on Monday that high inflation and a strong recovery warrant a rapid rundown of Fed asset holdings.
""While Powell didn't really push back on market pricing around expected Fed rate hikes, we've certainly seen relief play out across markets"" after he ""tried to remove a belief that they are stuck on a set path,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""Risk is buoyant,"" weighing on both the dollar and the safe-haven yen, the note added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony signalled that while the Fed will be normalizing policy it has not made a decision on reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
Powell noted that policymakers were still debating approaches to reducing the fed's balance sheet, and said it could sometimes take two, three or four meetings for them to make such decisions.
Powell's overall message on Tuesday was less hawkish than some investors had expected, especially in light of recent commentary from some other Fed speakers, analysts said. 
High inflation and a strong recovery will require the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times this year, beginning as soon as March, and warrant a rapid rundown of Fed asset holdings to draw excess cash out of the financial system, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Monday.
""Powell defied the hawkish commentary of others on the Fed’s rate-setting committee, suggesting that a quantitative tightening decision will come in the next two to four meetings, with bonds allowed to roll off in an organic manner - as opposed to actively selling securities into the market,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""This is lifting global risk appetite and spurring flows into yield-sensitive currencies like the Canadian dollar.""
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was down 0.32% at 95.627. The Canadian dollar was up about 0.8% against the greenback.
While the dollar index has been well supported in recent weeks by the idea that the Fed will raise interest rates aggressively this year, it has struggled to break above the 16-month high touched late in November.
Traders have ramped up bets for rate hikes this year after the U.S. central bank's minutes from the Dec. 14-15 policy meeting suggested an earlier-than-expected rate hike and the possibility that it may cut its bond holdings sooner than many initially thought.
On Tuesday, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar was up 0.6%, aided by data showing retail sales surpassed forecasts for a second month running in November.

Sterling rose 0.36% on Tuesday to touch its highest level versus the dollar in almost 10 weeks, helped by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates further.
Elsewhere, bitcoin was up 2.4% on the day at $42,839.43, after having dropped below $40,000 on Monday for the first time since September.

LONDON (Reuters) -Sterling rose on Tuesday to touch a pre-pandemic high versus the euro, supported by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates further. 
The pound edged 0.1% higher versus the euro at 83.35 pence by 1600 GMT, after touching its highest level versus the single currency since February 2020. 
Against the dollar, it rose 0.2% at $1.3611, hovering around its highest level since Nov. 4, when the pound slid 1.5% on the day after the BoE surprised the market by keeping interest rates unchanged.
Over the past weeks, investors have ramped up expectations that the BoE will raise interest rates as early as next month after a surprise hike in December by 15 basis points, to 0.25%.
You-Na Park-Heger, FX analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said the prospect of interest rate hikes by the BoE is supporting sterling. But ""quite a bit of it is likely to be priced in already so that the GBP rally could begin to run out of steam"", she added. 
Jane Foley, head of FX Strategy at Rabobank in London, said sterling has also gained some support from signs of weakness in the U.S. dollar. Against a basket of currencies, it was trading on Tuesday well below the 16-month highs it touched in November despite rising bets this month that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than initially expected. 

""The market is already holding long USD positions and this is making it difficult for the greenback to react to continued speculation about Fed policy tightening. This may allow cable freedom to push higher in the coming weeks,"" Foley said. 
She expects the market to unwind some of the expectations for BoE rate hikes as pressure on real incomes in the UK will likely ""become more obvious as the winter progresses"".

Protesters took to the streets in several areas of the country on Monday night, burning tires and voicing anger at the dire economic situation amid political deadlock. Cars queued at fuel stations to fill up before another expected rise in prices.
""You would like to believe that you can be hopeful, but there is no hope,"" said Abdel-Rahman Shaar, who runs a computer shop in central Beirut. ""People are dying of hunger ... , the state is in a coma and the dollar (exchange rate) is crashing.""
The Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 90% of its value since 2019, was trading at a new low of more than 33,000 to the dollar on Tuesday from 27,400 on Dec. 31. It had traded at 1,500 before the economy was crushed by a mountain of debt.
Public frustration has been fuelled by political sclerosis among Lebanon's sectarian leaders.
A new cabinet, appointed in September as a step towards reviving talks with the International Monetary Fund, has not met for nearly three months amid a dispute over the conduct of an investigation into the devastating 2020 Beirut port explosion.
President Michel Aoun held a series of meetings on Monday and Tuesday to win support for a national dialogue conference to discuss the economic crisis among other issues, but he has so far only secured backing from his close allies.
""At the best of times, the call for dialogue is normal and necessary. At a time of hardship, pressure and bickering, it is more than necessary not to stop dialogue,"" Mohamed Raad, a lawmaker from Hezbollah, a powerful Shi'ite Muslim group that has an alliance with Aoun's Christian party, said after meeting the president.
Others, including rivals from Aoun's Christian community, have rejected the proposal. Some have said talks must wait until a parliamentary election in May, while others have said the cabinet needs to meet first.

Aoun's six-year term as president, a post reserved for a Christian under Lebanon's sectarian system, ends later this year adding further uncertainty to the political outlook.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar slipped lower in early European trade Tuesday, but remained in a tight trading range as traders look to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s appearance in Congress later session for clues over when the central bank will start raising interest rates. 
In his opening remarks for the hearing released in advance, Powell pledged to prevent high inflation from becoming ""entrenched,"" but did not provide clues about the central bank’s timeline and speed of monetary tightening.
Powell's answers to questions from senators during his confirmation hearing for a second four-year term as the head of the U.S. central bank could be more illuminating.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 95.843.
The index hit its highest in more than 16 months at 96.938 on Nov. 24 when released minutes of a Fed meeting pointed to policymakers turning hawkish, but has since been stuck between that level and 95.544, touched less than a week later.
USD/JPY egged higher to 115.22, after bouncing off a one-week low of 115.04 on Monday, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1344, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7188.
The Fed turned hawkish in December, indicating that inflation was more of an issue than previously suggested and flagged plans to tighten policy faster than expected in response.
But that was before the Omicron variant started its rapid spread, and this week's hearings the first opportunity for Powell to indicate if this outbreak has changed his thinking.
Money markets are priced for an increase by May, with two more by November, with influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) earlier this week announcing it now expects another hike in December, making it four in 2022.
Powell's comments come ahead of Wednesday’s U.S. December consumer inflation release, with headline CPI seen breaking above 7% on a year-on-year basis.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3594, approaching Monday's two-month high of 1.3602, helped by the British Retail Consortium reporting that U.K. real sales grew 4.6% last month compared with December 2019, suggesting the country may be weathering the Omicron variant better than the previous iterations of the virus.
Elsewhere, USD/RON fell 0.1% to 4.3577, the day after Romania’s central bank lifted interest rates, but only by 25 basis points to 2.0%, instead of the 50 basis points that had been widely expected.
“We believe that failing to credibly anchor expectations now could lead to inflation staying persistently above the target range until 2024,” said analysts at ING, in a note."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia but remained near the middle of its recent range. Investors now await U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s Senate Banking Committee hearing later in the day for fresh clues on the timetable and speed of policy normalization.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 95.875 by 10:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 115.34.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.31% to 0.7190, with data showing that Australian retail sales grew a better-than-expected 7.3% month-on-month and the trade balance was AUD9.423 billion in November.
The NZD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.6769.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to 6.3722 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3591.
In his opening remarks for the hearing released on Monday, Powell pledged to prevent high inflation from becoming ""entrenched,"" but did not provide clues about the central bank’s timeline and speed of monetary tightening.
Powell is bidding for a second four-year term at the Fed’s helm and will take questions from senators during his hearing. The hearing for Fed vice-chair nominee Lael Brainard will take place on Thursday.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will also speak later in the day, the first from a group of Fed officials speaking throughout the week.
It seems that the Fed was of the mindset of ""sooner rather than later"" for both higher rates and running off its balance sheet after ending bond-buying stimulus, TD Securities strategists said in a note.
""An affirmation of March 2022 tightening and early quantitative tightening should support dollar firmness overall, though within well-established ranges,” the note added. Although the TD Securities analysts expect the first hike in June 2022, a hike as early as March is also possible.
Money markets are priced for an interest rate hike by May 2022, with an additional two by November.
Investors now await U.S. data, with the consumer price index and the Fed Beige Book due on Wednesday, followed by the producer price index a day later. China will also release its own consumer and producer price indexes on Wednesday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies on Monday as recent employment data prompted some Wall Street banks to raise their estimates for how quickly the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was up 0.2% at 95.993. The index remains close to the 16-month high it touched late in November.
The dollar was supported by Friday's closely watched employment report which suggested the U.S. job market was at or near maximum employment.
""A number of sell-side firms have revised their Fed forecasts after the NFP (nonfarm payroll) report on Friday,"" Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note.
""With the unemployment rate below 4%, the Fed could probably declare their job on employment 'completed' which does indeed set us up for an even faster period of taper potentially,"" Bechtel said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year and begin the process of reducing the size of its balance sheet as soon as July. The investment bank, which earlier predicted the Fed would raise rates in March, June and September, now expects another hike in December.
On Friday, J.P. Morgan and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) also forecast an aggressive tightening of U.S. monetary policy. Traders have priced in an 80% chance of a rate hike in March, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
Rising Treasury yields - the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level in almost two years on Monday - also supported the greenback.
Traders have ramped up bets for rate hikes this year after the U.S. central bank's minutes from the December meeting suggested an earlier-than-expected rate hike and the possibility the Fed may cut its bond holdings sooner than many initially thought.
Investors will be watching inflation data and testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard this week for clues to the timing and speed of rate hikes.
U.S. December consumer inflation data is due to be released on Wednesday, with headline CPI seen coming in at a red-hot 7% on a year-on-year basis, boosting the case for interest rates to rise sooner rather than later.
Sterling on Monday fell 0.11% against the dollar, even as easing fears about the adverse impact of the Omicron variant on the economy helped it rise to a near-two-year high against the euro..
Cryptocurrencies, which have faced pressure from broad selling in risk assets at the start of this year, weakened on Monday, with bitcoin down 1.3% at $41,346.71.

Analysts said the currency has strengthened since mid-December as UK government resistance to further COVID-19 restrictions provided a much-needed boost to sentiment.
Britain has focused on rolling out booster vaccinations - which have reached more than 60% of the population - rather than requiring a return to lockdown measures.
Meanwhile, investors have ramped up expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates as early as next month after a surprise hike in December.
""We are looking for a decent November UK GDP release tomorrow of 0.4% month over month, which should keep expectations alive of a further Bank of England rate hike on February 3,"" ING analysts said, recalling that overnight indexed swap (OIS) market prices an 80% chance of a 25 bps hike.
A preliminary estimate of UK gross domestic product for November is due on Tuesday. 
Sterling dropped 0.4% versus the dollar to $1.3542 by 1528 GMT, after briefly touching its highest level since November 2021 at $1.3602.
It was 0.1% higher at 83.48 pence per euro, after hitting its highest since February 2020 at 83.32.
But analyst views are mixed on the medium-term outlook.
""We remain negative on sterling. The UK economy is lagging the rest of the world, and activity is still one percent below pre-Covid levels,"" Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management said.
""We don't expect three or four more hikes in 2022, which is what the market is currently discounting,"" he added.
The pound entered 2022 ""with a tailwind of cautious optimism; the market will be looking closely at Omicron data, and any immediate indication of Liz Truss’s focus areas, as an indication of the tone taken by the Bank of England in Q1,"" Joe Tuckey, forex analyst at Argentex said.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is Britain's lead negotiator with the European Union over trade to Northern Ireland following the resignation of Brexit minister David Frost.
Truss said ahead of talks with the European Union over post-Brexit trade arrangements that the United Kingdom is ready to take unilateral action to suspend customs checks on goods moving to Northern Ireland.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday, with traders expecting the release of key U.S. inflation data this week to boost the chances of early Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 95.915.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.78, close to last week's five-year high of 116.35, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1332, GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3588, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7195.
The greenback is recovering from Friday’s hit after a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report for December, with attention now firmly switching towards the release of key December inflation data.
“The key for Fed policy now is not the labor market but inflation, and this week's December CPI report is expected to show further acceleration,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
“Even after the employment report, the December Fed Funds contract showed increased wagers of four hikes this year. The probability of a fourth hike is now slightly over 50% compared with a 40% of a third hike after the November jobs report on December 3.”
The consumer price inflation data, on Wednesday, is expected to show headline CPI breaking above 7% year-on-year, approaching a four-decade high, while producer price inflation data the following day is also expected to show a surge higher.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and governor Lael Brainard will also testify before Senate committees this week regarding their nominations as the Fed chair and deputy chair respectively.
Their comments over the potential for the central bank to tighten monetary policy this year will be closely studied, and they are the highlight of a week in which there will be numerous Fed speakers.
Also helping the dollar Monday are the continued tensions between the U.S. and Russia, primarily, over the former Soviet state’s intentions towards Ukraine.
Talks between the two principals begin on Monday in Geneva before moving to Brussels and Vienna, but Russia said on Sunday it would not make concessions under U.S. pressure and warned that the negotiations might end early.
Elsewhere, USD/RON rose 0.3% to 4.3613 with Romania’s central bank expected to lift interest rates later Monday to try and tackle soaring inflation in line with its peers in the region. 
The central bank is seen increasing its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 2.25%, according to six of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The other five predicted a rise to 2%. Poland has already raised interest rates this year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia starting the week strong as investors bet U.S. inflation data and appearances from several U.S. Federal Reserve officials would bolster the case for hiking interest rates.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.19% to 95.905 by 11:22 PM ET (4:22 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.23% to 115.81. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.27% to 0.7198 while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.6775.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to 6.3738, with China’s consumer and producer price indexes due on Wednesday.
The USD/GBP pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3588.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, City Fed President Esther George, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, and New York Fed President John Williams will all speak throughout the week.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and governor Lael Brainard will also separately testify before Senate committees this week regarding their nominations as the Fed chair and deputy chair respectively.
The dollar met with some selling after a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report for December, including non-farm payrolls, squeezed investors out of long dollar positions. Investors now await inflation data, including the consumer price index, later in the week.
""The dollar index is likely to recoup some of its Friday losses this week on Powell's likely hawkish commentary and rising U.S. inflation,"" Scotiabank FX strategist Qi Gao told Reuters.
However, the greenback would probably run out of steam eventually, and the index head towards 94 once money markets fully price in a Fed hike in March 2022, he added.
Across the Atlantic, the pound was also slightly weaker on the dollar. However, it has been rallying over bets that the Bank of England (BOE) will likely hike its rates in step with the Fed.
MUFG analysts reckon investors are too hawkish on their rates expectations for the BOE but believe that the pound will be able to hold its own.
""We still expect two rate hikes by the BOE which should keep EUR/GBP under modest downward pressure, which will result in GBP/USD advancing to around the 1.4000 level,"" they said in an outlook note.
U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine are also on investors’ radars, with talk unlikely to end in a compromise and an armed confrontation likely."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was on track for its biggest daily percentage drop in six weeks on Friday on the heels of the December U.S. jobs report that missed expectations, but it was still seen as strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve's tightening path intact.
The dollar index fell 0.546% at 95.734, and was poised for its biggest drop since Nov. 26, when concerns about the Omicron COVID-19 variant began to rattle markets. Even with Friday's weakness, the dollar was still on track for a slight weekly gain, its first in three weeks.
The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by 199,000 last month, well short of the 400,000 estimate. But analysts noted underlying data in the report appeared sturdier, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.9% against expectations of 4.1% while earnings rose by 0.6%, indicating tightness in the labor market.
The report also increased expectations the Fed will begin to hike interest rates at its March meeting, with futures on the federal funds rate implying a 90% chance of a hike, up from 80% on Wednesday.
""While the headline might have fallen short of the consensus, the consensus doesn't matter much to the Fed. For them, this probably justifies their hawkish tilt,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
""We'll have to see how whether they walk the walk of their hawkish talk, but the odds are rising for a rate hike in March or May and a balance sheet run-off beginning later next year.""
On Wall Street the benchmark S&P 500SPX> was modestly lower, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched 1.80%, its highest since January 2020. 
The euro was up 0.62% to $1.1361 as it strengthened against the greenback in the wake of the payrolls report, after showing little reaction to data showing euro zone inflation rose to 5% in December. 
Euro zone policymakers have said they expect inflation to gradually slow down in 2022 and a rate hike will likely not be needed this year.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.22% versus the greenback at 115.59 per dollar. The yen has taken the brunt of the damage while the greenback has strengthened recently, with the dollar hitting a five-year high versus the yen earlier this week. 
Sterling was poised for its third straight weekly gain against the dollar and was last trading at $1.3592, up 0.47% on the day, even after data showed growth in Britain's construction sector cooled in December as the Omicron variant of coronavirus spread, nearly matching a two-month high reached on Wednesday. 

Despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, investors have increasingly viewed it as unlikely to derail the global economy or more aggressive actions by central banks. 
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last fell 2.96% to $41,822.60 after hitting a low of $40,600, its lowest since Sept. 22. Ethereum last fell 6.27% to $3,194.51, on track for a third straight daily decline, after touching its lowest level since Oct 1.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is expected to strengthen over the coming year as global economic recovery continues from the COVID-19 crisis but gains for the currency could be kept in check by Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, a Reuters poll showed.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll was for the Canadian dollar to strengthen 1% to 1.26 per U.S. dollar, or 79.37 U.S. cents in three months, compared to 1.25 in last month's forecast.
It was then expected to climb to 1.2350 in a year's time.
""Our expectation of Canadian dollar strength over the 12-month horizon is based upon our expectation of improved global growth conditions,"" said Simon Harvey, Head of FX analysis for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.
Growth will pick up after the first quarter of the year ""as variant risk subsides,"" Harvey added.
Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the outlook for the global economy. Oil has rallied 27% since December.
Canadian provinces have announced in recent days restrictions to curb the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, mirroring moves in some other countries. 
Still, investors remain generally calm about the global economic impact of the variant after studies suggested the risk of hospitalization is lower.
Also supportive of the loonie, the Bank of Canada https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/despite-omicron-bank-canada-likely-signal-earlier-rate-hikes-possible-2021-12-17 is likely to change its interest rate guidance this month so that it has the option to raise borrowing costs earlier than planned.
Money markets expect Canada's central bank to hike five times in 2022 and that the policy rate will peak over the coming years at 2%, the so-called terminal rate. 
That exceeds the 1.6% endpoint seen for the U.S. Federal Reserve but those expectations could shift.
""We still think the terminal rate in the U.S. is going to be higher,"" said Bipan Rai, North America head, FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
""Once we get more hikes priced in further out (the money market curve) for the Fed, that should translate into U.S. dollar strength.""

The Canadian dollar was the only G10 currency to gain ground against the greenback in 2021, rising 0.8%.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's real will stay backed up by a surprisingly good fiscal performance into the southern hemisphere summer lull as the campaign for October's presidential election begins to gather pace, a Reuters poll showed.
It oscillated around 5.60 per U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter and is expected to keep doing so, with subdued market action during the summer holiday season softening the hit of the greenback's rise following the latest hawkish Federal Reserve minutes..
According to the median estimate of 21 foreign exchange strategists polled Jan. 4-5, the real is set to strengthen 1.4% to 5.62 per dollar by end-March from 5.70 on Thursday, so long as Brazil's fiscal problems remain under control.
The country's public accounts swung to a small primary surplus in the 12 months through November, thanks to stronger-than-expected tax revenues and slower expenditures resulting from strict spending rules.
But investors worry the improvement may be only temporary after President Jair Bolsonaro's administration tweaked the fiscal framework last year to gain budget leeway for social programs before the vote.
Bolsonaro is trailing in election polls behind former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has said he would seek to build a broad range of alliances in a bid to unite a divided country.
""Having been on a positive trajectory since 2016 and into the pandemic, it looks as though Brazil's post-pandemic policy mix could be heading in the wrong direction,"" said Padhraic Garvey, ING regional head of research, Americas.
""This can be categorised as a pre-election government looking to find loopholes in the constitutional spending cap and deteriorating fiscal risk premia forcing the central bank into even more aggressive rate hikes"".
Brazil's central bank is leading the most aggressive policy tightening drive in the world. It raised the key interest rate to 9.25% from 2.0% in 2021 and is maintaining an orthodox view this year to fight persistently high inflation.
The real was forecast at 5.70 per dollar in 12 months, virtually flat compared to its value on Thursday at 5.70 and more solid than an expected 3.7% depreciation of the Mexican peso in the same period, to 21.3507 per dollar.

The weaker outlook for Mexico's currency rests on perceptions its central bank's rate hike cycle is still too moderate when measured up against other countries like Brazil, despite a larger than expected https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/mexican-central-bank-hikes-rates-more-than-expected-tame-inflation-2021-12-16 move last month.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, but remains largely in favor ahead of the release of the monthly official U.S. employment report which could reinforce the case for early Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 96.227, but is on course to record broad weekly gains.
Although the dollar is marginally lower Friday, firming expectations that the U.S. central bank could raise rates fairly promptly this year, particularly after the hawkish minutes from the December Fed meeting, are pushing up U.S. yields and the currency.
“The FOMC could begin increasing the policy rate as early as the March meeting in order to be in a better position to control inflation,” said Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard on Thursday. “Subsequent rate increases during 2022 could be pulled forward or pushed back depending on inflation developments.”
Fed Funds futures have priced in a roughly 80% chance of a Fed hike of 25 basis points by its March meeting.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 115.97, with the yen the most prominent casualty of the firmer dollar, hitting a five-year peak at 116.35 earlier this week, with the Bank of Japan seen as very far off raising interest rates.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1305, with another surprisingly weak print for German and French industrial output capping gains, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3540, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.1% to 0.7157.
This main focus of the day will be the release of U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which are expected to have risen by 400,000 in December, almost doubling November’s disappointing 210,000 rise, with the unemployment rate seen falling to 4.1% from 4.2%. 
However, Wednesday’s private payrolls report, which is often used as a guide to the government’s, showed companies added 807,000 jobs last month, more than twice the number expected. Other items such as wage growth will also be parsed for their implications for inflation.
“In order for the U.S. dollar to sustain its gains, the jobs report will need to be so good that it fuels expectations for an accelerated Q1 rate hike and/or four rate hikes this year,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management. “That would require job growth to exceed 650,000, the unemployment rate to fall further and average hourly earnings growth to accelerate.”

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stressed on Friday the need for currency stability and said he was watching market moves ""carefully,"" in the wake of the yen's recent declines against the dollar.
Domestic media and some market participants have warned of the potential demerits of a weak yen, which pushes up import prices and households' cost of living at a time when the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I won't comment on the currency market itself, but stability is important above all,"" Suzuki told reporters.
""From that standpoint, we'll closely watch currency market moves and their impact on the Japanese economy,"" he said, when asked if the weakening yen was negative for the economy.
Suzuki's remarks came as the dollar hovered near a five-year high at 116.355 yen hit on Tuesday, after strengthening on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will embark on steady interest rate hikes while the Bank of Japan keeps rates ultra-low.
Japanese policymakers have traditionally favoured a weak yen as it gives exporters a competitive advantage.
But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last month the boost to export volume from a weak yen may have declined compared with the past as more Japanese companies have shifted production abroad.
Kuroda also said the hit to households from a weak yen may have become bigger due to Japan's increasing reliance on raw material imports, offering the most direct acknowledgement yet of the potential disadvantages of a weaker yen.
With wholesale inflation already hitting a record high and driving up the cost of living, further yen declines could become politically painful for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ahead of an upper house election looming in the summer.
Data released on Friday showed household spending fell for the fourth straight month and inflation-adjusted real wages slumped 1.6% in November from a year earlier.
J.P. Morgan analysts say the yen's real effective rate, which tumbled to its lowest level in 50 years, is set to fall further and slash consumers' spending power.
But Japanese policymakers see little room to intervene in the currency market to arrest the yen's decline, with some conceding there is good reason for it to soften given Japan's weak economy, waning competitiveness and dire public finances.

""In a way, a weak yen reflects Japan's fundamentals,"" one ministry said on condition of anonymity, though adding that Tokyo was ready to step in if yen declines become too sharp.
Japan has stayed away from intervening in the currency market since 2011 when devastating earthquakes and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear crisis triggered a spike in the safe-haven yen.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia but set for a fifth consecutive weekly gain on the Japanese yen. This rally could be extended if the latest U.S. jobs report justifies early Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.10% to 96.230 by 10:49 PM ET (3:49 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.05% to 115.88. Japanese data released earlier in the day showed that household spending contracted 1.3% and 1.2% year-on-year and month-on-month in November, while the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.5% year-on-year in December.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 0.7169 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.6755.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.3765. The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 1.3548, over investor expectations that the Bank of England will also soon begin hiking interest rates.
The dollar hit a five-year high against the yen at 116.35 on Tuesday but has since fallen back somewhat. The U.S. currently is up about 0.7% on the yen this week and about 2.7% over five weeks, over expectations that the Fed will start hiking interest rates several times in 2022, beginning in March that drove a bond market selloff and a rise in yields.
The yen is the most prominent loser among major currencies, with investors betting that the Bank of Japan will lag its peers in hiking interest rates. The dollar, meanwhile, is set for its best week in more than a month against its Australian and New Zealand counterparts.
Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday that the Fed could also start reducing its balance sheet soon after it begins hiking interest rates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly added that the balance sheet reduction would follow normalizing rates.
Investors now await the U.S. job report due later in the day and particularly the non-farm payrolls figure.
""If it is a very strong number the Fed has more fuel to maintain the hawkish rhetoric, which further supports the March hike probability,"" NatWest analysts said in a note, which added the downside is probably limited."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Most currencies will struggle to make any gains against the U.S. dollar in coming months, as monetary tightening expected from the Federal Reserve will provide the greenback with enough impetus to extend its dominance well into 2022, analysts said.
Nearly two-thirds of 49 foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters between Jan. 4-6 said interest rate differentials would dictate sentiment in major FX markets in the near term, with only two concerned about new coronavirus variants.
The vast majority of analysts polled said volatility in FX markets would increase over the coming three months, with well above 80% saying so for both majors and EM currencies.
In the meantime the Fed, now expected by traders to raise interest rates in March and begin reducing its asset holdings soon afterward, will provide the dollar with an edge over other major currencies.
Financial markets are now pricing in at least three U.S. rate hikes this year.
""There's been a lot of U.S. dollar strength of late, mainly driven by the widening interest rate differentials and inflation dynamics in the U.S. relative to other major markets like Japan and Europe,"" said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.
""The fact the Fed is becoming much more hawkish and reacting to that by tapering much sooner than forecast a few months ago ... (and soon) start raising rates should support the dollar over the first part of the year,"" he said. (Graphic: Reuters Poll: Outlook for major currencies, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/znpnelkxrvl/Reuters%20poll%20-%20%20Outlook%20for%20major%20currencies.PNG)
Median forecasts lined up with that view as analysts do not expect most major and emerging currencies to make any significant headway against the greenback during that period.
While the dollar's dominance is nearly universal, as in previous Fed tightening cycles, emerging market currencies are likely to feel it the most.
""The macro backdrop looks challenging for emerging market assets,"" said Kamakshya Trivedi, co-head of global FX, rates and EM strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""Growth is slowing from peak rates as the reopening boost fades across the world, monetary policy tightening is under way, China has shifted to a lower gear of growth, and some all-too-familiar old-school EM issues like inflation, fiscal overreach and political instability are back on the table."" (Graphic: Reuters Poll: Major currency market outlook, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/zgpomakawpd/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20Major%20currency%20market%20outlook.png)
Among the emerging currencies polled on, the tightly-controlled Chinese yuan was predicted to depreciate nearly 2% to 6.5 per dollar in a year. The Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and Indian rupee were also expected to weaken about 1% or at best cling to a range.
Turkey's battered lira was forecast to drop another 14% this year after plunging 44% in 2021, its worst year since President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party came to power in 2002 and making it by far the worst performer in emerging markets.
South Africa's rand, another high-yielder but among the worst-performing emerging market currencies in 2021, is set to remain rangebound in the next six months but fall 0.4% to 15.78/$ in a year.
Most major currencies were also not expected to recoup their 2021 losses over the next 12 months.
The euro, which lost nearly 7% last year was forecast to gain a little under 1.5% by end 2022. Among major safe-haven currencies, the Japanese yen was expected to trade around current levels and the Swiss franc to drop around 3% in a year.

While the general direction of travel seems to be for the dollar to strengthen across the board as there is more clarity on Fed policy, analysts say plenty of risks remain.
""Given the uncertainty around how economies will evolve and how policymakers will respond, we are more confident in our view that currency volatility will be relatively high,"" said Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up on Thursday after a flurry of economic data, including weekly labor market numbers, in a more muted move a day after a spike higher following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting.
The dollar sharply pared losses of as much as 0.44% late Wednesday after the minutes showed Fed policymakers were concerned about rising inflation, which along with a tight labor market, could result in the Fed's raising rates sooner than anticipated along with a reduction in its asset holdings.
Traders are currently anticipating a greater than 70% chance for a rate hike of at least 25 basis points at the March Fed meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
""The market is paying attention more to monetary policy and that discrepancy, and that is really what is driving the dollar,"" said John Kicklighter, analyst at DailyFX.com in Chicago. ""If you are already pricing in, probably, the most aggressive, hawkish view that you are going to get, then how much further is the dollar going to go?"" 
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday the Fed could raise rates as soon as March and is in a ""good position"" to be even more aggressive against inflation, as needed.
U.S. labor market data showed weekly initial jobless claims rose by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 207,000, slightly above the 197,000 forecast. The data comes after a very strong private payrolls report on Wednesday in the ADP National Employment report and ahead of Friday's December payrolls report, which could bolster expectations the Fed will become more aggressive in hiking rates.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the central bank should raise interest rates this year, given the ""very strong"" labor market and high inflation acting as a ""repressive tax"" that acts as burden, particularly on the poor.
Other data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened sharply in November to $80.2 billion, indicating a possible weight on fourth-quarter economic growth.
The dollar index rose 0.071% at 96.253. 
Analysts view 96.40 for the dollar index as a technical resistance point, with a break above likely to result in a test of the December high of 96.91. 
Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC in New York, anticipated the appreciation in the dollar index will continue into early 2022 toward the 98 level, with an ""overshoot"" to 100 possible. 
A report from the Institute for Supply Management showed activity in the U.S. services sector slowed more than expected in December, likely due to a rise in COVID-19 infections. However, investors have viewed the new Omicron variant as unlikely to severely crimp economic activity.
The euro was down 0.17% to $1.1294 as annual inflation in Germany slowed in December for the first time in six months but remained well above the European Central Bank's 2% target, according to preliminary data on Thursday.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.26% versus the greenback at 115.82 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3532, down 0.16% on the day. Sterling reached a two-month high of 1.3598 on Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a five-year high to the yen on Thursday, supported by a surge in U.S. Treasury yields on rising bets for a Federal Reserve rate hike by March.
The greenback stood at 116.115 yen, little changed from Wednesday, when it rallied back toward Tuesday's high of 116.355, lifted by more hawkish rhetoric from Fed official and a strong U.S. jobs report.
Anticipation of faster policy tightening dented riskier assets, with the British pound retreating from a near two-month high and cryptocurrencies tumbling toward multi-month lows.
Fed officials said the ""very tight"" U.S. labour market might warrant raising rates sooner, and indicated they could also reduce the central bank's overall asset holdings to tame high inflation - a process dubbed quantitative tightening (QT) -minutes of their Dec. 14-15 policy meeting showed.
In the wake of that, futures on the federal funds rate priced in a roughly 80% chance of a quarter-percentage-point Fed hike by its March meeting.
Earlier in the day, the ADP National Employment report showed private U.S. payrolls surged last month by more than double what economists polled by Reuters had forecast, potentially raising expectations for the non-farm payrolls numbers due Friday.
""With odds for a rate hike in March rising and the threat of QT this year, the USD should maintain resilient form,"" TD Securities strategists wrote in a report.
""That should leave USDJPY supported over time, though we think a very hawkish Fed could cause some short-term indigestion for risk markets.""
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against the yen and five other major peers, was about flat at 96.209 from Wednesday, when it rebounded from intraday losses as steep as 0.44% following release of the minutes.
Five-year Treasury yields, which are keenly sensitive to interest rate expectations, climbed to an almost two-year high.
Despite an ever-more-hawkish Fed over recent months, which signalled three quarter-point rate increases for this year at its December policy meeting, gains for the dollar index have stagnated since hitting a 16-month high at 96.938 in late November.
""Trend and momentum dynamics continue to favour the USD, but prices will have to pierce the Q4 2021 highs in order to reassert the uptrends in most cases,"" George Davis, a strategist at RBC, wrote in a report, pointing to euro, sterling and the Australian dollar in particular. 
The euro stood at $1.1310 as it continued to consolidate in the middle of its trading range since mid-November. It dipped as low as $1.1186 on Nov. 24 for the first time since July 2020.
Sterling traded at $1.3550, after retreating overnight from a nearly two-month high of $1.3599 following the Fed minutes.
The Aussie slipped to $0.7215, down from an intraday high of $0.7273 on Wednesday.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin stabilized at around $43,600 after dipping to a one-month low of $42.413.59 in the previous session.
Ether recovered some composure to trade around $3,500, after slumping to $3,410.22 overnight for the first time since mid-October.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen's real effective rate has tumbled to its lowest level in 50 years and the currency is set to fall even further, slashing Japanese consumers' spending power and raising the risk of capital flight, J.P. Morgan analysts said.
The yen was weakest of G10 currencies last year and its underperformance has continued into 2022 with the nominal exchange rate against the dollar tumbling to a five-year low of 116.3550 this week. It is also near two-month lows to the euro and sterling.
The yen's real effective rate, referenced to consumer price inflation, fell to a low of 66.3 on Tuesday compared to a base of 100 in 2010, which according to J.P. Morgan calculations is likely its lowest since June 1972. The rate measures the weighted average of domestic prices relative to those of Japan's trading partners.
Analysts Tohru Sasaki, Benjamin Shatil and Sosuke Nakamura noted a strong inverse correlation between U.S. long-term interest rates and the yen. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was at a nine-month high of 1.7192% on Thursday and J.P. Morgan predicts that the 10-year yield could reach 2% by end-June. If the current correlation holds, the yen could drop past 119 per dollar then, it said.

With companies from sauce manufacturers to stationery makers announcing price hikes in recent months, ""the risk of an unexpectedly large rise in Japan's inflation rate cannot be ruled out,"" they wrote.
Considering that Japanese salaries are no longer high relative to other developed nations, fears that imported goods will become unaffordable may prompt Japanese households to invest offshore - easier than ever before due to online services, they said, which would lead to further yen weakness.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher in early European trade Thursday, boosted by rising Treasury yields after the minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting raised expectations of an early interest rate hike and also put the issue of reversing the bank's bond purchases in play.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 96.392, remaining close to Tuesday’s one-week high.
“The minutes revealed that committee members felt inflation risks were more persistent and to the upside, and there was general agreement that the taper should be accelerated with three tentative rate hikes penciled in,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA, in a note.
While this was largely what was said by Chairman Jerome Powell after the meeting in December, five-year U.S. Treasury yields, which are keenly sensitive to interest rate expectations, climbed to their highest in nearly two years. That was also due to the minutes showing that some policymakers were pressing for the Fed to start selling back into the market some of the bonds it has bought over the last two years.
Additionally, Fed Funds futures have priced in a roughly 80% chance of a quarter-percentage-point Fed hike by its March meeting.
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 115.93, remaining near a five-year high of 116.35, while EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1290. GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.3518, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD slumped 0.8% to 0.7160.
The Fed minutes mentioned an extremely tight labor market as a point of concern, and ADP data released Wednesday showed an increase in private payrolls of over 800,000 in December, more than double the expected number.
Weekly jobless claims data are due later Thursday, ahead of Friday’s key nonfarm payrolls report.
“We suspect March is too early for a rate hike given the lack of visibility caused by Omicron, but May is clearly on the cards,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.3% to 6.3749, despite China’s services sector growing more quickly in December, with the Caixin services purchasing managers’ index rising to 53.1 from 52.1 in November. 
USD/TRY rose 0.8% to 13.7879, with Turkey set to release its latest data for foreign exchange reserves later in the session. The country’s central bank recently unveiled a plan to compensate lira holders for any currency losses, in order to stop sharp selling of its currency as it cut interest rates. However, it has also been intervening heavily in the foreign exchange markets as well.
“By my reckoning, the lira has already given back around 35% of its engineered gains in the past week or so, if reserves show a big drop this evening, the Turkish lira vigilantes will be back out in force,” added Halley.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, remaining near a five-year high to the yen as investors digested the hawkish tone in the minutes from the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 96.188 by 11:05 PM ET (4:04 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.20% to 115.87.

the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 1.3535.
The dollar was little changed against the yen, from Wednesday, when it rallied back toward Tuesday's high of 116.355.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday but pared losses after minutes released from the Federal Reserve's December meeting showed the U.S. central bank may need to act more quickly in hiking interest rates to combat inflation.
Fed officials said the ""very tight"" U.S. labor market might warrant raising rates sooner than expected as well as reducing the bank's overall asset holdings to tame high inflation, minutes of their Dec. 14-15 policy meeting showed. 
The greenback weakened after a nearly 0.7% gain in the year's first two sessions and a more than 2% increase since the end of October. It extended its decline earlier in the session following a much stronger-than-expected ADP National Employment Report.
Analysts cited the 96.40 mark in the dollar index as a technical level of resistance contributing to the currency's softness on the day.
""The minutes almost never change anything. They may have reinforced a little bit the Fed's intent on raising rates, but not very much,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com in New York.
The dollar had risen more than 2% since the end of October before Wednesday's decline, as expectations have grown the Fed will begin to hike interest rates this year. Expectations for at least a 25 basis point hike are over 60%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. 
""It is going in the right direction, it is going where it should be going, so even if the dollar was off a little bit today I just don't see how you are going to get away from the Fed’s intention."" 
Following the release of the minutes, futures on the federal funds rate were pricing in about an 80% chance of a quarter-percentage point hike by the central bank at its March meeting. 
The dollar index fell 0.164%, after dropping as much as 0.44% on the session, with the euro up 0.23% at $1.1311.
Despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, investors have increasingly viewed it as unlikely to derail the global economy or more aggressive actions by central banks, with studies indicating lower hospitalization rates. On Monday, the United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.07% versus the greenback at 116.06 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3559, up 0.20% on the day. 
Sterling hit a fresh 2-month high versus the greenback at 1.3598 per dollar, its highest since Nov. 9, on growing expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates as soon as next month.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower overall in early European trade Wednesday, handing back some overnight gains on rising Treasury yields with traders looking to the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting for clues on the timing of its expected tightening. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 96.210, remaining close to its one-week high reached Tuesday.
“A break of 95.50 or 96.50 will signal the index’s next directional move, although if U.S. yields stay firm, the greenback looks set to continue to outperform in the major currency space,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA.
U.S. yields eased back slightly Wednesday after sharp gains to pre pandemic levels on Tuesday as investors geared up for early interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to curb high inflation.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.94, after climbing to a five-year high of 116.35 on Tuesday, with the Bank of Japan seen as being one of the last of the major central banks to sanction policy tightening.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1300, just above a two-week low, GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3535, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged lower to 0.7236.
The U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its December meeting later in the day, and will be studied for clues to the central bank’s timetable for rate hikes.
Fed Funds futures suggest interest rates will start rising by May, but expectations are growing that the central bank could move sooner than that, given the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
The Fed is on track to end its asset-buying program in March, potentially  opening the way for raising rates, after it on Dec. 15 doubled the pace of tapering purchases. 
Also due for release Wednesday will be the ADP employment data, a closely watched precursor to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls.
USD/PLN edged lower to 4.0398 after Poland’s central bank lifted its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points on Tuesday, matching December’s hike, as it sought to combat soaring inflation.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia. The yen fell to a near five-year low against the U.S. currency and saw losses on other crosses over investors bets that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) would fall behind its counterparts in tightening monetary policy to curb high inflation.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 96.240 by 10:17 PM ET (3:17 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.18% to 115.93.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7229 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.6798.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3723 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3529.
The yen hit the five-year low of 116.35 on Tuesday, as well as dropping through its 200-day moving average to a two-month low of 131.45 per euro. It was trading at around 131.06 per euro earlier in the session while falling to a more than six-year low against the Swiss franc and a seven-week low against the Australian dollar.
""Sharply higher COVID-19 case numbers in the U.S., and a little higher in China, appear to be primarily boosting supply-chain concerns and fears of higher inflation in the U.S., rather than boosting growth concerns,"" Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst told Reuters.
This led to a sharp jump in U.S. Treasury yields in the first trading days of 2022, with the widened gap on Japanese yields also hurting the yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its December meeting later in the day, which will be scrutinized for clues for the central bank’s rate hikes timetable.
Investors also await the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls and due on Friday, for further clues. But with Fed Funds futures showing that investors are betting on an interest rate hike by May 2022,  Standard Chartered analysts now expect 25-basis point hikes in March and June rather than one hike in September.
""Despite the explosive rally in the USD/JPY pair, I still can't get excited about the idea of a stronger dollar right now,"" Spectra Markets president Brent Donnelly told Reuters.
""The rates move certainly has grabbed everyone's attention but it's hard to know how much to read into a move on the first trading day of the year. The big question remains: Can the Fed hike more than a few times without breaking everything?"""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose for a fifth straight day against the Japanese yen on Tuesday, hitting a five-year high as investors viewed the Omicron variant as not likely to derail the global economy or delay the Federal Reserve's expected rate hikes.
A rise in U.S. Treasury yields on expectations for a Fed rate hike this year have supported the greenback, with those foreseeing at least a 25-basis-point hike at the March meeting of the central bank's policy-setting committee topping 60%, the CME FedWatch Tool found. 
Yields on U.S. 5-year notes, which are sensitive to rate hike expectations, reached the highest level since February 2020. Yields on U.S. 2-year notes, which also reflect the market's view on interest rates, edged lower after touching a 22-month high on Monday. 
The dollar index rose 0.06%, with the euro down 0.05% to $1.1288.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.65% versus the greenback at 116.08 per dollar, after the dollar reached a high of 116.34 against the yen, its highest level since Jan. 11, 2017. 
""Absolutely, dollar/yen on a tear, it is all yield-driven, 2022 is here and the market is just bracing for higher rates from the Fed, so that has been the key catalyst pushing dollar/yen higher,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington. 
""The main thing here, certainly Omicron is very unpredictable, but the market’s take so far is that it doesn’t look like it is going to deal a significant blow to the recovery, so that just increases the spotlight on central banks and how they are likely to push interest rates higher."" 
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari, known as a dove, said he expects the U.S. central bank to need to raise interest rates two times this year to address persistently high inflation, reversing his long-held view that rates will need to stay at zero until at least 2024.
On Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of a third dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15, and narrowed the interval for booster shot eligibility to five months from six.
Investors have come to view Omicron as potentially less disruptive to the global economy than previous variants of the coronavirus, as studies have indicated the risk of hospitalization is lower.
Sterling was last trading at $1.3531, up 0.45% on the day, after hitting a two-month high of $1.3557 against the greenback and a near two-year high against the euro, buoyed by expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month. 
The dollar index briefly pared gains after economic data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month, below the 60.0 estimate. That was the lowest since last January and followed a 61.1 reading in November. 

Other data showed a record 4.5 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in November, which will likely pressure businesses to increase wages in order to attract workers.

378,"<span>Jan 04, 2022 06:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound has returned from the holiday season reinvigorated against the euro as bets on a widening monetary policy chasm lift the U.K. currency. 
Sterling rallied on Tuesday to 83.62 pence per euro, the strongest since February 2020, buoyed in recent weeks by hopes that omicron won’t derail the U.K. economy. Money markets are bringing forward bets on Bank of England tightening, wagering that a 25-basis-point rate increase in February is nearly a done deal. That’s a sharp contrast with wagers for the European Central Bank, which isn’t priced to raise borrowing costs by 10 basis points until later this year.  
“The pound has been one of the main beneficiaries from the ongoing improvement in global investor risk sentiment over the holiday period,” said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG. “At the same time, the stronger pound has been encouraged by the BOE’s hawkish decision to follow through and start raising rates last month despite the heightened omicron uncertainty.”
A pullback in bearish bets on sterling is giving the rally legs. Asset managers cut shorts on the pound in the second half of December, having turned the most bearish on the currency since 2019 earlier in the month, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
The pound’s advance against the euro is sharpening the focus on 82.77 pence, its peak in 2019. Expiries over the next month show few option-related bids beyond 83 pence, according to Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. data, suggesting traders may be under-positioned for further strength in sterling.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher in early European trade Tuesday, making particular gains against the yen on rising Treasury yields as expectations rise that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates early in 2022 despite rising Covid-19 cases. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 96.310, close to the one-week high of 96.338 reached earlier Tuesday.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 115.72, not far removed from its strongest level in nearly five years, boosted by a jump in Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield climbing to 1.64% for the first time since Nov. 24.
Money markets have fully priced in a first U.S. rate increase by May, and two more by the end of 2022.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1285, close to a one-week low, despite German retail sales rebounding in November. GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3466, falling back toward the overnight trough of 1.3431, a level not seen since Nov. 29, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7208, just above its near two-week low hit overnight.
The number in coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant has continued to rise, with the U.S. recording a global daily record of over one million cases. While this is affecting global travel and some public services, investors remain optimistic that the economic impact will be limited, allowing the recovery to continue and the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates a number of times in 2022.
“Although equities rallied on diminishing Omicron fears, that same situation has allowed U.S. yields to rise sharply, lifting the U.S. dollar,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA. “The U.S. dollar rally could peter out if sentiment remains strong, but the moves in equities and currencies highlight what a messy year could be ahead, without the unifying theme of the post-vaccine recovery central bank back-stop in play.”
Investors will focus on the release of the ISM manufacturing PMI for December as well as the November JOLTs job openings later Tuesday as the latest gauges of the strength of the U.S. economy.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.4% to 6.3748 despite China's factory activity growing at its fastest pace in six months in December, with the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rising to 50.9, its highest level since June.
USD/PLN rose 0.2% to 4.0581, with Poland’s central bank expected to announce the world’s first interest-rate hike this year later Tuesday, with the country’s inflation soaring.
Polish Governor Adam Glapinski said last week inflation would peak at above 8% in June, and the central bank is expected to hike the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 2.25% on Tuesday, according to 15 of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The other two expect a 75 basis-point rise.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia but climbed to its strongest level in more than a month against the Japanese yen. A jump in U.S. Treasury yields overnight as investors bet on an early U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike also gave the U.S. currency a small boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 96.180 by 8:52 PM ET (1:52 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 115.43.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 0.7200, with the Australian dollar near the near two-week low of $0.7184 hit during the previous session. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.6789.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.32% to 6.3727. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index for December was a better-than-expected 50.9.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 1.3481. The pound was flat from Monday, when it fell as low as $1.3431 for the first time since Nov. 29.
The Japanese, Chinese and Australian markets all re-opened after a holiday.
The dollar rose as high as 115.395 yen for the first time since Nov. 25, boosted by long-term U.S. Treasury yields soaring 12.5 basis points overnight to hit 1.6420% for the first time since Nov. 24.
Investors also continue to bet that the Fed will hike interest rates in 2022, with money markets fully pricing in a first hike by May and two more by the end of 2022.
""The market is pricing in a more aggressive U.S. rate hike scenario, or at least the risk thereof, in 2022, and that definitely remains the key support for the dollar,"" Barclays senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
The number of global COVID-19 cases also continues to surge, thanks to the omicron variant. Global travel and public services continue to be delayed, with the surge also likely to delay the reopening of more U.S. schools after the holidays. Thousands of schools have already delayed openings, with New York City hitting a 33% positivity rate.
However, investors remained hopeful that lockdowns could be avoided. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized a third dose of the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/ BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine for children aged between 12 and 15 years. The regulator also shortened the time for all booster shots to five months from six months after primary doses."

NEW YORK(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday, the first trading day of the new year, in sync with government bond yields as investors anticipate the Federal Reserve will stay on its path of interest rate hikes in 2022. 
While the surge in coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant continued to impact global travel and public services, investors remained optimistic that lockdowns would be averted. 
On Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of a third dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged between 12 and 15 years, and narrowed the time for all booster shots to five months from six months after primary doses. 
Yields on U.S. two-year notes, which are sensitive to rate hike expectations, along with 5-year notes, soared to their highest level since March 2020. Benchmark U.S. 10-year and 5-year yields rose to six-week peaks. The U.S. central bank is seen as likely to begin hiking interest rates by mid-2022. 
""Markets in general have a short attention span when it comes to anything COVID related and it has been this way since the very beginning,"" said Erik Bregar, president and CEO at Bregar Capital Corp in Toronto. 
""I don’t feel a risk-off vibe today because oil is steady, stocks are still green... right now yields are the driver.""

The Japanese yen weakened 0.17% versus the greenback at 115.27 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3482, down 0.35% on the day. 
Trading volumes, however, were expected to be thin as London, Europe's main FX trading center, is closed for a market holiday. 
In the broader euro zone, manufacturing activity remained resilient as factories took advantage of an easing in supply chain constraints and stocked up on raw materials at a record pace. 
Turkey's annual inflation rate surged to 36.1% last month, its highest in the 19 years Tayyip Erdogan has ruled, laying bare the extent of a currency crisis caused by the president's unorthodox interest rate-cutting policies.

The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3561 and the GBP/USD pair was down 0.21% to 1.3501.
The Japanese, Chinese, Australian, and New Zealand markets were all closed for a holiday, and the thin trade could make it more difficult to see the dollar’s real moves.
The global spread of the omicron COVID-19 variant also continues to impact on sentiment. Although the number of cases in the western Chinese city of Xi’an edged down, Johns Hopkins University data showed that the global number of cases topped 290 million as of Jan. 3.
Meanwhile, China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) Hong Kong shares were suspended from trading earlier in the day, with the property developer declining to provide a reason for the suspension.
However, Chinese property developer Cifi Holdings offered to buy China Evergrande’s outstanding 5.5% bond due in 2022. The offer was $1,000.5 for each $1,000 in principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, according to Cifi Holdings’ statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The offer to buy the $505.1 million of notes that remain outstanding expires at 4pm London time on Jan. 7.

WHO IS HAMDOK?
- Before becoming prime minister, Hamdok worked for the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, the African Development Bank and as a special adviser at the Trade and Development Bank in Ethiopia. He studied economics at the universities of Khartoum and Manchester.
- He was named prime minister in August 2019 by the Sovereign Council, a ruling body of civilians and the army that was set up to oversee a transition towards democracy after long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled. 
- Upon taking office, he said his priorities included solving an economic crisis, addressing a public debt burden, and achieving peace in a country long fractured by civil wars. 
- He quickly started talks with International Monetary Fund and World Bank to discuss restructuring Sudan's debt. 
- He also opened talks with the United States to have Sudan removed from its list of states that sponsor terrorism, a designation that had isolated Sudan from the international financial system since 1993. Sudan was removed from the list in 2020.
- On his watch, the IMF accepted Sudan into the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative based on the country's commitment to macroeconomic reforms. This put Sudan on the path to relief on more than $56 bln in debt and access to new funds.
- The economic reforms he promoted included the removal of fuel subsidies that cost several billion dollars a year, and the devaluation and floating of the currency. He also sought to bring under government control firms owned by the security forces.
- A few weeks before he was removed from office on Oct. 25, he acknowledged the hardship arising from reforms but expressed hope that their positive impact would be felt on the ground very soon. ""The Sudanese people have borne a very high cost of the reforms and we cannot take their patience for granted,"" he said. 
- He is a firm supporter of Sudan's transition to civilian-led rule. As tensions grew between the army and civilians in the power-sharing administration in September, Hamdok presented a roadmap out of crisis https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-pm-hamdok-unveils-roadmap-with-political-players-end-crisis-2021-10-15.
""I am not neutral or a mediator in this conflict. My clear and firm position is complete alignment to the civilian democratic transition,"" he said.

- His stance has won him support among the population. During rallies against the coup, protesters carried photos of Hamdok and hung banners featuring him from billboards.
- After signing a deal to return as prime minister, a move opposed by many protesters and political figures who had previously supported him, Hamdok said he had done so to halt bloodshed after several dozen civilians had been killed during demonstrations.

NEW YORK - The dollar index dipped on Friday in quiet holiday trading, but was set to end 2021 with a gain of nearly 7% as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates earlier than most other major economies amid surging inflation driven by COVID-19 stimulus initiatives.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.289% at 95.729.
(Graphic: world currencies versus the dollar in 2021 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)) 
Set for its best year since 2015, the dollar has been supported by an improving U.S. economy and persistent inflation that led to a hawkish turn by the Fed, which is now expected to begin raising interest rates as early as March. [FEDWATCH]
The best performer of the major currencies against the dollar in 2021 was the Canadian dollar, which was around flat for the year, helped by expectations the Bank of Canada will begin tightening its monetary policy as soon as January. 
The worst performer versus the greenback among the majors was the Japanese yen, which is down around 10% this year. 
The euro, which makes up the biggest weighting in the dollar index, was down a little more than 7% in 2021, with the European Central Bank (ECB) ""sticking to ultra-dovish monetary policy settings while the Fed accelerates its taper and looks to hiking,"" analysts at Scotiabank said in a note to clients.
""We see continued weakening in the shared currency next year to the 1.10 mark and likely beyond as headwinds remain firmly in place, where only the (highly unlikely) chance that the ECB hikes in late-2022/early-2023 possibly providing some support,"" they said. 
The euro was down around 6% on the year versus sterling, as easing concerns in Britain about the economic impact of the pandemic boosted the British currency, with analysts expecting more rate rises from the Bank of England in 2022.
While sterling was at its highest level against the euro since February 2020, it was down a little over 1% against the dollar for the year.
The biggest laggard of the year by far, while not considered a major currency, was the Turkish lira, which was down around 44% against the dollar in its worst year in two decades, battered by soaring inflation and the Turkish government's unorthodox monetary policy.
On Friday, the euro was up 0.33% at $1.1362.
Sterling was up 0.21% at $1.3527. 
The yen was down 0.03% at 115.075 per dollar.

The Turkish lira was up 0.98% at 13.1835 per dollar.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 1.66% at $47,931.97, and was set to end the year with a gain of around 65%, but well off its November peak of $69,000.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, continuing its small upwards moves as 2021 wraps up.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 96.040 by 10:44 PM ET (3:44 AM GMT).

The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.08% to 6.3743. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that December’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.3, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 52.7. Both figures were above the 50-mark indicating growth.
China’s debt-ridden property sector, and some initial coupon payment deadlines for  Kaisa Group  Holdings Ltd.'s (HK:1638) (HK:1638) dollar bonds, in particular, were also in investors’ radars.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3497.
Japanese markets closed for the day. with Australian markets due to have an early end to the day. Volumes were thin in the last trading day of 2021 for some markets, meaning that moves were likely to be more exaggerated.
U.S. data released on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims fell to 198,000 last week, with the job market seemingly undented by the spread of the omicron COVID-19 variant. The data also said that the Chicago PMI was a higher-than-expected 63.1 for December.
COVID-19 will continue to be a key factor in investors' outlook, as the number of global COVID-19 cases continues to surge. The number topped 286 million as of Dec. 31, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
However, some investors downplayed the variant’s impact.
“The market is blasé about many of the risks emanating from omicron right now in terms of growth and the supply chain,” ForexLive chief currency analyst Adam Button told CNBC."

Following two interest-rate hikes in 2021, the South Korean central bank will watch growth and inflation trends, financial imbalances and changes in global monetary policy as it decides when to reduce accommodation again, Lee said Friday. 
“The economy will continue steady growth on the back of exports and investment, but uncertainties surrounding the economy remain high,” Lee said, according to a statement from the BOK. “With the emergence of the new variant, it’s difficult to gauge when the pandemic will end, and there are concerns that high inflation may last longer than expected due to supply disruptions and climate change polices.” 
Lee’s comments largely echoed the bank’s previous stance that rate hikes will continue into the new year, with the caveat that the pace and timing of any change will depend on how the pandemic affects the economy.  
Data released earlier Friday showed Korea’s inflation hovered near a decade high in December, underscoring persistent price pressures facing the economy. 
South Korea Inflation Exceeds 3% for Third Month in December 
In Friday’s statement, Lee also expressed concern over excess debt buildup, an issue that has prompted the BOK to start reining in stimulus in 2021 earlier than most Asian peers.  
“Such weak links in the economy are exposed to risks when external situations deteriorates,” Lee said. “When uncertainties are high, like now, we should find our vulnerabilities and actively work to resolve them.”
Lee added that financial markets and capital flows could become more volatile as global central banks normalize policy, and called for timely action to stabilize markets.

388,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 06:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s inflation topped 3% for a third straight month in December, as still-high commodity prices, ongoing supply issues and resilient domestic demand all worked to lift consumer prices. 
Consumer prices rose 3.7% from a year earlier, far exceeding the Bank of Korea’s 2% target, data from Statistics Korea showed Friday. The reading matched economists’ estimate for a 3.7% gain.  
Policy makers have been ramping up their caution over quickening inflation in recent months after a global acceleration in price growth reached Korea. 
The central bank sees a risk of stronger-than-forecast price pressures amid prolonged supply bottlenecks and a recovery in demand. Both the government and the central bank expect inflation to hover above the target well into next year. 
Friday’s report shows consumer prices remained strong even as a government fuel tax cut came into effect and virus restrictions were tightened again to stem a surge in infections.
The figures also reflect the latest changes to the consumer price index basket and base year. 
The statistics office last week adjusted the base year for the index to 2020 from 2015, and revised the basket to add 14 new items including masks and clothes dryers while removing 13, including school uniforms and cameras. 
The revision raised average inflation through January to November to 2.4% from 2.3% previously.   
Inflation will be a key consideration as the BOK board mulls when to raise interest rates again. Having hiked twice since August this year, Governor Lee Ju-yeol has indicated further hikes are on the table but has remained vague on the timing. The board next reviews rates on Jan. 14.
From a month earlier, consumer prices rose 0.2%.
Core inflation excluding agriculture and oil prices was 2.7% from a year earlier.

Investing.com – The pound has had a mixed year in 2021. The currency was one of the best performing in the G10 at the start of the year as the UK had one of the most advanced vaccination programmes in the world, and as the UK and EU agreed a Brexit trade agreement at the end of 2020.
However, ongoing Brexit troubles, a muddling Bank of England, and stubbornly high COVID cases weighed on Sterling in the second half of the year and the currency is set to end the year with slight losses against the US Dollar and gains against the Euro.
A number of the themes that were dominant in 2021 look set to continue into 2022 with Brexit, the Bank of England, Omicron, inflation, and potential government turmoil all set to play a part.
At the end of 2020, the UK and European Union announced a new trade and cooperation agreement that set out arrangements in areas such as goods and services, intellectual property, aviation, fisheries and law enforcement. The agreement prompted a rally in the pound at the start of 2021 but the UK has since signalled it could suspend parts of the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol.
The protocol was implemented to prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, part of the EU. However, since it was put into effect, the UK said the protocol represented a compromise by the UK and that the EU was enforcing border checks from goods coming from England, Scotland, and Wales too rigidly.
“Next year the focus will continue on post-Brexit trading arrangements, particularly over the Northern Ireland protocol,” said ITC Markets Europe and Americas Head of FX & Macro Analysis Robert Hoodless. “The expectations are for a conclusion on these matters in Q1, but the market may not be easily scared on these matters having experienced years of headlines on the matter.”
The Bank of England became one of the first major central banks to raise its interest rate and begin to remove the emergency stimulus that had been in place since the start of the pandemic. On 16th December, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street voted to increase the interest rate by 15 basis points to 0.25% and, with little fanfare, allowed for the conclusion of the current quantitative easing programme.
The focus for 2022 will be on how many more interest rate hikes are expected throughout the year.
“The pressures we still see building domestically within the labour market, in services, prices, inflation and so forth, need to be addressed by somewhat tighter policy and a somewhat higher bank rate,” the Bank of England’s Chief Economist Huw Pill said on the day after the decision.
Markets are currently pricing in around 80 basis points of tightening throughout 2022, or the equivalent of about three interest rate hikes.
If the Bank of England does decide to raise interest rates three times in 2022, it will be because they fear inflation could spiral out of control.
“The trend that everyone is watching in 2022 is inflation,” Justin Grossbard, Co-Founder and Chief Editor at Compare Forex Brokers told Investing.com. “With quantitative easing increasing demand while supply chains are stretched it appears inevitable that inflation will increase, forcing interest rate hikes to be considered.”
The Bank of England’s latest Monetary Policy Report from November showed that the central bank expected inflation to peak in the Spring of 2022, before falling as the impact of higher oil and gas prices begins to fade.
However, the central bank saw inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, peaking at around 5%. By November, CPI had already reached 5.1%.
The evolution of the pandemic will be another factor to consider for the pound in 2022. The Omicron variant is currently the dominant strain of COVID-19 in the UK with daily case numbers reaching record levels, far higher than at any other point during the pandemic.
The hope is that Omicron causes less severe disease than previous dominant variants, such as Delta or the original strain.
If that is not the case, then the UK looks set for additional social restrictions with Prime Minister Boris Johnson not ruling out more lockdowns.
On the outlook for the pound, Newsquawk Senior Analyst Danny Baker thinks Omicron and the pandemic could continue to be a key factor to look out for in 2022.
“Much depends on the evolution of the pandemic with Omicron adding a new/different dimension to the Delta variant (not to mention any other mutations or strains of the virus that emerge),” Baker told Investing.com.
The final piece of the jigsaw that pound traders will have to navigate in 2022 will be whether Prime Minister Johnson’s Conservative Party can see out the current turmoil.
In December alone, Johnson has faced a rebellion in parliament of over 100 of his MPs over new COVID regulations and the Conservative Party has lost a by-election in North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats, a seat the Tories had held for almost 200 years.
The election was called after Conservative MP Owen Paterson resigned after being found to have breached paid advocacy rules by the Commons Select Committee on Standards.
“The longevity of PM Johnson heading a Conservative majority is another matter worth considering,” ITC’s Hoodless added. “A replacement waits in the wings, in the form of UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak. Mr Sunak may well differ from PM Johnson’s ‘boosterism’ strategy, and look to tax and spend less than current government policy prescribes. The Chancellor is also known for a more Thatcherite intention of deregulation and a freeing from European rules. Such a political change later on in the year may have implications for the pound.”"

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, but remained near the bottom of its recent range in holiday-thinned volumes as fears over the Omicron Covid-19 variant continued to subside.
At 1:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 96.105, helped by rising U.S. Treasury yields, with benchmark 10-year yields hitting 1.56% on Wednesday, the highest since late November.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 115.16, at a one-month high and not far away from the 115.51 level it reached in November, its highest since early 2017. EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1317, still close to a one-month high, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3477, just off its highest since Nov. 19 reached overnight, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged higher to 0.7249.
“Although Omicron cases in the US and Europe, amongst others, continue to surge, it has yet to make its presence felt negatively in economic data. With market activity much reduced for the holiday season, investors continue to price in a global recovery, hitting a minor bump, not a pothole,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at Oanda. 
“Europe’s restrictions will have a tail impact, but, for now, markets are overwhelmingly pricing in the latest variant as a milder incarnation, despite its easier contractibility.”
Investors will focus on the release of weekly initial jobless claims later Thursday for further evidence that the U.S. economic recovery continues despite the rising number of Covid cases.
Initial unemployment claims totaled 205,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, unchanged from the prior period, Labor Department data showed last week, a level that is generally consistent with pre-pandemic levels.
The claims figure is expected to be largely unchanged, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), illustrating the low levels of job losses seen in recent months as employers focus on attracting and retaining workers to keep pace with consumer demand.  
Elsewhere,  USD/TRY rose 5.8% to 13.3723, with the lira giving back some of last week’s hefty gains after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a scheme to protect lira deposits against currency volatility.
The Turkish lira had previously fallen to record lows on the back of the central bank slashing its policy rate by 500 basis points since September even though inflation soared above 20%.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, but traded near the low end of its recent range along with the Japanese yen. However, moves remained small due to holiday-thinned trading and as fears over the omicron COVID-19 variant continued to subside.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 95.935 by 10:43 PM ET (3:43 AM GMT). The U.S. currency was supported by rising U.S. Treasury yields, with benchmark 10-year yields hitting 1.56% on Wednesday, the highest since Nov. 20, 2021.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 115.03 after falling to a one-month low of 115.03 on Wednesday.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7261 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.22% to 0.6845.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.3692 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3491.
Investors' risk appetite improved as many governments refrained from re-imposing lockdowns, despite soaring numbers of COVID-19 cases globally as omicron continues to spread. The number of global cases exceeded 284 million as of Dec. 30, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
“The dollar resumed its retreat overnight as markets continue to price in finishing omicron fears thanks to low hospitalizations,” Oanda senior market analyst for Asia Pacific Jeffrey Halley told Reuters.
“That has encouraged investors out of defensive positioning and back into the global recovery trade.”
However, other investors warned against reading too much into the moves as trades remained thin heading into the end of 2021.
“In times like these we trade very technically as short-term jobbers try to eek out some final year-end gains,” Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note.
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira was at 12.6 per dollar after tumbling 6.9% on Wednesday. The lira has lost 40% of its value in 2021 to date, it surged more than 50% last week thanks to state-backed market interventions.
Turkish Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said on Wednesday that the current swings in the lira were not worrying and that it would return to normal levels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged lower in thin holiday trading on Wednesday, while the safe-haven yen touched a one-month low as investors looked beyond a surge in Omicron cases and favored riskier currencies.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six global peers, was down 0.206% at 95.932, having turned negative around the start of the North American session.
With many traders having taken time off ahead of the year-end, analysts cautioned against reading too much into the moves. 
""In times like these we trade very technically as short term jobbers try to eek out some final year-end gains,"" Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.
FX flows have been on the ""lighter side of usual for a month end, corroborating the view that most of that flow happened last week or even sooner,"" he added. 
Investor sentiment has been buoyed in recent days by signs the Omicron variant, while causing a jump in cases to record highs in many countries, is not leading to new, widespread lockdowns.
U.S. health authorities on Monday shortened the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 to five days from a previous guidance of 10. 
Risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, were higher, while stocks were mixed.
""The Omicron variant continues to rage and fails to register on this market, even as global cases topped a million for the second day running,"" said Saxo Bank analysts.
The Aussie was up 0.35% at $0.72515, the Kiwi was up 0.28% at $0.6823, and the loonie rose 0.16% to C$1.2794.
The euro gained 0.29% to $1.13415, while sterling rose 0.45% to $1.34875. 
The Japanese yen touched 115.04 to the dollar, its lowest since late November. While the yen has been battered by the strength of investors' risk appetite, analysts said end-of-quarter investor flows were also impacting the currency.

Elsewhere, Turkey's lira dropped more than 6% to around 12.58 per dollar, eating further into huge gains made the previous week, as worries persisted over soaring inflation and unorthodox monetary policy.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was last down 0.67% at $47,223, while ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, was down 1.57% at $3,733.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely unchanged early in the European session Wednesday, struggling for direction in holiday-thinned volumes, but looks set for a strong 2022. 
At 1:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded largely flat at 96.230.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.90, just below Tuesday’s month-low of 114.94, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1305, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3430, slipping from a five-week high, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged higher to 0.7229.
“The week before and the one after Christmas are notably a low-volatility period for most asset classes including FX,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This year some seasonal tendencies will be mixed with the Omicron variant threatening to force new restrictions and markets still processing a week full of key central bank decisions.”
The safe-haven dollar has been on the backfoot of late with the recent rally in risk assets based on a view the Omicron strain would be less dangerous than the Delta variety, the previous dominant strain, and would thus not derail the global economic recovery too much.
That said, the dollar index has enjoyed its best year since 2015 and many expect further advances for the greenback in 2022, as the U.S. Federal Reserve recently indicated it will start hiking interest rates next year, before other major central banks and the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, in particular.
“Given our view of the persistence of U.S. inflation pressures, we see further room for the Fed to turn hawkish,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “While the financial markets are already flirting with the chance of the Fed starting its rate hikes as early as at the mid-March 2022 meeting, we see more room for market pricing to increase longer out.”
Elsewhere,  USD/TRY rose 2.3% to 12.0812, with the lira weakening amid persisting investor concern over Turkey's monetary policy, having surged more than 50% last week after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a scheme to protect lira deposits against currency volatility.
The Turkish lira had recently fallen to record lows on the back of the central bank slashing its policy rate by 500 basis points since September even though inflation soared.
The next iteration of the country’s inflation rate is due in early January, and is expected to have climbed above 30% in December for the first time since 2003, according to a Reuters poll.
The median forecast of 13 economists is 30.6%, which would be the highest since May 2003 - with forecasts ranging from 26.4% to 37.3%.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, but investors still struggled to grasp its direction due to holiday-thinned trading.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 96.165 by 10:46 PM ET (3:46 AM GMT). The euro edged down 0.14% overnight to $1.1307 and the pound retreated from a five-week high, helping to take the index to 96.165 from as low as 95.958 on Friday.
The dollar was also supported by climbing two-year Treasury yields, which hit a near two-year high on Tuesday.
The USD/JPY pair stabilized at 114.81.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7226 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.6807.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.3718 as investors continue to digest that People’s Bank of China reiterated that the yuan exchange rate will be more flexible in 2022 and will remain stable overall.
The GBP/USD pair stabilized at 1.3434.
Some investors warned that it is still hard to read the dollar's real direction from its recent moves as many traders are off for the holidays.
“Things are mostly noise right now, though we are probably seeing a soft risk-on/risk-off dynamic going on with stocks down slightly, and the dollar has caught a bid on the inverse of that,” IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
However, Rodda remained bullish on the U.S. currency longer term, due to imminent interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the reduced chance of future lockdowns in the U.S.
Expectations that the Fed will begin hiking interest rates before other major central banks, such as the European Central Bank, boosted the dollar index to its best year in 2021 since 2015.
Meanwhile, Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down, with the S&P 500 closing lower on Tuesday after four consecutive sessions of gains.
Investors are also monitoring the impact of omicron COVID-19 variant with an optimism that the new variant would not dent the global economic recovery too much.
Meanwhile, moves were bigger in cryptocurrencies. Both Bitcoin and Ether lost about 6% on Tuesday, with the assets often seeing bigger moves in low liquidity trading periods such as holidays and weekends."

Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropped 5.57 % to $3,812.6 on Tuesday, losing $224.8 from its previous close.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged higher in thin trading on Tuesday, helped by safe-haven flows as worries over the spread of COVID-19 sapped a multi-day rally in equity markets, and on expectations the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as early as March.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major rivals, was up 0.177% at 96.223.
The S&P 500 opened at another record high, extending a four-day rally, but then pulled back, while the Nasdaq was in the red the entire session, as investors eyed Omicron-driven travel disruptions and store closures.
""The losses on the Nasdaq are keeping the market a little bit anxious and favoring the U.S. dollar as a safe place to position [investors] over the next few days,"" said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco.
But ultimately, market volumes are low due to the holidays any moves may have been exaggerated, he noted.
""Most people just want to wrap up and get their work done and then get out, so I don’t think we’re going to get very much movement here,"" he said. 
The greenback is up nearly 7% in 2021, helped by growing expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates sooner than other central banks. 
""What we're really dealing with is inflation and what we're really dealing with is the Fed,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.
Fed funds futures are pricing better than 50% odds for a first quarter-point rate hike by March, odds that were ""unheard of just two weeks ago,"" Trevisani said.
The Fed said in a policy statement on Dec. 15 it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March and pave the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022 as the economy nears full employment and inflation continues to surge.
The safe-haven yen inched higher after having touched a one-month low against the dollar during the Asian session. 
The Japanese currency was up 0.07% at 114.8 yen per dollar after having earlier fallen to 114.935, its weakest since Nov. 26.
The Australian dollar, often considered a liquid proxy of risk appetite, was down 0.24% at $0.72225, after having hit its highest level against the greenback since Nov. 22 overnight.
Sterling declined 0.14% to $1.3422, having earlier touched a one-month high of $1.3461.

The euro declined 0.24% to $1.13.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell below $50,000 and was last down 6.31% at $47,771.62.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia. Meanwhile, the yen traded near a one-month low to the U.S. currency as uncertainty about the omicron COVID-19 variant was largely consigned to the background, and investors’ risk appetite improved.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 96.110 by 10:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 114.90, with the yen falling as far as 114.935 against the dollar for the first time since Nov. 26 and approaching the year-to-date low of 115.525 hit on Nov. 24.
Data released earlier in the day in Japan also said that industrial production grew a better-than-expected 7.2% month-on-month in November. It also said that the jobs/application ratio was 1.15, while the unemployment rate was 2.8%, in November.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7234, with the riskier Australian dollar inching up back towards the three-week high it hit on Friday. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.6807, with New Zealand and Australian markets closed for a holiday.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3722, with the People’s Bank of China reiterating on Monday that the yuan exchange rate will be more flexible in 2022 and will remain stable overall at a reasonable and balanced level.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 1.3429.
U.S. shares were on an upward trend, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high on Monday. The safe-haven U.S. dollar remained near toward the bottom end of its recent trading range, even as a hawkish tilt by the U.S. Federal Reserve at its latest policy meeting earlier in the month.
""Markets globally are optimistic"" that omicron won't derail an economic recovery, denting demand for haven currencies, predominantly the yen,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan head of G10 FX strategy Osamu Takashima told Reuters.
The U.S. equities rally ""implies that currently investor risk appetite must be very, very strong"" despite expectations for faster Fed tightening, he added, predicting that the yen is likely to test its 2021 low in the near term."

Investing.com -- The dollar was flat in early trading in Europe on Friday, on course to end the week lower after encouraging signs from the pandemic revived global risk appetite, supporting higher yielders. 
By 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT) the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of half a dozen advanced economy countries, was effectively unchanged at 96.06. Moves in all the major currencies were also minor. The euro was up less than 0.1% at $1.1347 and the pound was up a similar amount at $1.3412.
However, the dollar has lost between 1% and 1.5% this week against sterling and the Canadian, Australianand New Zealand dollars, and nearly 1% against the euro, as scientific data has dribbled out suggesting that the latest wave of the pandemic will be less economically damaging than previous ones. The only notable gains it has made have been against other haven currencies, such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. 
Data released on Thursday that showed sustained inflationary pressure in the U.S. weren't enough to upset the broader optimism as a growing body of evidence suggested that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is less likely than all previous dominant strains to lead to serious illness. The more evidence goes in that direction, the less likely disruptions to economic life will become. 
Trading has now all but stopped ahead of the Christmas holiday period, but markets remain at least formally open.
As has been the case all week, the sharpest moves are in the Turkish lira, whose rally in response to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's attempts to stop dollar hoarding now appears to be running out of steam. From a high of over 18 lira last week, the dollar fell as low as 10.1565 on Thursday before starting to gain ground again. By 3:30 AM ET, it traded at 11.6279, up 3.6% on the day.
The Russian ruble was testing its highest level in over a month after news suggesting that talks with the U.S. to de-escalate the situation on the Ukrainian border may take place in the near future. President Vladimir Putin slightly dialed down the tension at his annual press conference on Thursday, declining to repeat a threat of military action that he had made in a speech earlier in the week.
The South African rand also strengthened after fresh data showing that the first country to identify the Omicron variant of Covid-19 may soon put its latest infection wave behind it. The 7-day average for new infections is already down by around a quarter from its peak last week.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, with investors towards riskier assets as fears of the omicron COVID-19 variant’s virulence continue to fade.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 96.035 by 10:52 PM ET (3:52 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 114.35, with Japan’s cabinet approving a record initial budget for the year starting in April 2022. According to the country’s Finance Ministry, Japan plans JPY107.6 trillion yen ($941.26 billion) in overall spending for the year ending March 2023, a 0.9% increase from the current year’s initial budget.
Meanwhile, data released earlier in the day showed that Japan’s national core consumer price index grew 0.5% year-on-year in November.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7232 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.6815.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3702, with the People’s Bank of China setting a weaker-than-forecast yuan fixing, at 6.3692 per dollar, for a record 15th day on Friday. This is the longest period of lower-than-expected yuan fixings since surveys began in 2018, based on instances when the rate is even a fraction below the estimate.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3409.
Volumes were thin ahead of the holidays, with U.S. markets closed and other markets, such as Hong Kong, ending the trading day early.
Investors cheered the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use approval for Molnupiravir,  Merck & Co . Inc.'s (NYSE:MRK) COVID-19 pill, on Thursday.
A U.K. study that said omicron infections are less likely to lead to hospitalization also boosted sentiment. However, the study added that the variant may still produce a substantial number of serious cases due to its infectiousness.
Meanwhile, a laboratory study showed that two doses and a booster of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s vaccine did not produce sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies to protect against omicron.
Elsewhere in Asia Pacific, authorities locked down the western Chinese city of Xi’an, the biggest such move since the pandemic started in early 2020. The city’s 13 million residents were told to remain in their homes and to designate one person to go out every other day for necessities, in a bid to curb China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies on Thursday, but its gains were capped as easing fears of fallout from the Omicron coronavirus variant supported higher risk currencies such as the Australian dollar and British pound.
Ahead of the holidays and extended long weekend in the United States, most major currency pairs clung to narrow ranges. 
""We think the majors are liable to remain more or less range bound over the holidays,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was up 0.07% at 96.174. The index remains close to the 16-month high hit late last month.
Upbeat news on the vaccines and omicron-related hospitalizations helped boost investors' appetite for risk, lifting stocks and pushing U.S. Treasury yields higher.
Two vaccine makers said their shots protected against Omicron as UK data suggested it may cause proportionally fewer hospital cases than the Delta coronavirus variant, though public health experts warned the battle against COVID-19 was far from over.
Separately, data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held below pre-pandemic levels last week, while consumer spending increased solidly, putting the economy on track for a strong finish to 2021.
But price pressures continued to build up, with a measure of underlying inflation recording its largest annual increase since 1989 in November. 
The Australian dollar rose 0.35% to $0.72405. The Norwegian crown rose about 0.6% to a one-month high against the dollar, boosted by soaring oil and gas prices.
Sterling rose to 0.4% against the dollar benefiting from the reassuring reports on the Omicron variant and a move higher in Britain's short-dated government bond yields.

Elsewhere, the Turkish lira extended its startling rebound this week, rising another 6% at 11.3 per dollar, having traded as weak as 18.4 on Monday.
The big gains came after President Tayyip Erdogan said the government and central bank would guarantee some local currency deposits against FX depreciation losses. 
 
",,,,,
403,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish net foreign assets fell by nearly $6 billion early this week as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled plans to bolster the USD/TRY, suggesting Turkey made unannounced interventions in foreign-exchange markets. 
While the government has said it didn’t intervene, the fall of $5.9 billion probably signals a backdoor intervention similar to operations carried out over two years from October 2018, when state lenders sold dollars to support the local currency. 
Net foreign assets dropped to minus $5.1 billion on Tuesday compared with $817 million on Friday, according to calculations by Bloomberg using the monetary authority’s daily analytical balance sheet. 
The U.K.’s Financial Times reported earlier on the change in Turkey’s net foreign assets.
Erdogan on Monday rolled out a series of extraordinary measures to support the plunging lira, which at that point had shed more than 50% of its value against the dollar this year. The currency slump was fueled by central bank rates cuts demanded by the president, but authorities acted as the lira’s losses threatened to accelerate inflation that’s already over 20% and eroding support for the ruling party.  
The lira appreciated as much as 25% on Monday after Erdogan spoke, its biggest daily jump since 1983, and has now gained more than 40% against the dollar this week. 
The lira’s move on Monday was supported by state banks, according to four people who asked not to be identified by name. At least one private lender was also involved, said one person familiar with the transactions. The sales continued Tuesday, said the people. 
At the center of Erdogan’s plan is a new instrument intended to suppress retail investor demand for dollars. If the lira’s decline against hard currencies exceed banks’ interest rates, the government will pay holders of lira deposits the differential.
Net reserves dropped to $12.2 billion as of Friday, showing the impact of last week’s direct sales, which were announced by the central bank. The dip of about $9 billion was the biggest weekly drop in data that goes back at least 2002.
Global banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predict more than $100 billion of central bank reserves were spent to prevent a disorderly depreciation in the lira last year alone, when the currency came under pressure after a series of large rate cuts to support the pandemic-hit economy.
Earlier this year, Erdogan said authorities used $165 billion of central bank foreign-currency reserves to weather developments in 2019 and 2020, and may use them “again when needed.”

Investing.com - The dollar traded marginally lower early in the European session Thursday, near a one-week low, amid growing optimism for the global economic outlook despite the surge of Omicron-variant Covid cases. 
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.1% to 96.043, having earlier fallen to 96.018 for the first time since Dec. 17.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.19, with the yen, another safe haven, slipping despite Japan upgrading earlier Thursday its growth projections for the next fiscal year starting in April.
The growth projection was raised to 3.2% for fiscal 2022 from a forecast 2.2% real GDP growth seen at a mid-year review in July. This would be the fastest growth since fiscal 2010.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1338, adding to its overnight advance, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3354, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7218, after Wednesday’s surge of almost 1%.
Risk sentiment has improved as the week has progressed, helped by a couple of studies suggesting that patients with the Omicron variant face a lower risk of hospitalization and severe disease compared with the Delta variant, the previously dominant strain.
Also helping was the release of positive U.S. economic data on Wednesday, with GDP growing 2.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter and existing home sales rising 1.9% in November. However, it was U.S. consumer confidence improving more than expected in December despite the resurgence in Covid-19 infections which had the biggest impact.
“Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased,” said a Conference Board spokeswoman.
The economic data slate is packed Thursday, including initial jobless claims, new home sales, durable goods orders, and the PCE price index. It also includes personal income and spending, as well as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment and expectations indexes.
Elsewhere,  USD/TRY dropped 1.8% to 11.8270, with the lira continuing to rebound after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that measures to protect the Turkish lira bank deposits from depreciation amid a currency crisis have achieved their goal.
That said, the currency is still about 40% down so far this year after a series of interest rate cuts, engineered by the president, despite inflation soaring over 20%.
Elsewhere, the Russian ruble rose to its highest level in over a month ahead of President Vladimir Putin's annual press conference, against a backdrop of continued tension on the Ukrainian border, where over 100,000 Russian troops have massed. Analysts will want to see whether Putin repeats to a more general audience the hawkish comments that he made to his defense chiefs earlier in the week.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia as optimism about the global economic outlook whetted investors’ risk appetite. However, the continuous, rapid spread of the omicron COVID-19 variant remains a concern.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 96.028 by 11:09 PM ET (4:09 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 114.13.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.1% to 0.7206 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.6808.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.3707 while the GBP/USD pair stablized at 1.3348.
Risk sentiment has improved after being rattled by omicron’s spread and ensuing government restrictions earlier in the week. A South African study showed that patients with the omicron variant have reduced risks of hospitalization and severe disease compared with the delta variant.
Also contributing to improved sentiment,  Pfizer  Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 antiviral therapy, Paxlovid, received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.
On the data front, Wednesday’s data from the U.S. showed that the GDP grew 2.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of 2021. Existing home sales were at 6.46 million for November and the Conference Board Consumer Confidence index was at 115.8 for December.
More data is due later in the day, including initial jobless claims, new home sales, durable goods orders, and the PCE price index. It also includes personal income and spending, as well as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment and Michigan Consumer Expectations indexes.
Central banks are also tightening monetary policy, with the U.S. Federal Reserve adopting a hawkish tone at its latest policy meeting.
“Ongoing data strength should help bolster Fed pricing, particularly amid reports that omicron appears to be leading to fewer hospitalizations,” TD Securities analysts said in a report.
The Bank of England also raised its interest rate to 0.25% in its latest policy decision last week. However, the surprise move has “offered only some time-limited support to the pound, but the fast spread of the omicron in the U.K. may keep some pressure on the pound around Christmas, in particular as the government may opt to impose some new restrictions,” ING said in a recent note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro, Australian dollar and other currencies recovered against the U.S. dollar as traders turned more positive about the economic outlook on Wednesday, even as Omicron cases rocketed and investors braced for more volatility.
Risk appetite has improved since Monday, when markets were rattled by government restrictions relating to the spread of Omicron, and after U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support a new fiscal spending package.
""The dollar is softening as risk-off impulses continue to ebb,"" analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said in a report on Wednesday, adding that ""we are likely in a consolidative period for now given the lack of any major new drivers.""
The dollar dipped 0.37% against a basket of currencies to 96.068.
The dollar index, however, remains near a 1-1/2-year high of 96.938 reached on Nov. 24, on expectations that the Federal Reserve is closer to raising rates.
Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. consumer confidence improved further in December, suggesting the economy would continue to expand in 2022 despite a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and reduced fiscal stimulus.
The euro gained 0.37% to $1.1331.
The risk sensitive Australian dollar gained 0.86% to $0.7214 and the kiwi rose 0.74% to $0.6820. 
The greenback dipped 0.63% against the Norwegian crown to 8.8800. The Norwegian currency has benefited from rising oil and gas prices and has a positive seasonality for the weeks around Christmas.
Sterling gained 0.67% to $1.3358, despite data showing Britain's economy grew more slowly than previously thought in the July-September period.
The weeks on either side of Christmas are typically low in volatility for currencies and other asset classes, analysts at ING said, though ""this year some seasonal tendencies will be mixed with the Omicron variant threatening to force new restrictions and markets still processing a week full of key central bank decisions.""
Turkey's lira steadied and held its recent gains after a rollercoaster ride in which it charged back from record lows due to President Tayyip Erdogan's new steps to guard Turks' savings against volatility.

Investing.com – The pound was handed a lifeline recently as the Bank of England unexpectedly hike rates for the first time in three years, but the tailwind will be fleeting as U.K. may impose further restrictions to curb the Omicron spread.
GBP/USD rose 0.7% to 1.3332.
The BoE rate hike has “offered only some time-limited support to the pound, [but] the fast spread of the Omicron variant in the UK may keep some pressure on GBP around Christmas, in particular as the government may opt to impose some new restrictions,” ING said in a recent note.
The UK government is facing calls from to follow other countries in mainland Europe and impose more stringent restrictions to stop the spread of the omicron variant of Covid-19 just as daily cases of Covid-19 passed 100,000 for the first time on Wednesday.  
Though there does appear to be scope for the government to avoid a return to a national lockdown in England should hospital admissions in London remain below 400 per day by the end of this week, according to local media reports.  
Hospital admission reached 301 per day in London, according to latest government data.
Rising political uncertainty, however, may also present a slippery path ahead for the pound as “markets attempt to re-assess both the Brexit policy,” ING said.
Yet, with the pound down about 3% against the dollar since its recent peak, there may be room for a short-term bounce, though the risks still appear “moderately skewed to the downside,” ING added.",,,,,
408,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are redrafting their playbooks as they game out just how well different currencies can withstand -- or harness -- the rising tide of global consumer prices.
For the likes of Amundi Pioneer Asset Management and Brandywine Global Investment Management, the answer may lie in higher-yielding emerging markets or big commodity producers that stand to gain from rising prices. Analysts at  Goldman Sachs. are more focused on mispriced opportunities around the policies of central banks, which may show more willingness to embrace FX appreciation and extend their rate-hiking cycles amid climbing inflation risks. And still others are of a mind to just hide out in the dollar -- the world’s biggest reserve currency and a go-to haven.
It’s an indication of just how prevalent global inflation fears have become that FX traders are having to sit up and take notice. Typically a sign to avoid or bet against a currency, rising prices are so widespread that traders are contemplating exotic currency pairings that offer relative value and considering whether central banks will diverge from conventional toolkits to rein in consumer-price gains without killing growth.
“We’ve always thought the market has underestimated the macro risk that inflation poses,” said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy at Amundi Pioneer, which oversees $316 billion.
So far, the greenback has more than held its own, buoyed by the prospect of Federal Reserve policy tightening and a measure of confidence that officials there can keep price pressures in check. Even with deeply negative real yields -- the rate that bonds deliver with inflation taken into account -- the dollar is up against almost all of its biggest peers this year and many observers project it will remain strong into 2022.
A Bank of America survey released earlier this month showed that investors’ dollar positioning and views are the most bullish since 2015, while respondents pointed to central bank tightening and inflation as key risks for 2022.
Those concerns aren’t new for Jack McIntyre, a Philadelphia-based money manager at Brandywine, but he favors resource-linked currencies as the way to get positive exposure to global inflation risks. He currently has long positions on the Australian and Canadian dollars, as well as the Norwegian krone, preferring to express those trades against the Japanese yen and the euro instead of the U.S. dollar. 
“We’re positioned for commodity prices at a minimum to be stable, and to actually continue to move higher,” he said.
He also underscored that with inflation becoming a potential problem for some central bankers, many that might have previously wanted a lower exchange rate may now be in favor of some appreciation. 
“If inflation is becoming more of a concern, and it looks like it is, I think we could actually go to an environment where countries not only tolerate, but embrace a stronger currency,” McIntyre said.
How central banks choose to respond -- and the effectiveness of their toolkits in fighting the current inflation threat -- is, of course, critical to how currencies are likely to behave.
Europe is facing inflationary pressures, but the euro-area monetary authority appears to have less scope than some of its peers to lean against these with rate hikes. For Michael Cahill, an economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in London, there’s potential for investors to protect themselves with the currencies of neighboring countries whose central banks might prove more able to respond.
With inflation running hotter, the Swiss National Bank -- an authority that’s historically had quite a large presence in markets -- is less likely to intervene to cap the value of the franc, he said. On top of that, the currency could prove to be a haven if European inflation risks also begin to affect growth. All that means there’s still room for it to run higher against the euro, in his view.
Sweden could also provide opportunities if inflation sparks a more hawkish turn from the central bank there, according to Cahill, potentially buoying the {{|krona}} against the common currency. He favors expressing that view through an options-based wager that pays out if the euro hits particular levels against the Swedish and U.S. currencies.
Amundi Pioneer’s Upadhyaya, for his part, sees potential for the Australian dollar to gain against its New Zealand counterpart, reasoning that the market hasn’t priced in enough tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia compared to its trans-Tasman peer.
He has also been looking at some more niche developing-market currencies that deliver higher yields -- both nominal and real. Upadhyaya has already taken long positions on the Egyptian pound, Kazakhstani tenge and Uzbekistani soum, and reckons there might be opportunities in the the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah. “On a volatility-adjusted basis, the carry is very attractive,” he said.
That said, investors may not have to think about anything too exotic if the greenback keeps on rallying. Morgan Stanley, for one, expects that a hawkish response from the Fed relative to its biggest developed-market counterparts will bolster the advantage in inflation-adjusted yields that America’s rate market has, and that the dollar will be a beneficiary, at least in the first part of 2022.  
“This should support USD strength, particularly versus the low yielders, which are more sensitive to real yields,” analysts including Matthew Hornbach wrote in a note to clients this month.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, but ranges are tight as traders continue to assess the impact of the Omicron Covid variant as the year-end approaches.  
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.1% to 96.558.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.16, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1267, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3252, after Britain's economy grew more slowly than previously thought in the July-September period, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7137.
“The week before and the one after Christmas are notably a low-volatility period for most asset classes including FX,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This year some seasonal tendencies will be mixed with the Omicron variant threatening to force new restrictions and markets still processing a week full of key central bank decisions.”
Still, looking at the bigger picture, Omicron infections are multiplying across Europe, the United States and Asia, causing many countries to consider new restrictions on movement to the likely detriment to risk sentiment, thus benefiting the safe-haven dollar.
Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the speeding up of the withdrawal of its bond-buying program last week, potentially bringing forward interest rate hikes to the first half of 2022. 
This contrasts with the still very accommodative stance of the Bank of Japan, while the European Central Bank only slightly reined in stimulus last week, still ruling out any interest rate hikes next year..
Another factor that could support the dollar near term is the growing tension on the border between Russia and the Ukraine, following reports Russia is massing troops in preparation for invasion.
President Vladimir Putin took a hardline stance in a speech Tuesday, saying Russia had no room to retreat in a standoff with the United States over Ukraine and would be forced into a ""military-technical"" response unless the West backed down.
In response, a Biden administration official stated U.S. officials are considering tough export control measures to disrupt Russia's economy should invade Ukraine.
USD/RUB dropped 0.2% to 73.8510, with the ruble benefiting from the Bank of Russia hiking interest rates by 100 basis points late last week, its second such move this year.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY dropped 0.3% to 12.4859, with the lira rebounding from record lows against the dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled measures earlier this week to support the currency, including a program to protect savings from fluctuations in the lira."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, but moves were small as investors continued assessing the impact of the omicron COVID-19 variant on the global economic recovery.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 96.500 by 10:36 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 114.11, with the Bank of Japan releasing the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.25% to 0.7136 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.6751.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3724, while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.3259.
The euro was down marginally at $1.1277 starting Wednesday.
Investors are struggling to explain the ""risk-on"" mood, with some saying markets were struggling to assess omicron's consequences, leading to unseasonable volatility.
Typically, currencies' volatility is low in the weeks ahead and after Christmas, but “this year some seasonal tendencies will be mixed with the Omicron variant threatening to force new restrictions and markets still processing a week full of key central bank decisions,” ING analysts told Reuters.
With omicron spreading across Europe, the U.S., and Asia, some countries are considering re-imposing restrictive measures. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to be cautious but ruled out tighter restrictions ahead of the holidays. In Germany, gatherings will likely be limited to 10 people and France will limit New Year’s Eve celebrations.
However, news that U.S. Food and Drug Administration could authorize COVID-19 treatment pills from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Merck & Co  . Inc. (NYSE:MRK) as early as this week boosted investor sentiment.
Also contributing to improving sentiment, U.S. President Joe Biden is optimistic about reaching a deal with Senator Joe Manchin to push the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better bill through Congress.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira is bracing for another volatile day. The currency closed up 6% on Tuesday, having fallen as much as 8.6% and risen as much as 18.5%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped slightly on Tuesday as improving risk sentiment boosted riskier currencies such as the Australian dollar and the British pound.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index was last at 96.47, down 0.03% on the day, after slipping as low as 96.336 earlier in the session. The index, which is up about 7% for the year, fell 0.1% on Monday as traders sold the greenback to book profits in the final days of the year.
Risk appetite took a blow on Monday after U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat who is key to President Joe Biden's hopes of passing a $1.75-trillion domestic investment bill - known as Build Back Better - said on Sunday he would not support the package, prompting a sell-off in global markets.
Surging Omicron coronavirus cases also pushed investors to look for safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc < CHF=>.
Stocks rebounded and bond yields rose on Tuesday as investors looked past the recent setbacks. 
""We expect broader range trading will extend over the holiday period,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar bounced on Tuesday, snapping a two-day weakening streak to trade up 0.60%.
The rebound in global risk appetite also pushed the British pound up against the dollar and euro, even as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cautioned that further lockdown measures may be needed to tackle the spread of the virus.
Despite the greenback's lackluster showing this week, the dollar index is still close to the 16-month high of 96.938 hit in late November. Investors remain bullish on the outlook for the greenback, with latest positioning data near the highest levels in more than two years.
The Federal Reserve's hawkish statement last week that it would accelerate the unwind of its asset purchases, paving the way for three quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2022 - is expected to keep the dollar well-supported.
""We continue to anticipate the USD and CAD advancing against the majors in the new year as investors bank on tighter monetary policy being introduced by the Fed and Bank of Canada respectively,"" Osborne said.
The slack in Canada's economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic has substantially diminished, the governor of the Bank of Canada said on Wednesday, a key sign the central bank is set to begin hiking rates soon.
The loonie was up about 0.2% on Tuesday.
In other trading, Turkey's lira was up about 7% against the U.S. dollar, extending its historic recovery from record lows after President Tayyip Erdogan unveiled a plan he said would guarantee local currency deposits against market fluctuations.
Bitcoin gained 3.5% to $48,558 after trending lower for the past few weeks.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday as risk sentiment improved, but losses are small as the surge of cases of the Omicron variant prompts caution.  
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.1% to 96.500.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 113.77, with the safe haven yen losing some ground despite Japan’s government raising its monthly view of the economy for the first time since the summer of 2020.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1286, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3221 while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7125.
Still, despite these moves, “sentiment remains exceedingly fragile, complicated by rapidly thinning liquidity in asset classes ahead of the holiday season and year-end,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at MarketPulse. “We are one headline away, be it Omicron or something else, from normal service resuming.” 
The dollar took a hit on Monday from the news that U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, will not support President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill, effectively ending its hopes of passing through the Senate.
However, looking at the overall picture, the bigger picture, the dollar remains strong after the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish turn last week, speeding up the withdrawal of its bond-buying program and thus potentially moving up interest rate hikes to the first half of 2022.
Also, the dollar retains its safe haven status as the fast-growing Omicron variant causes many countries to reimpose mobility restrictions, potentially slowing the global economic recovery.
New Zealand delayed the planned reopening of its international border, the U.S. advised its citizens against travel to eight destinations, including Spain and Finland, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would tighten coronavirus curbs if needed.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY dropped 0.4% to 13.1581 in extremely volatile trading, with the lira rebounding strongly from record lows after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan moved to support the currency late Monday.
The Turkish government announced measures to protect savings from fluctuations in the local currency, with the government making up for losses incurred by holders of lira deposits should the currency’s declines be deemed excessive. 
The lira has been very weak this year, with Erdogan insisting on cutting interest rates despite inflation surging over 20%. It has lost half its value over the past three months, the biggest retreat of any currency in the world over that period."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, remaining below its recent high. A blow to U.S. President Joe Biden’s investment bill, as well as concerns about the omicron COVID-19 variant, also capped gains for riskier currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.05% to 96.465 by 9:20 PM ET (2:20 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 113.69.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7115, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day. In the minutes, the central bank said that beginning asset tapering at its first meeting of 2022 and ending it in May is consistent with existing forecasts, an upbeat view of the economy.
The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.6726.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.3740 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3211.
The U.S. currency briefly approached 16-month highs at 96.914 during the past week, reacting to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish pivot in its latest policy decision. Omicron concerns also gave the safe-haven asset a boost.
However, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin’s comments on Sunday that he will not support Biden’s Build Back Better package, a $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill, saw the dollar finish Monday’s session down 0.12%.
""The dollar pulled back on the breakdown of Build Back Better. Less stimulus, weaker growth, and rates dropping at the short-end were enough to push the dollar slightly lower,"" IG markets analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields hit 0.5870% on Monday, their lowest level since Dec. 3.
The pound was also on a downward trend after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that he would tighten restrictive measures to curb omicron’s spread if needed. The variant is spreading rapidly in Europe and the U.S., accounting for 73% of all sequenced U.S. cases, according to federal estimates.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira had a volatile day on Monday, falling as much as 10% before ending the session up over 20%. The currency got a boost after President Tayyip Erdogan introduced measures that he said would ease the impact of the weakened currency.
However, Erdogan also vowed to continue with a low-rates policy that had led to the lira's slide in the first place."

Activity in some service sectors is “significantly hampered,” the central bank said Monday in its monthly report. While the hit to sales should be smaller than a year ago as current restrictions are less severe and only cover a comparatively short period of time, a persistent squeeze on supplies is adding extra strains.
Business confidence slipped for a sixth month in December, with gauges for current conditions and expectations both worsening. The Bundesbank last week lowered its economic-growth forecasts for this year and next, warning of a winter setback.
It predicted a strong pickup in momentum in the spring with private spending to rise “substantially,” and sees supply bottlenecks being resolved by the end of 2022. At the same time, it raised its inflation outlook and urged the European Central Bank to be vigilant of upside risks.
On Monday, the Bundesbank said it expects annual consumer-price gains in Germany to remain above 4% over the coming months, citing a steep increase in natural gas prices that’s likely to reach consumers at the start of 2022.

Investing.com - The dollar rose in early European trade Monday, climbing close to its recent high, as the Federal Reserve pointed to early rate hikes while Europe struggles with surging Omicron cases.  
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.1% to 96.595, not far from last month's peak of 96.938, the highest since July 2020.
The U.S. central bank took a hawkish turn last week after its two-day policy meeting, with Fed policymakers agreeing to speed up the removal of its bond-buying program, potentially also bringing forward the first interest rate increase of the post-pandemic period.
This new stance was confirmed by a couple of policymakers late last week, with Fed Governor Chris Waller stating that a rate increase in March would be ""very likely"", while Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said she would support two or three rate hikes next year.
“The Fed has finally woken up to the inflation risks,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “While the financial markets are already flirting with the chance of the Fed starting its rate hikes as early as at the mid-March 2022 meeting, we see more room for market pricing to increase longer out.“
The Bank of England also turned hawkish last week, becoming the first G-7 central bank to lift interest rates since the start of the pandemic. However, any benefit to sterling from this move has quickly dissipated as Omicron cases soared, and Britain's health minister declined to rule out tightening restrictions on economic and social activity before Christmas. 
GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3212 after climbing as high as 1.3375 on Thursday, its highest for almost a month, when the BoE hiked interest rates.
EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1255, but this is still near the lowest levels since Dec. 15 after Netherlands went into lockdown on Sunday and Italy confirmed it was considering similar measures.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY climbed 0.1% to 6.3790 after China cut its lending benchmark loan prime rate for the first time in 20 months earlier Monday, in a bid to prop up growth in the slowing economy and support its troubled property sector.
USD/TRY soared 6.2% to 17.4361, the lira falling to fresh record lows against the dollar after the Turkish central bank cut interest rates again late last week, as part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox approach to tackling rampant inflation.
The lira is down 55% in the year, set to surpass declines in the 2001 financial crisis that brought Erdogan’s AK Party to power. Inflation, meanwhile, is running at over 21%.

Key central banks handed down their policy decisions last week, with the Fed turning hawkish in its latest policy decision. The central bank will accelerate its asset tapering program to end in March 2022 and project three quarter-point rate increases in the same year.
The Bank of England hiked interest rates to 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision, a surprise move as it handed down its policy decision last Thursday. The European Central Bank also announced plans of asset tapering over the upcoming quarters on the same day.
On Friday, Fed Governor Chris Waller said the central bank might raise interest rates “shortly after” the completion of bond purchases in March 2022.
“Waller gave the (dollar index) a tailwind on Friday. Positioning is skewed long in USDs, so the prospect of position squaring into year-end is elevated, while central bank actions are the real issue, headlines on omicron could be seen as the smoking gun for position squaring,” head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne Chris Weston, said in a note.
On the COVID-19 front, U.S. President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser Anthony Fauci said a shutdown will not be necessary despite COVID-19 surges again.
However, European countries are imposing more restrictions over the surging Omicron cases. The U.K. is warning that new curbs could be imposed by Christmas, as the country detected 12,000 cases on Sunday. The Netherlands has already gone into lockdown."
417,"<span>Dec 19, 2021 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China are set to spend 2022 diverging on monetary policy, marking a new phase in the struggle to deal with the fallout of the pandemic and setting up a synchronized slowdown in the world’s two largest economies.  
As the Federal Reserve lines up to start raising interest rates from near zero to curb the strongest inflation in four decades, the People’s Bank of China is stepping up support for an economy under strain from a property market crackdown. 
Higher rates will dampen demand in the U.S. while China merely cushions -- rather than stimulates -- its own sputtering economy. Growth between both economies could start converging if the U.S. follows China’s 2021 slowdown, though the omicron variant is a new wildcard for both central banks. 
Each central bank’s pivot carries risks and have potential implications for international capital flows. The yuan’s strength and record inflows of foreign capital into China will be tested if a hawkish Fed means the dollar strengthens, bond yield differentials narrow and investors rebalance portfolios. 
“If the Fed is pivoting towards a more hawkish stance and the PBOC is easing, this will shift the expectation of relative tightness in monetary policies in the U.S. versus China,” said Helen Qiao, chief economist for Greater China at BofA Global Research. “The immediate implication is on foreign exchange as we may start to see some depreciating pressure on the yuan relative to the dollar,” she said.
Much will ultimately depend on the pace of tightening that the Fed pushes through and how far China goes with easier policy.
For now, economists predict the Fed will carry through on its plan to end its asset-purchase program and satisfy its new projections for three rate hikes in 2022. 
Meanwhile, analysts expect the PBOC to accelerate credit growth after almost a year of slowing, and there is rising expectation that it will further cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve -- called the reserve requirement ratio -- in coming months. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says ...
“Potential paths for China’s interest rates ... and faster than previously signaled increases for the Fed mean that the yield gap between yuan and dollar assets is likely to narrow more.”
-- Chang Shu, chief Asia economist

Calls for a rate cut are also gaining momentum, which will narrow the yield spread between U.S. Treasuries and Chinese government bonds. The PBOC’s current benchmark, the loan prime rate, is at 3.85% and hasn’t been cut since April 2020.
Policy divergence could lead to less capital flowing into China “but the impact is likely to be more muted than previously,” said Mitul Kotecha, chief EM Asia and Europe strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
Pandemic Policy
The pandemic has put China’s monetary policy in sharp contrast with the rest of the world. As the first economy to enter a lockdown-induced slump last year, it was the first to begin recovering as well while the rest of the world was still struggling to emerge from recession. 
Worried that loose monetary and fiscal policy would fuel financial risks, Chinese authorities began tapering stimulus and tightening rules on lending in the property market this year. That triggered debt defaults, a slump in housing sales and investment, and weaker economic growth -- a slowdown that policy makers want to avoid worsening as the Communist Party heads for a crucial leadership meeting in 2022. 
“The Chinese and U.S. economies are in different stages of the business cycle,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc. “China has taken a lead with tightening this year, and next year it will start to boost domestic demand, and growth is expected to stabilize.” The U.S. on the other hand “will begin to slow next year, but will still remain above the trend growth rate,” he said.
Surging trade surpluses -- which will likely continue at least into the first half of 2022 -- will give underlying support to the yuan and provide space for the PBOC to let it depreciate somewhat, while much more stringent capital account controls will prevent a repeating of large money outflow five years ago.
“Factors that have kept the yuan strong, such as the large trade surplus, brought by surging exports and weak domestic demand and little outbound tourism, are likely to remain intact in the near-term,” said Alejandra Grindal, chief international economist at Ned Davis Research Inc.
For the global economy, the central banks’ different paces could turn out to be helpful in avoiding overheating, and lead to converging growth between the two countries, according to Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte. in Singapore.  
The two largest economies in the world “may offset each other and have a balancing effect on the global economy overall,” said Standard Chartered’s Ding.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday as traders retreated from riskier currencies amid talk of interest rate hikes by central bankers and concerns about the spread of Omicron cases.
The dollar index against major currencies rose 0.7%, recouping all of the value it had lost on Thursday following a series of central bank policy statements.
The euro and British pound fell 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively, after having booked gains the two previous days. The euro stood at $1.1239 and the pound at $1.3236 at 2100 GMT.
Commodity-linked currencies, including the Australian and Canadian dollars, also lost value as crude oil prices fell 2% on worries that Omicron variant will dampen demand.
The Aussie fell 0.8% to $0.7124. 
The Canadian dollar traded 1% lower at 1.2895, or 77.54 U.S. cents, in its biggest decline since Nov. 26.
The dollar was flat against the Japanese yen. 
The risk of reinfection with the Omicron coronavirus variant is more than five times higher than the Delta variant and has shown no sign of being milder, a new study from England showed. The findings were released as European countries weigh further travel and social restrictions. 
In the United States, Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller said an interest rate increase will likely be warranted ""shortly after"" the Fed ends its bond purchases in March.
Earlier, New York Fed president John Williams told CNBC that the Fed will gain ""optionality"" to raise interest rates in 2022 by ending bond purchases by March. 
Traders are comparing changing interest rates across currencies as central banks go at different speeds to adjust monetary policies in the face increasing signs of persistently high inflation and the Omicron threat.
The spread between yields on two-year government securities of the United States and Germany widened through the day to its biggest gap in a week and reflected the euro's weakness.
Some analysts have cautioned against reading too much into changes in exchange rates at this stage.
With the central bank meetings out of the way, ""we think there will be little informational value in price action in coming days,"" strategists at TD Securities said in a note to clients on Thursday.
""The USD can consolidate into year-end as FX markets work off some residual positioning/value excesses,"" they added.
The dollar index, at 96.6590, was up about 8% since May.
Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 3% to $46,335.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Friday, remaining under pressure the day after the Bank of England raised its key rate and even the European Central Bank said it will slow down its bond-buying from April.  
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.1% to 95.950, having hit its lowest in over a week on Thursday.
GBP/USD traded flat at 1.3319 after climbing as high as 1.3375 in the previous session, its highest for almost a month, when the BoE hiked interest rates for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, becoming the first G7 central bank to do so since the start of the pandemic.
EUR/USD was also flat at 1.1328 having hit the highest this month on Thursday, following the latest policy meeting of the European Central Bank, in which it announced plans toward asset tapering over the upcoming quarters. 
“The ECB paved the way out of the pandemic-era support measures but at the same time retained flexibility to react to unforeseen developments,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “We expect net asset purchases to end in H1 2023 and see the first hike in late 2023.”
These moves follow the Federal Reserve announcing on Wednesday that it was accelerating the tapering of its asset-buying program, paving the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022. 
However, while the Fed’s stance had been well trailed, the hawkish turns by the ECB and the BoE surprised markets, given that Europe, and the U.K. in particular, is currently looking at an economic slowdown due to increasing cases of Omicron-variant Covid-19.
The U.K. posted a record number of daily coronavirus cases for the second day running on Thursday, with almost 90,000 infections confirmed, while the likes of France and Italy have tightened their restrictions on arrivals.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY climbed 2.7% to 16.0903, the lira falling to new record lows after Turkey's central bank cut its policy rate again by 100 basis points to 14% despite inflation soaring above 21%.
USD/RUB fell 0.1% to 73.7234 ahead of the latest Bank of Russia meeting, which is expected to deliver another increase in the key interest rate as inflation remains at double the central bank’s 4% target.
The majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey expect a 100 basis-point increase, the second hike of that size this year. The central bank has already raised its key rate by 325 basis points this year.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, remaining under pressure as investors digest a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of England (BOE), and the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a more hawkish stance.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 95.990 by 10:26 PM ET (3:26 AM GMT).
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3326, while the USD/JPY pair inched down 0.06% to 113.64.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.7170 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.6783.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.3698.
Key central banks have adopted different policies as uncertainty about the omicron COVID-19 variant’s impact on economic recovery remains. The debate on the extent to which central banks should act to curb high inflation also continues.
The pound climbed as high as $1.33755 for the first time since Nov. 24 during the previous session, after the BOE hiked interest rates to 0.25% in a surprise move as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday. It is now the first key central bank to hike interest rates since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Meanwhile, the euro steadied around the $1.13315 mark, after hitting its highest in December, or $1.13605. The ECB, in its own policy decision handed down on the same day as the BOE, announced plans toward asset tapering over the upcoming quarters. However, the central bank also emphasized policy flexibility.
""A cautious ECB taper and a surprise BOE hike likely leaves the dollar index heavy near-term, especially given lopsided long dollar positioning into year’s end,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
""But weakness likely does not extend beyond the low 95s"" for the dollar index, with the U.S. Federal Reserve ""streets ahead"" of the ECB in terms of the tightening cycle, and dips into the mid-95 level are a buying opportunity, the note added.
The Fed turned hawkish in its latest policy decision, handed down on Wednesday. The central bank will accelerate its asset tapering program to end in March 2022, while projecting three quarter-point rate increases that year.
In Asia Pacific, the Bank of Japan kept its interest rate steady at -0.10% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. Although keeping within investor expectations, inflation still remains well below the central bank’s target."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar steadied on Thursday but was headed toward a second day of losses as markets sorted a raft of central bank policy statements for clues to coming differences in interest rates and support for their economies.
The dollar index of major currencies was down 0.4% in afternoon trading in New York after having fallen as much as 0.5% in the morning.
Losses came against currencies associated with more risk taking, as well as against the safe-haven Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
Within 24 hours, the dollar index plunged 1.1%, starting from a spike up when the U.S. Federal Reserve posted a new policy statement on Wednesday, down to a low shortly after the European Central Bank and the Bank of England made announcements on Thursday.
""What a day,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
The British pound surged as much as 0.8% against the dollar after the Bank of England became the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic.
The euro climbed more than 0.5% after the European Central Bank said it would slightly rein in stimulus.
The gentle move by the ECB contrasted with the more hawkish tone of the Fed, which said it will end its pandemic-era bond buying in March, paving the way for an expected three interest rate hikes in 2022.. 
The pound was last up 0.4% to $1.3314 and the euro was up 0.3% to $1.1332.
The swings suggested that some traders had moved to close out short positions against the euro and sterling, Chandler said.
The euro-dollar exchange rate also seems to be tracking changes in the spread between market yields of two-year U.S. and German government securities, Chandler said, adding that two-year yields are especially sensitive to central bank interest rate policies.
That spread, which had been trending wider this year with the relative hawkishness of the Fed to the ECB, narrowed slightly on Thursday in favor of the euro.
The different paths taken by major central banks underline deep uncertainties about how the fast-spreading Omicron variant will hit economies and about how much each should do to fight surging inflation, which is hitting hard in the United States and Britain, but less so in Europe. 
The central banks included dovish elements in their statements, which gave markets confidence to move toward riskier trades without too much fear of recession from tighter monetary policy.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 2% to $48,011.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira plunged as much as 5.6% to a record low against the dollar on Thursday after the central bank slashed its policy rate in line with an unorthodox economic programme set out by President Tayyip Erdogan.
The lira touched a low of 15.689 after the move, before trimming losses to 15.58 by 1430 GMT. The dollar has more than doubled in value against the lira this year, rattling Turkey's big emerging market economy.
The central bank's 100 basis point rate cut, in line with the forecasts, brought its cumulative easing since September to 500 points, making the local currency even less attractive to investors and savers.
The bank signalled it would pause the easing cycle to monitor its effects in the next three months.
""The central bank's tolerance for lira pain certainly appears much higher this go around with Erdogan now more or less fully in charge of rates policy,"" said Dennis Shen, director of the sovereign and public sector at Scope Ratings.
Erdogan's new economic plan prioritises exports and lending, even though economists and opposition lawmakers have widely criticised the policy as reckless. With inflation soaring above 21%, Turks' budgets are straining and anxieties are building.
The central bank has intervened four times in the currency market in the last two weeks, selling dollars to slow the lira sell-off and eating into its already depleted foreign reserves. 
After the latest cut, market watchers forecast more pain for the lira, which has lost 47% of its value since the start of September alone.
""It is a bold move that will certainly cost Turkey a lot of money, and headache. The kneejerk reaction is a heavy selloff in the lira. I expect the dollar-try to end the year within the 17-19 band,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, Geneva, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
(Graphic: Lira timeline December 2021, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znvnexombpl/Lira%20timeline%20December%202021.PNG) 
MINIMUM WAGE HIKED 50%
According to the central bank, which targets 5% inflation, the price pressure is temporary and necessary to expand economic growth and balance the current account. 
But given the lira's crash, economists predict inflation will jump to near 30% next year due largely to soaring import prices.
After the central bank move, Erdogan announced a huge 50% hike in Turkey's minimum wage to 4,250 lira ($275) per month next year. The dollar value of the 2021 minimum wage has tumbled to $185 from $380 this year.
Marek Drimal at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said the increase ""will fuel inflation pressures further, together with the cumulative impact of the lira's weakness.""
Commenting on the central bank's plan to re-assess its monetary framework in the first quarter he said the best case scenario was probably that it refrains from further cuts.
""That itself wouldn't stop the slide in the lira, as real interest rates will further slump to more negative levels,"" he added.

Erdogan has overhauled the central bank's leadership this year, bringing in like-minded officials to replace orthodox policymakers, leaving its credibility in tatters, analysts say. 
The lira was also hit by the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish decision on Wednesday to end its bond-buying stimulus in March, and project up to three U.S. interest rate increases next year to tackle heated inflation. 
 
"
423,"<span>Dec 16, 2021 08:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -Turkey's central bank cut its policy rate again as expected by 100 basis points to 14% on Thursday despite inflation soaring above 21%, sending the lira to a fresh record low.
Below is the reaction from analysts to the latest move: 
JAKOB CHRISTENSEN, DANSKE BANK
""We expect that even though they are now staying on hold, the fact that inflation will be peaking further, and that the U.S. central bank is in a tightening mode, there's a bias towards a weaker lira."" 
""I am concerned about the inflation outlook in the next two to three months, as the sharp weakening in the lira feeds through... inflation will definitely go above 30%.""
HALUK BURUMCEKCI, BURUMCEKCI CONSULTING
""(The central bank) at least giving the signal that it won't lower interest rates until March is a limited positive development for the Turkish lira... The central bank will most likely try and navigate this period by using macroprudential tools, primarily required reserves, and by resorting to direct forex sales in the market at times. In other words, without raising interest rates.""
""Considering inflation in Turkey will rise to 35% and more mid-next year due to the recent lira outlook, the possible minimum wage hike, significantly deteriorating inflation expectations and the global inflation backdrop we think these measures will not be enough and the bank will have to raise the policy rate in the not-so-distant future.""
JOHN HARDY, SAXO BANK 
""Turkey cuts 100 bps to 14.0% as expected, but still unbelievable""
DENNIS SHEN, SCOPE RATINGS
""The central bank's tolerance for lira pain certainly appears much higher this go around with (President Tayyip) Erdogan now more or less fully in charge of rates policy.""
""The only thing is that even if destabilising lira devaluation is somehow being fully justified away as being good for correction of the current account and raising exports, now that the lira crisis is starting to have an effect on dampening growth conditions – whether such weakening economic growth might force Erdogan to change course ahead of elections by 2023? 
""If so, any 'change of course', however, may not mean a rate hike immediately even if the central bank pauses rate cuts at least over the near future, instead potentially meaning capital controls, more FX swaps with domestic banks and friendly allies, and use of reserves to support lira should lira sell-off pressures continue.""
JASON TUVEY, CAPITAL ECONOMICS
""Today's move provides further evidence, if any were needed, that macro developments are playing little role in the CBRT’s policy formulation.""
""The accompanying statement suggests that the easing cycle will be on pause early next year but, even so, the lira will remain under pressure and capital controls are likely.""

IPEK OZKARDESKAYA, SWISSQUOTE BANK 
""The central bank of Turkey made the decision to pull the rates 100 basis points lower despite a heavy objection from the market. It is a bold move that will certainly cost Turkey a lot of money, and headache. The knee jerk reaction is a heavy selloff in the lira. I expect the USD-TRY to end the year within the 17-19 band.""

Investing.com – Sterling GBP/USD rose 0.8% Thursday against the dollar as Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time since the pandemic struck.
The U.K. central bank raised the Bank Rate by 0.15 percentage points to 0.25% and committed itself to more hikes in coming months as it attempts to bring surging retail inflation back to its target of 2%. The BoE now expects GDP to grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter, slower than anticipated earlier. Yields on the benchmark 2-Year U.K. government bond surged. 
BoE is the first in the G7 to have hiked rates since the pandemic and was prompted by the country’s annual retail inflation hitting 5.1% in November from 3.1% just two months back.   
The central bank said staff expect inflation to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and to peak at around 6% in April 2022, when the cap on regulated household energy prices is raised.
BoE said although the Omicron variant is likely to weigh on near-term activity, its impact on medium-term inflationary pressures is unclear at this stage and a hike was thus warranted at this juncture.
Britain recorded its highest number of new Covid cases Wednesday, with 78,610 new cases. Hospital admissions, however, have not risen in tandem so far, as they have done in previous waves of infection.
Concerns over inflation are now occupying center stage at most central banks. The clearest recognition of this came from the Fed Wednesday which said it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March and hike rates three times in 2022. Consumer prices in U.S. are at a 39-year high, forcing Fed to commit to rate hikes even if recovery falls short of full employment.
Earlier in the day, Norway’s central bank doubled its base rate to 0.5%, its second hike in three months.  The Bank of Mexico is expected to raise its key rate by another 25 basis points to 5.25% later Thursday.

Investing.com – The Turkish Lira USD/TRY plunged to a new low of 15.61 against the dollar after the country's central bank cut its key interest rate, the one-week repo rate, to 14% from 15%.
It was another volatile day for the currency that has halved in value against the greenback in less than a year under the pressure of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's economic policy, which has been characterized by increasingly heavy influence on the central bank. 
Erdogan has gone about replacing officials at the watchdog several times over last two years in his quest for lower rates, adamant that high interest rates were causing inflation rather than limiting it.
Naci Agbal, a key force in pulling the lira back from previous lows, was removed as governor in March. He was replaced by incumbent Sahap Kavcioglu.
The bank has cut its key rate by 500 basis points since September under Erdogan's plan to boost exports, a policy many economists have widely criticized as reckless.
The bank has continued cutting even as inflation has soared above 21%, way above the central bank’s target of 5%.
According to Reuters, economists predict Turkey’s inflation to near 30% next year, due largely to soaring import prices.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Thursday, slipping the day after the Federal Reserve confirmed it would accelerate the tapering of its bond-buying program and ahead of meetings by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.2% to 96.263, retreating from a high of 96.914 in the immediate aftermath of the Fed decision.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.17 and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7176, benefiting from strong employment data even after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe indicated that it was unlikely interest rates will need to rise next year.
The U.S. central bank announced on Wednesday that it was accelerating the tapering of its asset-buying program, aiming to end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March. This will pave the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, a faster pace of monetary policy tightening than previously guided for.
The dollar initially soared on the announcement before quickly retreating, suggesting that markets were positioned for something even more hawkish.
U.S. producer prices rose a hefty 9.6% in the year through November, data showed earlier this week, and that release came hot on the heels of data last week showing consumer inflation running at a near-40% high.
Yet, despite the retreat by the dollar Thursday, “ risks are now clearly tilted towards an earlier start to the Fed’s hiking cycle than our current baseline of June,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “We see more room for the Fed to turn more hawkish next year, and expect more curve flattening and a lower EUR/USD.”
Attention now turns to the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, with both institutions holding policy-setting meetings later in the session.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1303 and GBP/USD was largely flat at 1.3260.
The European Central Bank is expected to confirm that its bond-buying program will end as scheduled in March given the soaring inflation. However, the uncertainty caused by the growth of the Omicron coronavirus variant will likely mean the policymakers will want to assure that interest rate hikes are still some way off.
The Bank of England policymakers, on the other hand, have to decide whether to agree to the first interest rate increase since the pandemic began, weighing a surge in inflation against a surge in coronavirus infections.
Data released earlier in the week showed U.K. inflation jumped to 5.1% in November, more than double the central bank’s target, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned over the weekend that a “tidal wave” of Covid cases is coming.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY soared over 3% to 15.2225, climbing above the 15 level for the first time, ahead of the latest meeting of Turkey’s central bank as traders anticipated another rate cut despite inflation soaring above 21%.
The central bank has cut its key rate by 400 basis points to 15% since September as part of President Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox economic plan program, and is again expected to cut its key rate by 100 basis points to 14% later in the session.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, with the U.S. Federal Reserve tightening its monetary policy in a hawkish pivot.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.13% to 96.360 by 10:39 PM ET (3:39 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 114.11.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.13% to 0.7158, with jobs data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that the employment change was at 366,100, the full employment change at 128,300, and the unemployment rate was 4.6%, in November.
The NZD/USD pair was down 0.19% to 0.6765.
The USD/CNY pair was flat at 6.3675 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3252.
The Fed will accelerate its asset tapering program to $30 billion per month, it said in its policy decision meeting on Wednesday. The central bank also kept its interest rate unchanged but will have three quarter-point interest-rate increases in 2022, another three in 2023, and two more in 2024 to tackle inflation.
“The economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He compared the near-depression situation at the beginning of COVID-19 in 2020 with current rising prices and wages, as well as rapid improvement in the job market.
“It suggests to me that markets were positioned for the Fed being more hawkish than survey expectations would have you believe. Also, that risk assets took the latest pivot so well reinforces the fact that the U.S. dollar and risk sentiment seem to be negatively correlated,” NAB head of FX strategy Ray Atrill told Reuters.
Investors are now looking to policy decisions from the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BOE) later in the day, while that of the Bank of Japan will come on Friday.
“To some extent, the reaction to the Fed might have to wait for what the ECB does, because we're expecting the contrast between the ECB's disposition and the Fed's will be laid bare later tonight and that could probably be a catalyst for the U.S. dollar to push through the highs overnight,” said Atrill.
The ECB is set to end their Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, but investors are still betting that the central bank will not hike interest rates just yet.
The BOE is attempting to tackle inflation and calm concerns about the fast-spreading omicron variant. U.K. data on Wednesday showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 5.1% year-on-year in November, its highest level in a decade. The CPI grew 0.7% month-on-month."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders embraced and then turned way from the U.S. dollar on Wednesday as initial enthusiasm for higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve turned into confidence to take more risk with stocks and other currencies.
The U.S. dollar index rose as much as 0.3% right after the Fed issued a new statement on monetary policy that paved the way for three one-quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases next year.
But by the time Fed Chair Jerome Powell finished a news conference 90 minutes later, stocks were climbing to near record levels and dollar index was down 0.2%.
""That was a catalyst to move into some of the riskier currencies, like the euro, like sterling,"" said Joseph Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
Other risk-on currencies, such as the dollars of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, also gained against the dollar, while the Japanese yen, seen as safer haven, lost. 
""Wall Street is somewhat comforted that the Fed's not on autopilot raising rates. It's going to keep close tabs on the coronavirus and if it needs to go slower it will,"" Manimbo said.
Attention now turns to meetings on Thursday of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The banks are trying to balance the need to support economies threatened by the coronavirus with the need to withdraw easy money to cool inflation. 
The greenback has been bolstered recently by expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise faster than those in other countries. The dollar index, even after Wednesday's up-and-down, was about 0.6% short of its highest level in more than a year.
The euro and British pound each rose about 0.3% against the dollar. The euro traded at $1.1292 and the pound at $1.3262 at 4:29 p.m. EST (2129 GMT).
The Australian dollar gained 1% to $0.7173 and the kiwi rose 0.6% to $0.6782.
Versus the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.4% to 114.0200.
Cryptocurrency bitcoin was up 2% to $49,225.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble drifted lower on Wednesday, slipping past 74 versus the dollar for the first time in a week as investors focused on central bank meetings this week, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Russia. 
By 1722 GMT, the rouble was 0.7% weaker against the dollar at 74.33, its weakest since Dec. 7. It had lost 0.7% to trade at 83.67 versus the euro.
The dollar was holding onto recent gains as investors looked towards a pivotal U.S. Fed policy meeting to see if it would reinforce growing market expectations for earlier and additional interest rate rises next year.
Russian assets have come under pressure from rising East-West tensions in recent weeks, with the United States and Western capitals voicing fears over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine.
""Geopolitical noise"" related to Ukraine remains an important factor for the rouble, but it could firm towards 72-73 versus the dollar in the near term due to month-end taxes that prompt export-focused companies to convert FX revenues to meet local liabilities, said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko Invest.
The rouble could also get support from the central bank that is expected to raise interest rates on Friday by a hefty 100 basis points as inflation hovers near its highest since early 2016. 
""The high level of real rates and comfortable commodity prices will support the rouble in 2022,"" VTB Capital Investment said in a note. It revised its end-2022 forecast for the dollar-rouble pair to 68 from 70, citing tighter central bank monetary policy and expected higher oil prices. 
Russian stock indexes were mixed.
The dollar-denominated RTS was down 0.5% at 1,541.0 points. The rouble-based MOEX was up 0.1% at 3,621.8 points, though still near its lowest level since April of 3,532.29 touched on Tuesday.

""Russian stocks now appear to be oversold, given their solid fundamentals, and we see upside even in a bear case pandemic scenario,"" Sinara bank analysts said in a note.

The lira dipped as far as 14.75 versus the U.S. currency, closing in on the record low of 14.99 which it hit on Monday. At 1312 GMT, it stood at 14.70, more than 49% weaker than at the end of last year.
Investors fear the Federal Reserve might take a more hawkish stance than previously expected when it meets on Wednesday, outlining plans for tightening policy and hiking interest rates next year.
Turkey's central bank is expected to cut its policy rate by 100 basis points on Thursday despite the lira slump and soaring inflation as President Tayyip Erdogan exerts pressure on it to boost growth ahead of 2023 elections.
It has cut its key rate by 400 basis points to 15% since September under Erdogan's plan to prioritise exports and lending, even though economists regard the move as reckless.
The bank has intervened in the forex market four times in the last two weeks, selling dollars to slow the sell-off. It will announce its rates decision at 1100 GMT on Thursday.

The lira slide is aggravating inflation, which rose to a three-year high of 21.3% last month. It is also eroding Turks' earnings and fuelling discontent among workers.
Healthcare unions representing more than 250,000 health sector workers went on a one-day strike on Wednesday, protesting what they say are poor wages and harsh working conditions.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, but retained underlying strength ahead of the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to reinforce expectations of interest rate hikes next year. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.1% to 96.450, not far removed from last week's 96.954 high. It has gained around 0.5% this week.
USD/JPY edged lower to 113.69, EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1271, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7122.
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3245, gaining after U.K. consumer price inflation surged to an annual rate of 5.1% in November, its highest since September 2011, raising the pressure on the Bank of England ahead of Thursday’s policy-setting meeting.
The pound has been under pressure as Britain grapples with rising cases of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus. Political uncertainty is also starting to make itself felt, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s authority undermined by a revolt within his party over the imposition of new restrictions.
However, the focus Wednesday is on the Federal Reserve, as the U.S. central bank wraps up its latest two-day policy-setting meeting later in the session.
Investors are expecting the Fed to accelerate the tapering of its bond buying program and probably moving up its projections for interest rate rises.
Currently, markets are expecting the Fed to wrap up bond-buying around March and then proceed with one or maybe two rate hikes in 2022.
“With the Fed having already met its average inflation goal, and the labour market likely at full employment, we judge that the Fed will start to hike the fed funds rate in June 2022,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note. “In total, we expect the Fed to raise the fed funds rate three times in both 2022 and 2023.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY traded 0.1% lower at 6.3642, after data released earlier Wednesday showed that Chinese industrial production grew 3.8% year-on-year in November, an improvement from the previous month’s 3.5% growth. 
Retail sales also grew 3.9% year-on-year, lower than October’s 4.9% growth, with Covid-19 restrictions weighing on consumer spending.
USD/TRY rose 1.8% to 14.6455, with the Turkish lira continuing to slide to record lows on concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox economic policy and prospects for another interest rate cut this week.
The lira slump has been driven by the Turkish Central Bank's 400-basis-point rate cuts since September, while the Federal Reserve looks set to hike interest rates in the not too distant future.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, but moves were small as investors bet on the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates quicker than expected in 2022 from its policy meeting later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 96.520 by 10:28 PM ET (3:28 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 113.74.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.7104 while the NZD/USD pair was down 0.25% to 0.6728.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.3647. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 3.8% year-on-year, fixed asset investment grew 5.2% year-on-year, and retail sales grew 3.9% year-on-year in November.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3227.
Around 20 key central banks will hand down their policy decisions throughout the week, with the Fed handing down its policy decision later in the day.
Currency markets were “taking a tiny break from the omicron COVID-19 variant” despite it “very much bubbling away in the background... it's hard for it to be the dominant focus when you’ve got the Fed, and the Bank of England and European Central Bank lining up to make policy decisions,” CBA currency analyst Kim Mundy told Reuters.
She added that investors were watching the Fed meeting for two reasons, firstly whether the central bank will accelerate asset tapering and secondly whether it will bring forward their projections for interest rate rises, known as ""dot plots"".
They are betting the Fed will complete asset tapering between $25 billion-$30 billion per month, from $15 billion currently, by March 2022. They also predict one or two interest rate hikes in the same year.
A figure at the lower end of that range could cause some short-term dollar weakness, said Mundy.
The Bank of England (BOE) will hand down its policy decision on Thursday. The BOE is expected to keep interest rates steady, according to a Reuters poll, with the U.K. reporting the first death linked to omicron on Monday, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The European Central Bank will also hand down its policy decision on Thursday, followed by the Bank of Japan a day later."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose again on Tuesday after rebounding from a dip that nearly wiped out its gains from the day before as markets jostled with the different paths major central banks are choosing between fighting inflation or the economic drag of the pandemic.
The U.S. dollar index measuring the currency against major peers was up 0.2% at 96.5520 in afternoon trading in New York after having earlier given up much of its Monday gain of 0.3%.
The rebound came largely at the euro's expense as markets digested another report of unexpectedly high U.S. inflation that could push American interest rates much higher and sooner than in Europe. 
The dollar's safe-haven appeal also improved as stock indexes fell in the United States and in Europe, and as oil dropped on a prediction that the spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus will dent global demand.
The euro was down more than 0.2% at $1.1256, near a one-week low at 3:39 p.m. ET (2039 GMT).. 
The contrast between the monetary policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank is driving the euro-dollar exchange rate, said Ron Simpson, global currency analyst at Action Economics in Safety Harbor, Florida.
The Fed will update its policy on Wednesday and the ECB on Thursday.
""It's like there's no end in sight to the dovishness for the ECB, whereas it seems like every meeting the Fed is getting a little more hawkish,"" said Simpson.
The Fed is expected to indicate on Wednesday that it will quicken its taper from bond buying. That would open the door sooner for increases in overnight lending rates. 
The dollar's gain on Tuesday was likely given an extra lift by covering of dollar-short positions after the inflation report and ahead of the two central bank meetings, he added. ""I don't think it was so much a matter of initial fresh, long-dollar positions.""
The latest sign of higher U.S. inflation came earlier on Tuesday with data showing that producer prices increased more than expected as supply constraints persisted. The data showed the biggest annual gain in at least 11 years.
""It's clear the Fed needs to react to higher inflation,"" said David Riley, chief investment strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""It's an environment where it's very hard not to be positive on the U.S. dollar.""
Markets have been pricing for the Fed to wrap up bond-buying around March and proceed with rate hikes. 
The British pound gained 0.1% to $1.3224 after data showed employers hired a record number of staff in November. 
The Japanese yen lost ground, with the dollar trading at 113.73 yen.
Commodity-associated currencies, including the Australian and Canadian dollar, lost to the greenback as Brent crude prices dropped toward $73 a barrel. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the Omicron coronavirus variant is set to dent the global demand recovery.
The tension between the dollar and the euro that mirrors Fed and ECB choices is dramatically different from the start of the pandemic when central banks tended to make similar moves. 
The Fed and ECB meetings headline a string of policy decisions this week that also will come from the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan and others.
While money markets are pricing good odds on a Fed rate hike by June, no moves are expected anytime soon from the ECB, BOJ or SNB. And, the Omicron threat could force the BoE to postpone a rate hike.
Cryptocurrency bitcoin was up 2% at $47,789 at 2039 GMT, but remains some 30% below record highs reached in early November.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's central bank said on Tuesday it was working to ensure the stability of the afghani, a day after the currency lost almost 12% of its value against the dollar in a matter of hours amid a deepening economic crisis and soaring inflation.
The abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid following the Taliban victory in August has left Afghanistan's fragile economy on the brink of collapse, with prices for food, fuel and other basic staples rising rapidly out of reach for many.
The central bank issued a statement saying that it had held a number of meetings with foreign exchange dealers, representatives of commercial banks and the business sector to halt the fall in the afghani.
""Based on its strategic planning policies, Da Afghanistan Bank has always tried to avoid volatility that could be harmful to the purchasing power of the people,"" it said.
A meeting of the council of ministers also instructed the government's economic commission to ""take urgent steps to ensure the stability of the afghani"", Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.
The crisis has accelerated sharply in recent days. On Monday the afghani, which traded at around 77 to the dollar before the fall of Kabul and at 97 a week ago, dropped from 112 to the dollar in the morning at Kabul's Sarai Shazada money market to 125 by the afternoon.
On Tuesday it had recovered slightly and was being quoted at around 114-115 following the central bank move.
""The Islamic Emirate said it would bring the dollar down and issue dollars on the market and it's changing now,"" a dealer at Sarai Shahzada said, using the name for the new Taliban government.
RISING PRICES
However the pressure on the afghani has already had a stark impact on the prices of daily necessities in an economy where unemployment is widespread and where even many in work have not been paid in months.
Within the space of a week, wholesalers said the price of a 50 kg (110 lbs) sack of flour had risen by between 20-40% to between 2,800-3,200 afghani, from 2,300 a week ago, with the price of sugar up by a third and rice up by more than 15%.
Surveys by the World Food Programme showed an estimated 98% of Afghans were not eating enough, with seven-in-10 families resorting to borrowing food,
Starved of dollars that used to be physically shipped into Afghanistan, and cut off from the world financial system by the fear of U.S. sanctions, the banking system is only partially functional and some $9 billion in central bank reserves remain blocked outside the country.
Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department formalised guidance allowing personal remittances to Afghanistan and protecting senders and financial institutions from U.S. sanctions, offering some hope to those with relatives outside the country.

But efforts to bring in cash have been hampered by international reluctance to provide funds to the Taliban government, which is still not officially recognised by any other country.
Longer term, business people said prospects were hampered by the structural weakness in an economy whose main exports - apart from illegal narcotics - were dried fruit and handmade carpets, and the lack of a clear economic plan from the new government.

Tilman Kolb of the UBS chief investment office team sent out a memo last Thursday announcing the cessation in coverage, adding that previous exchange rate forecasts and hedging advice should not be relied upon. 
UBS is the largest wealth manager globally and its Global Wealth Management unit had invested assets of $3.2 trillion as of the third quarter 2021.

Turkey's lira has weakened nearly 50% against the dollar this year with pressure on the currency sharply accelerating since September, when the central bank kicked off an easing cycle that saw its benchmark slashed by 400 basis points despite quickening inflation.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's lira slid as much as 4% on Tuesday in further volatile trade after tumbling to all-time lows a day earlier on concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan's risky new economic policy and prospects for another interest rate cut this week. 
The ailing currency, which has lost almost half of its value against the dollar this year, touched 14.4 to the dollar before trimming losses to 14.3450 by 1042 GMT. 
On Monday, the lira crashed as much as 7% to a record near 15 before whip-sawing back after the central bank (TCMB) intervened for the fourth time in two weeks to prop it up.
""When we look at yesterday's trades we see a rise in volumes with strong forex demand from locals,"" said a forex trader at one bank.
""The concern that the TCMB will continue with interest rate cuts is triggering an expectation of continued lira losses, so it is difficult to make an optimistic forecast for the lira.""
The domestic woes come against a backdrop of global market unease. The dollar has firmed ahead of a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, with investors eyeing the possibility that it will start to raise interest rates in 2022.
The lira slump has been driven by the Turkish Central Bank's 400-basis-point rate cuts since September, aggressive monetary easing carried out under pressure from Erdogan. 
With Turks' earnings being sharply eroded, Erdogan held talks with Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu, Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati and state bank heads on Monday, but no official announcements were made following the talks.
Erdogan has repeatedly advocated for rate cuts as he promotes a new economic plan prioritising growth, credit, production and exports, despite widespread criticism of the policy from economists and opposition politicians.
With the lira selloff straining the existing budget with pending wage hikes and other new expenditures, the government is soon expected to present to parliament an additional budget for next year, two officials said.
Last week, the central bank acted to keep the lira below 14, but abandoned that level on Monday. Depreciation fuels inflation in the big emerging market economy that depends heavily on imports.
Despite inflation jumping to 21.3% last month, the bank is expected to cut the rate by another 100 basis points on Thursday, according to a Reuters poll.

The forex market interventions are an additional risk for a central bank that is not only easing policy but also has depleted foreign reserves.
Three traders estimated the central bank sold $2-2.5 billion dollars in interventions on Monday alone. According to the calculations of bankers analysing official data, sales worth $2.5 billion were carried out in the first three efforts last week.

Investing.com - The dollar climbed to a one-week high Tuesday ahead of the start of a Federal Reserve meeting that is expected to take a hawkish turn.
Concerns over the Omicron Covid variant also boosted safe havens at the expense of higher-yielding currencies.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.1% to 96.365, having climbed as high as 96.454 for the first time since Dec. 7.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 113.63, EUR/USD slipped 0.1% to 1.1275, just above a new one-week low of 1.1260 hit overnight, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD slipped 0.1% to 0.7123.
GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3211, close to the one-year low of 1.3161 reached last week on growing worries over the Omicron variant, but helped by the U.K. claimant count falling almost 50,000 in November, a stronger number than expected.
Optimism surrounding the Omicron variant is on the wane Tuesday, the day after the U.K. announced its first death from this version of the Covid-19 virus.
Additionally, researchers from the University of Oxford announced findings that two doses of current vaccines do not induce enough neutralising antibodies against Omicron, emphasising the importance of booster programs.
This has helped the safe haven currencies, like the U.S. dollar, push higher Tuesday. However, the main focus is on the Federal Reserve, which starts its two-day policy-setting meeting later Tuesday.
The Fed is widely expected to announce a faster tapering of asset purchases this week, and thus potentially an earlier start to rate hikes, particularly after U.S. consumer prices posted their largest annual gain since 1982 on Friday.
“We are also particularly interested in the Fed Dot Plots, which we believe turned the bearish dollar trend around in June this year,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Assuming the Fed does shift to a median expectation of two hikes in 2022, we would expect U.S. money market rates to push higher again, taking the dollar with it.”
Money markets currently price in a rate hike by June next year, with another as early as November.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY traded flat at 6.3628, with the yuan remaining near a three-year high, at levels that are starting to frustrate the Chinese authorities.
The People’s Bank of China reduced the reserve requirement ratio for banks earlier this month, sparking speculation it would start cutting interest rates as well.  
China should lower interest rates and boost infrastructure investment to ensure the economy will grow by at least 5% next year, an influential Chinese think tank said Monday.
Elsewhere in emerging markets, USD/TRY rose 3% to 14.2010, above the 14 level that prompted the Turkish central bank to intervene on Monday, for the fourth time in two weeks, as traders dumped the currency on prospects of another rate cut given President Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox policy stance.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia as expectations of interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and concerns over the omicron COVID-19 variant rise.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.12% to $96.390 by 12:05 AM ET (5:05 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 113.59.
The AUD/USD pair went down 0.34% to 0.7104 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.6744.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.3653 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3202.
The Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan, are among around 20 central banks handing down their respective policy decisions this week.
The Fed will start its two-day monetary policy meeting later in the day and hand down the policy decision on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to quicken its asset tapering program and investors will look for clues about the timing of interest rate hikes in 2022.
Investors are now anticipating an interest rate hike by June in 2022, with another hike as early as November of that year.
“That leaves a very high bar for the Fed to deliver a ‘hawkish surprise’,” Westpac analysts said in a note.
“But even if the Fed merely matches elevated expectations, they are still streets ahead of the ECB, who is looking for ways to maintain accommodation” after its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) is due to end in March 2022, the note added.
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan will hand its down a day later.
The European Central Bank is expected to confirm its exit from EUR1.85 trillion ($2.08 trillion) pandemic emergency stimulus scheme in March 2022 during the meeting.
Meanwhile, with the U.K. reporting its first death linked to an omicron case according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the probability of an interest rate hike from the Bank of England is diminishing. In Asia Pacific, China reported its first imported case of omicron infection.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Monday ahead of a slew of central bank meetings this week led by the Federal Reserve, with investors expecting the U.S. central bank to announce it will wrap up its bond purchases sooner than expected, as they look for clues on timing of interest rate increases next year.
Aside from the Fed, the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, and Norges Bank, among others, all have policy decisions in the next few days. 
The euro fell, as it is seen as vulnerable to a U.S. rate hike given expectations that the Fed will tighten policy more quickly than the dovish ECB.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was up 0.2% at 96.297. The euro was down 0.2% at $1.1291.
Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.1% at 113.49 yen.
""The market has priced in the Fed concluding its bond tapering in Q1 and expects the central bank to put a rate hike firmly on the table by early summer,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""Whether the dollar has any juice left to rally could hinge on how many times the Fed expects to raise rates next year. A Fed that signals little tolerance for higher inflation would strike a resoundingly hawkish note and likely keep the dollar biased higher,"" he added.
Some analysts, however, believe the dollar's march higher in recent weeks has already factored in many of its possible sources of strength in the short term.
That said, if the Fed forecasts 2022 inflation rates above 3 percent, or if the 2023 projection jumps, ""dollar bulls will stampede,"" noted Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""If the dots show more than two rate hikes in 2022, the front-end of the yield curve will rise, taking the greenback with it.""
The pound dipped 0.4% to $1.3216 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday Britain faced an Omicron ""tidal wave."" On Monday he said at least one person has died in the UK due to the latest variant.
The Swiss franc was down versus the dollar, which was last up 0.1% at 0.9219 francs, while the euro was down 0.1% at 1.0409 francs.
Moves in the franc came as the Swiss National Bank's sight deposits rose last week by their highest amount in seven months, indicating policymakers are taking the first steps to battle a rise in the value of the franc against major rivals, particularly the euro.
The SNB, which has been battling the appreciation of the franc since the start of the pandemic, is due to make its latest interest rate decision on Thursday.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell to a two-week low of $45,750 and was last down 7.2% at $46,500, after hitting levels above $50,000 on Sunday. Ether, the token linked to the Ethereum blockchain, dropped 9.8% to $3,747.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's lira crashed as much as 7% to a record near 15 to the dollar on Monday before whip-sawing back after the central bank intervened, gripped by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's risky new economic policy and prospects of another rate cut. 
The central bank said it entered the market to sell dollars for the fourth time in two weeks, triggering the rebound after the currency had touched 14.99 - where it was worth just half its value at the beginning of the year. 
The bank moved to keep the lira below 14 last week but abandoned that level on Monday. Depreciation fuels inflation in the big emerging market economy that depends heavily on imports, and which is rattled after 400 basis points of interest-rate cuts since September. 
The interventions are an additional risk for a central bank that is not only easing policy in the face of rising inflation, but that also has had depleted foreign reserves. 
According to calculations of bankers analysing official data, the central bank sold $1.5-2 billion in dollars on Monday alone, after sales worth $2.5 billion in the first three efforts. 
By 1547 GMT, the lira had trimmed losses in thin market trading to 13.79 - its strongest point on the day, but still down 31% since the beginning of last month. 
""The central bank has continued to intervene to soften the blow but this is akin to putting a band-aid on a gaping wound,"" said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
In response to the market turmoil - which has upended Turks' economic lives - Erdogan held talks with Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu, Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati and the heads of state banks in Istanbul, sources told Reuters.
Any decisions from the meeting were not clear and no announcements had been made. 
OUTLOOK REVISED TO NEGATIVE
The central bank, under pressure from Erdogan, is expected to cut its policy rate by 100 basis points to 14% this week, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, despite inflation soaring to 21.3% last month. 
Kavcioglu has said boosting the current account, which showed a surplus of $3.156 billion in October, was key to price and lira stability. But many analysts are sceptical.
""We doubt that either intervention or a balanced current account will be effective in stabilising the currency,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. 
The central bank's relatively thin reserves means interventions could be counter-productive, it added.
Data last week showed the central bank's net international reserves dipping to $22.47 billion. Reserves are sharply negative once outstanding swap transactions of $45.571 billion are deducted.
Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds dropped, with the 2034 issue down 0.8 cents, according to Tradeweb data.
The lira crash has sharply eroded Turks' earnings, fuelling poverty and leading to lines of people waiting to buy cheap bread as the price of goods surges. Lawmakers have brawled amid rising tensions in parliament as the opposition slammed government handling of the economy.
Late on Friday, ratings agency S&P affirmed Turkey's long-term foreign currency rating at ""B+"" and revised its outlook to negative on uncertain policy and rising external risks.
Turkey's 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) nudged 1 basis point higher to a one-week high of 503 basis points, according to IHS Markit data.
Erdogan has repeatedly advocated for rate cuts as he promotes a new economic plan prioritising economic growth, credit, production and exports, despite widespread criticism of the policy from economists and opposition politicians.

""There is an element of concern about what the economic plan is, and how closely aligned it would be to engaging with the private sector. There is a lack of clarity around that,"" said Khush Choksy, the U.S. Chamber's senior vice president for international development and for the Middle East and Turkey.
""U.S. companies do have questions about how Turkey will handle the current short-term crisis and get on to the path of long-term growth that it enjoyed for a long period,"" told Reuters.

Investing.com - The dollar inched higher in early European trade Monday at the start of a week that includes a number of central bank meetings, including the Federal Reserve, while concerns over the Omicron Covid variant remain.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.2% to 96.243.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 113.52, EUR/USD slipped 0.2% to 1.1286, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD slipped 0.2% to 0.7154.
GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.3230 after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Sunday that Britain faces a ""tidal wave"" of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus, as he accelerated the country’s booster rollout program to try and contain its damage.
The Bank of England is one of the major central banks due to hold policy-setting meetings this week, and these new virus worries are expected to prompt the central bank to opt for caution, pushing back its first rate increase since the pandemic into 2022.
There are also meetings scheduled from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, but it’s the Federal Reserve’s two-day gathering, concluding on Wednesday, which is attracting the most attention.
The Fed is widely expected to announce a faster tapering of asset buying this week, and thus an earlier start to rate hikes, particularly after Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent hawkish speech to Congress and with U.S. consumer prices posting their largest annual gain since 1982 on Friday.
“The Fed is about to signal that it needs to accelerate its tapering process, but market pricing could still become more aggressive,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “The ECB will move more slowly. The Chinese authorities have also become more worried about the growth outlook.”
The market is already pricing in a U.S. rate hike of 25 basis points by May, and a move by the Fed to speed up the ending of its bond-buying program is likely to support the dollar, particularly versus currencies whose central banks will likely be slower to tighten.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3629, with the yuan near a three-year high, even as Chinese authorities set its reference rate at a slightly weaker-than-expected level.
The People's Bank of China has announced a hike in the foreign exchange reserve requirement ratio by 200 basis points to 9% from 7% from Dec. 15.
USD/TRY rose 3.2% to 14.3220, the Turkish central bank failing to stop the lira weakening despite intervening late last week in the foreign exchange market for the third time this month.
The S&P rating agency lowered the outlook on Turkey’s sovereign credit rating to negative on Friday, citing the lira’s recent weakening and rising inflation.

442,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 02:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Avoiding excess yuan appreciation should be one of China's priorities in managing market expectations and regulations, a former senior official at the country's foreign exchange regulator has said.
A challenge for exchange rate fluctuations or flexibility is that the currency could overshoot, deviating from its economic fundamentals, said Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International and the former head of the Balance of Payments department of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), writing in a social media post over the weekend.
""Market supply and demand were the dominant force driving the yuan rally this year, while orderly expanding domestic FX purchases and outbound investment channels should be the key to stabilising the currency,"" he said.
The Chinese yuan has been one of the best-performing Asian currencies this year, rising about 3% against a strengthening U.S. dollar. In trade-weighted terms, the yuan is at its strongest since late 2015.
""The soaring multilateral yuan exchange rate has prompted concerns over competitiveness,"" Guan said.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced a hike in the foreign exchange reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 200 basis points (bps) to 9% from 7% from Dec. 15, thereby requiring financial institutions to hold an additional $20 billion in foreign exchange in reserve at the central bank.
The second hike in the FX reserve requirement ratio this year has convinced some market participants that authorities are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the yuan's rapid appreciation.
""The PBOC's decision to hike FX deposit RRR has already sent an obvious signal that it doesn't want too rapid a yuan appreciation,"" said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura.
""The yuan is overvalued, and I think the exceptionally strong yuan is not good for exports.""
Lu said the huge capital inflows from surging trade and current account surpluses were a challenge for the yuan and the central bank's reluctance to purchase foreign currency from commercial banks had driven the yuan even higher.

Those surpluses and investment flows had pushed foreign cash deposits at China's banks to $1.02 trillion by the end of November.
Nomura expects the authorities to roll out measures to stabilise exports while also absorbing dollar deposits from the banks so as to relieve the pressure on the yuan and also supplement cash balances in the financial system.

The lira weakened as much as 1.2% on Monday to trade at 14.0512 per dollar at 9:40 a.m. in Istanbul.
The currency has dropped 30% against the dollar since late October as the Turkish central bank cut interest rates despite accelerating inflation, a key driver for the revision to its rating outlook cited by the S&P on Friday.

Markets have been volatile since omicron was discovered, due to concerns about its impact on economic recovery. However, reports that the variant may not be as bad as feared saw investors retreat from safe-haven assets last week.
""All I want for Christmas is clarity,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Barclays analysts titled a research note.
The Fed kicks off the central bank’s meetings on Wednesday, with six of the G10 central banks and a number of emerging-market central banks due to meet throughout the week.

The Fed is expected to accelerate its asset tapering, and potentially speed up interest rate hikes. Investors now see a more than 50% chance of an interest rate hike by May 2022, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch program.

(Reuters) - The dollar lost some ground on Friday after U.S. consumer prices increased roughly in line with expectations in November as investors, who had been bracing for much higher inflation, bet that the actual number would not change the pace of interest rate hikes.
Labor Department data showed an increasing consumer price index (CPI) as cost of goods and services rose broadly amid supply constraints for the largest annual gain since 1982.
The CPI rose 0.8% last month after surging 0.9% in October while in the 12 months through November, it rose 6.8%, following a 6.2% advance in October. this compared with a 0.7% forecast from economists polled by Reuters.
""I'd characterize the CPI reading as right on expectations but the Forex market had positioned for a higher reading,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.
""The FX market has been extremely long US dollars for several months so with this number coming in benign we're almost out of events that could push the dollar materially higher before year-end,"" he said, noting that next week's FOMC meeting and Powell's speech following the meeting are likely the last dollar catalyst events this year. 
""Normally FX investors scale back positions for year end ...
today's proce action where the dollar fell on neutral news is probably a prelude to that,"" Anderson said.
Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar went into negative territory after the news and while it regained enough ground to turn positive it was still below its pre-CPI level. the index was last up 0.04% at 96.233.
Sterling gained some ground agaist the dollar after the day before paring gains to last trade down 0.09% at $1.3210.
The euro was down 0.04% at $1.1289.
Elsewhere, China's yuan fell in onshore and offshore markets after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) raised FX reserve requirements for the second time since June, and was further pressured when the central bank set its trading band midpoint weaker than expected.

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trade Friday ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data, which could influence Federal Reserve monetary policy thinking into the new year.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was flat at 96.263, edging toward its seventh consecutive weekly rise.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 113.59, EUR/USD slipped 0.1% to 1.1288, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged higher to 0.7151.
GBP/USD was flat at 1.3222, even after data showed the U.K. economy grew less than forecast in October, as traders kept their powder dry ahead of the U.S. inflation release.
U.K. gross domestic product grew just 0.1% from September, way below the forecast growth of 0.4%. This left the economy 0.5% smaller than in February 2020, before the pandemic struck, and further weakness looks likely given that the population faces new restrictions to contain the new strain of the Covid-19 virus.
U.S. consumer prices are due for release at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and economists are looking for a monthly gain of 0.7%, translating into annual price gains of 6.8%, the largest year on year increase since 1980.
This release will be seen as a prelude to next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve, and expectations are running high that the central bank will outline a faster tapering of its bond-buying program, pointing to sooner interest rate rises, especially after Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent Congressional testimony.
Powell stated that it was time to retire the phrase ‘transitory’ while talking about high U.S. inflation, and also suggested it was appropriate to consider wrapping up net asset purchases a few months sooner than previously guided.
“The timing of his hawkish comments was interesting, and suggests that the Fed is more concerned about the inflationary consequences of the latest virus developments than their impact on growth,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3664, with the yuan rebounding to a certain extent after recording its sharpest drop in months on Thursday when the People's Bank of China raised FX reserve requirements for the second time since June, moving to halt the currency’s recent rally.
USD/HUF rose 0.2% to 323.70 after Hungary’s central bank raised interest rates for a fifth time in less than a month on Thursday, hiking its one-week deposit rate by 20 basis points to 3.3%, in an attempt to rein in surging inflation.

The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7154 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.6800.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3226.
The U.S. currency is moving towards its seventh consecutive weekly rise ahead of the U.S. data, including the consumer price index (CPI) and due later in the day.
""Inflation is going accelerate,"" said RBC Capital Markets chief U.S. economist Tom Porcelli, who predicts that the annual pace will rise to push near 7% in early 2022.
""As a result, we think that combination means a hike in March 2022 is very possible... the market is pricing in about a 40% chance of that, but we now think it's a bit higher. It's probably closer to a coin flip now,” he added.
Investors also await policy decisions from the Fed, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan next week.
""Judging by the way the dollar is trading... I'd argue traders are positioning for a higher CPI print which cements a view that the Fed will increase the pace of tapering its quantitative easing program,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
""While form suggests we get a beat, we obviously can't dismiss a poor number, and of course an inline print. I think if we get 6.4% or below then AUD/USD should fly.""
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China raised FX reserve requirements for the second time since June 2021, dunking the yuan about half a percent in offshore trade on Thursday.
The move will also encourage yuan selling and cool a rally that has lifted the Chinese currency by more than 2% against the dollar since late July 2021. ""It also sent a clear signal on PBOC's discomfort on the rapid and continued appreciation of the currency,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Thursday as increased restrictions in parts of the world to contain the spread of COVID-19, including the new Omicron variant, tempered investors' appetite for riskier currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index was up 0.3% at 96.233.
""We are seeing some caution in the markets because of Omicron. I think the worry that it would be worse than Delta has waned but the reports about how easily transmissible the strain is have caused extra caution,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at FX payments firm Tempus Inc.
""There are worries about how governments could react, and the UK's 'Plan B' is a great example.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday imposed tougher COVID-19 restrictions in England, ordering people to work from home, wear masks in public places and use vaccine passes to slow the spread of the new variant.
Johnson said Omicron was spreading rapidly and he had no choice but to move to ""Plan B"" while a vaccine booster program is accelerated.
""Risk is off for the first time this week so the greenback is up against the entire G10 except for the safe-haven yen,"" Doyle said.
The dollar was 0.2% lower against the Japanese yen.
The greenback was supported by data that showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than 52 years last week as labor market conditions continued to tighten amid an acute shortage of workers. 
Investors were also awaiting U.S. inflation data on Friday that could set the tone for the Federal Reserve's strategy on interest rate hikes.
""I think we are seeing some position-squaring ahead of the CPI data tomorrow and the various central bank meetings next week,"" Doyle said.
With the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England among those meeting to discuss monetary policy next week, investors will be watching for forward guidance, especially from the Fed. Some analysts expect a faster unwinding of pandemic-era stimulus plans.
On Thursday, China's yuan pulled back from a 3-1/2-year high and was set for its biggest drop in more than four months after the central bank raised foreign currency reserve requirements.

The pound held steady, just above a 2021 low hit on Wednesday when the ""Plan B"" restrictions were announced. 
Bitcoin lost 6.1% to $47,562.34, struggling to find a footing after rebounding from a sharp weekend plunge.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Thursday, but remained on the back foot as risk appetite remained strong on positive news surrounding the likely economic damage caused by the Omicron Covid variant.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.2% to 96.037, some way below the year’s high of approaching 97 seen at the end of November.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 113.53, EUR/USD slipped 0.2% to 1.1324, just below a one-week high, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD gained 0.1% to 0.7176, just off its weekly high.
GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3203, after falling to a 2021 low on Wednesday after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher Covid-19 restrictions in England, ordering people to work from home and wear masks in public places. Social gatherings will still be allowed, however. It has been politically impossible to restrict them due to public outrtage over a party held last Christmas by staff at 10 Downing Street in defiance of the government's own social distancing rules 
Despite this news out of England, risk-friendly currencies have seen demand this week following indications that the worst fears associated with the new Covid variant may not be realised.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said on Wednesday that three doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, developed with BioNTech, neutralised the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test, indicating that booster shots could be key to protection against infection.
""We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation, and there's no reason to expect that it wouldn't be so"" for Omicron, Mike Ryan, the World Health Organisation's emergencies director said Wednesday.
With the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant beginning to dissipate, attention is turning back to central banks and how they tackle the conflict between confronting high inflation and ensuring growth continues.
The Federal Reserve is still widely expected to announce it will accelerate tapering of its bond-buying program at its meeting next week, but last week’s nonfarm payrolls release disappointed.
Traders will likely keep a watchful eye on the release of the latest weekly U.S. jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), the most up-to-date gauge of the strength of the country’s labor market.
Elsewhere, USD/CAD rose 0.1% to 1.2659 after the Bank of Canada held its key overnight interest rate at 0.25% on Wednesday, as expected, and maintained its guidance that a first hike could come as soon as April 2022.
USD/PLN rose 0.1% to 4.0680 after Poland’s central bank raised its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.75%, as it battles the fastest inflation in two decades.     
USD/CNY was largely unchanged at 6.3435 after the People’s Bank of China tried to rein in its buoyant currency, setting its reference rate for the yuan at a weaker-than-expected level against the dollar.
USD/HUF rose 0.1% to 322.22 ahead of Thursday’s meeting of Hungary’s central bank, which is expected to deliver its fifth interest rate hike in a month in an attempt to combat inflation running at the fastest pace in 14 years."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, even as fears about the new omicron COVID-19 variant subsided.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.13% to 96.005 by 12:12 AM ET (5:12 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.04% to 113.61.
The AUD/USD pair and the NZD/USD inched up 0.01% to 0.7172 and 0.6809 respectively.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3440, with Chinese data showing that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 2.3% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month in November. The producer price index grew 12.9% year on year.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3207.
Omicron’s discovery roiled markets last and drove investors towards safe-haven assets. However, these fears are subsiding and increasing investors’ risk appetites.
Initial data showed that a three-short course of the BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) and  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine neutralized omicron.
""It's very 'virus-on' 'virus-off' in the FX market, and I think we are going to be stuck with this for a while. The headline risk associated with omicron is very high, it's very confusing, and it's making the intraday moves fairly volatile,"" HSBC global head of FX research Paul Mackel told Reuters.
A case in point was the pound, which fell to a year low on Wednesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced tougher COVID-19 restrictions in England, including working from home, wearing masks in public places, and using vaccine passes.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will hand down its policy decision next week, where it is expected to quicken its asset tapering program. The European Central Bank  and the Bank of England will also hand down their policy decisions.
The Bank of Canada kept its overnight interest rate unchanged at 0.25% and maintained its guidance that a first-rate hike could come as soon as April 2022.
In cryptocurrencies, top executives from six major cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Circle, called for Congress to provide clearer rules for the booming $3 trillion industry."

Investing.com – The pound fell to a fresh one-year low against the dollar, and the bleeding could continue as Goldman Sachs became the latest bank to throw in the towel on an imminent Bank of England rate hike.
GBP/USD fell 0.36% to $1.3191, adding to its more than 2% loss since the Bank of England's November meeting. 
Goldman Sachs said it now expected the BoE stand pat on rates until February, a sharp contrast from its previous forecast for a 15 basis points rate hike in December.
The Wall Street bank pointed to the threat of Omicron forcing the U.K. to impose fresh restrictions that would muddy the outlook of the economy.
The call from the Goldman Sachs appeared justified somewhat as Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said England would move to 'Plan B' rules including encouraging employees to work from home. 
The tougher measures were imposed as the U.K. attempts to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, which has driven a sharp increase in infections.
The U.K. reported 45,102 new cases on Wednesday.
The Bank of England surprised markets at previous meeting in November after deciding to leave its benchmark rate unchanged as it preferred to see the impact on the labor market following the end of the government's measures to protect the job market.
Bets on rate hikes were further reined in after Michael Saunders, a hawkish BoE member, signaled that the bank should adopt a wait and see approach to rate hikes amid concerns about the Omicron impact.",,,,,

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against several of its major counterparts on Wednesday, as easing concerns about the economic hit from the Omicron COVID-19 variant helped support riskier currencies, with the Australian dollar on pace to notch a third straight session of gains.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, slipped 0.4% to 95.854. The index remains close to the 16-month high hit late last month.
""Concerns about Omicron appear to be fading slightly, particularly as increasing – albeit unconfirmed – data emerges pointing to infections caused by the new variant being milder than previously thought,"" Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton, said in a note.
Investors' appetite for riskier assets improved this week amid reports that people infected with the Omicron variant in South Africa had only shown mild symptoms.
Preliminary evidence indicates that the new variant likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but is less severe, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday.
Commodity-linked currencies, including the Australian dollar, were the main beneficiaries of the improved risk sentiment.
The Aussie dollar was 0.8% higher at $0.7177, its highest level in a week.
The recent move by China - a major Australian trading partner - to stimulate its slowing economy was also supportive of the Australian currency, Caxton's Brown said.
The Canadian dollar was largely unchanged after the Bank of Canada held its key overnight interest rate at 0.25%, as expected, and maintained its guidance that a first hike could come as soon as April 2022.
The Norwegian crown rose about 1.8% against the U.S. dollar, helped by an improved risk sentiment and higher oil prices.

The pound was 0.05% lower on the day, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher COVID-19 restrictions in England on Wednesday, ordering people to work from home, wear masks in public places and use vaccine passes to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
Bitcoin was about flat on Wednesday at $50,567.89, as top executives from six major cryptocurrency companies including Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Circle urged Congress to provide clearer rules for the booming $3 trillion industry.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Europe's first cross-border trial of central bank digital currency payments has been described as a success by the central banks of Switzerland and France, though they said it would not immediately lead to issuance of CBDCs. 
Project Jura, named after the mountains between the two countries, is the latest in a series of CBDC trials conducted by central banks keen to rebut the threat from crypto assets. 

""Project Jura confirms that a well-designed wholesale CBDC can play a critical role as a safe and neutral settlement asset for international financial transactions,"" said Benoît Coeuré, head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements. 
The trial, the first time a digital euro and Swiss franc were fully tested, showed it was possible to settle foreign exchange transactions in euro and Swiss franc wholesale CBDCs, as well as issuing, redeeming and transferring tokenised euro-denominated French commercial paper between financial institutions.

454,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble firmed past 74 to the dollar on Wednesday, supported by the central bank's intention to raise rates and an increase in market risk appetite after a much-anticipated video call between Russian and U.S. leaders.
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that the West would impose ""strong economic and other measures"" on Russia if it invades Ukraine, while Putin demanded guarantees that NATO would not expand farther eastward.
Even though the conversation did not lead to any solid progress on Ukraine, it could restore some status quo and ease pressures on the market, said Artem Zaigrin, chief economist at Sova Capital.
At 1310 GMT, the rouble was 0.5% stronger against the dollar at 73.70 , but hovered far off its 2021 peak of 69.21 hit in October. The Russian currency eased 0.1% against the euro to 83.30.
Government bonds regained some ground after the Biden-Putin call, which despite not reporting any breakthroughs led to the two leaders agreeing to continue communication, which could lower global tensions.
""There are, of course, grounds to find immediate optimism as the U.S.-Russia summit took place yesterday with no signs of outright confrontation and the Russia-targeted measures didn't make it into the final text of the U.S. defence bill 2022,"" analysts at Rosbank said in a note.
The rouble is also poised to get support from the central bank, which is expected to raise the key interest rate by more than 25 basis points at its Dec. 17 meeting in response to stubbornly high inflation. 
Russia will report its inflation data for November and the latest week later on Wednesday.

Year-end inflation is likely to exceed the central bank's forecast up to 7.9%, which could prompt a rate hike of more than 50 basis points this month and another rate increase might follow, according to Dmitry Kharlampiev at the debt market department of Sinara investment bank.
Stock indexes gave up earlier gains and decline, with the dollar-denominated RTS index falling 0.5% to 1,639.9. The rouble-based MOEX index fell 0.9% to 3,837.9.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Wednesday amid growing risk appetite over indications that the Omicron Covid variant has relatively mild symptoms, and thus won’t derail the global economic recovery.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.2% to 96.205, trading in the middle of its recent range.
GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3238, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 113.44, while the EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.128. 
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged higher to 0.7118, just below 0.7124, its highest level since Dec. 1, having gained over 1.7% over the last week, its best performance in three months.
The Reserve Bank of Australia left rates at a record low earlier this week, but said the Omicron variant was not expected to derail the country's recovery.
Additionally, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3538, the yuan hitting hitting its highest level since May 2018, on confidence that the reserve ratio cut announced last week by the central bank will keep the country's economy on track, despite the ongoing real estate crisis.
Helping risk sentiment were various studies that suggest that the Omicron Covid variant, while being highly transmissible, doesn’t have severe medical repercussions.
Additionally, a South African study suggested on Tuesday that booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine produced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), could help fend off Omicron infection, although the study showed the new strain can partially evade protection from two doses.
With concerns just starting to ease over Omicron, attention in foreign exchange markets returns to the central bankers and how they plan to manage the growth versus inflation trade-off. 
USD/CAD rose 0.1% to 1.2651 ahead of a Bank of Canada policy meeting later Wednesday. Economists expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged at 0.25%, but it has already ended a bond-buying stimulus program and it could use this meeting to lay the groundwork for an increase in borrowing costs following a strong run of economic data. Brazil's central bank is expected to hike its key rate by a massive 150 basis points at its meeting later.
 Poland’s central bank is also expected to lift interest rates at Wednesday’s meeting after a spike in inflation to a two-decade high. USD/PLN fell 0.1% to 4.0587, while EUR/PLN rose 0.2% to 4.5842.
The central bank hiked the benchmark to 1.25% last month, and of the 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 20 expect a 50 basis-point hike to 1.75% later Wednesday, and 10 see the rate rising to 2%. The other two expect a 25 basis-point increase.
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank will hand down their policy decisions next week.

""Markets continue to travel with a good deal of optimism that omicron will not have the severity of prior variants in terms of health outcomes, even if it is more transmissible,"" National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
That's put risk asset markets in an ""ebullient mood"" lifting stocks, commodities, as well as riskier commodity-linked currencies including the Australian and Canadian dollars, the note added.
The Australian dollar is up 1.71% against the greenback for the week and is set for its best performance in three months. It has also rallied 2.28% against the yen and headed towards its best week since mid-October 2021.
Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar traded at C$1.2645 against its U.S. counterpart, near a two-week high of C$1.2635 set overnight.
However, Africa Health Research Institute head of research Alex Sigal warned on Tuesday that the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine could be only partially effective against omicron.
On the central bank front, the Bank of Canada, alongside the Reserve Bank of India, will hand down its policy decision later in the day. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank will hand down their policy decisions next week.
Investors also await U.S. and Chinese inflation data. China releases its consumer and producer price indexes on Thursday, with the U.S. consumer price index following a day after.
The U.S. JOLTS job openings index, due later in the day, is expected to show further proof of a tighter labor market. This would increase bets for a quicker Fed asset tapering, in turn boosting the greenback. Money markets are currently fully priced for a quarter point rate increase by June 2022."

The report comes as the Australian government is set to overhaul its regulatory framework for payment systems for the first time in over 20 years.
Concluding a year-long study, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said a tokenised form of central bank digital currency (CBDC) could be used by the wholesale market for the funding, settlement and repayment of a tokenised syndicated loan on an Ethereum-based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform.
The project showed the platform could provide efficiency gains and reduce operational risk by replacing highly manual and paper-based processes.

An enterprise-grade DLT platform with appropriate controls on access and security could address many of the potential requirements for a wholesale CBDC system and tokenised assets platform, the RBA said.
The research project, which looked only at wholesale use of a digital currency, was run in conjunction with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), Perpetual and ConsenSys, with input from King & Wood Mallesons.

Investing.com – The Canadian dollar has started the week on the front foot, putting the squeeze on short sellers, but the loonie is likely to be well behaved when the Bank of Canada unveils its monetary policy decision on Wednesday.
USD/CAD fell 0.78% to 1.2654, driven by a return in risk sentiment amid easing concerns about the Omicron Covid-19 variant and a surge in oil prices.
""We believe that a cautious approach this week by the BoC given the lingering uncertainty around the risks and economic impact of the new variant should not surprise the market and hit CAD as long as policymakers do not go as far as signaling there are risks of a deviation from current policy plans,"" ING added.
The Bank of Canada is expected to keep its policy unchanged, with its benchmark rate forecast to remain at 0.25%.
The BoC was one of the first major central banks to tighten monetary policy, and last month announced that it would immediately end its quantitative easing, or bond-buying program and guided for a first rate hike by mid-2022.
The hawkish policy outlook in the prior meeting stoked bets for a rate hike, with ING forecasting the BoC to raise interest rates four times next year – one in each quarter, citing a booming jobs market and bubbling inflation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Easing Omicron COVID-19 variant worries and a timely booster shot of Chinese stimulus helped lift riskier currencies on Tuesday with the Australian dollar leading the charge.
Global stock markets and oil gained, leaving traders to dump safe-haven currencies and bonds, as markets took confidence from reports in South Africa earlier in the week saying that Omicron cases there had only shown mild symptoms.
Preliminary evidence indicates that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but is less severe, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday.
Developments in China contributed to the risk-on tone, as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would lower the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve. This was its second such move this year and is seen as a way to release liquidity to support economic growth.
The Australian dollar, seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, was on pace for its best day in more than three after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expressed confidence that the emergence of the Omicron variant would not thwart economic recovery.
The Aussie rose to a near 1-week high, rebounding from the 13-month low touched last week, to trade up 0.92% at $0.7114.
""The Australian dollar is leading gains among the major currencies on the session following comments from the RBA indicating that it did not expect the Omicron variant to derail the recover,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
""That seems to be developing into a broader working theory for markets as the variant appears — at the moment— to be more infectious but less deadly than the Delta (variant),"" Osborne said.
The U.S. dollar was firmer versus its major currency peers, with the U.S. dollar Currency Index up 0.1% at 96.378, a 1-week high.
Data on Tuesday showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in October as exports soared, potentially setting up trade to contribute to economic growth this quarter. 
Sterling was pinned near 2021 lows against the U.S. dollar amid growing expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest rates unchanged next week.

The rouble was little-changed on the day against the greenback after U.S. President Joe Biden told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday the West is concerned Russia will invade Ukraine and warned of ""strong economic and other measures"" as punishment should Moscow start a military conflict.
Major cryptocurrencies continued to recover following the weekend's crash. Bitcoin was up around 2% at $50,917.73.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The rouble weakened marginally on Tuesday, with investors focused on a video call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden later in the day, as the threat of new sanctions against Moscow lingered over the talks.
Biden will tell Putin that Russia and its banks could be hit with the toughest economic sanctions yet if it invades Ukraine, U.S. officials said, news that sent the Russian currency into the red in the late trading on Monday.
By 1404 GMT, the rouble was 0.2% weaker against the dollar at 74.46, after having gained against the greenback earlier in the session. It rose 0.2% to 83.70 versus the euro.
Yields on the government's 10-year benchmark treasury OFZ bonds were under pressure as well, adding eight basis points to 8.60% and remaining near their highest levels since early 2019 as geopolitical tensions rise. 
Kyiv and the West say Russia is amassing troops near Ukraine. Russia denies any such plans and says it moves troops within its borders as it sees fit.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was not expecting a breakthrough at the talks and urged people to remain calm despite mounting tensions.
Latvia said Russia could be cut off from the SWIFT payment system used by banks all around the world, a move that would exacerbate Russia's high inflation problem, said Max Castle, a fixed income portfolio manager at Mediolanum Irish Operations.
""That would cause a severe economic downturn in Russia, and even for Putin the cost would be too great,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean Putin will not do more moves and become more aggressive.""
SWIFT measures have been an underlying threat for a couple of years. Andrey Kostin, chief executive of Russia's second largest bank, VTB, has said such a move would be comparable to a declaration of war.
One source told Reuters targeting Putin's inner circle with sanctions had been discussed but no decision had been made. 
Another source said sanctions curbing the conversion of roubles into dollars and other currencies was also an option, an idea the CEO of Russia's dominant lender Sberbank German Gref called ""nonsense"" and ""impossible to execute"".
The sanctions threat could be part of a U.S. strategy to deter Russia, Sova Capital said, adding that the call could cool tensions between the West and Russia and reduce some of the geopolitical risks in the rouble and Russia's financial assets.
But BCS Global Markets said the United States firing threats on the eve of the summit arguably inflamed rather than defused tension, and eroded hope of finding common ground. 
Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 2% at $74.55 a barrel, supporting Russian stock indexes.
The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 0.1% to 1,623.8 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.7% higher at 3,838.0 points.

The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.6% to 0.7091, extending gains from Monday when it enjoyed its best percentage gain in seven weeks, after the Reserve Bank of Australia left rates at a record low but said the omicron variant was not expected to derail the economy's recovery.
Additionally, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3688 after the People’s Bank of China announced plans to cut banks' reserve requirements by 50 basis points next week, for the second time in 2021. 
This will enable Chinese banks to release CNY1.2 trillion ($188 billion) of liquidity into the economy, helping ease the pressure on a number of property companies as well as supporting growth in the world’s second largest economy.
Supporting the general mood of risk taking were early indications from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first discovered, as well as the U.S. that  those infected suffer relatively minor symptoms compared with previous virus waves. 
However, the dollar retains underlying strength, especially against the euro, with the Federal Reserve expected to start tightening monetary policy long before its European counterpart.
Fed funds futures are still pricing in more than two full U.S. rate increases next year, beginning in May, a view that is likely to be cemented later this week, with Friday’s consumer price report expected to show another sharp rise in the annual inflation rate in November.
“We have just seen a terrible German factory goods orders number for October and one suspects the only help that the euro can get before year-end is if the ECB turns less dovish,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
However, it’s difficult to see that chance coming as ECB President Christine Lagarde has consistently taken the view that surging consumer prices will be temporary, and thus the European Central Bank should stick with its ultra-supportive stance."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia as concerns about the omicron COVID-19 variant started receding.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.09% to 96.245 by 12:12 AM ET (5:12 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.19% to 113.68.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.37% to 0.7075, with the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping its interest rate unchanged at 0.10% earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.6763.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.3712. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 22% year-on-year, and imports grew 31.7% year-on-year, in November. The trade balance was at $71.72 billion.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 1.3284.
""Although there is still a lot of uncertainty over Omicron's health and economic impact, investors have embraced news from South Africa suggesting the exponential rise in Omicron infections has not been followed by a big wave in hospitalizations,"" NAB strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
Ntsakisi Maluleke, a public health specialist in South Africa’s Gauteng province, said over the weekend that patients with omicron had only shown mild symptoms.
Meanwhile, China eased its monetary policy by cutting banks' reserve requirements for the second time in 2021. The People’s Bank of China will reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points next week, releasing CNY1.2 trillion ($188.16 billion) of liquidity.
The Reserve Bank of India will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England will all hand down their policy decisions in the following week.
Although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked its interest rate to 0.75% in November, some investors said that the move was bad for growth.
""It does seem like the market is fatigued with the New Zealand good news story, and is less willing to reward currencies heading for higher interest rates,"" ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.
""They normally signal strong growth, but in a supply-constrained world, higher rates may be a signal of slower growth to come. New Zealand's top of the pile cash rate, and expectations of more interest rate hikes to come, certainly aren't helping the New Zealand dollar.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged higher against safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc after reassuring news on the Omicron COVID-19 variant, while units like the Australian dollar that had weakened in recent weeks on growth worries also advanced.
U.S. Treasury yields rose and stocks gained after news that initial observations suggested Omicron patients had only mild symptoms, reversing some of Friday's heavy selloff.
While Omicron has spread to about one-third of U.S. states as of Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, told CNN that ""thus far it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it"".
""The absence of negative developments surrounding Omicron over the weekend appears to be helping markets stabilize today after the dramatic moves at the end of last week,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in a note.
The dollar climbed 0.5% against the Japanese yen and rose 0.9% against the Swiss franc. The yen and the franc typically draw investors looking for safety when economic or geopolitical tensions rise.
The dollar fell 0.3% against the Japanese currency on Friday..
The greenback's losses on Friday had also followed a below-forecast jobs report, though the data did little to shake market expectations the Federal Reserve will accelerate the pace of unwinding stimulus and raise interest rates, starting next year.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was 0.1% higher at 96.309, not far from the 16-month high of 96.938 touched late last month.
Investors have grown more bullish on the dollar in recent weeks, with net long bets on the greenback climbing to the highest level since June 2019, data from the U.S. CFTC showed on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar rose as much as 0.64%, rebounding from the 13-month low hit last week.
Russia's rouble slipped into the red in late trading on Monday after U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin of severe economic consequences in case of a Ukraine invasion ahead of a call between the two men on Tuesday.

The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Monday as oil prices rose and attention turned to a Bank of Canada interest rate decision this week, with the currency recovering from its lowest level in more than two months.
Elsewhere, cryptocurrencies nursed big losses from a wild weekend that at one stage crushed bitcoin more than 20%. Bitcoin slipped 0.6% to around $49,166.35 on Monday.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Monday, boosted by uncertainty over the omicron Covid variant and expectations the Federal Reserve will quickly tighten monetary policy, while the euro weakened after disappointing German factory orders.
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.3% to 96.365, not far off November's 16-month peak of 96.938.
GBP/USD traded flat at 1.3232, USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 113.10, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7016, rebounding from a 13-month low.
Additionally, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1284, with the euro hit hard after German manufacturing orders fell much more than expected in October, dropping 6.9% on the month after a revised increase of 1.8% in September, further clouding the growth outlook for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy.
The safe-haven dollar has received a boost from the uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant of the coronavirus, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating on Sunday that the new variant has now been found in about 15 U.S. states so far.
""We know we have several dozen cases and we're following them closely. And we are every day hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News in an interview.
However, the dominant factor helping the greenback has been the public acceptance by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week that inflation was going to stay high for longer than previously predicted, and the central bank would have to take this into account when setting policy.
Even last week’s disappointing nonfarm payrolls release did little to shake market expectations of a more aggressive U.S. tightening, especially with Friday’s consumer price report expected to show another sharp rise in the annual November number.
“Fed Chair Jay Powell's comments … that inflation is effectively no longer transitory has seen the policy-sensitive U.S. two year yield stay firm above 0.60% on the view that the Fed's normalization of monetary policy is locked and launched,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The futures market is almost fully priced for a hike to 0.25% by May of 2022 and to 0.5% by November.
Aside from the Federal Reserve, the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected on Tuesday to hold its cash rate at a record low of 0.1% at its final meeting of the year.
Traders will be looking for any clues about the RBA’s review of its bond-buying program on Feb. 1, the first meeting of 2022.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with uncertainty surrounding the omicron COVID-19 variant and expectations of more hot U.S. inflation data increasing the pressure on interest rates.

The riskier Antipodean currencies led an attempted bounce earlier in the session, helped along by preliminary observations from South Africa suggesting that omicron patients had relatively mild symptoms.
However, ANZ Bank analysts suggested, “perhaps we should be looking for volatility rather than a trend."" Volatility gauges for the Australian and New Zealand dollars hit their highest in about eight months on Friday.
Omicron has found its way into around one-third of U.S. states. Although research into the variant continues, an article by the South African Medical Research Council said the majority of COVID-19 patients were admitted for other reasons and were oxygen-dependent.
Treasury markets have also been volatile in recent sessions, with the U.S. yield curve flattening sharply over expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will move too quickly to curb inflation and eventually impact long-term economic growth.
Friday’s mixed job report also reinforced views of quicker Fed asset tapering. The consumer price index figure due later in the week is also expected to support the view and give the dollar a boost.
Interest rate futures markets have priced U.S. interest rate hikes around mid-2022, but only reaching as high as around 1.5% in late 2026 and investors remain wary of that changing quickly.
""This is a tough one to reconcile. It suggests the market sees the Fed stopping hiking after five hikes, well short of the Fed's median forecasts,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
However, a year-on-year inflation print above 7%, against economists' expectations for 6.7%, could change things. ""Inflation with a 7 as the big number would get the dollar higher,” said Weston."

Indirect U.S.-Iranian talks on saving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal broke off on Friday until next week, with European officials voicing dismay at sweeping demands by Iran's new, hardline government. Washington said Tehran ""does not seem to be serious"".
In Iran, the U.S. dollar was selling for as much as 302,200 rials on the unofficial market on Saturday, up from 294,000 on Friday, according to the foreign exchange site Bonbast.com.

""The market has received a first shock from the nuclear accord (talks),"" wrote the economic news website eghtesadnews.com. It said the dollar gained 6,000 rials to 299,500 before rising above 300,000 on Saturday.
In October 2020, the rial currency hit a record low of about 320,000 to a dollar as a drop in oil prices deepened the economic crisis in the country already reeling under U.S. sanctions and the highest COVID-19 death toll in the Middle East.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday he hoped that volatile foreign-exchange and inflation rates would stabilise shortly and he again promised low interest rates, after a historic plunge in the lira currency to record lows. 
The lira shed some 30% over the last month in a selloff driven by aggressive interest rate cuts that Erdogan sought, but that economists and opposition politicians say are reckless in part due to soaring inflation.
""God willing we will stabilise all fluctuations in prices and forex rates in not such a long time,"" Erdogan told an audience in the eastern city of Siirt. 
""Tayyip Erdogan said low interest rates yesterday, says low interest rates today and will say low interest rates tomorrow,"" the president said. ""I will never compromise on this because interest rates are a malady that make the rich even richer, and the poor even poorer."" 
The currency touched a record intra-day low of 14 to the dollar on Tuesday and logged a record close on Friday, at 13.7485. It is by far the worst-performing currency in emerging markets this year after having shed 45% of its value. 
Inflation jumped to a three-year high of 21.3% last month, leaving Turkey's real rates deeply negative, a red flag for fleeing investors and for Turkish savers who have flocked to hard currencies to protect their wealth. 
Despite opposition calls for early elections and a policy reversal, Erdogan has repeated in recent weeks that rate cuts are needed to boost exports, credit, jobs and economic growth.
Under pressure from the president, the central bank has slashed its policy rate by 400 basis points to 15% and is expected to ease policy again this month. 
""We will always be there for producers and employers with low interest rates. We're starting to enforce precautions safeguarding workers against inflation,"" Erdogan said. 
He said unspecific foreign actors as well as ""greedy"" businesses that stockpile more goods than needed are in part to blame for some sharp price spikes.

At a separate event in the southern city of Mersin, where crowds called for Erdogan to resign, main opposition CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said a new government would forgive all interest on loans held by farmers and small businesses. 
""He doesn't need to resign, we'll send him off anyways,"" he said of elections set for no later than mid-2023.

Taiwan, along with Vietnam, again exceeded the U.S. Treasury's thresholds for possible currency manipulation and enhanced analysis under a 2015 trade law, but the department on Friday refrained from formally branding them as manipulators.
Responding, Taiwan's central bank reiterated the trade surplus with the United States was due to the China-U.S. trade war, which has seen companies shift production from China to avoid tariffs, and soaring tech demand from U.S. consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The expansion of the trade surplus with the United States has nothing to do with exchange rate factors,"" it said in a statement, repeating comments from a central bank official late Friday.
Taiwan's current account surplus has also been affected by the same factors, with domestic savings growth contributing to the surplus as Taiwanese firms increased investment at home and people were unable to travel or spend as much due to the pandemic, it added.
""For a long time, our country and the United States have maintained close and mutually beneficial bilateral trade relations, and are important partners in the technology supply chain,"" the central bank said.
""Communication channels between the bank and the U.S. Treasury are smooth, and the two sides will continue to communicate on relevant issues in the future on the basis of good interaction.""
The U.S. Treasury said it was working with Taiwan to develop a plan with ""specific actions to address the underlying causes of Taiwan's currency undervaluation and excessive external surpluses"".

The Taiwan dollar is up more than 2.5% against the greenback this year, among the best-performing Asian currencies.
Taiwan's case is complicated by geopolitical pressures, including heightened military tensions with China, and the island's position as a major exporter of semiconductors that are needed to help ease a supply shortage for U.S. manufacturers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc gained on Friday as global equities and bond yields fell on fears about the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which has resulted in renewed restrictions in parts of the world, and concerns about possible aggressive action by the Federal Reserve to curb surging inflation.
""Volatility remains the norm in recent weeks amid changing outlooks on monetary policy, inflation worries, and now the Omicron uncertainties,"" Action Economics said in its latest blog on the market.
The dollar reversed gains to trade little changed on the day after the release of a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report, which still included positive revisions for previous months and solid details about the labor market. Market participants viewed the payrolls report as not really altering the Fed's plan to accelerate tapering of its asset purchases and possibly raise interest rates multiple times next year despite the Omicron threat.
U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 550,000 jobs.
October's job growth was revised up to 546,000 positions from the initial estimate of 531,000 and September's jump was increased to 379,000 from 321,000, for a net 82,000 two-month gain.
The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.2% from 4.6%, the lowest level since February 2020. 
""Despite today's mixed payrolls report, we think the bigger picture remains that sustained inflationary pressures in the U.S. are likely to support faster policy normalization by the Fed and keep the dollar strong,"" said Jonathan Petersen, markets economist at Capital Economics.
Federal funds rate futures, which track short-term interest rate expectations, late on Friday priced in a 74% chance of a quarter-percentage-point increase in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate by May 2022. That probability was as high as 86% following the release of the jobs report.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index was up slightly on the day at 96.146 . The greenback will end broadly unchanged on the week despite rallying last week to its highest level since July of last year.
Petersen of Capital Economics said the dollar's value reflected the ""offsetting effects of rising short-term yields in the U.S., particularly after Chair (Jerome) Powell's (hawkish) comments to Congress on Wednesday, and falling long-term yields amid growing concerns about the Omicron variant.""
The euro was up 0.1% at $1.1307.
Against the yen, the dollar dropped 0.4% to 112.75 yen. Versus the Swiss franc, the dollar slid 0.2% to 0.9179 francs. 
Also on Friday, the U.S. Treasury released its semi-annual currency report, which singled out Vietnam and Taiwan as countries that continued to exceed its thresholds for possible currency manipulation and enhanced analysis under a 2015 U.S. trade law. However, it refrained from formally calling them manipulators.
The currencies of the countries mentioned - the Vietnamese dong and Taiwanese dollar - showed little reaction to the report.
In emerging markets, Turkey's volatile lira edged near to its record low on Friday, triggering direct central bank intervention to sell dollars. The U.S. dollar was last up 0.6% at 13.745 liras.

(Reuters) -Vietnam and Taiwan again exceeded the U.S. Treasury's thresholds for possible currency manipulation and enhanced analysis under a 2015 trade law, but the department on Friday refrained from formally branding them as manipulators.
Switzerland also narrowly escaped triggering all three manipulation criteria in the Treasury's latest semi-annual currency report, thanks to revised, broader measurements for trade and current account surpluses and foreign exchange market interventions.
All three had tripped the Treasury's thresholds in April https://www.reuters.com/business/us-says-vietnam-switzerland-taiwan-violate-currency-thresholds-2021-04-16 prompting more intensive U.S. engagement to revise their practices. Former President Donald Trump's administration had branded Vietnam and Switzerland as manipulators in December, invoking a 1988 currency law.
In the latest report, the Treasury found that no major trading partners during the year through June 2021 sought to manipulate their currencies for a trade advantage or for preventing effective balance of payments adjustments.
The department said it would continue to work with Vietnam and Taiwan to address U.S. concerns. For Switzerland, which tripped only the trade and foreign exchange intervention thresholds, the Treasury said it would continue to conduct an in-depth analysis of the alpine country's practices for another year.
Switzerland was moved to the Treasury's ""Monitoring List"" of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices, along with 11 other countries that remained on the list: China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Ireland, Italy, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Mexico.
Treasury said it was ""satisfied with progress made by Vietnam to date"" and would continue engagement started in May with Taiwan.
""This engagement includes urging the development of a plan with specific actions to address the underlying causes of currency undervaluation and external imbalances,"" Treasury said of the Taiwan engagement.
The United States in July dropped a threat to impose tariffs on Vietnamese goods after the country's central bank agreed with the U.S. Treasury https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-trade-agency-drops-tariff-threat-against-vietnam-over-currency-practices-2021-07-23 to refrain from manipulation and make its exchange rate practices more transparent. The deal followed a Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-forex-intervention-exclusive-idUSKBN2AB1I4 that Vietnam had sought to shift its spot dollar purchases to forward purchase contracts with banks to evade the Treasury criteria. 
MUTED REACTION
The Treasury's latest report did not spark any significant immediate moves in the Taiwan dollar, the Vietnamese dong or the Swiss franc.
A Taiwanese central bank official said discussions with Washington would continue but blamed Taiwan's large trade deficit with the United States on strong demand for technology products fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic and production shifts prompted by U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 
Switzerland's finance ministry repeated its longstanding denial that the country's central bank engages in manipulation of the franc for an economic advantage.
""Foreign exchange interventions are necessary for Swiss monetary policy in order to maintain appropriate monetary conditions and thus price stability,"" the ministry said in a statement.
CHINA 
The Treasury report criticized China's lack of transparency in its foreign exchange practices, citing a wide discrepancy between the People's Bank of China's foreign exchange assets and net foreign exchange settlement data, suggesting that state- owned banks were being used to conduct official interventions.
""Treasury will continue to closely monitor China’s use of exchange rate management, capital flow, and macroprudential measures and their potential impact on the exchange rate,"" it said in the report.
A Reuters analysis in June https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-banks-are-bursting-with-dollars-thats-worry-2021-06-01 found that Chinese banks had amassed over $1 trillion amid little official PBOC intervention, posing a risk to the government's ability to control the yuan exchange rate. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Reuters Next virtual conference on Thursday that she would continue to engage https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/yellen-says-cutting-some-tariffs-chinese-goods-could-ease-price-pressures-2021-12-02 her Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier Liu He, on foreign exchange policy issues.
NEW GOALPOSTS
In the second currency report issued by the Biden administration, the Treasury also adjusted the three manipulation thresholds under the 2015 law to include somewhat broader measures of trade surpluses, foreign exchange interventions and current account surpluses.

A Treasury official said Switzerland would have exceeded the old current account surplus threshold, and narrowly missed exceeding the new one.
""Treasury is working relentlessly to promote a stronger and more balanced global recovery that benefits American workers, including through close engagement with major economies on currency-related issues,"" Yellen said in a statement accompanying the report.
 
"
472,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 12:17PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday said it employed somewhat broader measures of trade and current account surpluses and currency interventions in its analysis of U.S. trading partners' foreign exchange policies.
The semi-annual report declined to label any U.S. trading partner a currency manipulator, although it found that Vietnam and Taiwan continued to exceed its thresholds for possible currency manipulation and enhanced analysis under a 2015 U.S. trade law. Switzerland tripped two of the three new criteria but would have triggered all three under the previous standard.
Here's how the new goalposts employed by Treasury compare with its past approach to the analysis, including a new measure for determining which countries qualify for review in the first place:
WHO GETS REVIEWED?
Under the old standard, the Treasury reviewed all trading partners with $40 billion total bilateral trade in goods - the sum of imports and exports - with the United States. Services were not included in the equation.
Under the new measure, services are added because of their increasing role in international trade, and Treasury dropped the $40 billion trigger and instead will look at the top 20 U.S. trading partners determined by this equation every six months.
For the 20 countries that qualify, Treasury employs three tests to determine if a country is a currency manipulator, reviewing each country to see if it has: 
* A ""significant"" bilateral trade surplus with the United States
* A ""material"" current account surplus
* Engaged in ""persistent, one-sided intervention"" in foreign exchange markets
Also, Treasury will look at any trading partner that had triggered two of the three criteria in the immediately preceding report. This allows it to continue to pursue remedies, if needed, with any country that drops out of the top 20 from one report to the next.
WHAT COUNTS AS A 'SIGNIFICANT' TRADE SURPLUS?
Treasury now considers this threshold triggered if any of the countries under review had a goods and services trade surplus with the United States of $15 billion or more.
Previously the standard had been a $20 billion goods-only surplus.
WHAT COUNTS AS A 'MATERIAL' CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS?
Treasury's revised approach on this question is the most complicated of the three and is designed to help it differentiate between current account surpluses that may be ""excessive"" in its view and those that could be considered ""warranted.""
Previously countries with current account surpluses of at least 2% of their gross domestic product would count as having ""material"" surpluses.
Now Treasury looks at it two ways. The threshold is triggered for countries with current account surpluses of 3% or more of GDP or for those countries running surpluses that also have an estimated current account ""gap"" of 1% of GDP. A current account ""gap"" is a measure of how far a country's actual current account balance deviates from Treasury's estimated ""optimal"" balance.
WHAT COUNTS AS 'PERSISTENT, ONE-SIDED' FOREX INTERVENTION?

The key change here is on Treasury's measure of ""persistence."" As before, net foreign exchange purchases of 2% of GDP qualify, but in order to be considered ""persistent"" they must now have occurred over eight of the 12 months in the review period versus six of 12 months previously. 
The change is meant to help Treasury zero in on genuinely ""asymmetric patterns"" as opposed to those arising from external short-term shocks such as the ructions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

473,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group is planning to “actively engage” with offshore creditors to formulate a viable restructuring plan of the developer’s debt, according to a statement from the company.
“There is no guarantee that the group will have sufficient funds to continue to perform its financial obligations,” given the company’s current liquidity status, Evergrande said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange late on Friday. The company said it had received a demand to perform its obligations under a guarantee in the amount of approximately $260 million.
Evergrande is struggling to raise cash to meet its more than $300 billion in liabilities, fueling concerns it’s heading for a default that could hurt the world’s second-largest economy. In its statement, the company said if it’s unable to meet its guarantee obligations or certain other financial obligations, it may lead to creditors demanding acceleration of repayment.
The developer has become one of the biggest casualties of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s years-long effort to wring the excesses out of the country’s debt-laden real estate sector. The question looming over global markets is whether Xi can tackle the problem -- and pull off a sweeping campaign to bring “common prosperity” to China -- without derailing the economy’s fragile recovery from the pandemic.
Senior Chinese policy makers have tried to reassure investors that risks from Evergrande are contained, even as they signal a reluctance to bail the company out. The crackdown has begun to weigh on the real estate industry, which is now seeing home sales plunge and prices snapping a six-year streak of increases.
Authorities are laying the groundwork for a debt restructuring, assembling accounting and legal experts to examine the finances of the group, Bloomberg has reported. Evergrande has also hired financial advisers that are known to handle restructuring.

The guidelines would help regulate foreign exchange market trading and promote ""honest, fair, orderly and efficient"" market operations, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said.
Market participants would be barred from manipulating closing currency prices or other benchmark prices and barred from abusing dominant market positions to influence prices, according to the guidelines.
Market participants would be barred from using non-public, market-moving information to engage in currency trading, or use such information to advise others to conduct trading, the guidelines said.

Market participants should appropriately conduct proprietary currency trading, actively provide market liquidity and adjust supply and demand in the market, and help keep the yuan basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level.
Sources have told Reuters a central bank-led self-regulatory group that helps oversee China's foreign exchange industry had asked commercial banks to cap the size of their proprietary trading accounts, which many market participants interpreted as a move to limit financial institutions' speculation on the yuan.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Analysts are sticking with bullish forecasts on the Canadian dollar despite uncertainty related to the Omicron COVID-19 variant, expecting oil prices to rebound and the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates before the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll of 32 strategists was for the Canadian dollar to strengthen 2.4% to 1.25 per U.S. dollar, or 80 U.S. cents in three months, compared to 1.24 in last month's forecast.
It was then expected to firm to 1.23 in a year's time.
""We expect the Bank of Canada to raise rates ahead of the Fed next year and expect oil prices will rebound from where they are presently,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""Those are both positive factors for the loonie.""
In October, the Bank of Canada became the first central bank from a G7 country to exit quantitative easing and signaled it could begin raising interest rates in April. It is due to make an interest rate decision next week.
Money markets expect the BoC to hike five times next year - much more tightening than is seen from the Federal Reserve.
Data this week showed Canada's economy https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-economy-posts-annualized-gain-54-q3-october-gdp-seen-up-08-2021-11-30 grew at an annualized rate of 5.4% in the third quarter, beating analyst expectations, and growth most likely accelerated in October on a manufacturing rebound. 
""Canada is quite far along in the pandemic recovery compared to most other OECD recoveries and it should benefit from inbound foreign direct investment next year, which is probably going to surge,"" Anderson said.
Recent flooding in the western province of British Columbia that cut off a major port from the rest of Canada could weigh on fourth-quarter growth.
In addition, the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, has tumbled around 20% since October, pressured by rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the detection of the possibly vaccine-resistant Omicron variant. 
But analysts expect the loonie to cope.
""We've taken lessons from the past in that any severe impact posed by variants is phased out and then overlooked by markets,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada. 

""In our 2022 forecasts, we envisage an improvement in global growth conditions, and thus demand for oil, and a return by hawkish central banks to their normalization cycles.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday, ahead of the release of the latest monthly U.S. jobs report which could cement a quicker pace of tapering and, potentially, early interest rate hikes even amid the omicron-induced uncertainty.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.2% to 96.305, marginally higher for the week. That would be a sixth consecutive weekly gain, the longest stretch since January 2015.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1284, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3279, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 113.34, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7066, just above its 13-month low of 0.7063.
The dollar received a boost this week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated, in his testimony to Congress, that inflation was going to stay high for longer than the central bank had originally predicted, and that Fed policymakers would consider a faster tapering of its bond-buying program at their December meeting
This hawkish tone continued Thursday with San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly saying it may be time to ""start crafting a plan"" to raise rates to combat inflation, while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin talked about ""normalizing policy.""
Money markets are now back pointing to the central bank raising its benchmark rate by 25 basis points at its June 2022 meeting - just as they did before the first news about Omicron.
Attention now turns to the release of the monthly U.S. official jobs report for indications that the labor market continues to strengthen. However, the normally decisive signals sent by the report are likely to be muted by knowledge that it predates the emergence of the new variant.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 560,000 in November, an improvement from the 531,000 jobs created in October, while the unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.5% from 4.6% the previous month. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
That said, both the ADP private payrolls on Wednesday and Thursday’s initial jobless claims were stronger than expected, suggesting a positive surprise is a distinct possibility.
“We have seen some support coming from the backstop to the dovish repricing of rate expectations offered by Powell’s comments ... and by good ADP and ISM manufacturing figures,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Given the material downside risks caused by the omicron variant, markets will likely require the data flow to remain quite strong to avert another dovish repricing.” 
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.9% to 13.7306, with the lira again trading near record lows ahead of the release of the latest Turkish inflation data later Friday. That's likely to put the currency under more pressure.
Data due Friday will show consumer prices rose an annual 20.7%, up from 19.9% in October, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of nine economists. That’s more than four times the central bank’s target of 5% as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pursues a policy of lower interest rates.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, with markets adopting a broadly calmer tone. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report that includes non-farm payrolls, due later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% 96.165 by 11:39 PM ET (4:39 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 113.18.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.31% to 0.7071 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.31% to 0.6795.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.3720, with China’s Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 52.1 in November.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3290.
The U.S. Federal Reserve reinforced the hawkish stance shown by Chairman Jerome Powell earlier in the week. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said it may be time to ""start crafting a plan"" to hike interest rates to combat inflation, and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin showed support for ""normalizing policy.""
""Fed talk overnight was undeniably hawkish,"" National Australia Bank director for economics Tapas Strickland said in a note.
Bets are rising that the central bank will raise the target rate by a quarter point at its June 2022 meeting.
In terms of the newly discovered omicron COVID-19 variant, headlines were ""net positive"" overnight, helping risk sentiment to recover. However, with the first assessments of the efficacy of current vaccines probably still a week or so away, ""we expect ongoing volatility,"" the note added.
The riskier Australian dollar recorded its fourth session of losses. Both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank continue to stick to dovish stances, resisting expectations that the tone will change as inflationary pressures continue to mount.
""We continue to expect near‑term Australian dollar moves will be driven by omicron and the risk remains a dip below $0.7000,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joseph Capurso said in a report.
For Friday though, ""the U.S. labor market takes center stage,"" and should keep currency markets quiet, the report added, in reference to the U.S. jobs report. Thursday’s U.S. initial jobless claims data said that 222,000 claims were filed throughout the week.
Meanwhile, Didi Global Inc. (NYSE:DIDI) said that it will delist from the New York Stock Exchange and list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Interest rate differentials will dominate sentiment in forex markets over the next three months, a Reuters poll of FX analysts found, placing the U.S. dollar in a unique position to extend its outperformance against its peers.
The dollar index, up nearly 7% for the year and on its best run since 2015, received further impetus from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, who gave markets fodder to speculate the central bank would raise rates earlier than expected.
With that policy impetus in its sails, the dollar is likely to find new converts in coming weeks from among those analysts who still expect it to weaken in the short- to medium-term.
""The dollar is well placed to repeat what it tends to do,"" said Paul Meggyesi, head of FX research at JP Morgan in London. 
""Typically, on average, the dollar has gone up by four percentage points in broad index terms in the six months before the first Fed hike, and that's probably not an unreasonable projection for thinking about how much upside there could be for the dollar this time around."" 
Reuters poll graphic on major currency market outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/zgvomnmxlvd/Major%20FX%20poll.png 
But there was considerable uncertainty in financial markets over the new Omicron coronavirus variant that has pushed measures of volatility to levels not seen since the beginning of the year.
That split analysts polled Nov. 29-Dec. 2 on an additional question asking what would drive FX markets in the coming three months.
The most common reply, from 19 of 46 respondents, was interest rate differentials, the second most common pick was 15 for new coronavirus variants. 
While nine chose safe-haven buying, two said search for higher yield, only one analyst picked commodity prices. 
Even beyond that period analysts do not expect most major currencies to claw back the significant losses they have suffered against the dollar within 12 months.
The euro was forecast to gain about 1.5% and the safe-haven Japanese yen to drop another 2% in a year. They were down around 7% and 9% this year respectively. At the beginning of 2021, analysts had forecast both currencies to be about 10% higher from current levels around now.
However, some analysts held to the view the dollar would eventually weaken as underlying factors supporting the greenback's strength were unsustainable in the long run.

""If what you're looking at is inflation, you have to keep at the back of your mind that you're sort of looking at the near term, it can be a year, year and a half but ultimately there's a point at which they've done enough and then you hit a period of dollar weakness,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""I'd say this is not a high quality dollar rally. It's not like the late 90s when you saw productivity booming. This is sort of the 70s rally which we know comes and goes.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Some traders eyeing the next big short European trade in global markets amid growing economic headwinds and a new coronavirus variant are looking at selling Sweden's crown.
The export-oriented economy's currency has displayed an unusually high sensitivity to risk sentiment since the discovery of the Omicron variant hit markets last Friday.
The crown's more than 5% drop in November versus the greenback came at a time when the euro rallied thanks to a bout of short position covering by hedge funds, which had previously ramped up short bets on the single currency.
November's drop leaves the crown as the worst performing developed market currency so far this year, with its slide of more than 10% even worse than the struggling Japanese yen, according to Refinitiv data.
""Short-SEK trades may have become an increasingly popular proxy trade to bet against EU-sentiment given the euro is finding support in the current risk-off environment,"" ING strategists wrote in a note, referring to the crown by its popular moniker.
This week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its forecast for the crown versus the dollar over the next three months by more than 4%. A  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) economic surprise index for Europe has underperformed its U.S. and Chinese counterparts since September.
Analysing currency market trends from March 2020, Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London, estimates the crown has a greater degree of sensitivity and more volatility than some of its rivals, such as the Australian dollar, making it a prime candidate for short-sellers.
That high sensitivity combined with falling market expectations of central bank rate hikes over the next 12 months is weighing on the crown, with risk reversals - a ratio of bearish to bullish bets on the currency - trading at their highest levels since January.

“Classically the Swedish kroner (crown) is, and I'm an old foreign exchange trader, something I would short if I'm short global growth, and in particularly if I'm short European growth,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely unchanged Thursday, with the safe haven Japanese yen more in demand as worries over the omicron Covid variant mounted, weighing on the South African rand and the Australian dollar. 
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged marginally higher to 96.090, consolidating in the middle of its range over the past two weeks.
EUR/USD fell marginally to 1.1315, GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.3299, and USD/JPY rose 0.4% to 113.23, a recovery of sorts from Tuesday's low of 112.53, a level not seen since Oct. 11.
Additionally, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7110, not far from Tuesday's low of 0.7063, its weakest since early November of last year, while USD/ZAR fell 0.3% to 15.9760, after a more than 1% surge overnight.
“G7 FX volatility is at its highs for the year and it is not hard to see why,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Over the last week news of the omicron variant has inserted a new and, as yet, unsized risk premium into global asset markets.”
Adding to the concerns was the news late Wednesday that the U.S. recorded its first case of the omicron variant, while the number of new cases reported in South Africa, where omicron was first discovered, doubled from Tuesday to Wednesday with the new variant becoming the dominant strain, accounting for nearly three-quarters of cases.
Much remains unknown about the new variant, which has spread to at least two dozen countries in around three weeks, but the World Health Organization said Wednesday that it expects to have more information on its transmissibility within days. However, Australia's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly was quoted as saying there was no evidence to suggest it was more dangerous than the Delta variant. Elsewhere, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) said its antiviral treatment Sotrovimab, which has already been approved in the U.K., appears 79% effective against Omicron.
The dollar should still receive some support after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated during the second day of his testimony to Congress on Wednesday that the central bank is set to consider at its December meeting a faster tapering of its bond-buying program, which could lead to earlier interest rates hikes. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester indicated in an interview on Wednesday that she expects two 25 basis point hikes next year.
The main U.S. economic data release scheduled for Thursday will be the weekly initial jobless claims, another indication of the health of the U.S. labor market. This follows ADP private payrolls rising 534,000 in November, less than in October but more than expected, and ahead of the much anticipated government jobs report on Friday. 
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 1.5% to 13.4581, with the lira trading near record lows, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan abruptly replaced his finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, suggesting rifts within the administration over the policy of aggressive interest-rate cuts despite raging inflation.

(Reuters) - Investors became increasingly bearish on most Asian currencies as the detection of a possibly vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant and subsequent mobility restrictions by several countries soured risk appetite, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Bullish bets on the Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit reversed, while short positions on the Thai baht, Singaporean dollar and South Korean won rose, a poll of 10 respondents found.
Long bets on the yuan, however, consolidated and were at their highest since early June, as strong corporate demand for the Chinese currency saw it gain against broad dollar strength and provide some support to currencies in the region.
Traders say strong corporate demand and China's strict virus measures and travel restrictions should continue to support the yuan. 
""The Omicron (coronavirus) variant is the latest uncertainty in the pandemic world and adds to the demand for CNY, given China's zero-Covid management that could impart some safe-haven quality to the currency,"" analysts at Maybank said. 
Many Asian countries have already closed their borders to visitors from several southern African nations, including South Africa - where the variant was first detected.
""The most important things to know about Omicron are its contagiousness levels, the severity of the infection itself and the effectiveness of existing vaccines,"" said Sim Moh Siong, a FX strategist at Bank of Singapore. 
Early indications suggesting Omicron might be more contagious than previous variants have rattled financial markets as new restrictions could choke off a tentative recovery from the economic ravages of the pandemic in 2020.
""The Omicron variant introduces uncertainties as to how fast the economies can re-open now,"" Siong said. 
Earlier this week, authorities in Singapore said the city-state would hold off on further reopening measures even as it closed in on vaccinating all eligible people against COVID-19.
Short bets on the Singaporean dollar rose to their highest since mid-August. 
Investors raised their bearish bets on the baht after cutting a fortnight ago, as the possibility of travel curbs threatens to derail Thailand's efforts to revive its battered tourism industry.
Meanwhile, an end to crisis-level interest rates in the United States looms large following hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, sparking further sell-offs in riskier Asian assets.
Investors also raised their short positions on the won, as South Korea's coronavirus cases hit record highs and authorities temporarily halted quarantine exemptions for fully vaccinated inbound travellers. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia while the yen, a fellow safe-haven asset, remained near a seven-week high. The South African rand and other riskier currencies were also impacted by concerns over the new omicron COVID-19 variant and its rapid global spread.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 95.968 by 11:03 PM ET (4:03 AM GMT). The index consolidated in the middle of its range over the past two weeks, after rising as high as 96.938 for the first time since July 2020 during that period.

The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3693 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3298.
The dollar remained closed to Tuesday's low of 112.535 against the yen, a level not seen since Oct. 11. It was off 0.12% against the South African rand after a more-than-1% surge during the previous session.
Markets were rattled by the news that omicron could be more contagious than previous variants, which indicated a return to travel banks and lockdowns that could impact the economic recovery. The U.S. reported its first case of the variant on Wednesday, as Australia, the U.K., Canada, and Japan, also reported cases despite tightened borders.
Meanwhile, the number of omicron cases in South Africa, where the variant was discovered four weeks ago, doubled from Tuesday to Wednesday.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding omicron and its impact, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his stance that the Fed will consider speeding up asset tapering when it meets from Dec. 14 to 15. This could also mean a quicker-than-expected interest rate hike.
""If nothing else, Powell's repeat testimony tells you he is not in the least unhappy about how markets have interpreted what he said earlier,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
""The truth is we are less than a week into the two-to-three-week timeframe that anyone worth listening to, epidemiologists, not market analysts, say is necessary before an informed judgment can be made with respect both to the seriousness of this COVID-19 variant and the efficacy of existing vaccines,” the note added."

(Reuters) - The safe-haven yen hovered near a seven-week high on Thursday while the rand and riskier currencies languished as the Omicron coronavirus variant established itself as the dominant strain in South Africa and continued to spread globally.
Early indications suggesting Omicron may be markedly more contagious than previous variants have rattled financial markets on worries that a return to travel bans and lockdowns could choke off the nascent global recovery.
The strain has been found in places as widespread as Australia, Britain, Canada and Japan, even as those countries rapidly tighten their borders.
Against Japan's currency, the U.S. dollar edged 0.11% higher to 112.875 yen, but remained close to Tuesday's low of 112.535, a level not seen since Oct. 11.
Against the South African rand, the greenback was off 0.12% at 16.0025, after a more than 1% surge overnight.
The number of new cases reported in South Africa - where Omicron was first discovered four weeks ago - doubled from Tuesday to Wednesday. The country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases said 74% of all the virus genomes it had sequenced last month had been of the new variant.
The first case in the United States, reported on Wednesday, was a fully vaccinated person in California who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive seven days later.
Despite the uncertainty spawned by Omicron, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in Day 2 of testimony to Congress on Wednesday that he and fellow policymakers will consider at their Dec. 14-15 meeting a faster taper of stimulus, which could open the door to earlier interest rates hikes.
""If nothing else, (Powell's repeat testimony) tells you he is not in the least unhappy about how markets have interpreted what he said earlier,"" Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), wrote in a note to clients.
""The truth is we are less than a week into the 2-3 week timeframe that anyone worth listening to - epidemiologists, not market analysts - say is necessary before an informed judgement can be made with respect both to the seriousness of this COVID-19 variant and the efficacy of existing vaccines.""
The dollar index, which measures the currency versus six peers, edged 0.03% higher to 96.07, consolidating in the middle of its range over the past two weeks, when it also rose as high as 96.938 for the first time since July of last year.
The risk-sensitive Aussie was about flat at $0.7105, not far from Tuesday's low of $0.7063, its weakest since early November of last year.

Sterling, often considered a risk-on currency, was little changed at $1.3276. It plunged to a near one-year low of $1.31945 on Tuesday.
The euro was steady at $1.1316, continuing its recovery after dipping to a near 17-month low of $1.1186 last month.

The currency was around 13.34 per dollar in early Asian trading Thursday, down 0.7% from the New York close. It weakened to 13.356 late in New York trading Wednesday shortly after the news that Treasury and Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan is leaving his post after being fired by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
That was a paring of the day’s earlier advance and though it recovered slightly into the U.S. close, it dipped once more in the new trading day.
Elvan will be replaced with Nureddin Nebati, according to a decree published in the Official Gazette.
The firing comes amid an ongoing rift over monetary policy that has seen the currency collapsing to record lows, fueled by central bank interest-rate cuts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered from a loss on Wednesday after reports the Omicron coronavirus variant is spreading and oil prices turned down, hurting commodity currencies.
The dollar index against major currencies was up 01% in the afternoon in New York after having fallen 0.3% in the morning. The greenback gained against the dollars of Canada, Australia and New Zealand and against the euro and British pound.
""What you are seeing is a classic risk-off move in FX markets and that means the dollar outperforms against the commodity currencies,"" said Erik Bregar, an independent foreign exchange analyst.
The dollar lost to the Japanese yen currency, which is often seen as a safer haven, giving up 0.3% to 112.805.
The shifts underscored the hour-to-hour fragility of foreign exchange rates as traders weigh what the Omicron variant might do to plans that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Tuesday to move more quickly to raise U.S. interest rates.
The variant is becoming dominant in South Africa and has appeared in the United States.
""We've gotten these conflicting claims about the new variant, and Powell's comments really threw the markets for a loop,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
""People are still pretty nervous,"" Chandler said.
The dollar's rebound started as a report from the Institute for Supply Management came out showing that U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in November amid strong demand for goods, keeping inflation high as factories continued to struggle with pandemic-related shortages of raw materials.
An earlier report on U.S. private payrolls suggested that Friday will bring a ""solid jobs report"" when the government posts more comprehensive payroll numbers, Chandler said.
""Friday's U.S. jobs data is the next big thing,"" he said. 
The greenback is up nearly 7% this year. November was its strongest month since June.
The euro lost 0.2% on the day to $1.1314 at 3:21 pm ET (1507 GMT). 
The British pound, often considered a risk-on currency, fell back 0.2% against the dollar after having been up 0.4%. The pound is struggling to recover after reaching its lowest level in nearly a year earlier this week on fears over vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant.
The Australian dollar lost 0.4% to $0.7103 and the New Zealand dollar lost 0.3% to $0.6805. [AUD/] 

Prior to the tailspin caused by Omicron's advent, the main driver of exchange rates had been expectations of the different speeds at which central banks will raise interest rates.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A sharply fluctuating Turkish lira flirted with record lows on Wednesday as the central bank said it had intervened to prop up the currency, while President Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed his determination to stick with steep rate cuts. 
The emerging market currency logged its second worst month ever in November, hammered by Erdogan's widely criticised endorsement of sharp monetary easing despite soaring inflation. 
The central bank - which Erdogan has overhauled and pressured this year - said it had intervened directly in the market ""due to unhealthy price formations in exchange rates"". 
The lira, which had earlier weakened as far as 13.87 to the dollar, rebounded to 12.42 - a rally of more than 8% on the day. However, by 1613 GMT, it was just 0.5% firmer at 13.3485.
""We have no doubt that (CB) intervention will fail if the intention is to stabilize the currency, though it could provide some more two-way risk in the near term. In fact, the move worries us even more,"" said Brown Brothers Harriman.
""Spending precious FX reserves suggests that the government is still holding the line in its economic policies, making the adjustment even more painful.""
Erdogan is putting his political future nL1N2SM0N5 on the line with a risky wager that driving down interest rates will reverse his skidding opinion polls ahead of elections due by mid-2023, despite the heavy economic toll that a sliding lira has taken on voters.
The currency slumped to an all-time low 14.0 on Tuesday after Erdogan defended the economic policy and as the dollar benefited from hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve comments.
On Wednesday, for the sixth time in two weeks, Erdogan affirmed his commitment to low interest rates, vowing to fix inflation rapidly and telling Turks not to panic.
""Turkey has now abandoned the monetary policy based on high interest rates that caused several developing countries to remain stagnant,"" Erdogan said, as data from Copley Fund Research showed global emerging market equity fund managers had cut their Turkish bank holdings to a record low.
""Instead, we have transitioned to a growth strategy ... Interest rates are an evil that make the rich richer and the poor poorer,"" Erdogan told lawmakers from his ruling AK Party. 
The currency has lost as much as 47% of its value this year, sinking some 30% in November alone, rapidly eroding Turks' earnings and savings, upending household budgets and even leaving them scrambling to find some imported medicines.
'NO TURNING BACK'
Lira implied volatility gauges soared with the nine-month gauge hitting 35.8, revisiting the all-time record of August 2018, while longer-dated Turkish dollar-denominated sovereign bonds maturing 2030 or beyond slipped as much as 0.9 cent in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.
In an interview with state broadcaster TRT on Tuesday evening, Erdogan said there was ""no turning back"" from the new policy, defending an easing policy which most economists have called reckless. 
Support for his AK Party is tumbling in opinion polls that show Erdogan would lose head-to-head against his most likely presidential opponents.
Under pressure from Erdogan nL8N2SM2EN, the central bank has since September cut its policy rate by 400 basis points to 15%, leaving real rates deeply negative, with inflation near 20%. It is widely expected to lower it again in December. 
The opposition has called for an immediate policy reversal and snap elections.

Virtually all other central banks are raising rates or preparing to do so, and economists say the depreciation and accelerated inflation - which is seen reaching 30% next year due in large part to the currency devaluation - will derail Erdogan's plan.
A Reuters poll forecasts that November inflation, due on Friday, will rise to a three-year high of 20.7%.

Turkey’s central bank intervened in markets by selling foreign currencies for the first time in seven years to stem the lira’s decline against the U.S. dollar.
The intervention is due to “unhealthy price formations” in the market, the monetary authority said in a statement.
The lira swung to gains after the statement and was trading 0.8% stronger at 13.3855 per dollar as of 12:21 p.m. in Istanbul.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Wednesday, consolidating after strong gains during the previous session after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the U.S. central bank is likely to speed up the tapering of its asset purchases.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.970, after having recorded its biggest monthly rise since June in November on the idea of U.S. rates being hiked sooner rather than later.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1337, having dropped as far as 1.1258 on Tuesday, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 113.37, GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.3316, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.4% to 0.7151, rebounding from a one-year low.
Driving the earlier dollar gains were comments from the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
""At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, perhaps a few months sooner,"" said Powell, while indicating that it was time to ""retire"" the word transitory when talking about high inflation levels.
At its November meeting, the Fed said it would reduce bond purchases by $15 billion a month. A move to speed this up would likely bring forward the time the central bank feels confident in raising its benchmark interest rates. 
The dollar had been hit earlier in the week as traders preferred safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on a burst of risk aversion surrounding the emergence of the omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus. 
Powell's testimony continues later on Wednesday, while the release of the U.S. private payrolls will also be in the spotlight ahead of Friday’s official monthly jobs report.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3661 after the pair earlier fell to a six-month low of 6.3596, with the yuan resilient after the release of better-than-expected official manufacturing PMI data from November. The Korean won also hit a two-week high after stronger-than-expected trade data, the two data releases showing that global manufacturing remained in rude health last month.
USD/TRY fell 0.1% to 13.4557, with the lira edging higher after falling to a record low on Tuesday as Powell’s comments compounded concerns over President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s drive for lower borrowing costs despite raging inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's new political leadership is calling on the country's financial bureaucrats to ramp up efforts toward issuing a digital currency, pointing to China's far quicker progress as a potential challenge to the global economic order.
The government has increased staff looking into legal and technical aspects of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which are digital forms of existing currencies.
While the political attention has yet to translate into any other direct investment, it is also likely to keep the Bank of Japan (BOJ) under pressure to shift away from its cautious, baby-step approach toward issuing a digital yen, analysts say.
""We must think about what could happen to Japan's national security if other countries move ahead on CBDC,"" said Takayuki Kobayashi, a minister overseeing economic security - a new role created under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's administration.
""Japan must speed things up so it's ready to issue a digital yen any time,"" he said.
A global front-runner, China has already run tests in major cities for a possible launch of a digital yuan next year. Japan, along with other G7 advanced nations, have moved much slower.
The BOJ only started the first phase of its experiment in April, and says it has no immediate plans to issue a digital yen. Pilot programmes, if any, won't take place until 2023 at the earliest.
That lukewarm stance may be put to test as Kishida has made economic security a policy priority, and framed questions around CBDC beyond finance into one of national security.
While G7 central banks generally agree on the need to counter China on issues around privacy, the case is particularly strong for Japan as lawmakers worry about the growing economic might of its assertive neighbour.
Some influential ruling party lawmakers see China's advances on CBDC as a potential threat to the dollar's status as a global reserve currency, and the financial dominance of Washington - Japan's biggest ally.
A close aide to Kishida told Reuters Japan must ""work closely with the United States to counter any attempt that threatens the dollar's reserve-currency status,"" adding the BOJ was coordinating with the finance ministry to ensure speedy progress for issuing a digital yen.
Opposition parties have also called in their election campaign platforms for speeding up CBDC plans. 
BOJ officials say China's plan won't directly affect the timeframe for their CBDC experiments as the key purpose of issuing a digital yen is to provide convenient, efficient payment and settlement means to the public.
What could affect the BOJ more than China's plan would be how quickly its European and U.S. counterparts announce plans for issuing CBDCs, say sources familiar with its thinking.
Debate over issuing a digital yen may intensify next year as Kishida's administration lays out details of its economic security plans, and as China is seen promoting its digital yuan at the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in February.

""It's clear Kishida's administration and his ruling party are keen on issuing a digital yen,"" said former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi, who is currently an economist at Japan's Nomura Research Institute.
""If China launches a digital yuan next year and Europe's central bank announces plans to issue a digital euro, that will have a huge impact on Japan and pile pressure on the BOJ.""

490,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's second foreign exchange report, yet to be released, risks labeling some U.S. trading partners as currency manipulators, although the department held off from applying that label in its last report.
The foreign exchange manipulator designation is based on three broad criteria: a $20 billion-plus trade surplus with the United States, a current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP, and currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product.
The Treasury in April stopped short of formally branding Vietnam, Switzerland and Taiwan as currency manipulators even though they tripped some of its thresholds under a 2015 U.S. trade law. The Trump administration had labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators in December 2020. 
In its April report, the Treasury said it found 11 economies warranted placement on its ""Monitoring List"" of major trading partners. 
There is no automatic punishment resulting from a currency manipulator label, though U.S. law requires Washington to demand negotiations with designated trading partners.
For the next report, originally due on Oct. 15, analysts said the following trading partners are at risk - but doubt they will get the label. 
Graphic: FX valuations, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byprjkagape/FX%20valuations.JPG SWITZERLAND
* Switzerland was labeled a currency manipulator by the Trump administration in December 2020, but was spared being formally branded in Yellen's first report in April.
* Switzerland is likely to meet all three criteria, although analysts doubt it will be given the designation.
    * Switzerland's bilateral goods trade surplus of $39 billion in the 12 months to June 2021 exceeds the Treasury's threshold, and it has a current account surplus equivalent to 3% of GDP in the 12 months to the end of the second quarter.
* Although the Swiss National Bank has scaled back its interventions recently, it spent 25.4 billion francs in the 12 months to June 2021 - equivalent to 3.5% of Swiss economic output and more than the 2% limit set by the Treasury.
    * Still, analysts believe Switzerland won't be on the list because the Treasury Department (TD) can also look at other factors like currency development, monetary policy and trade policy action.
TAIWAN
* Taiwan was last formally labeled a currency manipulator by the United States in December 1992. It was put back on the monitoring list in 2020.
* Taiwan breached all three of the criteria, according to analysts at TD, although they do not expect Taiwan to be labeled a currency manipulator.
* Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit $29.9 billion in 2020, according to official data, almost $7 billion more than in 2019, while the current account surplus last year was around 11% of GDP, exceeding Washington’s criterion.
* In the first nine months of this year Taiwan’s trade surplus with the United States hit $17.94 billion, up $5.13 billion on the year-ago period. The current account surplus in the first half of this year reached around 14.6% of GDP.
* The central bank said in September that in the first half of this year it bought a net $8.73 billion to intervene and ""avoid serious disorder"" in the currency market.By comparison, the central bank purchased a net $39.1 billion for all of 2020. Analysts at TD said Taiwan's purchases amounted to 7.8% of GDP.
* The Taiwan dollar's 5.6% gain against the greenback last year was among the strongest in Asia. It is up about 2.5% against the greenback this year and among the best-performing Asian currencies.
* Taiwan's case is complicated by geopolitical pressures, including heightened military tensions with China, and the island's position as a major exporter of semiconductors that are needed to help ease a supply shortage for U.S. manufacturers.
* The U.S. is likely to take into account both Taiwan’s special economic situation vis-à-vis its booming tech exports and key role in making chips, as well as the need to show U.S. support for Taiwan in the face of Chinese pressure when it comes to making a decision on whether to label it a manipulator.
VIETNAM:
* Vietnam was labeled a currency manipulator by the Trump administration in December 2020 but was spared being formally branded in Yellen's report in April.
* Vietnam met the criteria for its trade surplus with the United States of $83.8 billion and its foreign exchange intervention, 4.1% of GDP, but not on its current account, according to analysts at TD. 
* After having reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to refrain from ""competitive devaluation"" and make its monetary and exchange rate policies more transparent in July, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) stopped buying U.S. dollars in the forward markets after seven months of doing so, and reverted to purchasing spot dollars. 
CHINA

* The Treasury Department under the Trump administration designated China a currency manipulator on Aug. 5, 2019, but in January 2020 Treasury dropped the designation days before the signing of a preliminary agreement to end the China-U.S. trade war.
* Trade remains a contentious bilateral issue despite a recent bilateral summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia. The safe-haven yen held steady, while the risk-sensitive Australian dollar remained near a one-year low after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled quicker asset tapering even as risks from the omicron COVID-19 variant remain.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 95.935 by 11:35 PM ET (4:35 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.30% to 113.46.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.61% to 0.7167 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.51% to 0.6856.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.3626, with China’s Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for November, released earlier in the day, at 49.9.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 1.3319.
As research into current vaccines’ efficacy against the latest variant of COVID-19 continues, some investors are worried that hasty monetary tightening could impact the global economic recovery.
""Investors are staying cautious. It's very difficult to make a judgment about the impact of omicron when we don't have a lot of information,"" Bank of America-Merrill Lynch chief Japan FX strategist Shusuke Yamada told Reuters.
 Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stéphane Bancel said existing COVID-19 vaccines would be less effective against omicron. However, BioNTech SE's (F:22UAy) chief executive Uğur Şahin struck a more cautiously positive note, saying its vaccine developed with  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) would likely offer strong protection against severe disease from omicron.
Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee hearing alongside U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday. In his testimony, he said that the Fed will discuss whether to wrap up asset tapering a few months earlier than scheduled when it meets later in the month.
Although Powell finally veered away from describing high inflation as ""transitory”, he was confident that omicron’s impact would be less severe than when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in 2020.
Investors responded to Powell’s comments by winding up interest rate hike expectations.
Powell and Yellen will testify before the House Financial Services Committee later in the day.
""Powell's unexpectedly hawkish tone overnight, essentially asserting that inflation risk has primacy over growth/omicron risks, should leave the dollar index forging ahead,"" Westpac analysts said in a note. The note also recommended buying dips in the index down to the mid-95 level."

(Reuters) - The safe-haven yen held steady on Wednesday, while the risk-sensitive Australian dollar languished near a one-year low after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalled a faster taper of stimulus despite the risks around the Omicron COVID-19 variant.
Investors fear that hasty monetary tightening could choke off the nascent economic recovery, with little still known about Omicron's potential to evade current vaccine protection or how deadly it might be.
""Investors are staying cautious,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. 
""It's very difficult to make a judgement about the impact of Omicron when we don't have a lot of information."" 
Global markets fell sharply on Tuesday after the head of drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said existing COVID-19 vaccines would be less effective against the new variant, although BioNTech's chief executive struck a cautiously positive note, saying the vaccine it makes with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) would likely offer strong protection against severe disease from Omicron.
The Aussie weakened 0.12% to $0.71245 after dipping as low as $0.7063 of Tuesday for the first time since Nov. 3, 2020. The New Zealand dollar was largely flat at $0.68195 after also touching the lowest since early November of last year at $0.6773 in the previous session.
The greenback ticked 0.09% higher to 113.26 yen, but still within sight of an overnight low of 112.535, a level not seen since Oct. 11.
Powell said in testimony to Congress on Tuesday that Fed officials will discuss at their Dec. 14-15 policy meeting whether to end bond purchases a few months earlier than had been anticipated. The Fed chief finally did an about face on a long-held contention that inflation would be ""transitory.""
Powell expressed confidence that the impact from Omicron will be far less than in the spring of 2020, when the pandemic erupted.
In response, traders wound up interest rate hike expectations, with money markets now almost fully priced for tightening at the June meeting.
Powell's testimony continues later Wednesday.
""Powell's unexpectedly hawkish tone overnight, essentially asserting that inflation risk has primacy over growth/Omicron risks, should leave the (dollar index) forging ahead,"" Westpac strategists wrote in a client note.
The index, which measures the dollar against six major peers, traded at 95.921 after sliding to 95.544 on Tuesday for the first time since Nov. 18, weighed down largely by an unwinding of bearish bets on the euro, the most heavily weighted component in the basket.
Westpac recommends buying dips in the index down to the mid-95 level.

The single currency slipped 0.04% to $1.1331, down from a two-week high of $1.1387 overnight.
Sterling traded not far from an 11-month low of $1.31945 reached overnight, last changing hands at $1.32955.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen and Swiss Franc gained on Tuesday, with risk appetite plummeting, as investors grew nervous about a suddenly hawkish Federal Reserve that could deliver aggressive rate hikes and derail a nascent economic recovery.
Worries about the new Omicron coronavirus variant also kept a bid in these safe-haven currencies.
The dollar, on the other hand, retreated on Tuesday after rising when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of inflation had increased and suggested retiring the term ""transitory"" to describe the surge in prices. He also pushed for accelerating the tapering of Fed asset purchases.
His comments suggested an urgency to undertake quick monetary policy action that financial markets may not be prepared for, analysts said.
""Overall, the risks to the short-term outlook keep on growing. Investors have always viewed the Fed as the safety net, but the Fed looks like its panicking here,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at OANDA in New York.
""The Fed was wrong on inflation. And now it appears they're going to rush tapering and quickly deliver rate hikes. And if the inflationary pressure remains, you could see an accelerated rate hike cycle that could threaten financial conditions.""
In late trading, the dollar fell 0.4% against the yen to 113.065 yen. 
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar dropped 0.4% to 0.9185 francs.
The dollar index fell 0.3% to 95.90. It rallied earlier, while U.S. stocks fell, after Powell's hawkish remarks.
""Traders are in 'sell first and ask questions later' mode,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
Earlier, the yen and Swiss franc rose against the dollar, after  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s CEO said the coronavirus vaccines will likely be less effective against the Omicron variant as they have been against other variants.
Adding to the fears, drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) said on Tuesday its COVID-19 antibody treatment could be less effective against Omicron.
The warnings reinforced a view that the global economy could take longer to return to pre-pandemic levels than many had been expecting.
Against the U.S. dollar, the euro rose 0.4% to$1.1335, posting its biggest three-day rising streak since December 2020.
Prior to Omicron's arrival, the main driver of currency moves was how traders perceived the different speeds at which global central banks would end pandemic-era stimulus and raise interest rates as they looked to combat rising inflation without choking off growth.
Cryptocurrencies also had a volatile trading session. Ethereum was last up 4.8% at $4,668. Bitcoin was down 0.3% at $57,645.

Investing.com — The U.S. Dollar staged an extremely strong rally against other major currencies Tuesday after comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in which he said it's time to retire the word transitory and indicated the central bank could speed up the pace of cutting its monthly bond buying. 
Speaking to the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said, ""At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, perhaps a few months sooner.""
At the Fed's November meeting, it said it would reduce bond purchases by $15 billion a month. 
Furthermore, Powell said the risk of persistently higher inflation has increased, and he expects high inflation through next year, although the baseline expectation is that it will move back down over the course of 2022.
Reacting to Powell's comments, U.S. dollar-related assets moved in the greenback's favor. The EUR/USD fell over 100 pips, likewise the GBP/USD and other dollar pairs, while XAU/USD dropped around $38.
A notable remark from the Fed chair was on the use of the word ""transitory,"" relating to the current stance of Fed officials on inflation. However, Powell said it is probably not beneficial anymore.
Powell stated, ""the word transitory has different meanings for different people,"" adding that they ""tend to use it to mean it won't leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation.""
Nevertheless, he thinks it's ""probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.""
Powell is not diverging from the current stance that inflation is temporary, but that the word itself needs to be retired, and the Fed needs to explain more clearly what it means."

ZURICH (Reuters) -The Swiss National Bank is no longer standing in the way of the franc's appreciation, according to data published on Monday, in an eye-catching change in view of the safe-haven currency's rise to its highest against the euro in more than six years. 
The central bank's apparent stance will confound investors who have grown used to the SNB's mantra that it would fight tooth and nail with negative interest rates and foreign currency purchases to restrain the Swissie.
On Monday, the franc rose to 1.0426 against the euro - its highest level since July 2015 - fueled by the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant, low Swiss inflation and the weakness of the euro.
The level is not far off the 1:1 against the euro the franc briefly reached after the SNB's last policy shift in Jan. 2015.
But the latest sight deposit data - a proxy for the SNB's interventions - increased by only 94 million francs last week, a fraction of the forex purchases seen last year.
One factor for the small increase could be the withdrawal by bank customers of cash, economists say, which happens every year in the lead up to Christmas and reduces the amount of cash the banks hold on sight with the SNB. 
""Still, an increase of less than 100 million francs shows the SNB chose not to defend the 1.05 level,"" said J.Safra Sarasin economist Karsten Junius.
The development could mean the SNB has given up restraining the franc at its current level, because of benign Swiss inflation and the country's robust economy.
Instead, the central bank may be storing up its firepower to prevent rapid and large-scale appreciation instead, economists say.
The SNB declined to comment about Monday's data and the economists' reaction to it.
""If the franc stays at this level of around 1.05, a little bit above, a little bit below, the SNB won't do a lot,"" said Thomas Stucki, the chief investment officer at St Galler Kantonalbank and the former manager of the SNB's foreign currency reserves.
PARITY SEEN 'IN NEXT 2-3 YEARS'
""They will prevent the movement below 1.04 to 1.03"" he added. ""Then they will step up interventions.""
The franc was on course to eventually reach parity, Stucki added.
""It's clear from the development of inflation in Europe and Switzerland the franc will become more expensive over time,"" he said. ""We don't expect parity to be reached next year, but we think it will happen in the next two to three years.""
Over the weekend, governing board member Andrea Maechler said the SNB was monitoring the franc's level, although the central bank didn't target a specific rate, she said.
Swiss inflation at 1.2% is well within the SNB's definition of price stability and reduces the need to act.
""The long-term policy of the SNB remains in place: fight a strong overvaluation of the Swiss franc. The question is, however, what a strong overvaluation means,"" said UBS economist Alessandro Bee.
Due to the much stronger inflation in the Eurozone than in Switzerland, the fair value of the franc has climbed to 1.11 to the euro from 1.20 last year, he said.
""From this perspective at 1.05 the franc is not strongly over-valued anymore,"" said Bee. ""This warrants a lower intervention threshold for the SNB, even at this point it is unclear where this new threshold exactly is.""
The stance of the SNB will be tested in the coming days, particularly if the omicron variant of coronavirus increases demand for the franc.
""Now the situation is getting more complicated for the SNB,"" said ING economist Charlotte de Montpellier. ""There is a risk of a renewed flight to safety and a strengthening of the currencies considered as safe havens, and therefore of the Swiss franc."" 

Until now, the SNB has done the right thing not wasting too much money defending the franc, said J Safra Sarasin economist Junius.
""I do think they will try to halt any appreciation at 1.03. That would be last line of defence before parity,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar retreated Tuesday as fresh concerns about the impact of the omicron coronavirus variant prompted a rush into the safe havens, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% lower at 95.965, at a fresh one-week low.
USD/JPY fell 0.4% to 113.11, just above Friday’s low of 113.05, while USD/CHF dropped 0.3% to 0.9204, as markets rapidly repriced the risk of interest rate hikes in the U.S.
In prepared testimony ahead of his appearance later in the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the omicron variant of the coronavirus poses risks to both sides of the central bank’s mandate to achieve stable prices and maximum employment.
“The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation,” Powell said in prepared testimony released Monday. “Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people’s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions.” 
Powell will likely flesh these comments out later alongside Treasury chief Janet Yellen.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.1328, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3323, off Friday’s 11-month low of 1.3278, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7118, just above a 12-month low, and the NZD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.6807.
This sudden burst of risk aversion followed comments from the head of drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), one of the pharmaceutical companies supplying most of the developed world with vaccines to combat the Covid-19 virus, which raised concerns that the omicron variant could cause more widespread global economic disruption. 
Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times that the existing vaccines would struggle to cope with the omicron variant, predicting a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness.
The World Health Organization has warned of a ""very high"" risk of infection surges from the new variant, and countries around the world have reacted quickly to tighten border controls.
President Joe Biden had boosted sentiment on Monday by stating that the United States would not reinstate lockdowns, even in the face of the uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant.
Also of interest Tuesday will be the release of the Eurozone CPI number for November, which is expected to climb to 4.5% on the year from 4.1% the previous month.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3723 after China recorded surprise growth in factory activity in November, the first in three months, as its manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 50.1, higher than the previous month’s 49.2 figure.
The non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, higher than the previous month’s 52.4 figure.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, just above a one-week low hit during the previous week, as concerns that the new omicron COVID-19 variant would derail the U.S. economic recovery and delay U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes subsided.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.21% to 96.135 by 11:07 PM ET (4:07 AM GMT). The index was up from the low of 95.973 hit on Friday, when it suffered its biggest one-day drop since May 2021.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 113.64.
The AUD/USD pair inched 0.08% to 0.7146 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.6828.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.24% to 6.3720. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.1, while the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, in November.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 1.3321.
The World Health Organization warned of a ""very high"" risk of infection surges from omicron, with some countries already tightening border controls. However, U.S. President Joe Biden said that the U.S. would not reinstate lockdowns, which gave investor sentiment a small boost.
Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell still expects inflation to recede over 2022 as supply and demand come into better balance. However, he added on Monday that the “recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation.”
Increased inflationary pressures could potentially speed up interest rate hikes, but Omicron's discovery initially saw investors push back bets for Fed monetary policy tightening because of the risk to growth.
""A less dire assessment of omicron has enabled the dollar to claw back some of its losses,"" but ""the somewhat underwhelming bounce in global markets suggests that there is still a heightened level of concern about the variant,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
Continued strength in the U.S. economy will buoy the greenback, while the Australian dollar continues to look weak and a break below $0.7106 ""just looks like a matter of time,” the note added.
The euro was flat at $1.12955, after falling to a nearly 17-month low of $1.1186 as the European Central Bank sticks to its dovish stance on inflation."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar rose to the highest level since mid-October, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Monday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $22.11 billion for the week ended Nov. 23, up from net longs of $18.30 billion in the previous week. U.S. dollar net long positioning rose for the first time in seven weeks.

Investigators from the State Supervisory Council will be authorized to seek prosecution if criminal activity is suspected, the person told Bloomberg on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose confidential details. The state-run Anadolu Agency, which first reported the impending probe on Saturday, said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has ordered the council to determine whether currency manipulation took place. 
The council will borrow staff and requisition documents and other information from relevant government agencies, the person familiar said. The probe will center on purchases above a still-undetermined threshold, excluding those that stem from “necessity” and transactions related to corporate debt, the person said.
Erdogan Says Turkey Under Attack by ‘Money Barons’ After Pivot
The lira weakened almost 24% against the dollar in November as Erdogan’s push for lower interest rates -- designed to turbo-charge growth and create jobs -- instead resulted in concern over price shocks. The central bank has cut borrowing costs by 4 percentage points to 15% since September.
On Monday, Erdogan stood by his unorthodox argument that lower rates will eventually slow inflation.
“I have always argued for lower interest rates and repeatedly said rates should be lower,” the president was cited by state media as saying. “I have never advocated and will not advocate interest rate increases.” 
The council is expected to share the results of its investigation with the central bank, the banking regulator, the markets regulator and the Financial Crimes Investigation Board and may request them to take action, the person said. It may also file criminal complaints, the person said. Investigators aren’t bound to any deadlines. 
The council didn’t respond to a phone query from Bloomberg on Monday.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Monday, boosted by higher U.S. Treasury yields as traders considered Friday’s sharp moves on the discovery of the omicron coronavirus variant as overdone.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 96.310, after dipping to a one-week low of 95.973 on Friday.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 113.42, after the yen, which had been the biggest beneficiary of Friday’s flight to quality, surged as much as 2% on Friday, with the pair dropping to 113.05.
EUR/USD fell 0.4% to 1.1271, while GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3329, off Friday’s 11-month low of 1.3278, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7147, recovering after a 1% tumble on Friday that saw it dip to 0.7112 for the first time since Aug. 20.
The World Health Organization said on Sunday that it is not yet clear if the new omicron coronavirus variant is more transmissible compared to other variants or if it causes more severe disease.
Health experts from South Africa, where the new variant was first detected, have indicated that the symptoms from the omicron variant have been mild so far, although they also pointed out that their population is relatively young, and that the number of 'breakthrough' infections of vaccinated people was significant.
Vaccine makers have indicated that they will be able to reformulate their drugs in pretty short order, and this has prompted traders to unwind a lot of Friday’s sharp moves, which were all the sharper for taking place on a day when liquidity was thin due to the U.S. holiday weekend.
The benchmark 10-year yield jumped as much as 7 basis points to 1.54%, although it currently trades at 1.52%, having plunged 16 basis points on Friday - the steepest since March 2020. 
Aside from the news surrounding the omicron variant, “the general environment in FX remains quite supportive for the dollar, as the FOMC minutes and a bunch of good data kept market speculation on faster tapering and earlier tightening alive,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “On top of this, the worsening contagion situation in Europe and risk of fresh containment measures are generating further divergence in policy expectations between the ECB and Fed.”
Several officials from the European Central Bank, including President Christine Lagarde, have speaking duties on Monday, and investors will be looking for clues on the central bank’s thinking ahead of its meeting on Dec. 16. ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said the bank expects inflation to peak this month. Preliminary German inflation data for November are due in the course of the morning.
ECB officials are due to receive new forecasts that are likely to show inflation climbing at a higher rate than expected earlier, but they will also have to weigh up the dangers posed by the pandemic following the return of lockdowns to some parts of Europe, as well as the discovery of the new variant.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Currency markets calmed on Monday in Asia after the initial shock of Omicron's discovery sent investors scurrying for cover last week, but analysts warned of more volatility with little still known about the new coronavirus strain.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar rose 0.37% to $0.7139, recovering after a 1% tumble on Friday that saw it dip to $0.71125 for the first time since Aug. 20.
The Mexican peso also rebounded, surging 0.93% to 21.7280 per dollar, after slumping to its weakest in almost 14 months at 22.1540 on Friday.
The safe-harbour yen, which had been the biggest beneficiary of the flight to quality, weakened 0.09% to 113.60 per dollar. The Japanese currency surged as much as 2% at one point on Friday to 113.05.
Fellow haven the Swiss franc sank 0.45% to 0.9257 per dollar.
The South African rand recovered from Friday's one-year low at 16.3675 per dollar, jumping 0.93% to 16.1400.
South Africa discovered the Omicron variant last week, and countries globally have been quick to tighten border controls with mutations in the spike protein suggesting it could be resistant to current vaccines.
Despite the speed of the response, Omicron has since been detected in places including Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany and Hong Kong.
On a reassuring note, a South African doctor who was one of the first to suspect a different coronavirus strain said that symptoms of Omicron were so far ""very mild"".
BioNTech said Friday it may know within two weeks if the vaccine it developed with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) needs to be reworked.
""Until then, market volatility is likely to remain elevated,"" Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), wrote in a client note. ""Markets have been forced to reassess the global growth outlook until we know more.""
""We expect currencies to be volatile this week,"" echoed Joseph Capurso, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY). ""It will not take much negative news about Omicron to push AUD below $0.7000.""
President Joe Biden will give an update later on Monday of the U.S. response to the new variant.
The U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against six major peers - traded at 96.283, after dipping to a one-week low of 95.973 on Friday.
While the dollar stands to benefit from the uncertainty because of its status as a safe haven, Omicron clouds the outlook for when the Federal Reserve - and other global central banks - can raise interest rates.
The euro, which jumped 0.98% on Friday as traders closed out short positions, dropped 0.32% to $1.12785.
Several officials from the European Central Bank, which has maintained a dovish stance in the face of mounting inflation pressures, have speaking duties on Monday, including ECB president Christine Lagarde.

Sterling was about flat at $1.33325, off Friday's 11-month low at $1.3278.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with investors slowly regaining their risk appetite after the discovery of the omicron COVID-19 variant. However, caution remained as research continues on this new strain.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.19% to 96.290 by 10:52 PM ET (3:52 AM GMT), after falling to a one-week low of 95.973 on Friday. Although the safe-haven U.S. currency is poised to benefit from the uncertainty, the outlook for when the U.S. Federal Reserve and other key central banks will hike interest rates is now uncertain.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.33% to 113.68. The yen has been the biggest beneficiary of the flight to safety, surging up to 2% to 113.05 on Friday.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.27% to 0.7143, with the Australian dollar recovering after a 1% tumble on Friday. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.6832.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.16% to 6.3822 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.3333.
The discovery of the omicron variant in South Africa last week prompted some countries to implement border controls. However, cases have already been reported in places such as Australia, the U.K., Canada, Germany and Hong Kong.
Although still under study, the mutations in omicron’s spike protein suggest it could be resistant to current vaccines. BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) said on Friday it could know within two weeks if the vaccine it developed with  Pfizer  Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - News of a coronavirus variant potentially resistant to current vaccines sent investors dashing for the safety of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on Friday, and traders also took profits after an extended rally in the U.S. dollar.
The gains in the yen and the franc came at the expense of the growth-sensitive Australian dollar and Norwegian crown, though thinner volumes after Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday made market moves more volatile.
The United States will restrict travel from South Africa - where the new mutation was discovered - and neighboring countries beginning Monday, a senior Biden administration official said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was designating the variant, named omicron, as being ""of concern,"" a label applied only to four variants to date. It could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant's mutations and potential dangers.
""If we’re looking at something like this where we have new mutations on mutations of a spike protein it almost feels like the initial working assumption for most market participants is that this is a new phase of the pandemic,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
""New lockdowns and restrictions will maybe be put in place, and it certainly feels like we're going to need a new vaccine as well,"" he added.
One of the main gainers was the yen, which bounced off five-year lows hit this week against the greenback, and jumped almost 2% to a high of 113.09, its best day since March 2020.
The euro rose 0.97% to a high of $1.1312, though it fell to more than six-year lows against the resurgent Swiss franc, at 1.0428 francs per euro.
""This is a textbook flight to quality into yen and the Swiss franc on the new virus strain with the thin liquidity also a factor, which may accelerate the unwinding of short bond positions,"" Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London, said.
Speculative accounts had been massively short safe-haven assets, with U.S. CFTC figures showing net bearish positioning at $1.2 billion and $10.3 billion for the yen and Swiss franc, respectively, in the latest week.
The dollar index dipped 0.75% to 96.030, after reaching a 16-month high of 96.938 on Wednesday. It has jumped from 93.872 on Nov. 9 as investors increased bets that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates in mid-2022 to thwart stubbornly high inflation.
CIBC’s Rai said Friday's decline in the greenback was more likely due to investors taking profits after the currency’s recent gains, and not a change in the dollar’s safe-haven status.
""The near-term move is mostly about extended positioning and closing those out. Once that becomes a little bit more finely balanced and if we are in a risk-off scenario, then I would expect the dollar to continue to outperform,"" he said.
Sterling briefly slipped to a new 2021 low below $1.3278 as the jitters prompted some to scale back bets on an interest rate hike in December.
In the crypto currency market bitcoin fell as low as $53,524, the lowest since Oct. 10, while ethereum dropped to $3,917, the lowest since Oct. 28.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee saw its worst week in seven on Friday, while the benchmark 10-year yield closed at its lowest in more than two weeks as concerns over a COVID variant spooked markets across the globe.
Shares and currencies in Asia's emerging markets fell sharply as investors fled riskier assets after the detection of the significant mutation, which in-turn strengthened safe-haven assets such as the dollar.
The partially convertible rupee ended at 74.87 per dollar compared to its close of 74.51. It touched a low of 74.9250 earlier, its lowest since Nov. 1. On the week, the unit fell 0.9%, its biggest weekly loss since the week to Oct. 8, snapping five straight week of gains.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield ended at 6.33%, its lowest close since Nov. 9 and down 4 basis points on day. 
""Buying being seen in bonds is largely on account of the new variant today. The market now expects the RBI to be dovish due to the uncertainty,"" said Murthy Nagarajan, head of fixed income at Tata Asset Management. 
""Some people are also toying with the idea that they may not even hike the reverse repo rate"". 
Indian shares sank nearly 3% in response to fears the new variant could wreak more economic damage. (BO)
The Reserve Bank of India is due to announce its monetary policy committee's decision after a three-day meeting on Dec. 8 and a large section of the market has been expecting them to start raising the reserve repo rate to try to normalise the policy rate corridor to pre-pandemic levels. 
The central bank has already started conducting variable rate reverse repo auctions of slightly longer tenors to temporarily absorb the massive liquidity surplus in the banking system but has shied away from announcing any more permanent measures so far. 
Traders expect the 10-year bond yield to trade in a 6.25% to 6.40% range until the policy decision, while the rupee is expected to largely track domestic shares and dollar moves for direction. It is broadly expected to hold between 74.25 to 75 per dollar range over the next two weeks.

Moves in global crude oil prices will also be closely monitored as they have a large impact on India's import bill, with the country importing more than three-fourths of its oil requirements.
Oil prices fell more than 5% to a two-month low as the new added to expectations a supply surplus could swell in the first quarter.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Friday, weighed by gains to the safe haven yen and Swiss franc, as traders dumped riskier currencies in the wake of the discovery of a new highly-mutated coronavirus variant.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 96.635, moving further away from Wednesday's high of 96.938, the strongest level since July 2020. 
USD/JPY fell 0.7% to 114.52 and USD/CHF dropped 0.6% to 0.9307 as traders leapt into the traditional safe havens of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on the announcement of a new Covid-19 variant that had mutated so far from the original strain that it could be resistant to vaccines.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.1240 and GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3300.
The World Health Organisation announced that it will hold an emergency meeting later Friday to discuss the implications for treatments in the wake of this discovery. While it isn't yet clear how virulent the new strain is, it is the first strain that has shown itself to be competitive with the Delta variant that has been responsible for most infections this year.
The U.K. Health Security Agency said that the variant, called B.1.1.529 or nu, has a spike protein that was dramatically different from the one in the original coronavirus, which the current generation of Covid-19 vaccines are designed to fight. 
Although the dollar moved lower, the hardest hit currency was the South African rand as the variant was first detected in southern Africa, with USD/ZAR climbing 1.6% to 16.2171, a more than one-year high. 
Also whacked was the risk sensitive Australian dollar, with AUD/USD falling to a three-month low, down 0.8% at 0.7130, even as Australian retail sales grew a better-than-expected 4.9% month-on-month in October. The New Zealand dollar followed suit, falling 0.7% to 0.6811, also a three-month low.  
""People are reacting with the uncertainty about what this means. You shoot first and ask questions later when this sort of news erupts,"" Reuters reported Ray Attrill, Head of FX Strategy at NAB in Sydney, as saying.
That said, the U.S. dollar index is still up around 0.6% on the week and is set for its fifth straight weekly gain. Traders are positioning for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates by the middle of next year, while central banks in Europe, Japan and elsewhere stick to more dovish stances.
ECB President Christine Lagarde is set to speak later in the session, and she rowed back last week on the notion of early rate hikes in the Eurozone. Additionally, the minutes of the central bank’s last meeting suggested a cautious approach to any policy changes.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A weak yen, once seen as favourable for Japan's exports-focused economy, has now become a pain point as it eats into household finances and confounds policymakers.
A gradual shift by Japan's manufacturers to offshore production means a weak yen has become less of a boon for local exporters than it was about a decade ago.
That shift means some at Japan's finance ministry, which is in charge of currency policy and known to step in to counter sharp yen rises, are now paying more attention to the downsides of a weaker currency, namely the effects of higher import costs.
Putting those concerns into focus this week, the dollar hit 115.525 yen, a level not seen since January 2017, as expectations for higher U.S. interest rates propped up the greenback and Japan's economic outlook darkened.
""A weak yen pushes up import prices, weighing on profits at companies dependent on raw materials imports and household purchasing power,"" Citi economist Kiichi Murashima noted. ""The negative impacts of a weak yen may be larger than before given the penetration ratio of imports is on the rise.""
Reversing the strong yen trend through massive monetary easing was one of the key goals of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies over his eight years in office to 2020. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is expected to follow this strategy.
Over that period, the yen lost 50% against the dollar. However, export volumes remained mostly unchanged, suggesting a weaker currency, while still beneficial for Japanese companies abroad, has not necessarily made the country's goods more attractive to foreign buyers.
A quarter of Japanese manufacturers used offshore production in 2020, compared with 18% in 2010, according to a survey by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
The 2011 earthquake and tsunami accelerated that trend, swinging the trade balance into deficit as exports slowed and imports of fuel surged.
Exports now make up roughly 15% of Japan's economy as of 2020, the second smallest contribution among OECD nations after the United States and down from 17.5% in 2007.
In contrast, the consumer sector's share of GDP has held steady at 53%, making the economy more vulnerable to the surge in imported goods prices caused by a weaker yen.
Up until 2011, Japan would intervene heavily to stop a strong yen from crimping the competitiveness of exports, but it has also on rare occasions stepped it stop the currency falling.
The last time Japan intervened to stop yen declines was 1998 during the Asian Financial Crisis when the dollar broke above 146 yen.
Analysts think such a move is highly unlikely this time, but some analysts see 125 yen as a potential line in the sand.
A Reuters' survey of companies earlier this month showed about third of respondents expected profits to decrease if yen weakness persists.
LESS BANG FOR YOUR YEN
Importantly for policymakers, a battered currency has sapped Japanese households' purchasing power, giving them less for what they pay.
The yen's dwindling value has pushed up prices of brand-name imports ranging from luxury cars to expensive watches to smartphones as well as foodstuff such as U.S. beef imports.
For example, the price of a new-model iPhone has tripled to 190,000 yen over the past decade, equivalent to 60% of the average monthly salary in Japan. Over that period, however, salaries have remained broadly unchanged.
While Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda maintains the merits of yen declines still outweigh the downsides, such a view is not evenly shared.
""The current yen weakness is rather negative, undermining Japanese purchasing power in the long run,"" said a government source with knowledge of the matter, stressing the need to fix public debt and raise productivity to make Japan more competitive.

Some central bankers have also acknowledged the challenge.
""For major companies with operations overseas, a weak yen gives a significant boost to their profits,"" BOJ board member Junko Nakagawa told Bloomberg in an interview published on Friday. ""On the other hand, a weak yen strains firms with domestic operations by pushing up import costs.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia. But losses were minimized as growing concerns about a newly discovered COVID-19 variant dampened investors’ risk appetite.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 96.685 by 9:57 PM ET (2:57 AM GMT). The index moved further away from 96.938, its highest level in nearly 17 months hit on Wednesday. However, it was up 0.73% on the week and set for its fifth straight weekly gain.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.58% to 114.68.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.63% to 0.7145, even as Australian retail sales grew a better-than-expected 4.9% month-on-month in October. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.42% to 0.6830.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.09% to 6.3920 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3304.
The rand fell to a more than one-year low, at 16.17 per dollar, with concerns mounting about the B.1.1.529 COVID-19 variant discovered in South Africa that could make vaccines less effective.
""COVID-19 worries are definitely playing a role in increasing demand for safe havens including the yen, and because South Africa is the location of this new variant, that's an obvious reason to avoid the rand,"" Barclays senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
In Europe, a rising number of COVID-19 cases prompted Germany to consider following neighbor Austria’s lead and re-impose a lockdown.
Meanwhile, an increasingly hawkish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased bets of an interest rate hike by mid-2022, while counterparts in Europe and Japan stick to more dovish stances.
Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated his commitment to massive monetary stimulus last week, while the minutes from the European Central Bank's October meeting, released on Thursday, signaled continued stimulus and a cautious approach to any policy changes.
""If the COVID-19 situation worsens, then dollar-yen could go down further, but otherwise the monetary policy divergence is definitely going to be weighing on the yen in the medium term,"" said Barclay’s Kadota, who predicts dollar-yen will strengthen to 116 and beyond by mid-2022.
On the flip side, 114 should provide a floor for the currency pair in the near term, ""unless the world really changes for the worse,"" he added."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's central bank governor said he discussed recent interest rate cuts with bankers at a meeting on Thursday after a slide in the lira to record lows, and he also said that the banking sector was able to overcome market volatility.
Turkey's lira was flat on Thursday after a historic slide to all-time lows this week, triggered by President Tayyip Erdogan's defence of interest rate cuts, despite widespread criticism of his policy direction.
Governor Sahap Kavcioglu said after the meeting with top bankers and the country's BDDK banking watchdog that they made general evaluations on economic developments, and he said that the banking sector was very strong.
""We informed them about everything, whether it be interest rate cuts and other issues,"" Kavcioglu told reporters after the meeting. ""The sector, central bank and BDDK are very much in harmony and in strong communication.""
The lira was unchanged after the meeting, trading 0.5% firmer at 12.025 to the dollar. Before a rebound in the last two days, it hit a record low of 13.45 on Tuesday, down 45% this year, touching record lows in 11 consecutive sessions.
Global and domestic developments, the markets and banking sector developments were discussed at Thursday's meeting, the Association of Turkish Banks said in a statement, describing the meeting as very beneficial. 
One market participant said the BDDK told the meeting that it would consider measures such as the country's capital adequacy ratio.
The BDDK was not immediately available for comment.
Separately, officials told Reuters Erdogan had ignored appeals, even from within his government, to reverse policy.
INFLATION ON 'VOLATILE COURSE'
The central bank said earlier on Thursday inflation would follow a volatile course in the short term.
It made the comments in the minutes of last week's monetary policy committee meeting, where it cut its policy rate by 100 basis points to 15%. It has lowered the rate by a total 400 points since September.
""The central bank can hasten the end of this overshoot by signaling an end to rate cuts and a willingness to use hikes to defend the lira,"" a note from the Institute of International Finance said.
""This would help re-anchor inflation expectations, which are rising due to FX pass through from devaluation, raising the risk of accelerated dollarization. We maintain our fair value at $/TRY 9.50.""
Many Turks, already grappling with inflation of around 20%, fear price rises will accelerate https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/lira-collapse-leaves-turks-bewildered-opposition-angry-2021-11-23. Opposition politicians have accused Erdogan of dragging the country towards disaster.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped slightly on Thursday but was still close to its highest since July 2020 against the euro, having strengthened due to market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner than other major central banks.
Minutes from the Fed's Nov. 2-3 meeting boosted the dollar on Wednesday as they indicated the Fed had become more concerned about rising inflation. Various policymakers said they would be open to speeding up the taper of their bond-buying programme if high inflation held and move more quickly to raise interest rates.
Data on Wednesday showed U.S. jobless claims were at a 52-year low, consumer spending increased more than expected in October and inflation was rising.
But on Thursday the dollar's upward trend - which has seen it gain around 2.8% this month - paused slightly, with the dollar index down 0.1% at 96.782 at 1535 GMT, compared to the 16-month high of 96.938 it reached late on Wednesday.
Versus the Japanese yen, the dollar was just below a five year peak.
Neil Jones, head of FX sales at Mizuho, said that he expects the dollar's move lower to be a ""temporary blip"".
""Post-Thanksgiving next week and into December I’m looking for further dollar strength, albeit at a fairly subdued pace,"" he said.
Jones said that towards the end of the year seasonal demand for dollars would also contribute to its strength.
But, in a note to clients, ANZ strategists John Bromhead and Daniel Been said that with U.S. markets closed for Thanksgiving ""a period of tactical consolidation might be close.""
The euro was up 0.1% versus the dollar at $1.1209, a slight recovery. But it has still lost around 3% so far this month, weighed down by expectations that the European Central Bank will be more dovish than the Fed, as well as, more recently, a new wave of COVID-19 restrictions in Europe.
""Given that this particular trade-weighted measure of the dollar is heavily skewed to European currencies, the combination of a bullish Fed and fourth waves in Europe is making the DXY (dollar index) look very bid,"" wrote ING currency strategists in a note to clients.
A surge in coronavirus infections in Germany and unusually high inflation rates are weighing on consumer morale in Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Thursday.
Sweden's central bank left monetary policy unchanged, arguing that inflation would ease next year. It pencilled in its first post-pandemic rate hike for the end of 2024.
The Swedish crown strengthened, and was up around 0.5% at 9.0657 versus the dollar and up around 0.5% at 10.1645 versus the euro. But it was still set for its worst month versus the euro since September 2020.
The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - was down 0.1% at $0.71895.

The New Zealand dollar was down 0.3% at $0.6855, extending its losses from the previous session, when the country's Reserve Bank raised the key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, disappointing bulls hoping for a half point increase.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up around 2.7% at $58,730.33, having recovered from the month-low of $55,128.60 it reached on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Turkish lira suffered a historic 15% fall on Tuesday in a session marked by thin trading volumes and dwindling liquidity, and gauges are pointing to more rocky times ahead.
Below are four charts depicting trading on a watershed day for the lira. 
FROM FLOWS TO TRICKLES 
The number of trades thinned out dramatically as the lira plunged to its record low of 13.45 to the dollar on Tuesday, data over the past week showed. The amount of deals peaked during that period when the lira stood at just under 10 to the dollar. 
Price swings in thinning volumes are a classic sign of a market freezing up, with market makers shying away from offering trading liquidity while end-users are panicking to transact at any available prices.

SOARING VOL 
Implied volatility gauges for lira/dollar - indicating expected fluctuations ahead - on Tuesday raced to their highest level since Turkey's 2018 currency crisis. The lira reversing some of its losses on Wednesday saw only a small pull back in implied volatility, showing that investors are betting on more swings ahead. 
Derivative markets signal a dearth of option liquidity, with the fact that traders are shying away from large directional bets further exacerbating the price swings.

WIDENING GAP 

Volatility in the lira is unlikely to end soon. Market gauges for longer-term measures of lira volatility suggest traders expect a rocky road ahead. One-year implied volatility indicators compared to one-month maturities are showing their widest gap since 2018.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Thursday, consolidating after hitting 16-month highs after the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting pointed to the potential of a faster tapering pace.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 96.733, just below Wednesday's high of 96.938, the strongest level since July 2020.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 115.35, not far removed from the overnight high of 115.53, a level not seen since January 2017. GBP/USD edged 0.2% higher to 1.33485, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1218 after falling below 1.12 on Wednesday  and AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7204.
The minutes from the Fed’s meeting held in early November, when the central bank agreed to start tapering, were released on Wednesday. These showed that a number of policymakers were open to the idea of speeding up the withdrawal of the bank’s bond-buying program if inflation remained at elevated levels. This would likely lead to the quicker introduction of higher interest rates. 
At the same time, data showed that personal income and personal spending both rose by more than forecast, while the PCE Price Index, widely seen as the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose at its fastest rate since April in October, and rose to multi-decade highs on an annual basis. 
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly added to the reasons to be bullish about the dollar, saying on Wednesday that she could see a case being made to speed up asset tapering.
“We find increasing evidence of a new leg of inflationary pressures in the U.S., increasing our conviction of a hawkish shift from the Fed during 2022,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
There’s little in the way of news expected from the U.S. to influence the foreign exchange markets Thursday due to the Thanksgiving holiday, but the minutes from the European Central Bank's meeting at the end of October are due for release.
“Despite the fourth [Covid] wave in Europe, the ECB seems to be sticking to the view that the PEPP [pandemic emergency purchase program] scheme will end in March,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY fell 0.3% to 12.0497, with the Turkish lira rebounding to an extent after falling to record lows earlier in the week on the back of President Tayyip Erdogan defending the central bank’s recent rate cuts. The pair climbed to a high of 13.45 on Tuesday. 
Additionally, USD/SEK fell 0.1% to 9.1039 ahead of a meeting by the Riksbank, with investors looking to see whether Sweden’s central bank still plans to keep its policy rate at zero into 2024. That comes after Sweden's Prime Minister was forced to resign after her coalition partner refused to approve her budget bill.
USD/HUF fell 0.1% to 328.67, with the National Bank of Hungary widely expected to hike its one-week deposit rate another 10 basis points to 2.60%."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, but trading near a five-year high against the yen. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone in the minutes from its latest meeting contrasted with the dovish approach taken by its Japanese counterpart.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.14% to 96.737 by 11:13 PM ET (4:13 AM GMT). However, the index remained close to Wednesday's high of 96.938, its strongest level since July 2020.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.04% to 115.36, a level not hit since January 2017.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7204 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.6876.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.3885 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3887.
The Fed indicated that it could pick up the pace on its asset tapering program, and hike interest rates quicker than expected if high inflation persists, in its minutes released on Wednesday.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also said on Wednesday that she could see a case being made to speed up asset tapering.
""The U.S. economy retained its titanium status,"" buoying the dollar, National Australia Bank director of economics Tapas Strickland said in a note.
""Slightly hawkish comments from the normally dovish Daly was also a factor.""
With U.S. markets closed for a holiday on Thursday, the focus is now on the minutes from the European Central Bank (ECB)’s latest meeting, due later in the day. ECB president Christine Lagarde will also give a speech at an ECB legal conference on the same day, and board members Frank Elderson and Edouard Fernandez-Bollo will also participate in the conference.
Investors are also looking ahead to whether the Bank of England (BOE) will raise interest rates in its next policy decision on Dec. 16. Investors were surprised when the central bank kept rates steady at its last policy decision earlier in the month, and look to comments from BOE governor Andrew Bailey at Cambridge University later in the day for clues.

Investing.com – The dollar hit its highest level this year earlier this week, riding on the coattails of hawkish Federal Reserve commentary, and a plunge in the euro, but the greenback’s rally may peter out next year as growth outside the U.S. resumes.
As the Fed looks set to tighten monetary policy and U.S. economic growth is expected to moderate, growth in developed economies including in the euro area will rebound, denting and possibly reversing the dollar’s advance in 2022.
“My view is that next year, we will see a renewed weakening in the dollar not as an indictment of the U.S. economy, but as better relative economic growth [emerges] outside the United States,” Mark Luschini, president and chief investment officer of Janney Capital Management told Investing.com in an interview earlier this week.
“This recent dollar rally is likely to top out and will weaken throughout the 2022 campaign,” Mark Luschini added.
Federal Reserve commentary showing Fed members are warming up to the idea of stepping up monetary policy tightening  amid growing concerns about inflation has helped support the recent rally in the greenback. 
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said Wednesday that she would be open to speeding up the pace of the Fed's bond tapering if inflation remained elevated and jobs growth remained strong.
Making up about the 58% of the dollar index, the euro has also played a big role in the recent dollar rally.
The single currency has slumped for three straight weeks as traders have abandoned their bets on any form of ECB monetary policy tightening following fresh pandemic restrictions in Europe and ongoing dovish commentary from the central bank.
“The euro area economic growth is being challenged by the Delta variant and the ECB's explicit reluctance to change interest rate policy or its bond buying regime even in the face of heightened inflation,” according to Luschini.
While the euro is reaching oversold levels, and may be set for a rebound -- that would counter the rally in the dollar – some warn the single currency remains vulnerable.
“We think it is oversold, but in no way would we describe it as cheap,” ING said earlier this week."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained broadly on Wednesday, reaching 16-month highs against the euro and an almost five-year top against the Japanese yen as investors bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy faster than its peers.
Fed officials have contributed to the more hawkish view that the U.S. central bank may act sooner to try to stem rising price pressures if inflation doesn’t moderate, while the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to remain more dovish as growth in the region lags.
Various Fed policymakers said they would be open to speeding up the elimination of their bond-buying program if high inflation held and move more quickly to raise interest rates, minutes of the bank's last policy meeting released on Wednesday showed.
The dollar’s strength is “a reflection of the willing dovishness the leadership of the ECB is presenting, versus a little more concern being shown by the Fed for inflation, so therefore maybe a little bit of a divergence on policies,” said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also said on Wednesday that she could see a case being made to speed up the Fed’s tapering of its bond purchases.
The dollar index gained 0.37% on the day to 96.853. The euro fell 0.44% to $1.1199.
The single currency was hurt by data on Wednesday showing German business morale deteriorated for the fifth month running in November as supply bottlenecks in manufacturing and a spike in coronavirus infections clouded the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy.
The dollar reached an almost five-year high of 115.50 against the Japanese yen after data showed that U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in October, while price pressures also heated up during the month.
The greenback reached a seven-month high against the Swiss franc.
Other data on Wednesday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level since 1969 last week, while gross domestic product data confirmed that growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
The New Zealand dollar fell as low as $0.6856, the lowest since Aug. 23, after the country’s central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75%, disappointing some traders that had expected it may raise rates by half a percentage point.
U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira recovered as much as 7% on Wednesday after a historic slide to record lows a day earlier triggered by President Tayyip Erdogan's defence of rate cuts, but volatility and steep price rises still worried consumers and investors.
The currency hit all-time lows against the dollar in all 11 consecutive sessions before Wednesday and has lost as much as 45% of its value this year, with around half of those losses occurring since the start of last week.
However, the lira strengthened as far as 11.6 to the U.S. currency on Wednesday afternoon before easing to 12.08 by 1610 GMT, still some 38% weaker than at the end of last year.
Bankers said liquidity had virtually dried up, with moves to Tuesday's all-time low of 13.45 driven by panic dollar buying.
Many Turks, already grappling with inflation of around 20%, fear price rises will accelerate. Opposition politicians have accused Erdogan of dragging the country towards disaster.
Thousands of angry Turks queued at petrol stations late on Wednesday ahead of a steep hike in fuel prices, as others took part in scattered protests against the authorities' handling of the economy.
Retailers too are struggling with the turmoil, with some websites stopping sales of electronic products on Wednesday.
A sales representative at an Istanbul Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store said people were thinking of electronics as an investment as much as items to use. ""It is pretty surreal with the economy and all, but people see it as a store of value,"" the representative said.
CRITICISM
Erdogan has defended the central bank's monetary policy and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"", but faces widespread criticism, including from top economists, and calls for action to reverse the slide in the currency.
There has been no sign of any intervention to boost the currency. The central bank said on Tuesday it could only do so under certain conditions in ""excessive volatility"". 
A banking source later told Reuters that officials from the central bank, Turkey's BDDK banking watchdog, and the board of Turkey's banking association will meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss recent developments in the economy.
""With today's exchange rate, official inflation could exceed 30% in the coming months. With the current deposit rate this means a real interest rate of -15%,"" former central bank chief economist Hakan Kara wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""If measures are not taken urgently, the financial system cannot cope with this,"" he added.
Erdogan has pressured the central bank to move to an aggressive easing cycle with the goal of boosting exports, investment and jobs. 
Graphic: Lira's plunge over the years https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkaxkrvq/lira's%20plunge.png 
But many economists have described the rate cuts as reckless and opposition politicians called for immediate elections. Turks told Reuters the dizzying currency collapse was upending their household budgets and plans for the future.
""The deviation from orthodox policies has a major toll on the economy,"" said Selva Demiralp, director of the Koc University-TUSIAD Economic Research Forum and a former U.S. Federal Reserve economist.
""There is an easing cycle on paper, but it will have a net contractionary impact on the economy,"" she said, commenting on the rate cuts and apparent indifference to the consequent lira depreciation. 
Following a meeting between Erdogan and central bank governor Sahap Kavcioglu, the bank issued a statement saying the selloff was ""unrealistic and completely detached"" from economic fundamentals.
Two sources said Kavcioglu was holding preliminary talks at the presidential palace on Wednesday with United Arab Emirates officials regarding a potential swap agreement.
Tuesday's slide was the lira's largest since the height of a currency crisis in 2018 that led to a sharp recession and three years of below-par economic growth and double-digit inflation.

The central bank has slashed rates by a total of 400 basis points since September, leaving real yields deeply negative as virtually all other central banks have either begun tightening policy to stem rising inflation, or are preparing to do so.

The currency strengthened to as much as 12.0459 per dollar as of 2:49 p.m. in Istanbul. The lira had been battered as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s push for lower interest rates, intended to turbo-boost growth and create jobs, instead resulted in concern over price shocks and generated the wildest lira swings in three years.

LONDON (Reuters) -As the good and great of the investment world try to figure out 2022, they may have taken their eyes off the rest of this year.
All of a sudden, the coming yearend -- often an illiquid and erratic period for global markets once the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday is over -- looks incredibly stressful. 
Much of that is seeded by the long-brewing narrative around post-pandemic inflation, a more urgent ""normalisation"" of central bank settings and a wide divergence in approaches from region to region - not least due to different responses either side of the Atlantic to more waves of COVID-19.
Clarity over Jerome Powell's renomination as Federal Reserve chief this week might have been a moment that calmed things down. But all it seems to have done is release more anxiety about recent Fed signals about hastening a taper of its bond buying and possibly bringing forward a first interest rate rise. 
So much so that in the space of just three weeks money markets have rushed to price three full quarter-point Fed hikes in 2022 compared to the two seen at the start of the month. And they have also pulled in Fed ""lift-off"" day to May from July.
While all that may just be second-guessing next year, the market repricing has its main impact now and nowhere more obviously than a super-charged U.S. dollar around the world. 
A rewriting of Fed scripts has only been matched by a scramble to upgrade dollar forecasts by numerous global banks from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Citi to HSBC and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
A host of political flashpoints worldwide have underlined a bid for perceived dollar safety and liquidity. The picture includes mid-winter energy stress over high oil and gas prices and how to react; rising military tensions in Europe between NATO and Russia over Ukraine and Belarus and even fractious relations between the West and China over Taiwan and militarisation of space.
Wild swings in emerging currencies reflect the tremors. 
A self-contained inflation black spot, policy conundrum and geopolitical worry all on its own, Turkey - who's lira has lost 85% of value against the dollar over the past decade - saw the dollar exchange rate balloon more than 10% on Tuesday alone, clocking a rise of more than 40% so far this month.
Turkey's lira may be a longtime outlier and an extreme example. But emerging currencies from South Africa's rand or Poland's zloty and Hungary's forint all hit their lowest for the year this week.
And it's not just the currencies of developing economies. The dollar's index against the other major currencies hit its highest since July 2020, while the greenback hit its highest in four years against Japan's yen and 2021 highs against the euro and sterling.
UNCORKED
Volatility has been uncorked everywhere, with aggregate measures of foreign exchange volatility the highest since March and bond market equivalents the highest in almost 20 months.
And as the Fed gets tough, still deeply negative real, or inflation-adjusted, bond yields have finally broken higher - undermining presumed inflation hedges such as gold and crytocurrencies and whipping away a key bulwark of expensive Big Tech equity valuations. Even the long-dormant VIX of Wall St stock market volatility has twitched back into life.
On top of this ""valuation effect"" the rate rise speculation and bond market moves this week saw bond yield curves that measure the gap between 2 and 30-year yields flatten to their lowest since shortly after the U.S. election last year -- flagging growth concerns ahead and seeing the Nasdaq put in its worst two days in two months. 
""Interest rate sensitivity came back roaring yesterday pushing down all of our growth baskets,"" said Saxo Bank's equity strategist Peter Garnry, adding there was now potential for a 10% correction in U.S. tech stocks if Treasury yields returned to the March highs.
And all this comes at time when dollar funding around the world tends to get seasonally sticky anyhow, even before you deal with the ebbing tide of world liquidity.
Dollar funding costs outside the United States hit their highest in almost a year this week, with spreads on 3-month euro-dollar and yen-dollar cross currency basis swaps at their widest since December 2020. 
But TS Lombard economist Shweta Singh said the FX swap market may no longer even be best measure of dollar funding stress as dollar liquidity ebbs from here. 
She points out the recent abundance of dollars due to Fed bond buying, emergency facilities and other related expansions of U.S. bank reserves meant offshore borrowers had been tapping domestic money markets more than offshore swaps. This shift had started before COVID-19 as U.S. multinational tax changes in 2017 forced substantial repatriation of huge pools of dollars parked overseas. 

As a result, direct changes to interbank funding associated with the Fed rate rethink, liquidity reduction and exchange rate fallout could have a much more direct impact around the world going forward.
""The Fed's large balance sheet, standing repo facilities, and swap lines have meaningfully mitigated the ripple effects from a strong dollar to global financing conditions, but they have not eliminated the impact from a strengthening greenback on offshore dollar funding,"" Singh told clients.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely flat Wednesday, taking a break after recent strong gains ahead of the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting that sanctioned the tapering of the central bank’s emergency bond-buying program. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded flat at 96.483, just off levels last seen in June 2020.
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 114.91, just off the new four-and-a-half-year high of 115.24 hit earlier. GBP/USD edged 0.1% higher to 1.3385, EUR/USD was flat at 1.1246 and AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7219.
The dollar has been in demand of late, climbing to its highest levels in 2021, with traders betting that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates sooner than expected, and certainty before the majority of its major peers, in response to surging inflationary pressures. 
It also received a boost on Tuesday with the nomination of Jerome Powell to continue heading up the central bank as he is widely perceived as being more likely to respond more quickly to the elevated prices than Lael Brainard, who was also in the running for the role.
Powell’s nomination “generated another round of USD buying, as the risk of the more dovish Lael Brainard taking over was priced out (she was, however, named Vice Chair) and markets reinforced their views around a first Fed hike by mid-2022,” said analysts at ING in a note.
Treasury yields have slipped back early Wednesday, but overnight yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose more than 5 basis points to as high as 1.68% while yields on 30-year Treasury bonds gained 6 bps. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields also eased back, having earlier touched their highest level since March 2020.
Attention Wednesday will now turn to a number of economic data releases, ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, including the latest third-quarter GDP reading, October durable goods and the weekly initial jobless claims.
Most eyes, however, will be on the minutes from the November Fed meeting, the gathering that approved the easing back of the central bank’s bond-buying program started at the beginning of the pandemic. Investors will be looking for clues on whether the pace of this tapering could accelerate, potentially bringing forward the date of the first interest rate hike. The release of personal consumer expenditures price indices at 10 AM ET will be interpreted in this light.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD fell 0.6% to 0.6908, falling despite the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifting its interest rate to 0.75% and raising its long-term cash rate projection by 50 basis points.
Investors had expected a bigger hike and a higher long-term cash rate projection from the central bank, prompting the kiwi to drop sharply.
USD/TRY rose 0.7% to 12.9145, with the Turkish lira remaining under pressure after this pair soared over 10% on Tuesday after President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent rate cuts and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"".

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, paused after a surge following Jerome Powell’s re-appointment as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman. The New Zealand dollar eased after a smaller-than-expected rate hike from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 96.573 by 11:87 PM ET (4:18 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 115. The dollar hit a more-than-four-year high against the yen on Tuesday after two-year Treasury yields surged to their highest levels since March 2020, and Fed funds futures also priced a chance of three rate hikes in 2022.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.32% to 0.7204 and the NZD/USD pair fell 0.63% to 0.6904.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.3920 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3373.
RBNZ hiked its interest rate to 0.75% and raised its long-term cash rate projection by 50 bps as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day, with the New Zealand dollar falling as far as 0.5% to $0.6915.
Investors had expected a bigger hike and long-term cash rate projection from the central bank, and interest rate swaps reversed sharply afterward.
“The unwind aggressive expectations might be a blueprint for other markets that have become similarly positioned, but in the meantime, the New Zealand dollar could be on the ropes against a rising dollar,” Westpac strategist Imre Speizer told Reuters.
""If it fell below $0.69, I think we're in danger of going below $0.68,"" he said.
The greenback hit its highest levels in 2021, with bets increasing that the Fed will hike interest rates sooner than expected in response to continuous inflationary pressures. Powell is also perceived to respond sooner and harder to inflation than Lael Brainard, who was also in the running to head the U.S. central bank.
The U.S. will release data, including the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, GDP, and initial jobless claims, on Wednesday ahead of a holiday on Thursday.
Across the Atlantic, the Turkish lira fell more than 11% in one session overnight. The lira’s collapse could lead to further capital outflows and potentially put pressure on emerging market currencies globally."
520,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s central bank raised interest rates for the second time in two months and signaled it will need to tighten policy more quickly than it previously expected to contain inflation.
The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor Adrian Orr, lifted the official cash rate by a quarter percentage point to 0.75% Wednesday in Wellington, as expected by most economists. New forecasts published by the RBNZ show the cash rate rising to 2% by the end of 2022, a year sooner than it projected just three months ago.
“The near-term rise in inflation is accentuated by higher oil prices, rising transport costs and the impact of supply shortfalls,” the RBNZ said. “These immediate relative price shocks risk generating more generalized price rises given the current domestic capacity constraints.”                                             
The RBNZ is at the forefront of global stimulus withdrawal as policy makers start to move away from the view that faster inflation caused by supply chain disruptions during the pandemic is transitory. In New Zealand, price pressures are becoming more broad-based and persistent as a labor shortage begins to drive up wages.
The New Zealand dollar fell on the decision and bought 69.29 U.S. cents at 2:07 p.m. in Wellington, down from 69.5 cents beforehand. Some investors and economists had expected the RBNZ to deliver a 50 basis-point hike.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira nosedived more than 15% on Tuesday after President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent rate cuts and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"", despite widespread criticism and pleas to reverse course.
The lira tumbled as far as 13.45 to the dollar, plumbing record lows for an 11th straight session, before trimming some of those losses to close 10.2% lower at 12.7015. It has lost 42% of its value this year, including a more than 22% decline since the beginning of last week.
Erdogan has applied pressure on the central bank to pivot to an aggressive easing cycle that aims, he says, to boost exports, investment and jobs - even as inflation soars to near 20% and the currency depreciation accelerates, eating deeply into Turks' earnings.
Many economists called the rate cuts reckless while opposition politicians appealed for immediate elections. Turks told Reuters the dizzying currency collapse was upending their household budgets and plans for the future. 
After a meeting between Erdogan and central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu, the bank issued a statement saying the selloff was ""unrealistic and completely detached"" from economic fundamentals.
There was no hint at an intervention to stem the meltdown. The central bank said it could only do so under certain conditions in ""excessive volatility"". 
Former bank deputy governor Semih Tumen, who was dismissed last month in the latest round of Erdogan's rapid leadership overhaul, called for an immediate return to policies which protect the lira's value. 
""This irrational experiment which has no chance of success must be abandoned immediately and we must return to quality policies which protect the Turkish lira's value and the prosperity of the Turkish people,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Tuesday's slide was the lira's largest since the height of a currency crisis in 2018 that led to a sharp recession, and brought on three years of sub-par economic growth and double-digit inflation.
The central bank has slashed rates by a total of 400 points since September, leaving real yields deeply negative https://tmsnrt.rs/3nsOPlp as virtually all other central banks have begun tightening against rising inflation, or are preparing to do so.

SLIDING POLLS
The lira has been by far the worst-performing currency globally this year due mostly to what some analysts have called a premature economic ""experiment"" by Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for nearly two decades.
Erdogan's AK Party is sliding in opinion polls ahead of elections scheduled for no later than mid-2023, reflecting sharply higher costs of living.
""Prices are rising too fast. I don't want to buy certain products because they've got too expensive,"" said Kaan Acar, 28, a hotel executive in southern Turkey's Kalkan resort, adding he was thinking of cancelling a trip abroad due to the rising cost.
""The fault lies with President Erdogan, the AKP government, and those who for years turned a blind eye and supported them.""
Investors appeared to flee as volatility gauges spiked to the highest levels since March, when Erdogan abruptly sacked hawkish central bank chief Naci Agbal and installed Kavcioglu, who like the president is a critic of high rates.
Against the euro, the lira weakened to a fresh record low of 14.4225 on Tuesday as Turks snapped up hard assets.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield rose above 21% for the first time since 2018. Sovereign dollar bonds suffered sharp falls with many longer-dated issues down over 2 cents, Tradeweb data showed.
As the lira plunged, Turkey's main share index rose 1.7% to a fresh record high due to suddenly cheap valuations, though bank stocks dropped. 
Graphic: Lira's plunge over the years https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkaxkrvq/lira's%20plunge.png 
EMERGENCY HIKES
The central bank cut its policy rate last Thursday by 100 basis points to 15%, and signalled another cut in December.
Erdogan received support on Tuesday from his parliamentary ally, nationalist MHP leader Devlet Bahceli, who said that high interest rates limit production and there was no alternative to a policy focused on investments.
""Turkey needs to rid itself of the hunchback of interest rates,"" Bahceli said.
Erdogan defended the policy late on Monday and said high rates would not lower inflation, an unorthodox view he has repeated for years.
""I reject policies that will contract our country, weaken it, condemn our people to unemployment, hunger and poverty,"" he said after a cabinet meeting, prompting a late-day slide in the lira.
Analysts said Turkey would need emergency rate hikes soon, while speculation about a cabinet overhaul involving the more orthodox finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, has also weighed. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) predicted an ""emergency"" hike as soon as next month, with the policy rate rising to about 19% by the end of the first quarter of 2022. 

Ilan Solot, global market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said Erdogan would likely wait until a ""breaking point"" before reversing course.
""Right now locals seem content to keep their dollars in the local system. If they start to move money elsewhere, to Germany, to Austria, it's another story... Then we will have a conversation about a real currency crisis.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar index held near 16-month highs on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was picked for a second term, reinforcing market expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise in 2022.
The euro bounced off 16-month lows, meanwhile, helped by better-than-expected business growth in the region.
Currency markets have been mostly driven in recent months by market perceptions of the different paces at which global central banks reduce pandemic-era stimulus and raise rates.
Powell’s renomination supports the view that the Fed is likely to begin raising rates in mid-2022, after it winds down its bond purchase program.
“Markets perceived the outcome as marginally hawkish, and futures now firmed up expectations for a hike in June from having been skewed toward July,” currency analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note on Tuesday.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. business activity slowed moderately in November amid labor shortages and raw material delays, contributing to prices continuing to soar halfway through the fourth quarter.
The dollar index was little changed on the day at 96.461, after reaching a 16-month high of 96.61 in overnight trading.
The euro gained 0.16% against the dollar to $1.1251, after earlier hitting a 16-month low of $1.1226.
The euro had tumbled on Monday as concerns grew over new COVID-19 restrictions in Europe, with Austria entering another full lockdown and Germany considering following suit.
Germany's health minister has called for further restrictions on public spaces.
The euro has some short-term technical support in the $1.1240 - $1.1180 area, which were the highs reached in October and December 2019, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) technical analysts Karen Jones and Axel Rudolph said in a report on Tuesday. If it breaks below this area, however, it would likely fall to $1.1000, which is the 78.6% retracement of 2020’s move, they said.
The dollar hit a four-and-a-half year high against the Japanese yen of 115.08 yen.
The greenback hit a seven-week high of C$1.2744 against the Canadian dollar, which was hurt by a slide in oil prices, before dropping back to C$1.2682 as oil prices rebounded.
The United States said on Tuesday it would release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain to try to cool prices after OPEC+ producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.
The kiwi dipped 0.13% to $0.6951 before the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to follow up its October rate hike with another 25-basis-point increase at its review on Wednesday. 
Turkey's lira dived 15% in its second-worst day ever after President Tayyip Erdogan defended recent sharp rate cuts and vowed to win his ""economic war of independence"" despite widespread criticism and pleas to reverse course.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was trading at around $57,644, up 2.4% on the day. Earlier this month it had hit an all-time high of $69,000. Ethereum gained 6.41% to $4,357.

The official, who didn’t elaborate on what was discussed in the meeting, was speaking on condition of anonymity as it wasn’t officially announced. The bank and the presidency both declined to comment.
The latest collapse in the lira came after Erdogan defended his demands for lower borrowing costs that have driven up prices and frustrated investors.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains but remained near a new four-and-a-half-year high against the yen after Jerome Powell was nominated for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 96.442, just off levels last seen in June 2020.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 114.80, having previously climbed to 115.15, its highest since March 2017. GBP/USD edged slightly higher to 1.3399, AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7226 and NZD/USD  was down 0.2% to 0.6944, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand set to hand down its policy decision on Wednesday.
The dollar received a boost from the decision of President Joe Biden to nominate Powell to head the Fed for a second term, instead of Lael Brainard, who was seen as the more dovish of the two and was instead promoted to Fed vice-chair.
Powell’s nomination now goes to the Senate for confirmation, but this move has reinforced market expectations of interest rate hikes in 2022 when the Fed is expected to have finished its asset tapering program. 
This resulted in two-year U.S. Treasury yields climbing sharply, reaching 0.64% - their highest level since early March 2020 - before retracing modestly to 0.63%. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1250, rebounding slightly after falling as low as 1.1226, a new 16-month low. 
“The (Fed) news cements the key trend in EUR/USD, where the Fed is preparing to normalize monetary policy while the ECB will lag,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The ECB had more cause to lag anyway since Eurozone inflation was looking set to turn lower far quicker in 2022 than inflation in the US - but renewed lockdowns and pressure on the service sector in Europe now provide the ECB with many more reasons to go slow.”
More evidence of the slowdown in business activity in the Eurozone is likely from the flash November PMI data for the region later in the session.
Despite all that, there was a notable shift in ECB rhetoric early Tuesday, with Isabel Schnabel becoming the first board member to warn that inflation risks are now skewed to the upside.
USD/CNY edged lower to 6.3837, not far removed from its record low even as China’s central bank tries to slow its ascent. 
So far, Beijing’s moves to rein in the appreciation have been measured, setting weaker-than-expected reference rates for the yuan for four straight days while urging banks to limit speculation, particularly of a bullish kind.
However, this has had limited impact, raising speculation China’s central bank could cut interest rates in the near future.
Elsewhere in emerging markets, the Turkish lira slumped again as comments from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pushed it through an important technical level, triggering stop losses. The dollar was up 4.7% at 11.9469, having peaked just short of 12.00 earlier.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, remaining near a four-and-a-half-year high against the yen. Incumbent U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s appointment to a second term increased bets that the U.S. will hike interest rates quicker than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 96.573 by 11:53 PM ET (4:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.22% to 115.11. Against the yen, the greenback surpassed the record of 114.97 hit last week, the highest level since March 2017. Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7220. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.38% to 0.6929, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to hand down its policy decision on Wednesday.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.3854 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.3390.
Investors also continued to digest U.S. President Joe Biden’s choice of Powell to head the Fed over Lael Brainard. Considered the more dovish of the pair, Brainard was promoted to Fed vice-chair.
Powell’s renomination reinforced market expectations of interest rate hikes in 2022 when the Fed finishes its asset tapering program. Market bets on the pace of central banks’ asset tapering and interest rate hikes have driven currency markets recently.
""Powell’s nomination for a second term will leave markets comfortable pricing in Fed lift-off from July 2022. At least three Fed officials have now openly discussed speeding up asset tapering too,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
The U.S. central bank may need to speed up the removal of monetary stimulus in response to strong employment gains and surging inflation, which could lead to a quicker-than-expected interest rate hike, said Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic.
""Meanwhile, COVID-19 suppression measures are being implemented in Europe again, making for a stark contrast,"" the Westpac note added.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the continent is rising, with Austria under a full lockdown since Monday and Germany considering tighter restrictive measures. The euro was at $1.124, around a 16-month low. It has fallen 2.8% so far in November, also hurt by the European Central Bank’s recent dovish tone."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar set a 16-month high against the euro on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was nominated for a second four-year term by President Joe Biden, while the single currency was hurt by COVID-19 related lockdowns.
Lael Brainard, the Federal Reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job, will be vice chair, the White House said.
""With Powell being renominated for a second term, that suggests a less dovish outlook for monetary policy than under a potential Brainard leadership,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analysts at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington. 
""It looks like there's greater scope for U.S. rate hikes under Powell with Powell remaining on as the Fed Chair, and that has been broadly positive for the dollar,"" Manimbo added.
The dollar index against a basket of currencies rose 0.42% on the day to 96.53, the highest since July 2020. The euro dipped 0.58% to $1.1233, also the weakest since July 2020.
The single currency was also dragged lower as concerns grew over new COVID-19 restrictions in Europe, with Austria entering another full lockdown and Germany considering following suit.
""It's kind of been a one-two punch for the euro. One has been a rise in cases across the bloc, and what that is doing is reinforcing the decidedly dovish outlook for (European Central Bank) policy and that stands in stark contrast to the Fed, where pressure is building for the U.S. central bank to adopt a quicker pace of normalization,"" Manimbo said.
Powell and Brainard on Monday noted the corrosive impact that high inflation is having on the U.S. economy and American families in what may be a signal that controlling the rapid pace of price increases is now the central bank's top priority.
The Fed will release minutes from its Nov. 2-3 meeting on Wednesday, which will be evaluated for any new indications that it may speed up the taper of its bond purchases and hike rates sooner than expected.
Fed officials Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller on Friday suggested a faster pace of stimulus tapering may be appropriate amid a quickening recovery and heated inflation.
The dollar also gained 0.79% against the safe haven Japanese yen to 114.93, approaching the 4-1/2 year high of 114.97 reached on Nov. 17.
The greenback also gained 0.55% to hit a seven-week high of C$1.27 against the Canadian dollar.
""Given the possibility that more virus lockdowns are announced in the coming days and weeks, risk-sensitive currencies like the CAD may trade on the defensive while declining oil prices exert an additional drag,"" analysts at Scotiabank said in a report on Friday.

Investing.com — The US Dollar Index has rallied Monday after U.S. President Joe Biden formally announced he will nominate Jerome Powell to serve as the chairman of the Federal Reserve for a second term.
Powell is set to end his current four-year term in February, and there was much speculation about who Biden would nominate before today's announcement. 
Biden will also nominate Lael Brainard, the other candidate for the top job, as vice-chair.
The DXY hit a high of 96.239 in reaction to the news, with the EUR/USD falling as low as 1.1236 and XAU/USD seeing the strongest move, dropping around $28. 
The dollar's strength is a reaction to the continuity that Powell will provide; however, there is also the fact that many considered Brainard to be even more dovish than the current Fed chair. "

LONDON (Reuters) -Borrowing costs for U.S. dollars in currency derivatives markets rose on Monday to their highest levels in nearly a year, driven up by the year-end dollar funding rush and the euro's steady slide against the greenback.
Spreads on three-month euro-dollar cross-currency basis swaps were at the widest since since December 2020 at around minus 27 basis points, implying that non-U.S. borrowers are prepared to pay that much premium to access dollar funding.
A cross-currency basis swap (CCBS) sees parties exchange interest rate payments in two different currencies and is often used by traders swapping liabilities to the desired currency.
Corporates and asset management firms generally step up dollar buying as the end of the year approaches, with portfolio rebalancing and fund transfers requiring currencies like the euro and sterling to be converted to the U.S. currency.
Spreads on yen-dollar swaps also were the widest since last December though sterling-dollar spreads were more resilient at minus 16.5 bps, a two-week high.
""Typically we see demand for dollar funding increase towards year end, especially amongst Asian borrowers who have sizeable dollar-denominated liabilities,"" Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) said noting similar pressures last year and in 2019.
The dollar has strengthened of late, on back of economic data pointing to the U.S. Federal Reserve possibly tightening policy earlier and stepping up the pace of stimulus unwind. 
The greenback is trading just off 16-month highs against a basket of its rivals. Against the euro alone, it is up nearly 2.5% so far this month. 
The euro's decline over the past few days may also be driving the widening spreads, one trader said.
The European Central Bank has pushed back against markets pricing a rate rise next year and those expectations have been dialled down further by the resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the continent. 
Last week the ECB also increased the upper limit of cash as collateral for the euro securities lending programme to 150 billion euros from 75 billion euros, easing the demand for cash euros.

Stephen Gallo, chief European FX strategist at BMO Capital Markets, also pointed to year-end flows but cautioned that any widening of credit spreads for European borrowers in the coming month could boost dollar funding costs for banks.
""We have that as a potential scenario for the euro next year,"" Gallo said though he described that outcome as an ""outlier"".

LONDON (Reuters) -Chile's peso and stocks surged on Monday after hard-right former congressman Jose Antonio Kast topped the first-round election, with the focus now shifting to the composition of congress.
Chile is heading for a runoff with Kast competing with leftist lawmaker and former protest leader Gabriel Boric on Dec. 19. A strong performance by moderate centre right candidates bodes well for Kast.
Chile's peso jumped as much as 3.7% against the dollar to trade at 797.90 - its best day in almost two years - before giving up some gains to trade at around 809.00. 
""Initial results are very bullish for Chilean assets as the market will have to remove the risk premia priced in last week,"" said Alvin Tan at RBC. 
""We have to wait and see if the right-wing coalition is able to increase or at least maintain the current representation in order to adjust our medium/long term negative views in CLP.""
The main Santiago stock exchange index jumped over 7%, led by retailers Falabella and Cencosud, along with regional carrier LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ).
""Fear over the potential for a political shift to the left has been one factor behind the weak performance of Chile assets this year, with equities down 10% year-to-date,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Tellimer in a note to clients. ""Chile is the cheapest hard commodity exporter in emerging markets.""
The election has split voters between those seeking a shake-up of its free-market model and those demanding a harder line against crime and immigration, after two years of sometimes- violent protests demanding improvements to living standards.
Chileans also voted to fill 155 lower house seats and 27 of the 50 upper house seats. Hard-right and conservative lawmakers looked set to finish with 23 seats in the Senate, and center-left and hard-left lawmakers were on course for 22 seats, with the rest going to independents.
""Against the backdrop of the Constitution Convention, the power distribution in the Congress matters more than in prior cycles,"" said Diego Pereira at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Notwithstanding Monday's gains, Chile's peso has weakened more than 11% since the start of the year, making it one of the region's worst-performing currencies in 2021 despite a more than 20% increase in copper prices. 

The premium demanded by investors to hold Chile's hard-currency sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries narrowed by 7 basis points to 149 bps, though they are still the worst performer in Latin America, returning -16.5% compared to a -8% return in JPMorgan's regional sub-index.
Luc D'hooge, head of emerging markets bonds at Vontobel Asset Management, said a divided Congress would likely limit any radical legislative changes.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Monday, testing the highs of last week as the euro suffered from growing anxiety over the impact of surging Covid-19 infections in Europe.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 96.153, just shy of last week's 16-month high of 96.266.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 114.22, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3448, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7253.
The dollar received a boost on Friday after comments by Federal Reserve officials Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller pointed to the potential of a faster pace of stimulus tapering amid a robust recovery and heated inflation.
The foreign exchange market has become fixated on the Fed’s timetable for phasing out its bond purchases as a shorter phase-out raises the possibility of earlier interest rate increases. Currently the market is priced for the U.S. central bank to start hiking rates by the middle of next year.
“We find increasing evidence of a new leg of inflationary pressures in the U.S., increasing our conviction of a hawkish shift from the Fed during 2022,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
The Fed will publish the minutes of its November meeting, in which policymakers decided the U.S. economy was strong enough to start scaling back its pandemic-era asset purchase program, on Wednesday. 
The same day sees a massive data dump, including the core PCE price index, rumored to be the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, while a lot of attention will be on whether the White House decides to keep incumbent Fed Chair Jerome Powell in place for another term or promote current Fed Governor Lael Brainard.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1265, to a new 16-month low as Austria became the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full national lockdown to combat the Covid-19 virus.
Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, refusing to rule out the possibility of another lockdown on Friday, and riots breaking out in Belgium and the Netherlands over the introduction of more restrictions.
USD/TRY fell 0.3% to 11.1960, with the lira attempting to rebound after suffering one of its worst days in three years on Thursday after the central bank cut interest rates again despite rocketing inflation.

533,"<span>Nov 21, 2021 11:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- An organization formed by key participants in China’s currency market urged banks to limit speculative foreign-exchange trading after the yuan climbed to a six-year high versus peers.
The China Foreign Exchange Committee -- founded under guidance from the central bank -- encouraged lenders to be risk-neutral when trading foreign exchange for themselves and for clients, according to people familiar with the matter. Banks were advised to better track their proprietary trading and improve risk management, the people said, citing a proposal made by core members of the organization that was circulated to members.
The move could be the latest sign that Beijing has grown uncomfortable with a rapid ascent in the yuan. The currency is the best performer in emerging markets this year as it benefits from robust exports and foreign investments in onshore bonds. Against a basket of trading partners, the yuan last week soared to the highest since 2015, when the authorities devalued the currency to aid growth.
The CFEC suggests banks conduct internal reviews when trading volumes at proprietary desks deviate significantly from the norm, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. Proprietary trading that is 50% higher than the level during the year-earlier quarter, or is more than 15 times the size of transactions done on behalf of clients could be considered abnormal, they said. Banks need to report their findings to the CFEC.
The proposal is targeted at more than 50 Chinese and overseas banks operating onshore, and covers over 90% of the country’s foreign-exchange market, the people said. It will not impact on liquidity in the currency market, they added.
The measures aim to strengthen standards for banks’ foreign-exchange businesses, especially proprietary desks, which tend to make speculative bets on one-way moves in currencies, the people said. 
The People’s Bank of China last week asked financial institutions and enterprises to step up exchange-rate risk management and to refrain from making one-way bets on the yuan. Volatility of the currency may increase in future as overseas central banks have started adjusting monetary policy, the PBOC said in a statement, which was about a meeting held recently by the CFEC.
China should deepen market-oriented exchange-rate reform, which includes making the yuan rate more flexible, the PBOC reiterated in its third-quarter policy implementation report released late Friday. 
While the PBOC has become more tolerant of yuan volatility in recent years, Beijing could grow uncomfortable if its rapid appreciation starts hurting exports and poses a risk to financial stability.
“At a time of slowing growth and a likely moderation in exports ahead, the strength of the yuan is likely becoming a growing concern,” said Mitul Kotecha, chief emerging markets Asia & Europe strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. This is yet another step toward limiting speculative pressure on the yuan following weaker fixings and the likely ongoing currency intervention, he added.
PBOC set its reference rate for the yuan at 6.3952 per dollar, weaker than the average estimate of 6.3931 in a Bloomberg survey of analysts and traders. That’s the third straight session of weaker-than-expected yuan fixing. Offshore yuan was little changed at 6.3906 as of 9:52 a.m. in Shanghai.
Reuters reported earlier that the CFEC proposed a plan to limit trading volumes at Chinese banks’ proprietary desks. The organization, founded in 2016, includes representatives from regulatory agencies and financial institutions. 
CFEC said it wasn’t immediately ready to comment on the proposal when reached by phone Monday morning.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, remaining near a 16-month high against the euro. Concerns over the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in Europe also saw investors turn towards the safe-haven U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 96.175 by 10:37 PM ET (3:37 AM GMT). It remained near the 16-month high of 96.266 hit during the previous week.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.17% to 114.18.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7242 while the NZD/USD pair was down 0.31% to 0.6988. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.3845 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 1.3432.
Bullish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials also boosted the U.S. currency. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and Governor Christopher Waller on Friday suggested that faster asset tapering could be appropriate as economic recovery quickens and inflation rises. This could also mean earlier interest rate hikes.
The euro was down 0.23% to $1.1274. ""EUR-USD has been in free-fall and will likely get the lion’s share of attention from clients looking for a play on growing restrictions and tensions across Europe,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""For momentum, trend followers, and tactical traders, short EUR remains attractive here.""
The surging numbers of COVID-19 cases triggered a full lockdown in Austria that begins Monday. German Health Minister Jens Spahn called the situation in the country a national emergency, adding that vaccinations alone will not reduce the numbers.
The riskier Australian dollar earlier slipped as low as $0.72285, near an Oct. 6 low. ""We expect AUD to remain heavy in the near‑term, and a dip to $0.70 is possible,"" with the economic recovery in China slowing down and the Reserve Bank of Australia’s dovish policy stance dragging on the currency, Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Joseph Capurso said in a report.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday as investors sought safe havens after Austria said it would be the first country in Western Europe to reimpose a full lockdown amid surging COVID-19 infections and Germany said it could follow suit, sending the euro lower. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.489% at 96.029, close to the 16-month high of 96.266 hit on Wednesday. For the week, the dollar was up around 1%.
The euro, meanwhile, which has been on its back foot all week, hit a 16-month low amid the COVID surge in Europe and as expectations have grown that interest rates will be hiked faster elsewhere, particularly in the United States.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the U.S. central bank should speed up the pace of tapering its bond purchases to give more leeway to raise interest rates from their near-zero level sooner than it currently expects if high inflation and the strength of job gains persists.
At a separate event, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said it ""may very well be appropriate"" to discuss speeding up the Fed's asset purchase wind-down when it next meets, on Dec. 14-15.
""The greenback right now is certainly benefiting from signs of a strengthening U.S. economy and from safe-haven flows due to renewed worries about the virus,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
On top of a lockdown, Austria said it will require all its citizens to be vaccinated against COVID-19 from Feb. 1, while Germany's health minister cautioned lockdown restrictions could return there. 
""One thing is certain, if the whole of Europe had to go under lockdown once more, and depending on how long that would last, we would need to rethink our growth scenarios,"" said Stephane Ekolo, global equity strategist at brokerage Tradition.
Commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, often seen as risky, all declined.
The euro has fallen more than 1% this week versus the dollar and was down 0.74% on the day at $1.12895, having earlier touched $1.1248, its weakest level since July 2020. 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde doubled down on her cautious position on Friday, saying the ECB should not tighten policy as that could undermine recovery.
The Aussie was down 0.58% at $0.72335 and the Kiwi was 0.72% lower at $0.69945. 
The Canadian dollar slid 0.42% to 1.2652.
The Japanese yen, also considered a safe-haven currency, strengthened following Austria's lockdown announcement, and was up 0.22% versus the dollar at 113.99 yen. 
Sterling shed some of its recent gains and was down 0.39% at around $1.3448.

536,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 10:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A central bank-led self-regulatory group that helps to oversee China's foreign exchange industry has asked commercial banks to cap the size of their proprietary trading accounts, five sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
One of the sources said the aim was to limit financial institutions' speculation on the yuan when the Chinese currency has been strengthening.
Beijing is keen to protect its export sector as domestic demand and economic growth momentum show signs of slowing.
Market observers said the request was the Chinese regulatory bodies' latest attempt to stabilise the exchange rate and may not be the last.
""They will find ways and other measures to thwart the market's ability, capacity and willingness to go long renminbi,"" Stephen Jen, who runs hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital, said.
He noted the yuan in trade-weighted terms was the strongest performing currency in recent months, outpacing even the U.S. dollar.
China's Foreign Exchange Market Self-Discipline Mechanism is a committee of central bank and commercial bank representatives that is supervised by the People's Bank of China (PBOC). 
It has told banks that if the volume of their proprietary trade rises 50% from a year earlier or exceeds 15 times the amount they execute on behalf of their clients, their businesses will be further analysed and investigated, said the sources, some of whom were told of the plan via email.
The sources from within some of the banks spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the issue in public. There was no mention of any effective date for the measure.
The regulatory body said in a statement late on Thursday that Chinese financial institutions should actively provide currency hedging services for companies, but they should not help companies speculate in currencies.
China's financial regulators have urged companies to protect themselves against currency risks as the central bank gradually loosens its control of the yuan, but are struggling to convince local businesses to hedge https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-regulators-struggle-sway-companies-currency-risk-2021-06-22.
China's tightly-managed currency has risen by nearly 3% against the U.S. dollar since March, even as the dollar rose against most other currencies.
Market analysts and economists attributed the yuan's strength to China's growing trade surplus - generated in part by an export boom during the pandemic - steady capital inflows and a glut of dollars in the banking system.

With authorities keen to attract international investment into Chinese stocks and bonds, keeping the exchange rate steady also helps ensure confidence among foreign investors, analysts say.
Eurizon SLJ Capital's Jen said the success of past Chinese measures to arrest yuan strength was ""ambiguous"" in the short run, but they eventually worked longer term.

538,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The cost of servicing U.K. government debt more than tripled in October from a year earlier due to surging inflation, leaving the budget deficit higher than economists forecast.
Interest costs were 5.6 billion pounds ($7.6 billion) compared with 1.8 billion pounds in the same month in 2020, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. In the first seven months of the fiscal year, the costs were up 63%.
The surge is due to a spike in inflation as a quarter of the national debt is linked to retail prices. The RPI rose to 6% in October, the highest since 1991, casting doubt on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s 5.2% forecast for the fourth quarter as a whole. Faster inflation may also prompt more Bank of England interest-rate increases, which markets expect to begin next month, further increasing debt-servicing costs.
The deficit in October alone stood at 18.8 billion pounds, little changed from a year earlier and higher than the 14 billion-pound figure that economists expected. The budget deficit totaled 127.3 billion pounds between April and October, the ONS said. 
The surge in debt costs highlights the risks facing Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak as he tried to rein in the budget deficit. 
At last month’s budget, a brighter economic outlook allowed the OBR to slash its deficit forecast for the year as a whole to 183 billion pounds. However, the pace of improvement is forecast to slow, and Sunak is forecast to meet his pledge to end borrowing for day-to-day spending by mid-decade by the narrowest of margins.
Borrowing remained elevated last month despite the ending of two key pandemic-era support programs. The furlough plan and separate support for self-employed workers hit by the pandemic cost the taxpayer almost 100 billion pounds in total.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Friday, especially against the euro, with traders focusing on the relative speeds the major central banks are expected to respond to rising inflation levels with interest rates hikes.
At 2:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 95.612, just shy of its recently hit 16-month high.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1354, with the pair on course for a weekly loss of around 0.8% despite recovering from a trip below 1.13 for the first time since July 2020.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.35, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3505 after the release of strong retail sales data, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was largely unchanged at 0.7282.
The latest evidence of the growing strength of the U.S. economic recovery came on Thursday in the form of the weekly unemployment claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health. This showed jobless benefit claims edging down to a 20-month low in early November. 
This recovery in the labor market has occurred at the same time as consumer inflation has climbed to levels not seen in three decades, fueling the market’s assessment that the Federal Reserve will be quicker to move than many of its contemporaries.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was at pains earlier this week to dismiss market expectations of early interest rate rises. Worries that Europe appears to be on the brink of a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections have added to the view that the ECB will be relatively late to the rate hike party.
This is despite German producer price inflation numbers showing prices rising another 3.8% on the month in October, taking the annual rate of factory gate inflation in Europe's largest economy up to 18.4%.
“EUR/USD continues to trade on the soft side and has not pulled away from support at 1.1300,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Not helping it, has probably been the news of record Covid case numbers in Germany, which could dent the recovery in the services sector just as the manufacturing sector is struggling with supply chain disruption.”
The economic data calendar is light Friday, and the focus is likely to be on a series of central bank speakers, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Bank of England economist Huw Pill and Federal Reserve officials Christopher Waller and Richard Clarida the highlights. 
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.8% to 11.0787, adding to Thursday’s sharp gains after Turkey’s central bank slashed interest rates by a further 100 basis points, bowing to pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Thursday's cut leaves interest rates at 15% and roughly 500 basis points below the current inflation rate.
USD/ZAR rose 0.1% to 15.5856 after South Africa’s central bank raised its repurchase rate to 3.75% from a record-low 3.5%. That’s the first hike since November 2018 and follows 300 basis points of easing last year as the country tried to cope with the ravages of the pandemic.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3811 after China’s central bank warned speculators to avoid making one-way bullish bets on the yuan, an attempt to stop the Chinese currency from appreciating too quickly. The yuan has risen over 2% against the dollar this year so far, one of few emerging market currencies to keep pace with the greenback as the Fed has prepared to tighten policy for the world's reserve currency.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, and is poised to post a second week of gains against the euro. The focus is now on when central banks will begin hiking interest rates in response to rising inflation.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.12% to 95.657 by 11:55 PM ET (4:55 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 114.36, with Japan’s national consumer price index (CPI) and national core CPI both growing 0.1% year-on-year in October.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7275 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.7037.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.3856 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3486. Bets that the Bank of England will hike interest rates in December are mounting as inflation rose to a 10-year high in October.
The euro fell 0.6% during the past week, boosting the dollar to a 16-month high. It last traded at 1.1372 after falling to $1.1263 earlier, but remains vulnerable as fundamentals and positioning swing to favor the dollar, according to investors.
""Previous post-global financial crisis occasions when the euro traded below $1.10 were accompanied by a big euro short position,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Juckes told Reuters.
""If the question is 'will the market now get very short euros' then I think the answer is that it will unless data improve dramatically.""
Several central bankers, including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Bank of England economist Huw Pill and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Christopher Waller, Richard Clarida, and Mary Daly, will speak later in the day.
Bets are also rising on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand handing down a hawkish monetary policy that will hike the interest rate by 50 basis points (bps) when it meets next week.
""Rates markets remain skittish and the data pushed the bellwether two-year swap to a new high for the year, and that in turn, put the bid in behind the kiwi,"" ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.
""With 36 bps of hikes priced in for next week and 198 bps priced in over the next eight meetings, local markets could be setting themselves up for some real disappointment if we 'only' get a 25-bps hike, as we expect,” the note added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged back from a 16-month high on Thursday as traders assessed whether the U.S. currency's recent surge, fueled by diverging central bank tightening expectations amid surging inflation around the globe, had gone too far.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six rivals, reached its highest since mid-July 2020 on Wednesday at 96.226, but was last down 0.272% at 95.553.
""We've had a really big move in the dollar in the past couple of weeks, and I think that we're taking a breather now,"" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities.
Recent U.S. data showed inflation in October running at its hottest since 1990, while retail sales numbers topped forecasts, leading the market to price in earlier rate hikes by the Federal Reserve than had been anticipated, driving strength in the greenback. 
""The dollar has had a full rally and now the market is going to step back and assess if indeed the inflation theme continues at the pace that everybody thinks it will,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. 
""If that's true, then there's nothing stopping it, but I think if the numbers start to print a little cooler as we go forward, you'll definitely see a bit of a dollar pullback across the board.""
The euro rose 0.45% to $1.13695, bouncing off of a 16-month low hit on Wednesday below $1.13.
Sterling edged up 0.1% versus the greenback to $1.3494, having jumped 0.5% on Wednesday after data showing rising inflation in Britain last month piled pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates at its meeting next month.
The New Zealand dollar rose 0.55% to $0.7036 after a central bank survey showed near-term inflation is expected to rise. 
Elsewhere, Turkey's lira shed another 2.83% after its central bank cut rates by 100 basis points to 15%, even in the face of inflation near 20%, sending the Turkish currency hurtling southwards.
""The lira remains a punching bag, and further weakness has no end in sight,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. 
The lira has lost around 11.5% of its value this month amid President Tayyip Erdogan's renewed criticism of interest rates and calls for stimulus despite the risks. It was last at 10.909, having earlier hit a record low of 11.30 per dollar.
Commodity-linked currencies rebounded along with oil prices, which had earlier slid to six-week lows. [O/R] 
The Canadian dollar edged off a six-week low, rising 0.08% to C$1.26, or 97.37 U.S. cents. Markets are expecting the Bank of Canada to start raising rates early next year. 

The Australian dollar also moved off of a six-week low of $0.7251 and was last up 0.16% at $0.72765.

542,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira fell to a record low after the central bank cut borrowing costs for a third straight month, a move that risks further undermining price and currency stability.
The lira fell as much as 3.3% to 10.9765 against the dollar, extending the biggest depreciation in emerging markets this year. Policy makers cut the one-week repo rate by 100 basis points to 15%, in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Consumer inflation accelerated to almost 20% in October, a level last seen in the wake of a currency crisis three years ago. Yet under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the central bank has lowered interest rates by 400 basis points since September, driving the currency’s real yield well below zero. 
Easier policy in Turkey also leaves the lira vulnerable to further gains in the U.S. dollar. The greenback rose to the highest level in more than a year against a basket of peers this week, piling pressure on riskier emerging-market currencies.
The lira has lost around a third of its value against the dollar since December and is poised for a ninth straight yearly loss. It has weakened more than 20% since the central bank started cutting rates in September.
Turkey’s benchmark BIST 100 Index erased earlier gains to trade 0.5% higher after the decision. The yield on 10-year government bonds jumped as much a 57 basis points to 20.44%.
The lira pared declines to trade at 10.8391 per dollar as of 2:18 p.m. in Istanbul.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Thursday, consolidating just below its 16-month high, while the Turkish lira slumps ahead of the country’s latest central bank meeting. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.775, after hitting its highest since July 2020 on Wednesday at 96.226.
EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1324, recovering from its trip below 1.13 for the first time since July 2020, USD/JPY was flat at 114.08, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3508, and AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7291.
The dollar has benefited in recent weeks from the market’s assessment that the Federal Reserve will be quicker to move against the rising inflation levels than many of its advanced economy contemporaries, a perception reinforced in the last month by strong labor market and retail sales data.
By contrast, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has made it clear this week that early interest rate hikes are not on her agenda, a stance not exactly challenged by figures showing European car sales down 30% on the year in October, and the Bank of Japan is expected to keep adding stimulus to its beleaguered economy, accommodating a major fiscal stimulus package due to be unveiled by Prime Minister Kishida.
The possible exception, among G7 central banks, is the Bank of England after a spike in Britain's October inflation piled pressure on it to hike rates at its meeting next month.
“We had felt the 96.00/96.10 area would be a good target for DXY [the dollar index] this month,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “We are reluctant to chase the move higher through these big resistance levels (96.10 being the 50% retrace of last year's DXY drop), but the factors that got DXY here look unlikely to abate soon.” 
The main economic data release Thursday will be the weekly initial jobless claims number, which is expected to show 260,000 claimants last week, a drop from 267,000 the previous week, and a fresh post-pandemic low.  
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has continued to exert pressure on the country’s central bank to lower interest rates, and Turkey’s central bank is expected to deliver later Thursday despite a weakening currency and elevated levels of inflation.
All but two of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Governor Sahap Kavcioglu to cut the benchmark for a third successive meeting, after reducing its benchmark rate by 300 basis points over the last two gatherings.
USD/TRY rose 0.9% to 10.7041 in anticipation of another rate reduction. The lira has already fallen nearly 30% against the dollar this year, and more than 15% this quarter alone as Erdogan has intervened more directly in monetary policy.

(Reuters) - Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan hit a more than five-month high despite risks from a slowing property sector, while the prospect of an economic rebound led investors to unwind bearish positions in Thailand's baht, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Short positions in the Indian rupee, Philippine peso, and South Korean won eased further, while market participants turned bearish on the Singapore dollar, the fortnightly poll of 10 respondents found.
Long positions in the yuan consolidated and were at their highest since early June, buttressed by robust industrial output and retail sales data from the world's second-largest economy this week.
That helped take some of the spotlight away from debt woes at China Evergrande Group and other real estate companies that still weigh on China's growth momentum and cloud its economic outlook.
China's frosty relations with the United States appeared to show early signs of thawing following a virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Traders said the meeting had raised the chances of partial tariff removals, following which the yuan climbed to a 5-1/2-month high.
Things are also looking up in Thailand where the reopening of the tourism sector has raised hopes of an economic revival following a sharp coronavirus-driven slump since last year.
Short bets on the baht, among the region's worst performing currencies this year, fell back to their lowest since Sept. 9.
Chua Han Teng, an economist at DBS, said while the economy ""has started to see the light at the end of the tunnel"", Thailand's recovery would likely be gradual.
""Consumer and business confidence have started to benefit from looser virus curbs and should continue to tick higher, but have some room to catch up from still weak levels,"" he said, adding that tourism would also take time to reach pre-pandemic levels.
That cautious sentiment echoed in the findings of a university survey on Tuesday, which showed the economy is expected to recover only in the second half of 2022 as concerns about fresh COVID-19 outbreaks and curbs remain.
Investors slightly raised long positions in Indonesia's rupiah and remained modestly bearish on the Philippine peso. Central banks of both countries meet later on Thursday and are expected to leave interest rates unchanged.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, remaining below a 16-month peak. The U.S. currency pressed pause in a recent rally, prompting questions as to whether the rally is slowing down.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 95.748 by 22:40 PM ET (3:40 AM GMT). It climbed as high as 96.226 on Wednesday, its highest since mid-July 2020.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 114.05.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.7268 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.33% to 0.7020.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.3787 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 1.3494. U.K. inflation jumped in October, with the consumer price index growing 1.1% month-on-month and 4.2% year-on-year. The higher-than-expected levels is putting pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates in December.
The euro was at $1.1316, remaining near a 16-month low as the European Central Bank is widely perceived to be in the back of the line in hiking interest rates.
Better-than-expected U.S. retail sales data earlier in the week gave the dollar’s recent rally a boost. U.S. inflation, which hit a record 30-year high in October, also raised bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike rates around the middle of 2022.
However, ""the sustainability of the current dollar strength beyond the next few months looks far from certain,"" Pictet Wealth Management FX strategist Luc Luyet told Reuters.
""Market expectations of the Fed are starting to be particularly hawkish, suggesting limited tailwinds for the dollar going forward from that factor. Furthermore, the economic growth outlook may turn more supportive of the euro as the worst of the slowdown of China’s economic activity looks mostly behind us, whereas COVID-19 and energy import costs may prove less of an issue than the past winter,” Luyet added.
Other investors viewed the dollar’s dip as an opportunity to buy. ""Dips have been hard to come by lately, but anything into the low-95s looks like a buying opportunity,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
Meanwhile, commodity currencies fell thanks to oil prices that fell to six-week lows. The Canadian dollar was at 1.2608 against its U.S. counterpart, near a six-week low hit on Wednesday. The Bank of Canada is also expected to begin hiking interest rates in early 2022."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased off of a fresh 16-month high on Wednesday, while the euro remained on its back foot as investors adjusted central bank tightening odds amid rising pricing pressures, with the U.S. Federal Reserve seen hiking rates as early as mid-2022.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six rivals, slipped 0.101% to 95.846 after earlier touching 96.266 for the first time since mid-July 2020.
Versus the yen, the greenback hit a 4-1/2-year high and tested the $1.12 level against the euro, helped by robust U.S. retail sales data and hawkish comments from Fed policymakers, which contrasted with dovish remarks from the head of the European Central Bank. 
""The market is now starting to understand that you're going to have divergent themes in FX,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at FX broker Oanda. ""I think that you're in for a choppy period ... you're continuing to see the markets fixate over inflation,"" he said.
Money markets are now pricing in a high probability of a Fed rate increase in June, followed by another in November. CME data suggests a 50% probability of a 25 bps rate hike by July 2022.
""The market assumes that the key rate will be hiked in the second half of next year,"" said Antje Praefcke, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""For me too, the dollar remains a 'buy on dips' short-term.""
The dollar soared last week after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose in October at the fastest rate since 1990, and that momentum continued into Tuesday when a report showed retail sales rose more than expected last month.
Elsewhere, data on Wednesday showed inflation in October hit a 10-year high in Britain and an 18-year high in Canada.
The pound climbed to a one-week high versus the dollar and a 21-month high against the euro after the British data, which boosted expectations of a rate hike by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as early as next month. [GBP/] 
""Although there are still a number of MPC members who take the position that inflation is transitory, the cards now seem stacked in favour of a hawkish turn from the central bank in December,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief analyst at HYCM.
The Canadian dollar eased, as the inflation numbers were in line with forecasts, and as oil prices fell, due in part to the strong U.S. dollar.
The greenback rose as far as 114.975 yen, its highest level since March 2017, before retreating to 114.135 yen. 
The euro was last down 0.07% at $1.1312.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded around $60,000, after dipping below that level on Tuesday for the first time this month.

The U.K. CPI increased by 4.2% year over year in October, above the expected 3.9%. Meanwhile, monthly CPI came in at 1.1%, again above the 0.8% predicted for October. 
September's 12-month rate was 3.1%, while the monthly rate was 0.3%.

The lira dropped for a seventh day, losing as much as 1.3% against the dollar and extending its slide this month to almost 9%, the worst among emerging markets. The currency was down 0.4% at 10.3547 per dollar as of 10:34 a.m. in Istanbul. 
Economists predict the Turkish central bank will cut its benchmark rate by a further 100 basis points when it meets on Thursday, pushing the nation’s real yields deeper into negative territory. Policy makers cut the rate by 300 basis points to 16% in the past two months even as inflation quickened and central banks in developed nations move closer to tightening.

Turkey has been loosening its monetary policy in line with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s unorthodox belief that higher interest rates result in higher prices. A surging U.S. dollar has helped push the lira to record lows and the currency has closed below the psychologically important level of 10 per dollar every day this week.
Almost all emerging-market currencies edged lower against the greenback on Thursday. The lira has dropped the most among developing nations in 2021, losing almost a third of its value since the start of the year.

Just for a minute, let's forget about rising bond yields and record-high stocks. Forex markets are where the action is. 
The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against other major currencies, is at its highest since July 2020. Against the yen, the dollar is at its highest since March 2017.
With Tuesday's strong U.S. retail sales numbers further bolstering rate-hike expectations, major currencies are clearly dividing into two camps -- those propelled higher by prospects of tighter monetary policy behind them and those that are not.
Like the greenback, Britain's pound is in the first camp. News earlier on Wednesday that British inflation surged to a 10-year high last month, rising 4.2% in annual terms, is boosting the likelihood of a Bank of England rate rise, possibly as soon December.
No surprise then, that sterling has hit a 21-month high against the euro and even managed to notch a one-week high against the robust dollar. 
But the ECB's pushback against market pricing for a rate rise next year, has left the euro languishing at 16-month lows versus the dollar. More pain is likely for the single currency.
Stock markets were also on wobbly ground, with MSCI's world stock index pulling back further from record highs, while U.S. and European stock futures were flat to marginally lower. 
Rising COVID-19 cases in some parts of the world is another source of angst. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded 0.5% and was set for its biggest fall this month. With South Korea reporting its second-highest daily new coronavirus infection, Seoul shares led the way down with a 1.2% fall. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- Japan's exports growth hits 8-month low as auto trade slides
- Speech by Oystein Olsen, governor of Central Bank of Norway,
- Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina speaks
- Bank of Iceland meets

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Wednesday, benefiting from the release of strong retail sales during the previous session, while sterling climbed after a hot inflation release pointed to a December Bank of England interest rate hike.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 95.938, after earlier touching 96.267 for the first time since July of last year.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1313, after earlier dipping to a 16-month low of $1.1263, while USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.88, climbing as high as 114.97, its highest since March 2017.
The latest catalyst for these dollar gains was the release of surprisingly strong U.S. retail sales data on Tuesday, which climbed 1.7% on the month in October. 
This added to the momentum generated last week by consumer prices surging at the highest rate since 1990, and could encourage the U.S. Federal Reserve to accelerate the tapering of its asset purchase program, likely bringing forward the timetable of interest rate hikes.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard added oil to the fire, stating on Tuesday that the central bank should ""tack in a more hawkish direction"" over its next couple of meetings.
At the same time, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has this week pushed back on the idea of her central bank lifting interest rates in the near future, warning that tightening monetary policy now to rein in inflation could choke off the Eurozone's recovery.
“The euro remains exposed to the downside in our view,” said analysts at ING, in a note, “and our short-term fair value model is showing that a move below 1.1300 would actually be in line with changes in the main drivers: primarily the short-term swap differential, but also the relative shape of the curve, relative equity performance and global risk appetite.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3463 after British inflation surged to a 10-year high last month, cementing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month, which would make it the first G7 central bank to do so since the pandemic.
Consumer prices rose by 4.2% in annual terms in October, a larger rise than had been expected, and a significant jump from the 3.1% increase in September.
This comes the day after the release of stronger-than-expected U.K. employment data even with the end of the government's job-protecting furlough scheme.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, remaining near a 16-month peak. Investors also digested the latest U.S. economic data and raised bets for an earlier-than-expected interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.14% to 96.043 by 23:20 PM ET (4:20 AM GMT). The index remained near an overnight high of 95.978, a level not seen since July 2020.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.04% to 114.87.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.33% to 0.7278. Australia released wage data earlier in the day, with the wage price index growing 2.2% and 0.6% year-on-year and month-on-month respectively in the third quarter. Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe again pushed back against market pricing for a rate hike in 2022, with recent data not justifying the move.
The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.6989.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.3886 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3418.
U.S. data released on Tuesday showed that core retail sales grew by a better-than-expected 1.7% month-on-month in October. Retail sales also grew a better-than-expected 1.7%. However, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said on Tuesday that the Fed should ""tack in a more hawkish direction"" in preparation for longer-term high inflation.
""The U.S. economy looks to have shaken off the COVID-19 Delta variant soft patch and is regaining forward momentum, albeit with heavy ongoing supply chain issues and reopening bottleneck,"" Westpac analysts said in a note, recommending buying the dollar index on any dips into the low 95 level.
""Hawkish comments from Bullard, who is a voter in 2022, will leave markets comfortable pricing in Fed hikes in that year, a stark contrast with Europe where renewed COVID-19 suppression measures are being implemented.”
Across the Atlantic, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in Europe triggered worries about the continent’s economic recovery from COVID-19. Germany will vote on Thursday on stricter measures to curb its outbreak after Austria imposed a lockdown on unvaccinated people earlier in the week.
European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde will speak later in the day, with ECB board member Isabel Schnabel also speaking at a separate event.
Elsewhere in Europe, the U.K. releases its consumer price index later in the day, which could provide further support to the Bank of England tightening its monetary policy."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose to a 16-month high on Tuesday after data showed U.S. consumers looked past rising prices and drove retail sales higher than expected last month, while the euro slumped amid growth concerns and a surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe. 
U.S. retail sales rose 1.7% in October, topping consensus expectations of a 1.4% rise, likely as Americans started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves amid shortages of some goods as the ongoing pandemic squeezes supply chains.
At 3:15 p.m. EST, the dollar index was up 0.385% at 95.898, having earlier touched 95.928, its highest since July 2020. 
The dollar has rallied since U.S. inflation data last week showed consumer prices surged to their highest rate since 1990, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected.
""If you look at U.S. markets, there's a lot more speculation, at least within implied market pricing, that they will be hiking on more than one occasion next year,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities. ""After last week’s U.S. CPI report, the dam just broke and the dollar and the FX complex is certainly tagging along for the ride.""
""Today’s retail sales report only adds fuel to the fire,"" he said.
The euro extended losses versus the dollar, last down 0.43% at $1.13175. Earlier in the session, the single currency dropped to $1.1315, its weakest since July 2020.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Monday said that tightening monetary policy now to rein in inflation could choke off the euro zone's recovery, comments which were viewed as pushing back on calls and market bets for tighter policy.
The euro's decline reflects the disappointing performance of the euro zone economy relative to the United States, which has been surprising on the upside more than the euro zone has been, said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Holding Ltd.
COVID-19 is also surging again in Europe, which causing some countries to contemplate lockdowns again, whereas the spread of the virus seems to have stabilized for now in the United States, he said.
""As a result, the market is getting increasingly nervous about the euro,"" Gittler said.
On Monday, Austria imposed a lockdown on unvaccinated people, while Germany's parliament is due to vote on Thursday on stricter measures to deal with surging cases. France, the Netherlands and many countries in Eastern Europe are also experiencing a surge in infections.
""The fear that the situation could escalate and result in a more significant tightening of restrictions in the coming months is hurting sentiment towards European currencies,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said in a client note. 

The British pound was up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3429, spurred by data that showed British employers hired more people in October after the government's job-protecting furlough scheme ended.
Elsewhere, the cryptocurrency bitcoin dipped back below $60,000, for the first time since Nov. 1.

Dollar: ""We expect modest U.S. dollar depreciation over the coming year, reflecting our views of a positive backdrop for risk and commodities alongside moderate U.S. dollar overvaluation. Upside risks are largely from risk-off moves rather than U.S. outperformance and limited relative to downside risks stemming from aggressive market pricing for tighter Fed policy."" 
Morgan Stanley
U.S. 10-year yields: ""Continued strong growth in 2022, alongside receding but above-target inflation, keeps the Fed patient, yet gradually moving toward rate hikes, and keeps Treasury yields moving higher.""
Dollar vs euro and yen: ""We see an up-and-down profile for the U.S. dollar. A Fed emphasizing that maximum employment is ways away and that subsequent hikes post-lift-off are likely to be gradual despite improving data is likely to increasingly contrast with other central banks who, having been quite dovish so far, are beginning to discuss normalization plans of their own. Policy divergence increasingly becomes policy convergence, and U.S. dollar turns lower in response.""
Goldman Sachs 
Dollar: ""Although the broad dollar likely has more downside than upside over the medium term, for it to actually depreciate the structural and cyclical drivers need to align, and we are now less sure that will be the case over the coming year... We revised down our 12-month EUR/USD forecast to $1.18 from $1.25 previously.""

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) 
Dollar: ""Policy repricing amid the ongoing supply-side inflation shock continues. Monetary policy divergence remains a theme for some pairs.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Tuesday, ahead of the release of key retail sales data, while the Chinese yuan benefited from the largely friendly dialogue between the U.S. and Chinese presidents during a virtual meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 95.468, near a new 16-month high.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3777, just above the five-month low reached earlier in the session, after a virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping proceeded relatively smoothly, albeit without any dramatically positive news. 
The leaders of the two largest economies in the world agreed that their countries must increase communication and cooperation, a positive tone that has left the foreign exchange markets looking at the possibility of a reduction in trade tariffs in the near future.
Additionally, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3451 after the release of stronger than expected U.K. employment data, lifting the chance of the Bank of England hiking interest rates in December. 
 British employers added  a net 160,000 workers to their payrolls in October, indicating that the economy had negotiated the end of the government's job-protecting furlough scheme successfully.
The Bank of England decided against raising interest rates at its last meeting, wanting to see how the broader economy held up after the end of its employment support package, but these numbers should help the central bank focus on fighting inflation.
Sticking with economic data, U.S. retail sales data for October are due later in the session. These will be watched closely to see consumer demand remains strong even in the face of high inflation levels, and thus potentially putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to act against the rising prices.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1375, bouncing a touch after earlier falling to a 16-month low, hit by the European region being hit once more by a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases.
The likes of Austria and the Netherlands have already put in place partial lockdowns, and a number of other countries are considering such moves in the runup to Christmas and the winter season.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was insistent at her testimony in the European Parliament on Monday that the central bank wouldn’t be hurried into interest rate hikes, and this dovish stance is also weighing on the single currency.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.25, while AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7339 after Reserve Bank of Australia head Philip Lowe again pushed back on the idea of rate hikes as soon as 2022.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, while the Euro fell to a 16-month low, as investors await U.S. retail sales data. A strong reading could pressurize the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 95.427 by 10:37 PM ET (3:37 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 114.19.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.23% to 0.7361, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) releasing the minutes from its November meeting earlier in the day. “The risks are tilted towards AUD/USD weakness today given the large gap between market pricing for rate hikes in 2022 and RBA rhetoric,” said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Joe Capurso.
The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7060.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.17% to 6.3715, as U.S President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping kicked off a virtual summit.
The GBP/USD pair incheded up 0.10% to 1.3432.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said to a parliamentary committee that he was “very uneasy” about inflation, which caused the euro’s fall to its steepest slide against the pound in six months. Overnight the EUR/USD tumbled below $1.14 for the first time since July 2021 as the number of COVID-19 cases in Europe rise.
European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagard pushed back on the need to tame inflation, telling European Union lawmakers, “if we were to take any tightening measures now, it could cause far more harm than it would do any good.”
""We expect the cautiousness of the ECB on policy to limit recovery prospects for the euro against the dollar in the coming months,"" Rabobank senior FX strategist Jane Foley told Reuters.
""Our current mid-2022 forecast of EUR/USD at $1.14 is looking outdated... we will be revising our forecasts later in the week.""
“In our view, the forecasts point to decent data, which following last week's acceleration in the U.S. consumer price index could increase bets over a hike by the Fed as soon as the tapering process is over,” JFD Group head of research Charalambos Pissouros said in a note.
Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales figures will be released later in the day, and Monday's NY Empire State Manufacturing Index was a stronger-than-expected 30.90 in November. The Eurozone consumer price index is due on Wednesday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The safe-haven dollar hit a 16-month high against its major peers on Monday, fueled by global growth and inflation concerns, as well as monetary policy expectations, as investors awaited data this week on the strength of U.S. consumers. 
The dollar surged on Wednesday after data showed U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, casting doubt on the Federal Reserve's view that price pressures will be transitory and fueling speculation that interest rates will be lifted sooner than previously thought.
""I feel like I'm trading back in the '90s when everybody paid a great deal more attention to what the Fed was going to do,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.
""It's been a while since we've had a real change in comparative sovereign rates and that seems to be where we're heading.""
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six peers, hit 95.462 on Monday, its highest since July 2020, and was last up 0.274% at 95.394.
Demand for the greenback had softened on Friday, when a report showed consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest in a decade, due in part to the surge in inflation. But it firmed again on Monday after policy makers in Europe and the United Kingdom voiced growth and pricing concerns.
Investors will look to U.S. retail sales data on Tuesday for clues as to where the dollar may be headed next. The data is expected to show retail sales rose 1.1% last month, according to a Reuters poll. 
""Following the consumer sentiment data, attention will be firmly on U.S. retail sales tomorrow to see whether the decline in consumer morale is being reflected in retail sales,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. 
Gains in the heavily euro-weighted dollar index have also been helped by a decline in the single currency, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde continuing to push back on market bets for tighter policy.
Supply-chain bottlenecks and soaring energy costs are slowing euro zone growth and will keep inflation elevated for longer than had been thought, Lagarde said. 
Lagarde ""reiterating the dovish outlook of policy makers"" kept the euro in check, said Jane Foley, head of FX Strategy at Rabobank London.
The euro hit a 16-month low against the greenback and was last down 0.49% at $1.13865. 
Versus the Swiss franc, the euro slid to its weakest in 18 months and was last down 0.17% at 1.0524.
Interest in the euro/Swiss franc cross has grown sharply, said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe, ""because the Swiss franc is a natural hedge against inflation."" 

Swiss National Bank governing board member Andrea Maechler said modest Swiss inflation, at an annual rate of around 1.2%, was capping the franc's rise. But she reiterated the SNB's commitment to currency market interventions designed to limit, if needed, the effect that the Swiss franc's strength has on Switzerland's export-orientated economy. 
In Britain, the pound rose 0.16% to $1.3429 to start off a data-heavy week with employment, inflation and retail sales numbers expected to provide clues on whether the Bank of England will raise rates in December, as expected by markets. On Friday, sterling touched its lowest level this year versus the dollar.

Investing.com – The euro fell to more than 16-month lows against the dollar Monday and is in for more pain after breaking through key support amid expectations for European central banks to remain dovish.
EUR/USD fell 0.59% to $1.1383.
In a hearing at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs  ECB President Christine Lagarde on Monday reiterated that the ECB continues to expect inflation to remain below target in the medium-term and ""very unlikely "" to be compatible with rate hikes next year.
""At a time when purchasing power is already being squeezed by higher energy and fuel bills, an undue tightening of financing conditions is not desirable, and would represent an unwarranted headwind for the recovery,"" Lagarde said.
The comments came amid growing fears that the European Union economy could suffer a setback as parts of Europe including the Netherlands and Austria have returned to partial lockdowns to curb a surge in Covid cases.
Germany, the most productive EU nation, is reportedly set to plan national restrictions for the unvaccinated.
“New lockdowns in Europe fuel growth concerns,” Commerzbank said, after noting the risk of further downside as the EUR/USD testing key support of $1.1420 before breaking lower.
Others agree and see EUR/USD falling to $1.13 by the end of November.
“Last week saw EUR/USD break below 1.1500, and we think there is now room for the pair to decline to the 1.1300 level by the end of November,” ING said in a note.
The latest positioning data, however, suggests that traders are betting on some respite for the single currency after trimming their bearish bets.
Speculative bets against the euro fell to five-week lows, with the net position on open interest rebounding further and flirting with the positive territory, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Positioning Report for the week ended Nov. 2."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Surging inflation and expectations of a potentially more hawkish Federal Reserve are accelerating a rally in the U.S. dollar, buoying the currency to a near 16-month high against its peers and putting it on pace for its biggest annual gain in six years. 
On Monday the U.S. Dollar Currency Index rose 0.3% to 95.437, its highest since July 2020.

A number of banks including HSBC, Citi and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have in recent days forecast more gains for the greenback, as Wall Street gauges whether rising inflation will push the Fed to speed up the unwind of its bond-buying program and raise rates more aggressively than expected. 
Here is a look at some factors driving the dollar's rally. 
Graphic: Inflation and real yield advantage https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzydkxavw/Pasted%20image%201636727898037.png 
INFLATION 
Inflation has run hotter than expected in recent months, bolstering the argument that the Fed will have to act more aggressively to tame rising consumer prices. Higher U.S. rates tend to make some dollar-denominated assets, like Treasuries, more attractive to yield-seeking investors. 
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index jumped nearly 1% last Wednesday, its largest one-day move in nearly five months, after data showed U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest annual gain in 31 years last month. 
""The dollar may be in the early stages of an uptrend if higher inflation should prompt the Fed to retire its bond buying program and raise interest rates ahead of current market expectations,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
The U.S. dollar index has appreciated at the start of the last four of the Fed’s hiking cycles, with a mean gain of 3.1% in the first seven months, economists at Citi noted in a recent report. The bank expects the Fed to speed up the unwind of its $120 billion a month bond buying program in January as inflation pressures mount. 
UBS Global Wealth Management analysts, meanwhile, believe a comparatively more hawkish monetary policy from the Fed could push the euro to $1.10 by the end of 2022, from $1.14 on Monday.

BULLISH BETS 
Net bullish positions on the dollar in futures markets have edged lower in recent weeks, though at $19.51 billion they still remain near recent highs after flipping from bearish in mid-July, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Nov. 5.
BofA Global Research's Bull-Bear Index for exposure and view, which tracks fund managers' responses on FX surveys, recently stood close to its highest level since December 2016, indicating bullishness on the U.S. currency.
The index, which moderated slightly recently, is likely to have readjusted after the latest inflation data, BofA Global Research strategists said in a note last week.
""Positioning is not stretched here, but has unwound the 2020 shorts,"" the strategists wrote. 
Graphic: Dollar dominance https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-MARKETS/DOLLAR/byprjkmqzpe/chart.png 
EMERGING MARKETS 
A strong dollar can be particularly troublesome for emerging markets, making it more expensive for developing countries to pay down debt denominated in the U.S. currency. 
The dollar is up 35% against the Turkish lira this year and has gained 5% against the Brazilian real. The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index is up 0.9%, on pace for its smallest annual gain in three years. 
On Monday, the lira touched a fresh all-time low against the dollar as concerns of another rate cut from the central bank this week continued to weigh on the currency.
""The Fed is starting to tighten monetary policy, worries around China and the pandemic persist, and many emerging markets won’t be able to keep up with the sound growth outlook for developed markets,"" Tilmann Kolb, analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note last week. ""We think this means more weakness against the U.S. dollar.""

BITCOIN BOOM 
Inflation fears have raised the allure of other assets, including oil, metal and other raw materials. Some analysts believe they have also contributed to the recent rise in bitcoin, which hit a fresh record earlier this month. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 120% in 2021.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Monday, retreating from a 16-month high, as traders seek new clues as to the Federal Reserve’s thinking over the timing of interest rate hikes.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.073, falling back from Friday’s 16-month high of 95.267. 
EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1449, just above Friday's 16-month low of 1.1433, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 113.95, while GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3416, recovering from Friday’s 1.3354 low, its weakest level this year. 
The dollar soared to its highest level in over a year last week when data showed U.S. consumer prices rising last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, casting doubts on whether the Federal Reserve can defend its line that this year's spike in inflation will be transitory.
“The rise in price pressures requires the Federal Reserve to be more flexible to address a range of possible outcomes,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The pace of the tapering is the main constraint on policy. The FOMC statement committed the Fed to reduce the bond-buying by $15 bln in November and December. While it anticipated that the pace would continue, it reserved the right to adjust the rate. This is likely to be the focus in the run-up to the mid-December meeting.” 
Ahead of that, the main focus as far as the U.S. economic data slate is concerned this week will be Tuesday's retail sales data, particularly after the University of Michigan survey on Friday showed consumer confidence unexpectedly plunged to a decade low in early November.
Additionally, traders will keep a wary watch out for comments coming out of a virtual summit between President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping later Monday, given the tense relationship between the two global economic superpowers. XI goes into the meeting having cemented his position at the top of the Communist Party last week at a meeting that could see him extend his term in office. That would be a major break from the precedent of the last 30 years. USD/CNY rose slightly to 6.3812, the yuan still testing a three-year high as annual growth in Chinese retail sales and industrial output both beat forecasts in October. 
The yuan's strength also gives the People's Bank of China more leeway to cut its minimum reserve requirement, a step that analysts have said is increasingly likely given the strains on the country's real estate sector.
Elsewhere, ECB President Christine Lagarde will speak before the European Parliament later Monday, and is unlikely to change hers dovish policy stance against the backdrop of a slowing economy and rising numbers of Covid cases.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, remaining below an almost 16-month high. Investors now await the next clues on the status of the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 after the brought forward bets for a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike during the previous week as inflation continues to skyrocket.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.13% to 95.007 by 23:32 PM ET (4:32 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 113.86, after Japan’s third-quarter GDP contracting by a larger-than-expected 3% year-on-year and 0.8% quarter-on-quarter.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.7344, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its November meeting on Tuesday. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7049.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.3819. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that fixed-asset investment grew 6.1% year-on-year, industrial production grew 3.5% year-on-year and retail sales grew 4.9% year-on-year in October. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will also reportedly hold a virtual summit with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3428.
U.S. data released during the previous week showed that the consumer price index grew at its fastest annual pace since 1990, giving the dollar boost. Investors are now doubting the Fed’s insistence that inflationary pressures will be temporary, pricing the first rate increase by July 2022 and a high likelihood of another by November 2022 as of the end of last week.
Investors now await U.S. retail sales data, which will be released on Tuesday. ""It will be important to watch what still cashed-up U.S. consumers do rather than what they say,"" considering readings of sentiment were at odds with actual spending during the summer, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
The dollar index, which is heavily euro-weighted, has also been boosted by the euro's drop as the European Central Bank (ECB) will not likely change its current dovish tone. The euro was little changed at $1.14455, remaining near Friday's 16-month low of $1.1433.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar lost a little ground on Friday as high inflation wreaked havoc on consumer sentiment, but the greenback was on track for its biggest weekly gain in almost three months after a surprisingly strong U.S. inflation print on Wednesday prompted investors to advance their bets for a U.S rate hike.
The dollar turned red on Friday morning after the University of Michigan survey showed a plunge in U.S. consumer sentiment in early November to its lowest level in a decade as surging inflation cut into households' living standards, with few believing policymakers are doing enough to mitigate the issue.
With short-dated U.S. Treasury yields edging higher -- five-year bond yields rose to a February 2020 high -- investors were ramping up bets this week that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sooner than expected. [US/] 
Against a basket of its rivals, at 1517 EST (2017 GMT) the dollar index was down 0.04% at 95.116 after falling as low as 94.991 in response to consumer sentiment. Earlier in the session it had risen to its highest level since July 2020.
""Consumers are clearly more worried about real income growth as inflation outpaces wages for now, and that is weighing on sentiment,"" said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
""That is feeding into growth worries for the dollar and pushing it lower against most currencies, especially the Japanese yen as U.S. yields decline here.""
The dollar was down 0.14% at 113.915 yen after falling as low as 113.77.
Currency markets have been shaken up since Wednesday when data showed a broad-based rise in U.S. consumer prices last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, casting doubts on the Fed's stance that price pressure will be transitory.
But while Friday's survey raised some eyebrows, strategists were bullish on the dollar, which was boasting its biggest weekly percentage gain since the week ending Aug. 22.
""The confidence data this morning was probably a bit of an eye opener for the markets ... and perhaps helped nudge the dollar just slightly off its highs,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, Scotiabank in Toronto.
While the closure of bond markets on Thursday interrupted the flow of the market this week, still ""the focus is clearly on inflation"" according to Osborne, who says this ""should mean that the US dollar stays relatively well supported."" 
""We'll be in a standoff in the next few months. We'll keep an eye on what the Fed does,"" he added. 
The renewed strength in the dollar earlier during the week injected fresh life into the moribund currency volatility markets, as traders have scrambled to buy options to protect themselves against further dollar strength. A currency volatility index hit a fresh six-month high on Friday. 
Markets were pricing a first rate increase by July and a high likelihood of another by November. CME data is assigning a 50% probability of a rate hike by then, compared with less than 30% a month earlier.
The euro was down 0.06% at $1.1443 after falling earlier to an almost 16-month low at $1.1433.
Investors have become increasingly bearish on the outlook for the single currency as the European Central Bank appears unlikely to change its extremely dovish policy settings in the near term against the backdrop of a slowing economy.
Sterling bulls received a slight reprieve on Friday as GBP/USD rebounded after hitting a fresh 2021 low, though the rise may only offer temporary solace as technical and fundamental factors pointed to further declines.
Stering was last up 0.39% against the dollar. It had gained ground in late morning as the dollar weakened and after the European Union said it was committed to coming to an agreement with the UK regarding Northern Ireland.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was up 0.53% at $0.733 after earlier sinking as low as $0.7277 for the first time in more than a month. 
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 1% at $64,104.89 after briefly hitting a record high of $69,000 earlier in the week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wasn't surging inflation supposed to undermine the U.S. dollar?
Be that as it may, the opposite happened this week as news of a surprise spike in U.S. inflation and inflation expectations to their highest in decades sent the U.S. dollar soaring against currencies around the world. 
The dollar's main index zoomed to its highest for the year as the euro and sterling, which make up 58% and 12% of that index respectively, slumped to 2021 lows.
For some, this made little sense.
There's a long-standing narrative out there that over-easy Fed money and seemingly endless creation of new dollars via Fed bond buying will eventually fuel inflation and undermine the greenback as the kingpin of the world financial system.
All things equal, higher consumer inflation should be bad for a currency as it means people can buy fewer goods and services for their coin. Allowed to fester, spiralling prices and resulting hyperinflation have in the past rendered national currencies effectively worthless. 
Fear of so-called 'dollar debasement' has been the stuff of gold bulls for decades, and many have been demanding a return to the gold standard ever since it was abandoned 50 years ago. Lately, cryptocurrency evangelists have taken up the cudgel.
Yet, the failure of bitcoin or ethereum to get excited by Wednesday's U.S. inflation shock underscored just how patchy the argument for buying crypto as an inflation hedge remains.
And even though gold rose this week, it remains in the red for the year. Long-standing gold bugs and Fed critics, such as Euro Pacific Capital's Peter Schiff, were left scratching their heads as to why the dollar was rising. 
""Today's dollar rally makes no sense,"" Schiff tweeted on Wednesday. ""The fact that the dollar is losing purchasing power much faster than expected doesn't make the dollar more valuable."" 
So what gives? 
Prosaicly, it's all just relative. Even if faith in the Fed is in question, foreign exchanges dictate that any loss of the bank's credibility only matters if it's more or less than any other central bank out there.
And more posaically still, that all comes down to the basics of where you expect U.S. interest rates and inflation to be relative to those of their major peers a year from now.
DOLLAR IN YOUR POCKET?
This week's slide in the world's pivotal euro/dollar pair to its lowest since July 2020 came as the one-year interest rate gap in favour of dollars surged after the inflation data. It's now added almost 20 basis points to 0.9% in just three weeks.
The Fed is now priced to hike policy rates at least twice by the end of next year, starting as soon as July. The European Central Bank barely has one smaller hike priced, but ECB officials loudly insist a rate rise next year is very unlikely.
Whether these rate premiums cover expected inflation differentials is less obvious. They are shy on a one-year horizon - but they do seem to comfortably cover the risk on a 5-10 year view, judging by the relative inflation swaps market.
And more immediately, U.S. economic data is surprising consensus forecasts more positively than the still deeply negative surprises seen in the euro zone. In fact, the gap between U.S. and euro economic surprise indices compiled by Citi is more positive in favour of the United States than at any other point since October last year.
Even though Fed critics like Schiff doubt the Fed will be willing to tighten to the extent the market now thinks, more mainstream investors feel the Fed will react next year and there is much more room to reprice those expectations higher than there is for other central banks.
Leander Galli, senior portfolio manager at Amundi’s global fixed income team, thinks the market is neither fully priced yet for higher U.S. inflation longer-term nor for the degree to which the Fed will act to contain it.
""The more the Fed waits, the faster it will have to go eventually.""
So is spiky inflation today the beginning of a big 'debasement' or the spur for more handsome returns?
There are myriad arguments back and forth as always.
What it does recall is the sometimes tedious debate over the U.S. Treasury's presumed 'strong dollar' policy - a clipped mantra that 'a strong dollar is in the U.S. interests,' which former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin repeated in the 1990s to bat away questions about whether Washington weakened the dollar for trade advantage.

Subsequent Treasury secretaries often tied themselves in knots over the wording - often unwisely nuancing the statement around whether it simply meant a strong dollar in your pocket via low inflation or strength on world currency markets.
This week at least, it's most certainly the latter.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Friday, but still traded just below its 16-month high, as soaring U.S. inflation prompts traders to position for the Federal Reserve raising interest rates more quickly than expected.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 95.123, just below the overnight fresh 16-month high of 95.267. The index is on track for a gain of around 1% this week, the most since the week ended June 20.
EUR/USD was flat at 1.1451, just above the 16-month low at 1.1436, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.17, while GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3385, just above the 1.3354 low, its weakest level this year.
The catalyst for these dollar gains was Wednesday’s release of U.S. consumer prices data, showing the consumer price index grew 6.2% year-on-year in October, the fastest annual pace since 1990.
These elevated, and persistent, inflation levels are fuelling speculation that the Federal Reserve policymakers will be forced to row back on their belief that price pressures will be ""transitory"", and instead lift interest rates sooner than previously indicated.
Markets are now pricing in a first rate increase by July and a high likelihood of another by November.
“Clearly higher inflation is becoming problematic for both the Administration and the Fed. In this light, we suspect Washington will not mind the dollar breaking to the highs of the year as the currency can do some of the tightening of monetary conditions,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
With this in mind, further dollar gains look likely, especially against the euro after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said last week that higher interest rates next year were very unlikely, pushing back on market bets for a move as soon as next October.
The “1.1500 support has given way in EUR/USD without much fanfare,” said ING, and “technically, the spot move looks as though it can extend to the 1.1300/1330 area this month.”
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment and the JOLTs Job Openings index for September are due later in the session, but traders will especially focus on a speech by New York Fed President John Williams at an online conference later Friday, as this could provide clues to the Fed’s reaction to high inflation.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, and was set for its best week in five months. Investors continue to bet that higher-than-expected inflation will prompt central banks to hike interest rates quicker than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies grew 0.07% to 95.237 by 23:41 PM ET (4:41 AM GMT), remaining just below a record 16 month high of 95.267.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.18% to 114.25.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7287 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.23% to 0.7003.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.10% to 6.3965 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 1.3363.
U.S. inflation data released on Wednesday showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 6.2% year-on-year and 0.9% month-on-month in October, while the core CPI rose 4.6% year-on-year and 0.6% month-on-month.
Investors are ramping up bets on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates earlier than expected. Investors are now pricing the first rate hike by July 2022 and another by December of that year, according to Reuters.
“We still think market pricing has room to firm further, especially in 2023, which can further support USD,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kimberley Mundy said in a note.
Meanwhile, ""interest rate futures are too aggressive in pricing in European Central Bank (ECB) rate increases for 2022 considering ECB policymakers are not budging from their ultra‑dovish guidance,"" giving scope for further euro weakness, the note added.
On the data front, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment and Michigan Consumer Expectations indexes for November are due later in the day. The data also includes the JOLTs Job Openings index for September.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to almost 16-month highs against the euro and other currencies on Thursday, after the hottest U.S. inflation reading in 30 years encouraged bets that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy faster than expected.
News on Wednesday that U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990 fueled speculation that the U.S. central bank would lift interest rates sooner than expected as traders question its stance that current high inflation is ""transitory.""
The dollar index looked set for a second straight day of gains, touching a session peak of 95.197, its highest since July 22, 2020. It was last up 0.36% at 95.1630. 
The euro was down 0.28% at $1.1446 after hitting $1.1430, the lowest since July 2020. 
""It feels like we're still trading the repercussions of the CPI,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at UBS in New York.
""The path of least resistance in the short term appears to be dollar higher. ... Stronger inflation weakens the transitory narrative, which means the Fed might need to tighten sooner.""
Second-day inflation-related bets and closure of the U.S. bond market for the Veterans Day holiday likely reduced trading volume and amped up price volatility, said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXstreet.com, a website following financial markets.
""Generally when the bond market is closed there's less liquidity and you tend to get more exaggerated moves because there's less liquidity to absorb any particular move,"" he said.
Sterling was down 0.31% at $1.3363 after hitting $1.3359, its lowest since December 2020. Data showing Britain's economy lagging rivals in the July-September period did little to help.
The greenback was last up 0.15% against the Japanese yen, trading in a range of 113.81 yen to 114.15 yen during the day after the U.S. currency rose sharply on Wednesday.
The dollar scored its second straight day of gains against another safe haven, the Swiss franc, last up 0.40% at 0.9217.
Swiss National Bank governing board member Andrea Maechler said at an event late on Thursday the Swiss franc remained in demand as a safe haven investment with market uncertainties elevated due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were pulled lower by the U.S. dollar strength. The Aussie was last down 0.46% at $0.7291 after hitting a month low of $0.7287 and New Zealand's Kiwi dropped 0.54% to $0.7019 after hitting its lowest level since Oct. 14. [AUD/]
Turkey's lira tumbled to a record low of 9.975 to the dollar after the U.S. inflation reading, and on growing expectations that Turkey will cut rates again soon.

In crypto currencies, Bitcoin was up 0.2% at $65,053.95 after hitting a $69,000 intraday record on Wednesday.

Investing.com — The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen Thursday against other major currencies following Wednesday's inflation data.
The Labor Department reported inflation data that showed U.S. consumer prices for the 12 months through October rose at their fastest pace in over 30 years, rising 6.2% from a year ago.
As a result, U.S. Treasury bond yields and the US Dollar Index surged.
Bond markets in the U.S. remained closed today due to the Veterans Day holiday. 
The GBP/USD has fallen well below the 1.34 level and is approaching 1.3350. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD sliced through the 1.15 level on Wednesday and is currently trading around the 1.1450 mark, a level not seen since July last year."

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Thursday, climbing to 2021 highs, as soaring U.S. inflation lifted expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates relatively soon.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.3% higher at 95.073, a level it last saw in June 2020.
EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1473, just above Thursday’s 1.1465 low, its weakest level since July 2020. USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 114.02, close to a three-year high, after Japanese wholesale inflation hit a four-decade high. In contrast to the Fed, neither the European Central Bank nor the Bank of Japan are expected to tighten monetary policy noticeably for the foreseeable future.
The dollar's advance follows Wednesday’s release of U.S. consumer prices data, which showed that prices grew at their fastest annual pace since 1990 in October and raised fresh doubts about whether the Fed can afford to sit on its hands until at least the end of next year, as its most recent guidance suggests. Price rises were both higher than expected and broad-based - and would have been even worse without a temporary drop in air fare prices due to Delta-variant Covid-19.
The currency move was also supported by a surge in Treasury yields, with the difference between 5-Year U.S. yields and the equivalent yields in Japan and Germany has grown to the widest level since early 2020. Bonds had sold off in the U.S. on Wednesday after a weak auction of 30-year debt.
“The broadening of the inflation picture continues into 2022 as wage growth tends to accelerate the price pressure in broader terms, hence the Fed will get increasing evidence of a broader price pick-up,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “This supports our view of a swifter than currently projected tapering path and three rate hikes in 2022.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3390, dropping to a fresh 11-month low. The U.K. economy grew by 0.6% in September but estimates for previous months were revised lower, leaving GDP 0.6% smaller than it was in February 2020. The Polish zloty continued to weaken against both the euro and the dollar, amid the ongoing standoff with migrants on the Belarusian border that has caused the latest diplomatic crisis between Belarus and Europe.
AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7311 after the jobs report in Australia showed an unexpected rise in unemployment in the middle of a pandemic lockdown.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia. The U.S. currency was at its highest levels in 2021 against the pound and the euro, while the yen took a sharp fall after U.S. inflation rose to its highest level in a generation and fanned bets on interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 94.905 by 11:50 PM ET (4:50 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 113.98.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.38% to 0.7298 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.29% to 0.7038.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.27% to 6.4055.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3405. The U.K. releases growth data, including its GDP for the third quarter, later in the day.
The euro slid 1% to $1.1476, its lowest level since July 2020, after the U.S. released inflation data on Wednesday. The data showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 6.2% year-on-year and 0.9% month-on-month in October. The core CPI rose 4.6% year-on-year and 0.6% month-on-month.
U.S. Treasury yields also surged. These rates move, especially at the short end, suggest traders believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will step in to hike interest rates if prices keep running higher, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy, Ray Attrill told Reuters.
""The market is still conferring a degree of credibility on the Fed, that they are not going to allow very high inflation to persist indefinitely,"" he said. If the dollar index moves higher than 95, investors might start to get out of the way.
""It's quite a big level technically and if we can break up through that then there will be more people throwing in the towel.”
In Asia Pacific, Australia also released employment data earlier in the day. The data showed that the employment change contracted by 46,300 and the full employment change contracted by 40,400 in October. The unemployment rate increased to 5.2%.
To gauge the likelihood of further dollar gains, investors now look to the data’s impact on the Fed’s next moves.
""From a forex standpoint, we are in a stand-off,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Alan Ruskin told Reuters.
""On the dollar, we have the classic dilemma. If the Fed won't respond to high inflation, it is dollar negative, if the Fed brings forward tightening it is dollar positive. Right now, the dollar is broadly stuck between these two worlds,” he added."

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar index jumped sharply on Wednesday, with the euro hitting a 16-month low against the greenback, after U.S. consumer prices surged to their highest rate since 1990, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected. 
The consumer price index rose 0.9% last month after gaining 0.4% in September and in the 12 months through October, the consumer price index accelerated 6.2%. the U.S. Labor Department said on Wednesday, while analysts expected on average the rise to be limited to 5.8%.
While the Fed last week restated its belief that the current inflation surge would be short-lived, many investors worry that underestimating price increases could prove to be a costly policy mistake. 
At 1140 EDT (1640 GMT), the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.60% at 94.5230 after reaching a high of 94.609, just below its 13 and half-month high of 94.634 reached on Nov. 5. 
While the Federal Reserve is already tapering its bond buying, rising inflation may force it to hike interest rates sooner than expected said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
But ""rate hikes might not be enough to reverse inflation because the sources of inflation involve supply chain bottlenecks and fiscal spending, which are two areas that the Federal Reserve doesn't control” she said.
“If inflation doesn't subside, the Federal Reserve may need to taper at a more substantial rate and hike interest rates, which could hurt stocks and bonds,” said Davis. 
Against Japan's yen the greenback was last up 0.85% to 113.86 yen after touching a session high of 113.940. On Tuesday the dollar had hit a month-low against the yen.
Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York said the ""pretty shocking"" inflation data including sharp housing price increases suggest that high consumer prices are ""not likely to prove transitory."" 
The euro was last down 0.61% at $1.1523 after earlier touching $1.15115, its lowest level since July 21, 2020.
Hammered last week after the Bank of England's surprise decision to keep rates unchanged, sterling was last down 0.59% at $1.3482, but still holding above Friday's more than one-month low of $1.3425. 
The Australian dollar was down 0.24% against the greenback at $0.7363 after earlier hitting $0.7341, its lowest level since Oct. 13. The New Zealand dollar was down 0.55% against the U.S. dollar at $0.7091.
""What do these numbers say? Simply that inflation is going to be long-lasting and structural inflation has picked up speed,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities In New York. 
""The bottom line is that this is going to be a real challenge for the Fed in the coming months and suggests that inflation has not peaked,"" he added.
Data had also shown on Tuesday that U.S. producer prices increased solidly in October, driven by surging costs for gasoline and motor vehicle retailing, suggesting that high inflation could persist. 
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin jumped to an all-time high of $69,000.00 after the U.S. inflation data and was last up 2.5% at $68,632.87.

Investing.com – Analysts at Nordea Bank expect a more aggressive Fed tightening cycle over the next two years than is currently priced in and therefore say the USD is likely to outperform its peers.
In a research note, analysts Andreas Steno Larsen and Jan von Gerich, said that they expect six interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve through 2023, three hikes next year and three in 2023.
“We continue to find that the Fed is too confident in the transitory narrative, even if they have moved consistently in the direction of our views since the beginning of this year,” Larsen and von Gerich said.
However, they cautioned that the forecast of three rate hikes next year (June, September, and December) would be under pressure should the Fed decide not to increase the tapering pace in Q1. Larsen and von Gerich think an increase in the monthly tapering pace of $20 billion per month, rather than the current planned $15 billion per month, is “on the cards” in the first quarter.  
At the current speed, tapering of asset purchases will conclude by the middle of June.
Nordea expects core inflation to increase to over 5% by the end of the year, with headline inflation exceeding 6%. The analysts believe that the Fed will start to get increasing evidence of a broader price pick-up which supports their view of a faster taper and three hikes next year.
Larsen and von Gerich do not expect ECB rate hikes to be on the table next year, with the central bank adamant that high inflation in the Eurozone is transitory and will fall back below target next year.
The two analysts “largely agree” with that assessment but do see inflation pressure mounting gradually in the Euro area as the labour market recovery proceeds.
Therefore, Nordea has now added one 25 basis point hike to their baseline forecast for late 2023.
With the Fed on a more aggressive tightening cycle, Larsen and von Gerich stick to their long-held view that the relative discrepancy policy-wise should lead to a stronger USD versus EUR.
Nordea now sees EUR/USD falling to 1.08 by the end of next year, with next year’s French election and fraught relations between the EU and UK also potentially playing a part in EUR weakness.
However, they note that rumours that the UK may decide to trigger Article 16 and lead to a renegotiation of the Brexit trade deal as being a “clear risk” for GBP.
Therefore, despite the Bank of England being on a more hawkish path than the ECB, Nordea sees EUR/GBP increasing to 0.88 by the middle of next year and GBP/USD dropping as low as 1.2700.
In regards to government bond yields, Nordea has lifted its forecast for the US 10-Year yield and now expects it to hit 2.5% by the end of next year (previously 2.30%).
Nordea has also lifted its forecast for the German 10-Year yield to 0.25% at the end of next year from 0.10% previously.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - The recent explosion in interest rate volatility and dramatic repricing of central banks' near-term policy path has claimed a few victims across the financial market spectrum, none more so than currency-trading hedge funds. 
Policymakers from Brazil to Britain, and from Turkey to Canada, caught investors off guard with surprise rate decisions and policy guidance. Yet it is leveraged foreign exchange trading, where interest rate differentials drive speculators' currency bets, that the spillover has been most visible.
Hedge fund industry data provider HFR's benchmark currency index plunged 4.37% in October to a four-and-a-half year low, its biggest monthly fall since the index's inception in 2008. 
Of HFR's near 40 major benchmark indexes across a range of asset classes and strategies, it is the only one in the red year to date. 
As HFR President Ken Heinz points out, every FX trading style and strategy lost money in October - carry, momentum, value, and volatility - while the flattening U.S. yield curve also tightened the squeeze on funding for FX carry strategies.
The outsized aggregate losses in October are puzzling, however, given the veneer of calm in most currencies, where implied volatility and spot exchange rates barely budged.
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) liken equity and currency markets to a duck swimming - gliding serenely across the water, but paddling furiously below the surface. The frenetic churn is the wild swings in short-term rates. 
They find that aside from the volatility at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February-April 2020, the last couple of weeks have produced the highest intensity of large one-day cross-asset moves at any time since 2011.
Don't hedge funds crave volatility to pounce on price mismatches and arbitrage opportunities? If they can ride the rising tide of volatility, that is considered 'good' volatility; but if the wave crashes on top of them, that's 'bad' volatility. 
""Traders always want to look for relative value and disconnects, but what we have seen in the rates space is that a lot of these relationships have been unusually odd. That reduces risk appetite,"" says Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley's chief cross-asset strategist. 
These oddities include flattening at the ultra-short end of some rate curves, and flattening - even inversion - at the ultra-long end of others. These moves can bamboozle funds looking to exploit short-term anomalies, as well as those betting on longer-term trends.
POLICY DIVERGENCE
In normal times, investors are plagued with a greater degree of uncertainty surrounding the longer term outlook than the near-term horizon. This goes for pretty much everything, from central bank policy and inflation, to growth and political risk.
It helps explain risk premium and term premium in bond markets, and why yield curves should slope upward. 
But these are not normal times. There is no playbook for how policymakers steer economies out of a global pandemic, and no template for investors to navigate that lack of clarity. 
Some of the world's most renowned macro hedge funds reportedly suffered huge losses in the recent blow up, stung by a burst of central bank 'miscommunication' and the dramatic re-pricing of rate expectations that followed.
The Reserve Bank of Australia abruptly decided not to intervene in the bond market and cap three-year yields at 0.1%, the Bank of Canada summarily ended its quantitative easing bond-buying program, and having signaled it was preparing to raise rates, the Bank of England backed off from pulling the trigger.
Several emerging market central banks put their foot down on the tightening accelerator - most notably Brazil's - prompting mixed and unpredictable currency swings. Turkey's central bank, meanwhile, slashed rates by 200 basis points.
Perhaps most alarming is the growing uncertainty surrounding the make-up and direction of the Federal Reserve. Chair Jerome Powell's re-nomination is far from guaranteed, and three resignations have freed up seats on the institution's rate-setting committee. 
Implied U.S. Treasury market volatility last week spiked to its highest since March last year, while key gauges of U.S. dollar vol against major currencies and the VIX index measuring S&P 500 volatility remain anchored near recent lows.

Interest rate volatility, if not FX vol, is likely to remain a key driver for currency markets for the remainder of the year, according to JP Morgan's FX strategy team.
""Markets are left with much weakened faith in central bank forward guidance, a greater willingness to reprice on data surprises and thus a propensity to test the limits of central bank patience,"" they wrote in a note on Friday.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, with producer price inflation data in both the U.S. and China weighing on risk sentiment, and with investors mindful that U.S. consumer price inflation - data for which are due later - is also close to a 30-year high.  
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 94.130, still some way before Friday’s peak of 94.645, its highest level for over a year.
EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1568, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 113.09, still not far removed from Tuesday's low of 112.73, a level last seen on Oct. 11. GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3553, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7360.
The safe haven greenback has benefited from a bout of risk aversion, with global stocks retreating from record levels. Additionally, fears of potential contagion from China's property market worries are growing after developer Fantasia Holdings warned Wednesday it might not be able to meet its debt obligations.
The country’s biggest developer China Evergrande Group also faces its biggest solvency test yet Wednesday, with over $148 million of coupon payments due on three dollar bonds. 
That said, most eyes are on the release of the U.S. consumer price index data for October later in the season, especially after U.S. factory gate prices remained at elevated levels on Tuesday. This reminded the market that inflation remains a live issue, with the Federal Reserve still having to decide when to start raising interest rates as the economy recovers.
Economists expect the headline October CPI index to climb 0.4% on the month, accelerating from a 0.2% rise in the previous month, with the closely watched year-on-year core measure gaining 0.4% to 4.3%, well above the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target.
The Federal Reserve insisted at its recent policy-setting meeting that it was still too early to raise rates, a view that the likes of San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari repeated this week.
By contrast, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard took a more hawkish view, calling for  two rate hikes in 2022.
""If inflation is more persistent than we are saying right now, then I think we may have to take a little sooner action in order to keep inflation under control,"" Bullard said Monday in an interview on Fox Business Network. 
Elsewhere, USD/CNY edged higher to 6.3935 after data from China showed that the country's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia after a three-day loss, and was near a one-month low against the yen. Investors now await the latest U.S. inflation data that could provide a clue to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s timetable for interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 94.032 by 11:54 PM ET (4:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 112.82.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.7367 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.7111.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.3934. Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.7% month-on-month and 1.5% year-on-year in October. The producer price index (PPI) grew by 13.5% year on year.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3557.
Tuesday’s data showed that the U.S. PPI grew 0.6% month-on-month and 8.6% year-on-year in October. The core PPI grew 0.4% month-on-month, and the CPI figure is due later in the day.
“We’ll need to see a print of 0.8% month-on-month to see the dollar index break out of the top of the range of 94.50,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note. While the dollar has been trending lower against the yen, “if U.S. CPI comes in hot then this poses a risk to USD/JPY shorts,” Weston added.
In the ongoing debate on when the Fed will hike interest rates, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard noted corporate pricing power and has already penciled in two interest rate hikes in 2022. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, on the other hand, expects “eye-popping” inflation to subside in 2022 as supply-chain bottlenecks subside.
U.S. President Joe Biden met with Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a potential candidate to be the next Fed Chairman. She is considered a dovish pick, and “Brainard’s possible nomination as Fed Chair is chipping at the dollar,” Westpac analysts said in a note.
“Otherwise, the underlying picture remains dollar-supportive,” the note added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar index dipped in choppy trading on Tuesday as investors awaited data on Wednesday that will be the next major indicator of whether rising price pressures are accelerating.
U.S. producer prices increased solidly in October, data showed on Tuesday, indicating that high inflation could persist for a while amid tight supply chains related to the pandemic.
But traders were holding back on big moves ahead of consumer price index data due on Wednesday morning.
""Looking for any sort of major moves ahead of the U.S. CPI tomorrow is going to be futile. We will likely see a little bit more movement on the FX side of things after CPI,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities.
He expects ""a stronger print than consensus on what is already expected to be a fairly hot CPI print.""
Economists polled by Reuters see monthly CPI accelerating to 0.4% from the previous month's 0.2% rise, with the closely watched year-on-year core measure gaining 0.3 percentage point to 4.3%, well above the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target.
Fed officials on Tuesday said it is not clear that high inflation will become more entrenched than previously expected.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said it will be mid-2022 before there is more clarity on the employment and inflation outlook and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he believes the forces that are currently keeping people out of the labor market and pushing up prices will prove to be temporary.
The dollar index dipped 0.11% to 92.948 while the euro gained 0.07% to $1.1594.
Elsewhere, the yen reached a one-month high of 112.73 against the greenback and last traded at 112.83.
Sterling, hammered last week in the wake of the Bank of England's surprise decision to keep rates on hold, was little changed on the day at $1.3561.
The New Zealand dollar dipped 0.51% to $0.7132 after jumping on Monday. It has been drawing support from expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could raise rates by as much as 50 basis points later this month.

The risk-sensitive Australian dollar dropped 0.60% to trade at $0.7378.
Bitcoin rose to a record $68,564 before reversing course. It was last down 1.15% at $66,791. Ether hit a record high of $4,843.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, drifting ahead of the release this week of key U.S. inflation data to guide the Federal Reserve’s interest rates outlook.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.938, retreating further from Friday’s high of 94.645, it’s highest level for over a year.
EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1597, USD/JPY fell 0.4% to 112.82, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.3568, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD was largely flat at 0.7420.
The Federal Reserve’s insistence that it would be ""patient"" in deciding when to raise rates at its recent policy-setting meeting has caused the dollar to drift lower, even in the wake of Friday’s strong payrolls release.
That’s because Fed funds futures have pushed back the likely date for rates lift-off from around July next year to September or October. 
However, this is before the release of the latest U.S. inflation data, starting with factory gate prices later Tuesday, which are expected to show inflation remaining very much a factor in the central bank’s thinking.
U.S. PPI is expected to rise 0.6% on the month in October, that’s up a massive 8.7% on the year, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
“We still see it as likely that inflation will climb further into the year-end,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “Apartment List’s rent data for recent movers continued to soar in October and is now at 15.8% y/y, indicating plenty of upside risks to the CPI over the coming six months. Used car prices have started to rise again, and we could see a jump in hotel prices plus airline fares if Covid-19 delta cases continue to subside into Christmas.”
As well as this inflation data, a number of central bankers are due to speak later on Tuesday, including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.5% to 9.7250 after Turkey’s central bank cut the amount of gold banks are allowed to hold as part of their lira reserve requirements, effectively increasing the amount of local currency lenders need to deposit at the central bank.
The central bank also increased reserve requirement ratios for foreign currency deposits by 200 basis points to offset any impact on its reserves. 
The lira is suffering as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan battles accepted monetary policy wisdom by seeking lower interest rates to fight soaring inflation.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, remaining a little below 2021's peaks hit on Tuesday. Cryptocurrencies scaled records, while inflation numbers loom as the next test of traders' thinking on the outlook for interest rates.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 93.942 by 11:59 PM ET (4:59 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair went down 0.35% to 112.82.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7410 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7160. The greenback dropped against the New Zealand dollar overnight as traders stay wary of the possibility that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) could raise rates by 50 basis points (bps) later in the month.
“If the RBNZ is of a mind to hike by 50bps, now’s the time,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
“That still seems incongruous with the uncertain global backdrop and cautious tone of other central banks. Still, until we know the outcome, markets will price in the risk.”
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.09% to 6.3960. Inflation data, including consumer and producer price data indexes from both China and the U.S., is due on Wednesday. The data could also test central bankers’ view that inflation is temporary.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3567.
Ahead of the data, a group of central bankers, including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, will speak on Tuesday.
The Bank of England gave markets a surprise last week when it kept its interest rates unchanged at 0.10%. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Fed also did not hike interest rates despite aggressive market predictions.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) analysts expect a hike in the third quarter of 2022, but a slow path higher thereafter. ""We suspect that the discussion of rate hikes will subside for a while. Central banks that give forward guidance discourage investors from pricing policy moves too far in advance,"" strategists Steve Englander and John Davies said in a note.
""So we expect Fed officials to keep repeating that rate hikes are not imminent until a move is only a few months away,” the note added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Monday after hitting 15-month highs on Friday following strong U.S. jobs data while investors digested the report, looked ahead to inflation data and monitored commentary from Federal Reserve officials for rate policy clues.
On Wednesday the Fed had stuck to its view that current high inflation is expected to be transitory and said it would start trimming its massive bond-buying program this month, but wait for more job growth before raising interest rates.
Then on Friday, U.S. data showed employment increased more than expected in October as the headwind from the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided, showing economic activity regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.
U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Monday turned their focus toward interest rate policy with Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida saying conditions for a rate hike could be met next year with job growth expected to continue and inflation already pushing beyond comfortable levels.
In separate remarks St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard repeated his view the Fed needs to raise rates twice next year. 
The next test of the Fed's wait-and-see approach to inflation will be U.S. CPI data due on Wednesday. 
""The focus this week is on inflation, which is why we'll probably be trading rangebound until we get those figures which could shed some light on interest rate hike timing,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.
At 1521 EST (2021 GMT), the dollar index was down 0.19% on the day at 94.046, taking a breather after Friday's rally.
""Markets are digesting the information that we received last week, both from the Fed statement and also from the nonfarm (payrolls) report on Friday, which still point to the fact that the Fed is removing liquidity and expected to hike rates later next year,"" said Bipan Rai, North America head of FX Strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculators scaled back their net long position on the dollar for the fourth week running in the week to Nov. 2.
The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy for risk appetite, was up 0.28% on the day.
The New Zealand dollar was 0.58% higher after Prime Minister Jacinda Arden announced that lockdown measures will likely be phased out by the end of the month.
The euro was a touch higher, up 0.17% at $1.1588.
Euro zone inflation will ease next year and remains too weak in the medium term, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane told a Spanish newspaper, repeating the bank's long-standing message that high price growth is temporary.

Britain's pound was up 0.54% at $1.3561, on the rebound from the five-week low it hit last week after the Bank of England meeting.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 4% at around $65,936.62 - not far from its recent record high - while ether was up 3% at $3,093.48 after hitting a record high of $4,768.07 earlier.

Investing.com – The pound started the week on the front foot Monday, and the currency could be preparing to put the squeeze on the bears in the coming weeks as the Bank of England’s surprise unchanged rate decision last week isn’t expected to be repeated at the December meeting.
GBP/USD rose 0.51%, to $1.356.
“In the last two months of the year, we see the prospect of imminent tightening (we think the 15bp rate increase should come in December) to help GBP recover its post-BoE losses,” ING said in a note.
The pound suffered a straight-second week of losses last week after the Bank of England confounded market expectations by keeping its benchmark rate on hold.
Ahead of meeting on Nov.4, economists and traders alike had expected the BoE to raise rates for the first time in three years.  
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that speculators added their net long GBP position to 15,047 contracts in the week to Nov. 2.
Following the surprise unchanged rate decision, traders rushed to unwind their long positions, but may likely pay the price if those bets swing bearish as the Bank of England is expected to hike rates at its December meeting.
“We expect, anyway, to see a short-squeeze in the pound in the next CFTC report as the 4 November Bank of England meeting saw policymakers surprise markets by holding the policy rate unchanged (a 15bp hike was priced in), which triggered a drop in GBP,” ING added.
BoE governor Andrew Bailey continued to tout a potential liftoff in rates on Monday, insisting the central bank would act to curb inflation pressures.
“What we’re concerned about ... is once you start to get an increase in inflation of this sort we want to stop it becoming generalised in the economy,” Bailey said."

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Hedge funds went into last week's Bank of England's policy meeting the most positive on sterling since July, but many will have been burned by the Bank's surprise decision not to raise interest rates. 
The Bank's 7-2 vote to keep its key lending rate on hold at 0.10%, convulsed UK markets, sent shockwaves through global markets, and has quickly gained notoriety as one of the most glaring examples of policy 'misguidance' in recent years. 
Perhaps even more jarring, Bank Governor Andrew Bailey and Chief Economist Huw Pill, who had both signaled in the run-up to Thursday's decision that a rate hike was a real possibility, were not among the two dissenters. Investors positioned accordingly. 
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show that hedge funds and speculators in the week to Nov. 2 upped their net long sterling position slightly to 15,047 contracts, worth around $1.3 billion. 
That was the largest net long since early July, and the biggest bullish bet on any G10 currency against the U.S. dollar, the data show. 
Many of those positions will have been wiped out by the pound's slump after the decision. The sterling/dollar exchange rate, known as 'cable', fell 1.4% on the day, its biggest fall since August last year, and trade-weighted sterling had its worst week in 11 months.
Cable fell as low as $1.3422 on Thursday, just above the year low of $1.3410 struck in late September. That looks like a key chart support now. 
The move in UK yields as investors revised their BoE outlook was also dramatic: the five-year gilt yield fell 20 basis points on Thursday, the biggest fall since the day after the Brexit referendum in June 2016; the 10-year inflation-linked bond yield fell to -3.16% on Friday, the lowest in almost a year; and the five-year linker yield slumped to a historic low of -3.73%. 
With relative interest rate support diminishing, strategists at Nordea opened a new short position in cable, and make no secret of why. ""The Bank of England are flip-flopping without credibility,"" they wrote on Sunday. 
Several analysts note that sterling's direction from here hinges on the direction of real yields. George Saravelos at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) puts it in simple terms: if UK real rates keep dropping, sterling will weaken further.
In aggregate, hedge funds have had a dismal year trading currencies, in large part because foreign exchange market volatility has been so low for so long. Even one-month implied sterling volatility is 7% now, only a three-week high.
Hedge fund industry data provider HFR said its benchmark currency index fell 4.37% in October, the worst month for years and plunging the index into the red for the year. It is the only one of HFR's almost 40 featured indexes across a range of asset classes and strategies to be down year-to-date. 

Of course, hedge funds thrive on going against the grain. Some will no doubt share the view of Unicredit (MI:CRDI)'s FX strategy chief Roberto Mialich that current long sterling positioning is much lower than it was early this year, suggesting there is ""still room for investors to increase long exposure to BoE tightening.""
But will the Bank of England raise rates next month? If history is any guide, the answer is surely no: there has only been one December rate hike in the last 45 years, in 1994.

Investing.com - The dollar drifted lower in early European trade Monday, retreating from Friday’s peaks ahead of the release this week of key U.S. inflation data, potentially another test of the Federal Reserve’s thinking over the timing of interest rate hikes.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 94.252, having climbed as high as 94.645 on Friday, it’s highest level for over a year.
Additionally, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1564, staying just above the 15-month low of 1.1513 made on Friday, while USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 113.56, clawing back some of the ground lost last week. GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3487, after falling as far as 1.3425 on Friday, a five-week low, in the wake of the Bank of England’s decision to hold rates unchanged.
The drift lower in the dollar in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s insistence that it would be ""patient"" in deciding when to raise rates even as it began tapering was abruptly reversed Friday following the strong payrolls release. 
The Fed had called for a further recovery in the labor market before it considered lifting its benchmark interest rates, and that’s what they received. October nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs, and data for September was revised higher to show 312,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 194,000.
There are no fewer than six Fed officials due to speak Monday, which may give an idea as to how solid the consensus on future rates is at the central bank. 
This comes ahead of Wednesday’s release of the latest U.S. inflation data, which are expected to show consumer growth running hot, further testing the resolve of these central bankers.
“Inflation will broaden further and median CPI looks set to reach the highest y/y rate in modern times,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. ""To us, Fed rate hikes are only seven or eight months away.""
Elsewhere, USD/CNY edged lower to 6.3976 after China's export growth slowed in October but beat forecasts, helping to cushion weak import data which pointed to overall weakness in domestic demand.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, making a steady start to the week but remaining below the peaks it hit on Friday. Investors continue to find a middle ground between markets' volatile interest rate projections and recent dovish monetary policy decisions from key central banks.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 94.310 by 12:24 AM ET (4:24 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.19% to 113.61.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7394 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7120.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.3979. Data released on Sunday showed that Chinese exports grew 27.1% year-on-year in October, while imports grew 20.6% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at $84.54 billion.
The Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee will start its first meeting in more than a year on Monday. The gathering will run to Nov. 11.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 1.3477, bouncing back from Friday’s five-week low of $1.3425 on Friday.
The pound took a beating when the Bank of England kept interest rates steady at 0.10% when it handed down its policy decision during the previous week. The surprise move triggered a sharp reversal late last week in quite aggressive bets on imminent rate hikes in the U.S. and globally. The U.S. Federal Reserve also kept its interest rate steady in its own decision, even as it began asset tapering.
""Central banks have distorted a whole lot of markets, pumping up the equity market and pumping up the bond market,"" Bank of New Zealand strategist Jason Wong told Reuters.
""Currencies are sort of in the middle of all that, wondering what the hell's going on,"" with the market seemingly in a holding pattern but with risks building up, especially in China where a slowing economy brings global implications, he added.
In the U.S., Friday’s job report showed that October’s non-farm payrolls increased by a better-than-expected 531,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4.6%.
Investors now await further data from the U.S. due on Wednesday, including the consumer and producer price indexes. China will also release its consumer and producer price indexes ahead of the U.S. figures."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar fell to their lowest level since late September, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $19.51 billion for the week ended Nov. 2, down from net longs of $20.07 billion in the previous week. U.S. dollar net long positioning has declined for four straight weeks.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, and Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning, which includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long position of $19.303 billion this week, slightly down from $19.75 billion in the prior week.
""Investors trimmed their bullish bets on the U.S. dollar ... ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy decision on Wednesday,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
But he noted that the dollar's net long positioning remained fairly substantial, which ""reflects solid bullish sentiment in the greenback as markets look to the beginning of the Fed’s hiking cycle.""
The dollar, however, fell on Wednesday as the Fed's policy statement was viewed as dovish by market participants.
The Fed did announce a reduction of asset purchases to be implemented later this month, but it stuck to its long-held view that the surge in inflation is transitory.
The dollar index ended the week little changed, as losses seen after the Fed statement were offset by gains following a strong U.S. job report for October.
On the year, the dollar has gained 4.7%.
The euro, meanwhile, saw a sharp reduction in net shorts to -6,138 contracts, equivalent to nearly $900 million. Also this week, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back against market bets that price pressures would trigger an interest rate hike as soon as next year.
Europe's single currency has so far been a laggard this year, down 5.3% in 2021.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin net shorts narrowed to -1,612 contracts this week, from a record -4,412 contracts the previous week.
Since hitting an all-time peak of $67,016.50 on Oct. 20, bitcoin has fallen 8.3%.
That said, continued optimism remains about bitcoin amid news on cryptocurrency adoption by banks, growth of nonfungible tokens on virtual gaming platforms, and launch of bitcoin futures-based U.S. exchange-traded funds.

New York (Reuters) -The dollar jumped on Friday to hit its highest level in more than a year, after data showed stronger U.S. job growth than expected in October, but retreated a bit in late trading as risk appetite improved and stocks rallied.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs last month, above the 450,000 forecast, as the latest surge in COVID-19 infections subsided. August and September data were revised upward to show an additional 235,000 jobs created over those months. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, rose as high as 94.634 after the jobs report, its firmest since Sept. 25, 2020. 
The safe-haven currency pulled back a bit as risk appetite improved and stocks staged a broad rally. The dollar was last down 0.096% at 94.234, but was still up around 0.1% for the week, which was marked by a bevy of central bank meetings that forced investors to reset rate hike expectations.
On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he was in no rush to hike borrowing costs, as there was ""still ground to cover to reach maximum employment."" The central bank did announce a $15 billion monthly tapering of its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases. 
""The payrolls print is certainly in line with Powell's statement at the Fed press conference, where he noted that job gains of this magnitude are consistent with the notion of making substantial further progress,"" TD Securities strategists said in a note.
The conditions are in place for a broad grind higher in the dollar, which also meshes with the seasonal trend for November, they said.
One soft spot in the U.S. employment report was a flat participation rate, which could end up spurring the Fed into action faster than expected, said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets
""The trend here could determine the course of Fed policy, as continued weakness in participation will only grease the jobless rate's decline ... which could very well lead to a faster pace of tapering and earlier rate hikes,"" he said.
The Bank of England's decision on Thursday not to lift rock-bottom benchmark rates proved the biggest shock for markets and pushed sterling to its biggest one-day fall in more than 18 months by as much as 1.6% on the day.
Sterling fell as much as 0.5% on Friday, hitting a fresh one-month low of $1.34250. It was last down 0.07%. 
Earlier in the week, the Reserve Bank of Australia also stuck to its dovish stance despite inflationary pressure and held rates. The Aussie reversed declines from the overnight session and was up 0.01% at $0.73995, but was still on track for around a 1.6% weekly fall.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back on Wednesday against market bets for a rate hike as soon as next October and said it was very unlikely such a move would occur in 2022.

The euro was up 0.08% at $1.15635.
Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 0.89% at $60,908.40, having largely traded sideways since it hit its all-time high above $67,000 last month.

Investing.com - The dollar was marginally lower in early European trade Friday, consolidating after the previous session’s strong gains and ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data which could sway the Federal Reserve’s thinking over interest rate hikes.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 94.302, after rallying 0.5% on Thursday. That lifted it into the positive for the week, adding 0.2%.
Additionally, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1562, after dropping 0.5% during the previous session, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 113.68. 
The Fed announced the tapering of its bond-buying program earlier this week, as widely expected, but added that it would be ""patient"" in deciding when to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate. 
While these comments were taken as being dovish by the market, the Federal Reserve is still seen as being nearer to raising its rates than many of its major peers. 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back on Wednesday against market bets for an early rate hike, saying it was very unlikely such a move would occur in 2022. Industrial production data from Germany, France and Spain all disappointed in September, according to figures out Friday. 
The Bank of England decided to stand pat on Thursday, surprising the market, citing concerns about future growth. This resulted in GBP/USD slumping 1.4% in the previous session, recovering just 0.1% to 1.3506 Friday, putting it on course for its worst week in 11.
“Policymakers have, sensibly we think, opted to wait for more information on how the recent end of the furlough scheme has played out,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
The Federal Reserve also cited the need to see a stronger labor market before it started moving on interest rates. With this in mind, the release of the official U.S. monthly jobs report later in the session will be watched carefully.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls are forecast by economists to show a 450,000 surge in jobs in October, following a 194,000 rise in the prior month.
“Special focus will be on hourly earnings, which look set to approach the 5.0% mark and may well be used (along with any above-consensus read in headline NFP) by Fed hawks to advocate further against the “temporary inflation” narrative,” ING added."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, but set to record a second consecutive week of gains. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report, which could change the timing of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 94.323 by 12:57 AM ET (4:57 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 113.66.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7396 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.7095.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4004, while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3495.
Rounding off a week of central bank policy decisions, the Bank of England (BOE) kept interest rates steady at 0.10% as it handed down its decision on Thursday. However, the surprise move caught the market off-guard and saw the pound headed for its worst week in 11.
Key central banks have declined to hike interest rates earlier than expected, forcing investors to reset monetary policy expectations during the week. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Wednesday dismissed market bets for an interest rate hike as soon as October 2022, adding that it was very unlikely such a move would occur within that year.
Across the Atlantic, the Fed said it would be “patient” on interest rate hikes, while beginning asset tapering, as it handed down its decision on the same day as Lagarde’s comments.
With job market recovery one of the Fed’s conditions for an interest rate hike, investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, that is due later in the day.
""The Fed delivered a 'dovish taper,' but the dollar is still better positioned than most,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
""Payrolls this week should be at least as strong as consensus given signs that recovery momentum is accelerating again,"" making dips into the mid-93s a buying opportunity for the dollar, the note added.
In Asia Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia set the tone for the week on Tuesday as it stuck to a dovish stance in its decision. Although the Bank of Japan is set to be the slowest among key central banks to normalize policy, the yen benefited as this expectation remained constant while investors cut bets elsewhere."
586,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and its Hong Kong-listed units were suspended from trading on Friday morning, a day after the Chinese developer flagged liquidity pressure and said it missed payments on wealth products it guaranteed.
The developer’s property management arm Kaisa Prosperity Holdings Ltd., health operation Kaisa Health Group Holdings Ltd. and construction equipment provider Kaisa Capital Investment Holdings Ltd. were also halted. No reason was given for the suspension. 
Kaisa’s shares and bonds tumbled Thursday after the company said it has faced “unprecedented pressure on its liquidity” due to unfavorable factors such as credit rating downgrades and a challenging property market environment. The missed payments on wealth management products come about two months after China Evergrande Group faced protests from investors demanding money on similar overdue offerings. 
Chinese developers are facing an intensifying cash crunch following a government campaign to reduce leverage in the industry. That’s been made worse by a slump in home sales and prices as sentiment among homebuyers evaporates. A bond sell-off is making it prohibitively expensive for the nation’s builders to refinance maturing debt. 
“Kaisa’s non-payment of a guaranteed wealth management product may exacerbate the sector’s crisis,” Andrew Chan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a note. It “suggests investors need to be aware not only of upcoming public debt payments but of obligations such as WMPs which may not be widely known.”
Kaisa is “making all efforts” to resolve its liquidity problem such as by speeding up asset sales, it said in the statement Thursday. The company is seeking buyers for assets including Kaisa Prosperity, but no clear candidates had emerged, Reuters reported last week.

Kaisa became a focus of investor concern after it canceled meetings with investors in October, triggering doubts about its liquidity and sending its dollar bonds lower. Downgrades by both S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings a few days later caused a fresh sell-off in the developer’s shares, which have tumbled more than 70% this year. 
Kaisa’s dollar bonds stabilized on Friday morning after the previous day’s plunge. Its 6.5% note due Dec. 7 rose 0.4 cent to 45.7 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Its shares dropped 15% on Thursday to the lowest price since its 2009 listing.
Kaisa Group holds 67% of Kaisa Prosperity and 43% of Kaisa Health. The developer’s founding Chairman Kwok Ying Shing and his family hold about 25% of Kaisa and 57% of equipment firm Kaisa Capital. 
The first Chinese builder to default on dollar bonds, Kaisa completed a debt restructuring in 2016. Since then, it has grown to become China’s third-largest dollar debt borrower among developers with more than $11 billion of bonds outstanding in the currency. It ranked as China’s 27th-biggest property developer by sales last month. 
In addition to Kaisa’s $400 million note due next month, it has $2.8 billion of dollar bonds maturing in 2022, according to Bloomberg data. It’s scheduled to pay an interim dividend of 4 Hong Kong cents per share on Dec. 17, which would cost the company about HK$281 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday as investors reset monetary policy expectations after the Federal Reserve repeated it saw high inflation as transitory, and the Bank of England caught the market off-guard by keeping rates steady, sending sterling skidding.
The BoE said most of it policy members still thought ""there was value in waiting"" for more data on the labor market.
The Fed announced on Wednesday a $15 billion monthly cut to its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, but Chair Jerome Powell said he was in no rush to hike borrowing costs. 
Also on Wednesday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back on market bets for a rate hike as soon as next October and said it was very unlikely such a move would occur in 2022.
""The market has really had to reset itself as far as exactly how quickly some of these major central banks are going to be tightening policies,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda.
While the Fed may still lag some of its peers in eventually raising rates, its accommodative policy will spur economic growth and continue the American exceptionalism theme coming out of the pandemic, supporting the greenback, he said.
The dollar index swung back from a low of 93.80 shortly after the Fed announcement on Wednesday to 94.327 as of 3:30 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday. 
""I think most people would have been looking for a dip to buy the dollar,"" said Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
The lack of a BoE rate cut sent sterling, which had initially led the gains on the dollar after the Fed, tumbling. It was last down 1.33% at $1.3502, its lowest level versus the greenback since Oct. 1, even as the British central bank kept alive the prospect of tighter monetary policy soon.
""The BoE rate decision was a lot more impactful in FX than the FOMC decision,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management.
""The Fed gave the market plenty of time to discount taper. They were very effective in their forward guidance. The Bank of England, on the other hand, had been hawkish and the fact that they did not deliver on the hawkishness today went against market expectations,"" she said. 
The euro, with the ECB seen far behind other major central banks in tightening, sank as low as $1.1528, its softest since Oct. 12, when the common currency hit its weakest level since late July 2020, at $1.1522. It was last down 0.57% against the dollar at $1.1546. 
The Aussie dollar lost 0.62% to $0.7402, slipping further from Tuesday when the Reserve Bank of Australia adopted a dovish tone at its key meeting. 

In the world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 2.69% at $61,236.61, having largely traded sideways since it hit its all-time high above $67,000 last month. 
Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, was down 2.75% at $4,480.34, after hitting a record high of $4,670.81 on Wednesday.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Thursday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses after the Federal Reserve said it was in no rush to raise interest rates after it began tapering its bond-buying program.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 94.088, climbing after Wednesday’s near 0.3% fall.
Additionally, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1577, giving up Wednesday’s gains, while USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 114.25, not far from the multi-year high of 114.69 hit last month.
The Fed announced late Wednesday that it would reduce its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program by $15 billion initially, as widely expected, but Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank would be ""patient"" in deciding when to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero levels. 
The dollar weakened Wednesday with traders judging Powell’s comments as being dovish, given that inflation currently stands at 30-year highs. However, it has since rebounded.
“The fact that the dollar continues to trade near its recent highs against EUR and JPY should be a reminder that: (a) EUR and JPY look better funding currencies than the dollar and (b) that the Fed has fired the starting gun on policy normalization, eventually tighter dollar liquidity, higher US rates and what should be a stronger dollar,” said analyst at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3657, down from its week high of 1.3698 hit earlier Thursday, as traders positioned for a Bank of England policy-setting meeting later in the session.
Markets are pricing in a rate rise from the U.K. central bank on the back of surging inflation, which would be the first rate hike from the world’s major central banks since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. That said, the decision is likely to be a close call as economic growth is starting to slow.
“GBP has corrected a little this week already and we suspect that it may have a little further to go should it appear that Governor Bailey does not carry at least 8 of the nine member MPC with him in voting for a 15bp rate hike,” added ING.
USD/PLN traded 0.5% higher at 3.9608 and EUR/PLN also gained 0.1% at 4.5835 the day after Poland’s central bank raised its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point, more than expected, to try and combat surging inflation.
USD/CZK rose 0.3% to 22.0000 while EUR/CZK dropped 0.1% to 25.4570 ahead of a meeting of the Czech National Bank, which is expected to result in another rate hike.
The central bank delivered a 75-basis-point hike in September, its biggest since 1997, to combat rapid price growth, and is expected to deliver something similar later Thursday.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, losing ground against the euro and sterling, as the latest U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision began asset tapering but kept interest rates steady.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.15% to X by 93.998 PM ET (X AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.20% to 114.20.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7454 while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7154.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.19% to 6.3941 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 1.3659.
The Fed handed down its decision on Wednesday, where it announced it would begin asset tapering in November. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added that the central bank would be ""patient"" on the timetable for interest rate hikes.
The pound extended Wednesday's 0.51% gain after the Fed decision, recovering from Tuesday's two-week low of $1.3603. The euro rose to $1.161, also rallying on Wednesday after the decision to gain 0.29% that day.
The focus is now on how long the Fed defer interest rate rises, with concerns that high inflation could last longer than the Fed had initially projected.
""Powell stressed that this Fed meeting was much more about quantitative easing than interest rates but this will be the last meeting in which that reasoning will hold. From here on, future Fed meetings are going to return the focus back to the Fed’s interest rate strategy and tactics,"" Janus Henderson Investors head of multi-asset Paul O’Connor told Reuters.
The Bank of England (BOE) will hand down its policy decision later on in the day, the last in a slew of central bank policy decisions.
BOE could be the first key central bank to raise interest rates since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is less consensus among investors about the BOE decision.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would begin unwinding its pandemic-era stimulus, but held to its belief that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" and likely not require a rapid rise in interest rates.
The Fed announced a $15 billion monthly cut to its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, but did little to signal when it may begin the next phase of policy ""normalization"" by raising interest rates.
The dollar index softened after the Fed statement, hitting a session low before reversing some of the losses and was last down 0.045% at 94.068, still within reach of its 2021 peak of 94.563 hit last month.
The initial sell-off in the dollar after the Fed announcement was likely profit-taking, said Scott Petruska, chief currency strategist at Silicon Valley Bank.
""The market was extremely long dollars going into this and they still are,"" he said. 
Over the rest of the quarter, the dollar will be supported by relatively higher U.S. yields, the Fed showing an eagerness to stop inflation and admitting to some extent that inflation may not be as transitory as they initially thought, and as a safe haven, he said.
The Fed announcement follows meetings of the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday and the European Central Bank last Wednesday, both of which pushed back against market pricing of tighter policy. The Bank of England meets on Thursday.
ECB President Christine Lagarde said an interest rate rise in 2022 was very unlikely because inflation was too low, sending government bond yields lower. But the euro barely budged.
Against the euro the greenback was nearly flat at $1.15825. That was not far from the $1.1522 low for the euro reached in October, which was the strongest level for the dollar since July 2020.
Dollar/yen traded at 114.125, near a four-year high.
The RBA on Tuesday abandoned its short-term yield target and dropped its expectation of holding rates at record lows until 2024, though the Aussie fell because the bank also pushed back on aggressive pricing for 2022 hikes.
The Aussie dropped 1.2% against the dollar on Tuesday and sat at $0.7425 on Wednesday, down 0.05% from the session open. The New Zealand dollar was also dragged 1% lower on Tuesday, but found support on Wednesday from strong labor data and was up 0.27% at $0.71285. [AUD/] 
Money markets have dialled back expectations for a 15 basis point hike from the Bank of England on Thursday but still expect one before 2022.
""The key question is how effective an interest rate hike will be in controlling inflation, mainly driven by supply chain issues, as we emerge from the pandemic,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM.

The BoE is also focused on labor data and may decide to hold off on rate increases on Thursday, as ""they will not want to hike rates too soon and risk crippling businesses’ recoveries,"" he said. 
Sterling recovered from a two-week low to trade 0.3% higher at $1.36525.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar, this year's top-performing G10 currency, is expected to strengthen further over the coming 12 months, supported by higher oil prices and the Bank of Canada's recent shift to a more hawkish stance.
The median forecast of 36 strategists in a Reuters poll taken between Oct. 29 and Nov. 2 was for the Canadian dollar to be at 1.24 per U.S. dollar, or 80.65 U.S. cents in three months, about its current level, compared with 1.25 in last month's poll.
It was then expected to strengthen 1.6% to 1.22 in a year's time. In October, the forecast was for 1.23.
The loonie has gained 2.6% so far in 2021. In June, it touched a six-year high near 1.20.
That's a level that could be revisited should the Bank of Canada begin ""a relatively aggressive tightening cycle,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. 
The Bank of Canada last week became the first central bank from a G7 country to exit quantitative easing and signaled it could begin raising interest rates in April, three months earlier than previously thought.
Money markets expect lift-off as soon as March and about 125 basis points of tightening in total next year, while the gap between Canadian and U.S. 2-year yields has climbed to as high as 60 basis points in favor of the Canadian bond in recent days, the biggest gap in seven years.
Canadian employment data for October are due on Friday, which could offer further clues on the outlook for rates.
""Higher oil prices and favorable interest rate spreads have helped the loonie recently,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins. ""According to historical relations, it still has some room left for further appreciation.""
In 2014, when oil, one of Canada's major exports, was last trading above $80 a barrel, the Canadian dollar was at about 1.13.

The Federal Reserve could give the U.S. dollar a boost by starting to taper its bond-buying program and moving closer to rate hikes, but analysts expect the loonie to cope.
""Decent growth in Canada, higher interest rates than much of the rest of the G10, and firm commodity prices,"" are supportive of the currency, Scotiabank's Osborne said.

The Lebanese pound lost around 90% of its value in the past two years, propelling three quarters of the population into poverty.
For Haddad, the difference between this and other crises that Lebanon has experienced, including the 1975-1990 civil war, is that it feels like there is no end in sight. 
""Previously, you had hope that: 'tomorrow the war will end, we do this and that and go back to where we were', but this time there is no hope,"" he said.
""They (those in power) promised us we would have plenty of money in our hands, and we indeed have a lot of it to play with,"" he said sarcastically referring to the growing stacks of banknotes needed for even basic purchases after the currency drop.
Haddad, whose small restaurant has been in business since 1984, said he can only buy 10% of the olive oil he used to buy with the same money.
The government, facing an election in March as it tries to secure an IMF recovery plan, has tripled transport allowance for employees to alleviate some of the pain but most salaries, including the minimum wage, have not been adjusted. 
Pub-owner Moussa Yaakoub is also taken aback by the amount of cash he needs to run his business. 
""I have never before held in my hands this amount of money,"" he said as he counted some 10 million pounds, worth $6,600 at the pre-crisis rate but now less than $500 at the market rate. 
That much money used to cover a pub's operation for months, but now only pays a couple of bills, he said. 
Grocery store owner Roni Bou Rached has changed the way he stores money in his cash drawer now that smaller notes are used less, and coins are almost non-existent. 
""I am hesitant how much to carry in my pocket when I leave. I sometimes carry 1 million or 1.5 million ... but I mean, they are worthless,"" he said. 

A single restaurant bill now could amount to sums higher than some workers' earnings. 
""God help those who do not have an income or are not able to work around things,"" Ali Jaber, a private sector employee, said.

PRAGUE/BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Polish zloty and Hungarian forint will notch up strong gains against the euro over the next year as most central European currencies return to a path of appreciation, helped by expected rate hikes, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
As inflation hits new highs in central Europe, more policy tightening is expected to lift regional currencies that had shed around 1% in the last month due to a stronger dollar.
""Generally over the next 12 months the zloty should be supported by a tightening of domestic monetary policy,"" said Krystian Jaworski, senior economist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) in Warsaw.
""Also the growth prospects should be quite good after this wave of the pandemic finishes.""
The zloty was expected to firm 3.5% from Monday's closing levels over the next year, to 4.46 versus the euro.
Inflation data on Friday further fuelled Polish rate hike expectations as the CPI soared to an annual rate of 6.8%, and officials and analysts have said it could hit 8%.
The zloty has lagged its regional peers in 2021, with the Polish central bank the last in the region to begin lifting rates, taking a cautious approach until a surprise October hike. It is expected to tighten further at a meeting on Wednesday.
The Hungarian forint is seen firming 3% to 350 per euro in the next year, also supported by rate hikes that the National Bank of Hungary started in June.
""Even though the bank slowed the pace of its rate hikes to 15 basis points, the tightening cycle must have an effect on the forint sooner or later. The small steps add up,"" Gergely Suppan, an analyst at Takarekbank, said.

Meanwhile, the Czech crown, the region's best performer this year, is seen firming 2.3% over the next 12 months as markets price in 125 basis points in hikes for the rest of the year.
In Romania, where political uncertainty continues to cloud attempts to rein in twin deficits, the leu is projected to ease 1.0% in the next year to 4.997 versus the euro.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely unchanged Wednesday at elevated levels, braced for the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and forward guidance later. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 94.055, but not far removed from a near 3-week high of 94.313.
Additionally, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1587, marginally above the year’s low of 1.1522, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 113.89, below the 2021 peak of 114.69.
The Fed is widely expected to announce a tapering of its current $120 billion monthly bond-buying program, judging the U.S. economy as being sufficiently recovered from the pandemic hit to cope with a reduction in support.
“The Fed is ready to pull the tapering trigger this Wednesday and we see risks clearly tilted towards a swifter process than anticipated by the consensus,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Potentially of more interest is what the Fed policy makers say about rising prices, with inflation at 30-year highs, and the impact this has on their thinking as to when interest rates should start rising. Officials have said rate hikes won’t be on the table until the bond-buying program ends. 
“Our new base case is a hike in June, September and December next year after a tapering process ending in April/May,” Nordea added. Most analysts expect the purchases to be phased out by the end of June. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3626, just above a two-week low, ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday. The central bank could hike its interest rates for the first time in years, with the markets pricing in a modest increase, but the generally weak currency suggests a disappointment is possible. Data released earlier showed house prices continuing to rise above expectations, despite the end of a tax holiday on stamp duty.
USD/PLN traded flat at 3.9763 and EUR/PLN also flat at 4.6044, with Poland’s central bank expected to raise interest rates for a second month as inflation runs at its fastest pace in two decades.
Of 30 economists polled in a Bloomberg survey, 16 expect the benchmark to climb a quarter point to 0.75%, while 13 anticipate a half-point. Only one respondent predicted borrowing costs will remain on hold.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, but was close to the year's peaks on the euro and yen. Investors are now focused on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering faster than its European and Japanese counterparts.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 94.070 by 12:30 AM ET (4:30 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.12% to 113.81.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7432 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7119.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.3989. Data released earlier in the day showed that China’s Caixin services purchasing managers index, released earlier in the day, was 53.8 for October, slightly higher than the 53.4 recorded during the previous month. The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3630.
The Fed will hand down its policy decision later in the day and is widely expected to begin asset tapering. However, a bigger focus is when the central bank will hike interest rates.
""Fed policy is under challenge in ways that cannot be remembered since the early Volcker years. Inflation is taking off with an economy that has been pricing itself off zero nominal rates and dramatic negative real rates for the last 18 months,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Alan Ruskin told Reuters.
Although expectations of even faster hiking elsewhere in the world are rising, risks could lie ahead if investors start to think that more than a few interest rate hikes will be needed to tame fast-rising prices.
""If the expected resilience of the real economy to rate hikes is correct, and inflation is similarly stubborn, the market expectations on the terminal funds rate at near 1.75% by the end of 2026 looks way too low,"" said Ruskin.
The Bank of England (BOE) will hand down its decision on Thursday, with swaps pricing indicating a modest interest rate hike.
""I lean towards a 15bps hike at this meeting with a 5-4 vote in favor,"" Pepperstone strategist Luke Suddards told Reuters.
However, a falling currency could lead to disappointment or a fairly stern pushback against market inflation expectations at least. ""Because this is basically baked into the price, I would say the risk is for the pound to weaken if BOE decides rather to hold and we see some dovish repricing in money markets,” said Suddards."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies are headed for more trouble next year as mounting expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to quell inflation are set to keep the mighty U.S. dollar in the driving seat, a Reuters poll showed.
Most emerging market currencies were forecast to weaken or at best cling to a range over the year as currency strategists in the Oct. 29-Nov. 2 Reuters poll feared high commodity prices would further pressurise economies already struggling with elevated inflation.
Higher U.S. Treasury yields are becoming a stronger headwind for EM currencies, as investors bet elevated U.S. inflation could lead the Fed to tighten policy sooner than signalled.
""For EM currencies, the worst is not yet behind us, as growth and inflation challenges persist into 2022, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are anticipated to march relentlessly higher through next year,"" noted Phoenix Kalen, head of emerging markets research at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
But a lot will depend on how the U.S. dollar performs. The greenback was expected to dominate currency markets for another year as inflation concerns come to the fore, with surging energy prices amid a supply crunch threatening global economic growth. [EUR/POLL]
""A pro-USD environment in G10 FX may continue to pose a threat to EMFX,"" Luis Costa, emerging markets strategist at Citi, wrote in a research note.
""Our negative EMFX view was based on higher U.S. rates and continued growth fears in China. While there is risk to higher real rates in the U.S., it is hard to not expect much weaker growth in China.""
SUPPLY BOTTLENECKS
The most actively traded emerging market currency, the Chinese yuan, was predicted to depreciate over 1% to 6.47 per dollar in a year as the economy is slowing after a strong rebound from the pandemic-driven slump early last year.
Asia's economic prospects have already been marred by China's slowdown, supply chain bottlenecks and the lingering effects of COVID-19 waves in trade-reliant countries.
The Thai baht, which has plunged about 10% so far this year, was expected to fall 1.5% more to 33.77/$ in the next six months. The Indian rupee, down over 2.0%, was forecast to depreciate more modestly, another 1.0% to 75.28/$ in a year.
Turkey's battered lira, which has already lost a fifth of its value this year, was expected to shed another 6% to 10.09/$ in a year.
The lira has been the worst-performing currency among EM peers this year, thanks to an unconventional monetary policy espoused by President Tayyip Erdogan - cutting interest rates to fight inflation. He has replaced the central bank head three times in the last 2-1/2 years.
""Erdogan's decisions recently to replace more CBRT officials have further undermined confidence in monetary independence which is set to prioritise stronger growth over dampening inflation,"" said Ehsan Khoman, head of emerging markets research at MUFG.
""In these circumstances, we expect the lira to weaken further with a heightened risk that weakness will overshoot.""
While several remain under intense pressure, a few emerging market currencies are likely to mark a stronger 2022 -- especially the South African rand, South Korean won and the Russian rouble. 
This comes despite the U.S. Fed looking set to imminently begin tapering its $120 billion a month bond purchase programme, which has already sent U.S. bond yields and the dollar higher in anticipation of a subsequent rate hike next year.

The South African rand and Korean won were expected to firm over 2% in a year to 15.10/$ and 1141.84/$, respectively, while the Russian rouble will gain nearly 1% to 71.16/$.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's performance against major currencies will be mixed as investors are expected to favour those carrying higher interest rates in both the short and medium-term, a Reuters poll of FX strategists found.
Calls for tighter monetary policy to tame inflation running at multiyear highs in the United States and elsewhere have prompted money markets to bring forward rate hike expectations, and are now at odds with central banks' own projections. 
Those expectations have pushed yields on U.S. Treasuries and other sovereign debt higher, especially at the shorter end of the curve, to the highest in more than a year. That is set to continue. 
But while rising Treasury yields have helped the dollar to maintain its gains so far this year, rate hike speculation elsewhere looks set to restrain the greenback from strengthening any further.
""The market is taking a pretty strong stance in a lot of places on what central banks plan to do. They're almost sort of not listening to central banks ... it's like the market thinks it knows what central banks are going to do,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.
""In the very near term I expect the dollar to finish the quarter approximately flat, in broad terms, but to weaken next year.""
The Oct. 29-Nov. 2 poll of nearly 70 foreign exchange analysts showed nearly all major currencies trading higher than current levels in the next 12 months - a view these analysts have held for years, even as the dollar drifted higher.
Among them, currencies offering higher interest rates were expected to outperform the rest.
The British pound, the New Zealand dollar and the Canadian dollar were expected to gain 2.9%, 1.6% and 2% respectively. All of their respective central banks are poised to take rates higher next year. [ECILT/GB/][NZ/INT][ECILT/CA]
However, that was not enough to make any significant dent in the dollar's strength. Its nearest rivals, the euro and the Japanese yen, were not forecast to claw back their year to date loss of 5% and 9% over the next 12 months.
The greenback was likely to hold on to a sizeable chunk of 2021's near 4.5% gain for another year, according to the poll. 
But some analysts say the dollar can strengthen even further.
""We are looking for broad dollar strength, we think the dollar will gain further. With the Fed heading towards tapering this should bring support to the dollar,"" said Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""Those currencies where there's no prospect for rate hikes are the most vulnerable. Currencies where central banks are hiking? Those currencies will hold up better. But we still think the dollar will gain broadly.""
But with most major central banks and many analysts still viewing the current jump in price rises as temporary and unemployment rates still below pre-pandemic levels, some moderation in interest rate pricing was likely.

""The reality is if interest rates went up as quickly as the market is anticipating ... we could be heading for recession in many countries,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar firmed slightly on Tuesday as the U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day policy meeting where it was expected to announce it will begin tapering its massive asset purchases put in place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Investors in recent weeks have priced in a wave of tightening from central banks as they bet policymakers are sufficiently concerned about rising inflation to end pandemic-era levels of easing.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday sounded a more dovish tone than investors had anticipated, in the first of several central bank meetings this week, sending the Aussie to it's biggest one-day loss since Sept. 29.
The Fed will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, and the Bank of England will do so on Thursday.
""The theme of inflation getting out of control and forcing central banks into action is unfolding,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, was up 0.19% at 94.106.
The market has fully priced in the Fed's expected tapering announcement, and will be looking for any clues as to when the central bank will begin raising rates.
""It's going to be interesting because we'll have to see if we get any pushback from the Fed, given how the market pricing has become a bit aggressive in anticipating multiple rate increases next year,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
""The rate debate is not all about inflation, it's also about the job market and I think the Fed wants to see the job market really turn the corner before acknowledging that policymakers are considering higher rates,"" he said. 
Australia's central bank did not display the hawkish pivot markets were expecting, sending the Aussie dollar down 1.23% to $0.74265, its weakest since Oct. 19.
The RBA stressed that inflation was still too low, although it also omitted its previous projection that rates were unlikely to rise until 2024 and dropped a key target for the April 2024 government bond.
""Unlike other central banks (like the ECB recently), the RBA's message was successful in at least marginally scaling down hawkish bets, although markets are still pricing in 76bp (basis points) of tightening in the next 12 months,"" ING analysts said in a note.
Sterling was on the back foot, slipping 0.32% to $1.36175, ahead of Thursday's Bank of England meeting, where the market is pricing in an interest rate hike. 
The euro edged 0.25% lower to $1.15775.
Elsewhere, the Swiss franc briefly hit an 18-month high versus the euro. The single currency dropped to as weak as 1.0544 francs - the lowest since May 2020 - before bouncing back to trade at 1.05875, up 0.33% on the day.
The franc has been strengthening versus the dollar, and was up 0.6% at $0.91455. 

Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Holding, noted that sight deposits data suggested the Swiss National Bank - which worries about a stronger franc hurting the Swiss economy - was not intervening as actively to arrest the franc strength as it had during previous moves higher.
""This could be the way the SNB goes along with the global trend toward tighter monetary policy, only doing it through the exchange rate rather than through its policy rate,"" he said.

600,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"Kabul (Reuters) - The Taliban announced a complete ban on the use of foreign currency in Afghanistan on Tuesday, a move sure to cause further disruption to an economy pushed to the brink of collapse by the abrupt withdrawal of international support.
The surprise move came hours after at least 25 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when gunmen attacked Afghanistan's biggest military hospital after two heavy explosions at the site in central Kabul.
""The economic situation and national interests in the country require that all Afghans use Afghan currency in their every trade,"" the Taliban said in a statement shared with journalists by one of their spokesmen. 
The use of U.S. dollars is widespread in Afghanistan's markets, while border areas use the currency of neighbouring countries such as Pakistan for trade.
The Taliban government is pressing for the release of billions of dollars of central bank reserves as the drought-stricken nation faces a cash crunch, mass starvation and a new migration crisis.
Afghanistan parked billions of dollars in assets overseas with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks in Europe, but that money has been frozen since the Islamist Taliban ousted the Western-backed government in August. 
The departure of U.S.-led forces and many international donors left the country without grants that financed three quarters of public spending.

The finance ministry said it had a daily tax take of roughly 400 million Afghanis ($4.4 million).
Although Western powers want to avert a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan, they have refused to officially recognise the Taliban government.

Investing.com — The Australian dollar took a plunge on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia took on a more dovish tone than expected.
The currency started its decline after the RBA's meeting, where it did not pivot to the hawkish stance that many analysts and traders had predicted. 
The central bank said inflation was still too low. However, it also dropped a key bond yield target following a bond market sell-off last week, with the outlook for the Australian economy looking more positive in recent weeks.
The RBA also removed previous suggestions that rates were unlikely to rise until 2024, suggesting a slightly more hawkish tone. However, it wasn't as hawkish as market participants had hoped, which caused the AUD/USD to continue to sell-off into the European and U.S. sessions.
As of midday in the U.S., the pair is down 1.25%, trading around the 0.7424 mark, after a roughly 100 pip fall."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar eased versus its main rivals on Monday, after posting its biggest daily rise in more than four months in the previous session, as traders position themselves ahead of this week's highly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting.
Monetary policy in the United States, Australia and Britain is in focus, with the Fed widely expected to announce a tapering of stimulus, a factor that has fueled the greenback's rise in recent weeks.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was down 0.321% at 93.894. 
""It ran up so much the last couple of days, I think it's just a little bit of pre-positioning ahead of FOMC just in case they remain relatively dovish,"" Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX at BK Asset Management, said of the dollar's pullback. 
On Friday, the greenback hit its highest level since Oct. 13, rising 0.8% in its biggest single-day move since mid-June, on the back of a 4.4% jump in the government's index of core personal consumption expenditures - the Fed's preferred inflation measure.
""I still think there's quite a strong chance that they'll try to downplay inflation and still stick to the transitory message as much as possible because I don't think they really want to create truly tightening conditions just yet,"" Schlossberg said of the Fed's policy announcement, due on Wednesday. 
Quickening inflation data has prompted some investment banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to advance their expectations of a rate hike by the Fed as early as July 2022, compared with the third quarter of 2023 previously.
""You had a move on Friday based on the PCE and you've got a little bit of a pullback right here,"" Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com said. ""Nobody is quite sure of what the Fed is going to do."" 
Money markets assign a 50% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed by next June, compared with 15% a month earlier, CME futures data shows.
The euro ticked 0.037% higher to $1.16045, after having given up most of its European Central Bank policy gains on Friday when it touched $1.1535, its weakest since Oct. 13. 
Hedge fund manager Stephen Jen of Eurizon SLJ Capital in a note to clients said FX markets seem too hawkish on the ECB and too dovish on the Fed.
""With a large overhang of long euro positions among the real money community, I believe the euro will remain vulnerable in the months and quarters ahead against the dollar,"" he said. 
The Aussie dollar slid 0.01% to $0.7518, having fallen off its nearly four-month high of $0.75555 reached last week, ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision on Tuesday.

The British pound fell to its lowest in more than two weeks versus the dollar, pressured by uncertainty over the Bank of England's policy stance and an escalating post-Brexit spat with France over fishing rights.
Most expect the Bank of England will raise rates by 15 basis points to 0.25% on Thursday, although a split vote is likely and some think the bank may hold fire, contenting itself with a hawkish signal.

Investing.com - The dollar stabilized in early European trading Tuesday ahead of the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, while the Australian dollar weakened sharply after the country’s central bank tightened monetary policy less than many had expected.
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 93.843, after retreating Monday from a 2 1/2-week high of 94.313.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD fell 0.7% to 0.7470 after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised the market by not raising its key rate from 0.1%, stressing that inflation was still too low to hike in the near term.
However, the RBA did drop its policy of yield curve control, saying it would no longer try to cap three-year government bond yields. It also removed its previous projection that rates were unlikely to rise until 2024, but traders had been expecting a more aggressive stance given the strong domestic inflationary pressures.
Now attention turns to the latest Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, with the two-day gathering set to start later Tuesday.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to announce a tapering of stimulus, especially after a record quarterly increase in Friday’s employment cost index illustrated the degree of current inflationary pressure. 
“This measure had been a preferred one for the Greenspan Fed in the 1990s and a surging figure will no doubt be unnerving some core members of the FOMC,"" said analysts at ING, in a note. ""We think this will add to the case for a confident tapering announcement from the Fed on Wednesday.” 
A survey by Bloomberg points to the Fed checking the current $120 billion monthly buying pace by reducing Treasury purchases by $10 billion a month and mortgage-backed security purchases by $5 billion a month.
The economists surveyed are more divided over when the central bank will start hiking interest rates, with a small majority suggesting early 2023 rather than in 2022.
Additionally, USD/JPY traded 0.3% lower at 113.65, continuing to consolidate below an almost four-year peak of 114.69 reached on Oct. 20, while EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1610.
GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3667 ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday, with the central bank potentially set to lift its interest rates for the first time in years. 
Inflation in Britain looks set to rise to 5%, more than double the BoE's 2% target, but the country’s economic recovery from last year's slump looks like it’s slowing as the government withdraws key support programs for households and businesses.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, remaining below recent highs as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) led key central banks in handing down their policy decisions.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 93.918 by 11:50 PM ET (3:50 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.05% to 113.92.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.31% to 0.7501 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7174.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4005 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 1.3651.
The RBA kept its November interest rate unchanged at 0.10% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The decision comes as the central bank failed to defend its yield target as bonds sold off over recent sessions, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is likely to track its Antipodean counterpart’s moves in its next policy decision.
Other central banks could take their cues from the RBA decision, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England handing down their policy decisions on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. All three face the common dilemma of surging inflation.
""The elephant in the room is headline and underlying inflation, which are higher than the (Fed) was anticipating. We expect the Fed to state that it is ready to act decisively if inflation is not moving towards target levels when asset tapering ends, but it still expects inflation to fall as supply constraints ease,"" Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) head of G10 FX Steve Englander told Reuters.
""We think investors will see this as advancing the likely timing of Fed rate hikes. We also expect FX markets to react to the implied Fed threat of rates moving off zero but discount inflation optimism. This adds up to a dollar-positive combination of higher real rates and increased risk-off positions.""
Meanwhile, trader positioning is indicative of bets on higher rates, as speculators crowd in to short the yen.
""That's a bet that interest rate trends will continue to move against the yen as they rise elsewhere, particularly in the U.S.,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Juckes told Reuters.
""In other words, there's a majority that thinks the bond sell-off isn't over yet. It's also, to a smaller extent, a bet that risk sentiment will survive the experience."""

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Monday, continuing the previous session’s gains after strong inflation numbers cemented the case for tapering at this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 94.243, just below Friday's peak of 94.302, a level not seen since Oct. 13.
This follows the release of data Friday which showed the Fed’s favorite inflation measure, core personal consumption expenditures index, rising at an annual 4.4% in September, the fastest since 1991.
The central bank holds a two-day policy-setting meeting this week, concluding on Wednesday, and is widely expected then to announce a tapering of stimulus. However, these continued inflationary pressures have solidified market expectations that the Fed will start increasing interest rates earlier than previously guided.
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has responded by bringing forward its forecast by a year to July 2022 for the first U.S. interest rate hike following the pandemic.
""The main reason for the change in our liftoff call is that we now expect core PCE inflation to remain above 3% — and core CPI inflation above 4% — when the taper concludes,"" Goldman's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, wrote in a client note over the weekend. 
USD/JPY traded 0.3% higher at 114.33, just below the strongest level since Oct. 20, after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling Liberal Democratic Party defied expectations and held onto its strong majority in Sunday's parliamentary election. This could mean that he now has leeway to push through more stimulus to boost the beleaguered economy, at the expense of the yen.
GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3659 ahead of Thursday’s Bank of England meeting, which could see the central bank lift interest rates if it judges the country’s economy to be strong enough to cope as inflation mounts.
AUD/USD was 0.3% lower at 0.7502, retreating from a near four-month high of 0.7555 reached last week ahead of Tuesday’s meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
The country’s central bank is under pressure to drop a commitment to keep yields on its April 2024 target bond at 0.1% as house prices soar. Late last week it chose not to defend the 0.1% target for three-year bond yields, which consequently rose to over 0.8%. 
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1553, only marginally above Friday's low of 1.1535, the weakest since Oct. 13, which followed Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, remaining near a two-and-a-half-week high. Increasing inflation in the U.S. that strengthened the case for earlier U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes gave the U.S. currency a boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 94.195 by 12:34 AM ET (4:34 AM GMT). The index remained near Friday's peak of 94.302, a level not hit since Oct. 13.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.24% to 114.28.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.27% to 0.7501 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7168.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.4046, with China's Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for October at 50.6. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, released the day before, were at 49.2 and 52.4 respectively.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3676.
The dollar also approached a one-and-a-half-week high to the yen after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling Liberal Democratic Party held its strong majority in Sunday's parliamentary election in a surprise move. This reduces the political uncertainty in the country and allows Kishida to press forward with ramping up stimulus.
""The reduction in political uncertainty is playing out with slight yen weakness this morning. The bigger driver of dollar-yen direction going ahead remains the Fed,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
Data released on Friday showed that the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index was at 4.4 year-on-year while growing 0.3% month-on-month, in September. The Fed's preferred inflation measure continued a run of inflation at levels not seen in 30 years and solidified market expectations for an interest rate hike around mid-2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar index continued to rebound from prior-day losses on Friday after U.S. government bond yields rose on news that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure showed prices continuing to rise faster than its 2% target.
The euro, which has a heavy weighting in the dollar index, plunged 1.05% against the greenback - the most since at least June.
The euro's drop helped drive the dollar index up 0.8% to 94.102 in the afternoon in New York (1820 GMT).
The fall in the euro more than reversed its big gain the day before and came as traders tried to sort through inflation reports and central bank comments to divine the course of interest rates for different currencies.
The euro also fell against the British pound by 0.4% and the Swiss franc by 0.7%.
Volatility in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets has increased throughout the week around central bank actions and economic data. Next week could bring more of the same around policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia.
""A source of volatility could be this discrepancy between what the markets are saying and what the central banks are saying,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
Another reason for the volatility, Chandler and others said, was month-end portfolio repositioning on the day of the week when markets tend to be the least liquid.
""It is the end of the month and it is Friday,"" said Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments in Palo Alto. Some of the trades were likely ""window-dressing"" so that month-end portfolios would not show so much leverage, he said.
U.S. Treasury yields rose after the government's index of core personal consumption expenditures - the Fed's preferred inflation measure - climbed at a 4.4% annual rate in September, continuing a run of inflation at levels not seen in 30 years.
U.S. interest rate markets have been unusually volatile as traders prepare for the Federal Reserve to raise rates around mid-2022.
European data on Friday showed inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 4.1% in October from 3.4% a month earlier, beating a consensus forecast of 3.7% and creating a policy dilemma for the European Central Bank.
Germany's 10-year bond yield rose on Friday as much as 8 basis points to its highest level since May 2019 and Southern European government bond yields surged.
ECB President Christine Lagarde's failure during a Thursday press conference to push back against market expectations of higher interest rates has brought out bears, with Danske Bank strategists expecting the euro to fall to $1.10 over the next 12 months.
""Investors are just not buying what the ECB is saying,"" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, a senior investment analyst at brokerage XM. Markets are betting that inflation will force the ECB to pull back on asset purchases sooner than planned.
Elsewhere, the British pound fell 0.7% to $1.3698. 
The dollar gained 0.3% against the Japanese yen to 113.92505. 

The Australian dollar slipped 0.3% to $0.7521.
In cryptocurrencies, ether rose to a record $4,460 and was up 3% on the day, while bigger rival bitcoin gained 3% to $62,330.

608,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 05:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest state-run banks extended their earnings recovery in the third quarter, fueled by rising credit demand and improving asset quality even as turmoil mounts in the nation’s sprawling real estate market. 
Bank of China Ltd. reported a 13% increase in third-quarter profit, while Bank of Communications Co. delivered a 38% gain, according to filings on Friday. Both lenders saw a decline in their non-performing loan ratios from the end of last year. 
After being enlisted to help millions of struggling business with cheap loans during the pandemic, the closely managed $52 trillion banking industry staged a comeback along with the economy this year. But it now faces renewed risks as the nation’s housing market is teetering after Beijing clamped down on easy credit, which along with electricity shortages dragged down economic growth in the latest quarter.
“We maintain our forecast for a marked slowdown in China’s property sector and overall economy and a further increase in credit defaults and non-performing loans,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. economists led by Ting Lu wrote in an Oct. 25 note. “To counteract the strong growth headwinds, we expect Beijing to step up monetary and fiscal easing, but it is unlikely to ease its unprecedented tightening measures on the property sector and industries with high carbon emissions and high energy intensity.”
China’s real estate market has been rocked by a debt crisis at China Evergrande Group after a multi-year campaign by officials in Beijing to cut leverage and prevent a bubble. The sector is now driving a record surge of defaults in China’s bond market.
Chinese banks had more than 51.4 trillion yuan of outstanding loans to the real estate sector as of September, an increase of 7.6% from a year earlier. The exposure was more than any other industry and accounted for about 27% of the nation’s total lending, according to official data.
Overall, about 41% of China’s banking system assets were either directly or indirectly associated with the property sector by the end of last year, and any slide in property prices may lead to knock-on effects on asset quality due to higher default rates in related sectors and lower collateral value, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). 
The stress for real estate companies adds to a string of broader risks for China’s economy, which depends on housing market for about 30% of gross domestic product. Home prices fell in September for the first time in six years, while real estate investment slid for the first time since last year.
Even so, regulators have vowed to keep the curbs on the property market, dismissing concerns that the crisis enveloping Evergrande will have any major impact on the credit profile of the sector. While officials have told banks to speed up mortgage lending again, the central bank has indicated that contagion risks from Evergrande are “controllable” and exposure at individual financial institution is limited.
China’s central bank has pushed almost a trillion yuan into the banking system over the past two weeks to to cope with month-end needs such as corporate tax payments and local debt issuances.
Meanwhile, China is stepping up efforts to strengthen its financial system by imposing tougher capital requirements on 19 banks designated by the central bank this month as “systemically important.” ICBC, Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank and Bank of China are facing capital surcharge of 1% on top of the minimum core tier-1 ratio, a requirement less onerous than other banking systems including in Singapore.
“This reflects the authorities’ gradual approach to strengthening financial stability because of the potential negative effects a more stringent capital regime might have on growth,” Moody’s Investors Service analyst Nicholas Zhu wrote in a note.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Friday, rebounding a touch after falling to a one-month low against the euro in the wake of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 93.438, just above Thursday's low at 93.277 - a level not seen since Sept. 27.
USD/JPY traded just lower at 113.53, GBP/USD was largely flat at 1.3788, and AUD/USD was unchanged at 0.7544, after reaching the highest since early July at 0.7555 in the previous session.
It’s the EUR/USD pair which has seen most of the action of late, falling 0.1% to 1.1665 after rising as high as 1.1692 overnight for the first time since Sept. 28.
This follows Thursday’s ECB meeting, which resulted in the central bank leaving interest rates and asset purchases unchanged, as expected. However, the focus was on Christine Lagarde, with the ECB President suggesting the inflation will be higher for longer, prompting traders to bet on the central bank being quicker in tightening its accommodative monetary policy. Eurozone government bond yields posted their biggest one-day rise of the year in response .
“The ECB still sees the period of higher inflation as transitory but has become much more balanced with its inflation analysis, paving the way for further asset purchase reductions in December,” said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski, in a note.
Traders will have their eyes on economic numbers from both regions later in the day, with Europe seeing a preliminary reading of the consumer price index, while the U.S. gets personal spending and income data.  
Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are scheduled to hand down their policy decisions in the following week. The Fed is expected to begin asset tapering from this meeting, while the BOE is expected to announce an interest rate hike.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but remained near its weakest level in a month. A stronger euro, as investors bet on earlier European interest rate hikes, capped gains for U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 93.388 by 12:16 AM ET (4:16 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 113.64. Japanese data released earlier in the day showed that the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.1% year-on-year, while the Tokyo CPI ex food and energy contracted 0.2% month-on-month, in October. Industrial production contracted 5.4% month-on-month, the jobs/applications ratio was at 1.16 and the unemployment rate at 2.8% in September.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.7552. Australian retail sales grew a better-than-expected 1.3% month-on-month, while private sector credit grew 0.6% month-on-month, in September. The producer price index grew 1.1% quarter-on-quarter and 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021.
The NZD/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 0.7188. The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.3910 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 1.3798.
The euro was largely flat at $1.16855 after climbing as high as $1.1692 for the first time since Sep. 28 during the previous session. The European Central Bank (ECB) handed down its policy decision on Thursday, with comments by President Christine Lagarde interpreted by some as not going far enough in affirming the central bank's dovish stance.
Lagarde's ""pushback was not forceful enough,"" opening the way for the euro to test $1.1680 in the near term, TD Securities strategists said in a note. However, ""extrapolating euro strength beyond that seems like a big ask a week ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting where assert tapering will be announced,"" the note added.
Foreign exchange markets saw big moves as central banks, including the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan, handed down policy decisions earlier on the week. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia on Thursday declined to buy a government bond at the heart of its stimulus program and continued the stance on Friday.
The Fed and the Bank of England (BOE) will hand down their policy decisions in the following week. While the Fed is expected to begin asset tapering from November onwards, BOE is expected to announce an interest rate hike."

Investing.com – The euro jumped to one-month highs against the dollar, shrugging off the European Central Bank’s attempts to downplay bets that rising inflation could force into raising rates as soon as next year.
EUR/USD rose 0.68% to $1.1683
The European Central Bank left interest rates and asset purchases unchanged, as expected, but the ECB governor Christine Lagarde, hinting at higher for longer inflation, struggled to convince traders that bets on sooner rather later rate hikes were misplaced.  
Lagarde conceded that the decline in inflation would “take a little longer than we expected,"" reflecting energy, recovery demand that is outpacing supply, though added that the medium-term outlook remained intact.
But market participants aren’t convinced and believe the central bank has grown more concerned about inflation.
“In our view, the ECB is clearly crawling back from its fully convinced view of inflation being transitory,” ING said.
”This was among other things reflected in the finer details, for example, the scrapping of a sentence such as ‘Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have continued to increase, but these remain some distance from our two per cent target”  but also in the assessment that wages will rise,” it added.
This subtle change in the central bank’s stance on inflation doesn’t help its case and will continue cast doubt on the ECB’s inflation outlook.
“When you fudge the arguments and interpretations, they take over the driver’s seat. Folks who have been through multiple cycles know full well that markets tend to lead central banks on the way in and the way out more often than not,” Scotiabank said.
Lagarde also pushed back, though unconvincingly, on market bets for the bank to raise its deposit facility rate by 20 basis points to minus 0.3% by December 2022.
“Our analysis certainly does not support that the conditions of our forward guidance are satisfied at the time of liftoff as expected by markets, nor any time soon thereafter,” Lagarde said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held losses to the euro and British pound late on Thursday as currency traders digested moves in interest rate markets, comments by the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and a weaker-than-expected U.S. economic report.
The euro rose nearly 0.7% against the dollar and was headed for its biggest daily gain since May. It traded at $1.1681 in the late afternoon in New York.
Sterling gained nearly 0.4% to $1.3788.
The dollar index of major currencies lost nearly 0.6% to 93.3580.
Foreign exchange markets have become volatile around central bank activity. Bigger moves started on Wednesday with hawkish comments from the Bank of Canada and were followed on Thursday with an action by the Reserve Bank of Australia and comments by the ECB - all ahead of meetings next week of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
""The market is very much triggered and sensitive to inflation worries and this notion that central banks are behind the curve,"" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities.
A contributing factor to the increasing volatility, Issa said, is the approaching end of the month when more investment managers rebalance their portfolios across currencies.
As central banks each chart adjustments to monetary policies adopted during the pandemic, traders are trying to predict the direction of interest rates and inflation-adjusted yields across currencies.
Some of the currency volatility is likely a spill over from uneasy interest rate markets. Recently flattening yield curves have suggested to some that central banks will have to sacrifice support for the pandemic recovery by allowing interest rates to rise to try to hold back inflation. Euro zone yields rose sharply on Thursday.
Before Lagarde spoke in a press conference, the euro moved little on the ECB policy statement. The ECB had stood, as expected, by its plan to keep buying bonds and hold down interest rates.
Some saw Lagarde's comments as not being as forceful in affirming the ECB's dovish position as markets expected.
""President Lagarde failed to give enough pushback against market expectations of rate hikes next year,"" Rabobank economists wrote in a note. 
The dollar got no help from a U.S. government report that gross domestic product grew at only a 2% annualized rate in the quarter ended in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.7% rate.
More recent U.S. economic data has been stronger, so the report had not been expected to matter much to the dollar.
Though the British pound firmed against the dollar, it slipped against the euro as much as 0.3%.
The pound has been buffeted recently by speculation over whether the Bank of England would proceed with an interest rate hike at its meeting next week.
Early on Thursday, the Reserve Bank of Australia declined to buy a government bond at the heart of its stimulus program and the Aussie dollar fell in response to speculation the central bank will allow rates to rise earlier than expected. 
The Aussie initially fell 0.5% after the RBA statement but soon erased those losses and was up 0.3% against the U.S. dollar at 1924 GMT.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose 3% to $60,040.

613,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter to the softest pace of the pandemic recovery period as snarled supply chains and a surge in Covid-19 cases throttled spending and investment.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2% annualized rate following a 6.7% pace in the second quarter, the Commerce Department’s preliminary estimate showed Thursday. 
The deceleration reflected a sharp slowdown in personal consumption, which  grew at just a 1.6% pace after a rapid 12% jump in the prior period. Shortages, transportation bottlenecks, rising prices and the delta variant of the coronavirus weighed on both goods and services spending.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 2.6% increase in GDP. 
The latest data underscore how unprecedented supply constraints are holding back the U.S. economy. Understaffed and short of necessary materials, producers are struggling to keep up with demand. Service providers, who face similar pressures, took an additional hit from the delta variant. 
While supply chain challenges are expected to linger well into 2022, subsiding Covid-19 infections and elevated savings should support stronger household spending in the final three months of the year. 
Persistent supply constraints paired with other reopening effects have also driven up prices for a variety of products, spurring concerns about the breadth and duration of the recent spike in inflation. 
The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy costs, followed closely by Federal Reserve officials, remained elevated last quarter. 
“We don’t see the raw material or the inflation environment slowing down in any way.” -- 3M Co. CFO Monish Patolawala, Oct. 26 earnings call
“Consistent with the broader market, we are experiencing inflation pressure... Next year we anticipate a more challenging inflation environment.” --  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.  CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe, Oct. 26 earnings call
“I think the headwinds and the increased distribution costs will certainly be with us into 2022.” -- Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB). CFO Maria Henry, Oct. 25 earnings call
“On the cost side of the equation... we do not see any meaningful improvement until well into 2022.” -- Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW). CEO John Morikis, Oct. 26 earnings call
“The risks are clearly now to longer and more persistent bottlenecks and thus to higher inflation,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week. “We now see higher inflation and the bottlenecks lasting well into next year.

The Bank of Japan handed down its policy decision on Thursday. ""BOJ is likely to look through the rebound in the CPI caused by rising commodity prices and a weaker yen,"" and ""maintain the status quo on all key policy settings, as widely expected,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts said in a note.

A neutral message which ""may ultimately defy some of the market's hawkish expectations” is expected, the note added.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada could hike interest rates as soon as April 2022 as it expects inflation to stay above target through much of the coming year. The U.S. Federal Reserve will also hand down its policy decision on Nov. 3."

Investing.com — The GBP/USD saw a bounce earlier today following U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's budget speech.
In the upbeat speech, Sunak said the U.K. economy had not been hit as hard as expected by the Covid-19 pandemic while using the positive economic forecast to unveil tax cuts and higher public spending. 
In addition, he also promised multibillion-pound initiatives to assist Prime Minister Boris Johnson in meeting his ""levelling up"" commitments to voters.
""Employment is up. Investment is growing,"" Sunak told MPs. 
""The public finances are stabilizing and wages are rising,"" he added.
In a further positive for the U.K. economy, Sunak said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believes the economy will return to pre-Covid levels at the turn of the year, approximately six months earlier than anticipated. 
After a recent fall in the pound due to Brexit trade worries stemming from the Northern Ireland protocol, the GBPUSD saw a small bounce following the speech.
Earlier in the session, the pair hit a low of 1.3710, putting it firmly in the red for the day. However, it has retraced post-speech and now finds itself sitting above the 1.3750 mark supported by Sunak's comments, Bank of England rate hike expectations, and a weaker U.S. dollar, although it is still down around 0.06%. "

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday in calm trading ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, while the U.K. budget places sterling in focus.
At 2:30 AM ET (0630 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.892.
USD/JPY traded 0.1% lower at 114.03, EUR/USD edged 0.1% higher at 1.1603, while GBP/USD slipped marginally to 1.3763 ahead of Britain’s annual budget.
The Federal Reserve has now gone into a blackout period ahead of next week’s policy-setting meeting, and ahead of this traders are focusing on the release of a series of important data releases.
Wednesday’s sees the release of the September durable goods orders, but the 3Q GDP release on Thursday and the September core PCE deflator on Friday will attract the most attention.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7513 after Australian core inflation rose at its fastest annual pace since 2015, prompting traders to price in earlier hikes in interest rates.
The headline consumer price index rose 0.8% in the third quarter and 3.0% for the year, much as expected, but the annual measure of core inflation accelerated to 2.1%, well above the 1.8% expected and putting it back in the RBA's 2% to 3% target range for the first time in six years.
Sterling could be vulnerable Wednesday as U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak delivers his annual budget. 
Much of the talk ahead of this set piece has been about Sunak loosening the purse strings, following leaks that he is set to end the public sector pay freeze, but the Chancellor still faces a tricky balancing act in this year’s budget. Too much largesse and he risks sparking more inflation with the Bank of England already looking at tightening monetary policy, but too little and he risks strangling an already hesitant recovery.
“The pre-budget leaks have typically involved new spending plans rather than how this is going to be paid for. That does perhaps leave GBP a little vulnerable tomorrow should the UK Chancellor announce any kind of fiscal consolidation,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
USD/CAD traded largely flat at 1.2391 ahead of the Bank of Canada latest policy-setting meeting later this session. The central bank is expected to reduce its weekly government bond purchases again, marking the fourth time over the past 12 months the central bank has rolled back its program, paving the way for the start of interest rate increases next year.

617,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 11:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The city of Shanghai launched a trial to eliminate all so-called hidden government debt, becoming the second Chinese region to start a program to clean up off-balance sheet risk.
The trial was in response to the central government’s strategy to prevent and resolve financial risks related to local government hidden debt, the Shanghai city government said in a statement on its website Tuesday. It didn’t provide further details on the trial.
The announcement came two weeks after Guangdong province, the manufacturing powerhouse in southern China, announced a similar trial, suggesting local governments are getting more serious about tackling off-balance sheet debt. 
A major source of hidden debt is local government financing vehicles, or LGFVs, which are used to raise funds for infrastructure and other expenditure and carry an implicit guarantee of repayment.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimated that LGFV debt surged to 53 trillion yuan ($8.3 trillion) at the end of last year from 16 trillion yuan in 2013. That’s equal to about 52% of China’s gross domestic product and is larger than the amount of official outstanding government debt.
Beijing has tried to tackle hidden debt for several years already but gave it more importance this year after calling it a national security risk. It’s ordered officials to deal with it by paying down debt or bringing it onto the balance sheets of local authorities. 
Cities and provinces may have started to use some of the proceeds from the sale of refinancing bonds to repay hidden debt this year, an analysis by Bloomberg found.

The USD/JPY pair was down 0.05% to 114.08. A weakening of the yen since the previous trading session after the country reported slower-than-expected producer price increases on Tuesday has pushed the Japanese currency past the JPY114 level against the dollar, a level that it touched last week for the first time since 2016.

In Australia, core consumer prices rose faster than expected over the last quarter, rising 2.1% in the third quarter, compared to an expected 1.8% rise. The increase puts the measure within the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) target of 2-3% for the first time in six years, according to the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Australia’s headline consumer price index rose 3% in the third quarter of the year, slightly lower than the 3.1% widely expected, Bloomberg reported.

619,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 07:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The economic gap between China’s less-developed western region and the wealthier eastern parts of the nation widened in the third quarter as Beijing’s crackdown on property and local government debt weighed on growth.
Fixed-asset investment in Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Ningxia contracted in the first nine months of this year, contributing to weaker growth in those provinces than the national pace of 9.8% in the same period. Expansion in another five provincial-level units in the west was also slower than the national level, with only Chongqing outperforming. Tibet and Xinjiang haven’t published their results yet. 
 
Nationally, growth slowed in the third quarter, partly due to a higher base of comparison from a year ago, but also dragged down by power shortages, repeated Covid outbreaks, and turmoil in the housing sector. Government action to fix imbalances and lower financial risk in the economy is also having an effect on activity, with the tighter rein on the property sector and local government debt likely helping to widen the divide between the regions.
Western Chinese provinces had seen faster economic growth than those in the east until recently, benefiting from big-ticket government investment aimed at boosting the region and transfers of lower-end industries from coastal provinces. But the coronavirus pandemic has slowed that down, with local government borrowing less money to fund infrastructure projects and businesses more cautious about expansion plans. 
The damage to the domestic tourism industry from repeated lockdowns and travel restrictions due to Covid-19 outbreaks have also hurt growth in these regions.  
In an effort to coordinate regional development, the State Council last week released an ambitious blueprint for linking two important cities in the western region: Chengdu and Chongqing. The city cluster development plan is expected to turn the region into an “important economic center” and a “science and technology innovation center” with national influence, according to the plan.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up on Tuesday in narrow-range trading as markets awaited news from upcoming central bank meetings that might spark volatility.
After a report showed that U.S. consumers were more confident about the economy than expected, the dollar index rose modestly and was up 0.1% at 93.9280 at 3:30 p.m. EDT (1903 GMT).
The greenback mostly hovered around a point midway between its one-year high reached earlier this month and the one-month low touched early on Monday.
Analysts said the dollar might continue to hold steady pending a slew of central bank meetings and economic data that could shift views on interest rates, inflation and growth rates.
Yields on 10-year U.S. and German government securities also stayed in narrow ranges before the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note slipped to 1.6185% in the afternoon in New York.
""The markets are just pausing right now,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com. 
The Bank of Canada meets on Wednesday and the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan convene on Thursday. Next week brings meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of Australia and Norway's Norges Bank.
The euro was down 0.1% at $1.1597. The euro has been weakened recently by expectations that the ECB will take a dovish stance when it meets. Doing so would come in the face of news on Tuesday that inflation expectations for the euro zone among bond investors had reached a seven-year high above 2.07%.
Bigger currency movements came from the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen.
Sterling rose to more than $1.38 after British retailers reported stronger-than-expected sales in October, affirming the prospect of higher rates. The pound then slipped back and was flat for the day at $1.3764. 
The Aussie, which tends to move with commodity prices, gained 0.2% to $0.7506. Last week, it traded above $0.75 for the first time since July. 
The U.S. dollar rose 0.4% against the Japanese yen, with the pair at 114.1400, below the four-year high of 114.695 reached last week.
The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its massive stimulus program and slash this year's inflation forecast when it meets on Thursday, showing again that it has no intention of following other central banks in backing away from pandemic policies.
The Canadian dollar gained slightly on the greenback as oil prices rose but was held back by the approaching Bank of Canada meeting.
The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its inflation forecast and to largely end stimulus from its pandemic-era bond-buying program.
So far in 2021, energy-exporting currencies whose central banks are preparing to tighten - such as the Canadian dollar or Norwegian crown - have outperformed, ING strategists noted.
Bitcoin was down 1% at $62,343 at 1903 GMT.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Tuesday, rebounding from a one-month low although gains are small ahead of the release of key economic data and next week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 93.882, climbing just above Monday’s one-month low.
USD/JPY traded 0.2% higher at 113.91 after Japan’s PPI for September rose 0.9% year-on-year. EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1604, GBP/USD slipped marginally to 1.3767, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7511.
The dollar was hit late last week following comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stating that it’s not yet time to begin raising U.S. interest rates.
The Fed has now gone into a blackout period ahead of next week’s policy-setting meeting, an eagerly-anticipated gathering where the central bank is expected to confirm the start of the withdrawal of its bond-buying stimulus.
In the absence of any Fed communication, it will be the U.S. data that the market concentrates on this week. Tuesday’s data slate includes new home sales for September and October CB consumer confidence numbers, but it’s the 3Q GDP release on Thursday and the September core PCE deflator on Friday that will attract the most attention.
“In the absence of any Fed speakers before the 3 November FOMC meeting we think that the persistence in inflation can continue to support the market re-pricing of the Fed curve - and be supportive for dollar strength against the low yielders,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY fell 0.1% to 9.5701 after President Tayyip Erdogan rowed back from his demand that 10 Western ambassadors be expelled from Turkey over criticism of the jailing of a government critic, deescalating a diplomatic row that had shaken the currency.
The Turkish currency has rebounded in response, after falling to record lows against the dollar on Monday.
Additionally, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.3819 after China’s central bank injected a net $190 billion yuan ($30 billion) into the financial system, resulting in the overnight interbank repo rate dropping as much as eight basis points to 1.53%, the lowest since September 29 and near a nine-month low.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) extended the deal with the People's Bank of China back in July, though the first official mention of it came in the RBA's annual report released last week. The previous deal expired in April.
The PBOC mentioned the agreement in a document posted on its website in September
The five-year agreement allows for the exchange of local currencies between the two central banks of up to A$41 billion ($30.60 billion) or CNY 200 billion. 
The RBA has similar deals with Japan and Korea, allowing the central banks to support trade settlement in local currencies in times of market stress or financial instability.

Investing.com – The dollar was up in early trading Tuesday morning in Asia, following a high reached overnight during the U.S. trading session.
The strengthening of the dollar comes as reports in China suggests the government may be shifting its focus away from tighter regulation of sectors it is concerned about and towards shoring up growth.
With the U.S. Treasury yield curve steepening and bonds with shorter maturity climbing, the dollar rose. The US Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.04% to 93.84 by 9:30 PM ET (01:30 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.14% to 113.85. The yen has been strengthened against the USD over the past few days after hitting the 114-mark last week. Japan’s Producer Price Index for September rose 0.9% year-on-year compared to an expected increase of 1% and a similar increase in August.
In South Korea, The USD/KRW pair fell 0.26% to 1,164.94 as growth slowed. Bank of Korea data showed that the country’s GDP rose 0.3% during the third quarter of the year, compared to the previous quarter. The expected growth, according to a Reuters survey, was 0.6%.
The AUD/USD pair rose 0.18% to 0.7503 while the NZD/USD pair rose 0.07% to 0.7165. In Australia, the ANZ-Roy Morgan Australia Consumer Confidence weekly index fell to 106.8, down from 107.
The USD/CNY pair fell 0.06% to 6.3820.
Concerns are rising in China that power shortages could lead to production stoppages and shortages of products down the supply chain, which could affect growth.
Xinhua News Agency reported an outline of the government’s strategy to deal with the 10 most pressing challenges for the country’s economy. The report provided hints as to the policy direction that the country’s leaders could take during a series of meetings over the next few weeks, including a plenary session of the 19th Central Committee next month and the Central Economic Work Conference.
According to Xinhua, the new priorities are likely to be boosting private consumption and investment, after growth slowed to 4.9% during the third quarter of the year.
“Consumption and investment are the ‘two engines’ to reach larger domestic demand,” said Xinhua as quoted by the South China Morning Post.
The GBP/USD pair fell 0.06% to 1.3759."

Gross domestic product gained 0.3% in the July-to-September period, decelerating from 0.8% in the second quarter and slower than the 0.6% predicted by economists, data from the Bank of Korea showed Tuesday. From a year earlier, the economy expanded 4%. 
The result complicates the BOK’s plans for another interest-rate increase this year, after it began a tightening cycle in August. Governor Lee Ju-yeol has said the central bank will consider another hike in November in the event the recovery proceeds as expected, having projected a 4% expansion for 2021.
Bank of Korea’s Lee Drops Strong Hint For November Rate Hike
Growth had been expected to ease last quarter as daily infections surged above 1,000 from July and authorities imposed a semi-lockdown in Seoul and other major cities. In an online seminar Monday, the BOK said it expected rising vaccinations and a transition to “living with Covid” to support consumption for the remainder of this year and into 2022.
Exports have remained buoyant this year, aided by resilient global demand. Still, factory shutdowns in Southeast Asia have created challenges in securing key manufacturing components, particularly for Korea’s automakers.
The BOK on Monday flagged risks to the economy from China’s energy crunch and property market woes. It estimated a 1 percentage point slowdown in China reduced Korea’s growth rate by 0.1-0.2 percentage point. 
Looking at GDP by component, private consumption fell 0.3% last quarter from the April-June period. Government spending was up 1.1%. Exports, as measured on a real basis, increased 1.5%, while facilities investment fell 2.3%.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's lira performed a volte face and bonds bounced back from multi-month lows after President Tayyip Erdogan welcomed statements on Monday from several Western embassies, paving the way for the de-escalation of a diplomatic row. 
The lira had tumbled as much as 2.4% to a record low early in the day after Erdogan said on Saturday he had told his foreign ministry to expel the ambassadors of the United States and nine other Western countries for demanding the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala. 
Though the currency pulled back from the brink after Erdogan made comments on his way to a cabinet meeting called to discuss the rift. He told state media he welcomed pledges by several Western embassies to abide by a diplomatic convention not to interfere in a host country's internal affairs.
The lira strengthened 0.7% in the wake of the comment and were seen by analysts as an attempt to cool diplomatic tensions. 
""It seems that President Tayyip Erdogan will not follow through on his previous threat to declare 10 Western Ambassadors 'personae non gratae',"" said Wolfango Piccoli at Teneo. 
""Just like in various past occasions, it seems Erdogan has been playing an expensive high-stakes game for short-term political gains.""
The lira had already come under sustained pressure last week after the central bank delivered a surprisingly sharp 200 basis point rate cut last week, stoked market volatility and also sent Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds tumbling.
However, dollar bonds marked a similar reversal, pulling back from losses that had pushed them to multi-months low early on Monday to gain as much as half a cent in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed. 
The president chaired a cabinet meeting at 3 p.m. (1200 GMT) to make a decisions on whether the expulsions would move ahead. Generally Erdogan issues a statement after meetings which was expected at around 1600 GMT. 
The lira has lost over 22% of its value so far this year in a sell-off that had accelerated after the central bank eased policy, despite rising inflation, in a shock move derided as reckless by economists and opposition lawmakers.
Notwithstanding the bruising year for Turkish markets so far, analysts predict that the central bank will continue to cut interest rates despite inflation being set to accelerate due to the plunging lira and rising energy prices. The next policy meeting is scheduled for on Nov. 18.
""Problems with the exchange rate come from the central bank's tendency under political pressure to ease monetary policy too early and too fast,"" said Per Hammarlund at SEB. ""President Erdogan's overarching goal is to generate economic growth and for that he needs lower interest rates."" 
Erdogan's political opponents said his call to expel the ambassadors was an attempt to distract attention from Turkey's economic difficulties.

Separately, state lenders Ziraat Bank, Vakifbank and Halkbank lowered their loan rates by up to 200 basis points, confirming a Reuters report on Sunday.
Analysts said the move could support some borrowers but also exacerbate pressure on the lira and the economy, given that Turkey's benchmark bond yields shot up after the central bank slashed its policy rate by 200 points to 16% last week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Monday afternoon after bouncing off a one-month low as traders weighed the prospects of higher interest rates for different currencies and considered how coming economic data and central bank comments could impact their positions. 
The upward move came at the expense of the euro, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The change seemed to indicate that the market had taken the dollar down too much recently on expectations that inflation outside the U.S. will force up interest rates for other currencies faster than for the greenback.
The dollar index against major currencies steadied with a gain of nearly 0.2% for the day after turning up from a one-month low in early trading. Before the turn, the index had lost 1% over two weeks.
Threats to current positions could come on Thursday from the European Central Bank and from U.S. economic data and from U.S. and European inflation data on Friday, as well as a meeting of the Bank of Canada on Wednesday.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week.
""There's so much event risk on tap this week and the dollar has underperformed over the last two weeks that the market's starting to buy back the dollar,"" said Joseph Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
""What had dulled the dollar's shine of late is this notion that other central banks appear poised to raise rates before the Fed,"" he said.
At one point the dollar index was up 0.4% on the day as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose. The dollar eased off and the 10-year yield fell back, and was last around 1.63% and little changed for the day. Crude oil, too, climbed and then eased for the day.
The euro lost 0.3% to $1.1613.
The European Central Bank meeting on Thursday is not expected to make big news but comments from the bank could shift views on how much inflationary pressures could impact interest rates.
""There is no way that they (ECB policymakers) can't acknowledge that inflation has run higher, but also they do not want to get dragged into a game of expectations given the ECB's dovish proclivities,"" said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments firm Equals Money.
""Alongside inflation and growth data due this week, we will be able to mark the European economy a lot better against its UK and U.S. counterparts, something we expect to continue to allow for additional euro weakness moving forward.""
The dollar chalked up gains versus the Japanese yen, rising 0.2% to 113.685 yen. The Bank of Japan meets later this week. But like the ECB, it is not expected to shift from its dovish policy stance.
Thursday's U.S. gross domestic product figures -- if they show an expected slowdown -- could take some pressure off the Fed even while inflation runs relatively hot.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Monday, trading near one-month lows as investors continue to assess the likelihood of U.S. rate hikes in the near term, while the Turkish lira slumped following a surprise rate cut and heightened political tension.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.552, just above a one-month low.
USD/JPY traded 0.2% higher at 113.65, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1653, GBP/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.3769, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7484.
Weighing on the dollar were comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday indicating that it’s not yet time to begin raising interest rates.
The central bank is widely expected to begin reining in its bond-buying program next month, but investors have also priced in Fed rate hikes starting in the second half of next year.
“The dollar rally has stalled recently even though interest rate markets continue to hawkishly re-price the Fed policy cycle,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Explaining that may be the better risk environment, where 3Q earnings have come in on the strong side and renewed interest has been shown in the commodity pairs on the back of supply challenges in this sector.”
While Powell tried to downplay expectations of early U.S. rate hikes, the prospect of inflation hastening the pace of rate hikes outside the United States is growing.
The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are set to hand down their respective policy decisions on Thursday. Nothing new is expected from those central banks, but markets are pricing in a near 60% chance of a hike from the Bank of England next week.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 2.3% to 9.7990, with the Turkish lira falling to a record low against the dollar after President Tayyip Erdogan said he had ordered the expulsion of the ambassadors of the United States and nine other Western countries for demanding the release of businessman Osman Kavala, who has been held in prison for four years without being convicted.
The currency had already hit record lows last week after the Turkish central bank cut its policy rate by 200 basis points, a move that surprised the market given the country’s rising inflation.
Additionally, USD/RUB rose 0.1% to 70.425, with the Russian ruble just falling back from a 16-month high after the Bank of Russia raised its benchmark rate by 75 basis points to 7.5% on Friday, its biggest interest-rate increase since July and its sixth straight hike.

The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.15% to 113.64.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.7471, with Australia releasing its consumer price index on Wednesday. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7150, with New Zealand markets closed for a holiday.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.09% to 6.3899, with China dealing with its latest COVID-19 outbreak. The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 1.3770. There is now a 60% chance that the Bank of England will hike its interest rate at its meeting in the following week.
The greenback softened, particularly against the yen, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that asset tapering should begin soon. He did, however, say that it was not yet time for interest rate hikes. Powell’s remarks came after investors priced in Fed interest rate hikes starting in the second half of 2022. However, they have already begun trimming long dollar positions in anticipation that other central banks will move sooner.
Some investors were cautious about further gains, with the Fed is expected to begin asset tapering soon.
""Dollar risks remain skewed to the upside,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy told Reuters.
""Fed members are slowly conceding that inflation risks are skewed to the upside and the upshot is that interest rate markets can continue to price a more aggressive Fed Funds rate hike cycle which can support the dollar.""
Investors now await U.S. data, including core durable goods orders that will be released on Wednesday and the GDP for the third quarter following a day later.
The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will also hand down their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira was braced for selling, as state banks are expected to follow a surprise interest rate cut from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's informal peso rate weakened 2.05% to 195 per dollar on Friday and country risk shot out 19 basis points to an all-time high 1,672 as inflation soars and policy uncertainty mounts ahead of November congressional elections.
""It reflects the process of dollarization at a time of political and economic uncertainty,"" local economist Gustavo Ber told Reuters.
The peso stumbled 4.36% during the week, its weakest in about a year, marking a 96.2% gap with the formal rate, which is controlled by central bank interventions.
The country's risk spread, prepared by JP Morgan, exceeded its previous ceiling of 1,669 basis points, reached at the end of March of this year.
Consumer prices spiked to a higher-than-expected 3.5% in September. The 12-month rate was 52.5%, while inflation in the first nine months of 2021 reached 37%.

Argentina has been battling runaway inflation for years, which saps savings, incomes and economic growth. The government this week froze prices of over a thousand household goods until early 2022. Inflation is also heating up globally.
Argentines will vote in November to elect half of the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate. Government-allied candidates got thumped in September primary elections, prompting a rash of finger-pointing in the ruling Peronist coalition.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should begin reducing its asset purchases soon, but should not yet raise interest rates.
Powell said employment is still too low and high inflation will likely abate next year as pressures from the COVID-19 pandemic fade, even as many market participants are concerned that rising price pressures will last longer than policymakers believe.
Investors have taken profits since the dollar index hit a one-year high last week, when concerns that inflation will remain stubbornly high for longer led investors to bring forward expectations on when the Fed will first raise rates to mid-2022.
Now, “there’s a bit of a positioning unwind taking place, we’ve obviously seen a firmer dollar since the September Fed,” said Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities in New York. “That also dovetails with the seasonal tendency for the dollar to soften into the end of the month.”
The Fed said at its September meeting that it will likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November, and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
The dollar index fell 0.10% to 93.64, and is down from a one-year high of 94.56 last week. The euro gained 0.09% to $1.1636.
Data on Friday showed that U.S. business activity increased solidly in October, suggesting economic growth picked up at the start of the fourth quarter as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.
The dollar rally has also faded as investors build in expectations for sooner rate increases in other currencies.
Issa expects the dollar to regain traction, however, as global central banks push back against the aggressive repricing of rate hikes, while the Fed is likely to remain relatively hawkish and move forward with a reduction in its bond purchase program.
“Once we get the pushback from other central banks and the Fed’s committed to taper, we should see dollar dips really being shallow,” Issa said. The Aussie dollar, which is a proxy for risk appetite, gave up earlier gains and was last down 0.05% at $0.7462.
The safe-haven yen gained, though it remains the weakest performer, having dropped by almost 10% this year. The dollar was last down 0.50% against the Japanese currency at 113.42 yen. 
Bitcoin dropped 2.98 percent to $60,367. The cryptocurrency set a record high of $67,017 on Wednesday, after the launch of the first exchange-traded fund that buys U.S. bitcoin futures.

Investing.com — The pound sterling weakened late in Friday's session after Bloomberg reported that the European Union could terminate the post-Brexit trade deal if the U.K.'s disagreement on the Northern Ireland border deepens.
The U.K. has spoken of suspending the Northern Ireland Protocol, which governs trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has threatened to trigger article 16, which allows the protocol to be suspended if it affects everyday life. Reports have stated the two sides have held crunch talks in a further attempt to resolve the issues.
A decision by the EU to terminate the Brexit trade deal is not a straightforward one and would need the unanimous backing of all 27 EU countries.
The news saw the GBPUSD fall to a low of 1.3736, down around 0.4% from Thursday. However, it is still hovering just above that level at 1.3743.
Since the start of October, the pair has experienced a strong rise, climbing from just above the 1.34 area to a high of 1.3834 on Wednesday."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia and was set for a second week of declines even as upbeat economic data gave the U.S. currency an earlier boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 93.718 by 10:57 PM ET (2:57 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 114.07, with data released earlier in the day in Japan showing that the national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.1% year-on-year in September. The national CPI grew 0.4% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7479 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.7166.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.3994 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3794.
Data released on Thursday in the U.S. said that existing home sales rose to a rate of 6.29 million units in September, a growth of 7% month-on-month. The better-than-expected data gave the dollar a boost, which it held onto as the Asian session opened.
However, some investors were concerned, with the dollar index down 0.18% for the week and set to post a second week of declines.
""People are wondering whether we are at an inflection point, as the dollar has been weakening and that doesn't really fit with the broader narrative that global growth is cooling and the U.S. Federal Reserve is on the path to asset tapering, which should be supportive for the dollar,"" HSBC global head of FX research Paul Mackel told Reuters.
Meanwhile, a rally in commodity currencies slowed down late on Thursday and continued as the Asian session opened as traded reaped the profits, according to analysts. The Canadian dollar slipped to C$1.2369 per U.S. dollar, off Thursday's C$1.2287, at a level not seen since June 2021. The Australian dollar also gave up some gains, buying $0.7455, off Thursday's three-month high.
""The ever-aggressive intervention by China in coal markets has had a significant impact on pricing in the energy sector... so we are not surprised to see a reasonable Australian dollar correction from very overbought levels,"" Westpac analysts said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Thursday against a basket of currencies, erasing earlier losses, boosted by better jobs and housing data, and as U.S. Treasury yields rose.
Data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 19-month low last week, pointing to a tightening labor market, though a shortage of workers could keep the pace of hiring moderate in October.
U.S. home sales also surged to an eight-month high in September, but higher prices as supply remains tight are squeezing first-time buyers out of the housing market.
“The dollar faded early in the session, though later found its footing on improved jobless claims and better existing home sales data,” said Ronald Simpson, managing director for global currency analysis at Action Economics.
The dollar index rose to 93.76, up 0.17% on the day, after earlier falling to 93.49. It had reached a one-year high of 94.56 last week on mounting bets that the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates sooner than previously expected to quell rising price pressures.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Thursday that the U.S. central bank should let its $8 trillion balance sheet shrink over the next couple of years.
The dollar was also supported as benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to 1.683%, the highest since May 13. 
Risk-sensitive currencies, including the Australian dollar, continued to weaken even as a rebound in stocks later in the day showed improving risk sentiment. [.N]
The Australian dollar, which is a proxy for risk appetite, fell 0.67% to $0.7465 after reaching $0.7547 overnight, the highest since July 6.
Commerzbank’s head of FICC technical analysis, Karen Jones, said in a report on Thursday that the Australian currency was likely to see profit taking as it reached its 55-week moving average at $0.7516.
The New Zealand dollar, which has been boosted since the country on Monday recorded the highest inflation reading in over a decade, also fell 0.67% to $0.77153, after rising to $0.7219 overnight, the highest since June 8.
The greenback dipped 0.34% against the safe-haven yen to 113.97. It had hit a four-year high of 114.67 against the Japanese currency on Wednesday.
Sterling slipped 0.29% to $1.3785 while the euro was down 0.23% at $1.1623.
Bitcoin was last at $65,193, after reaching a record high of $67,017 on Wednesday. Demand for the cryptocurrency has increased after the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund.

Investing.com -- The dollar was consolidating at lower levels in early trade in Europe on Thursday, after the revival of some concerns over China’s real estate crisis interrupted the momentum of higher-yielding currencies.
China Evergrande shares plunged as it resumed trading after a break of nearly three weeks, as the embattled developer was forced to abandon a proposed asset disposal that would have helped meet its short-term obligations. As such, the company is likely to fall into formal default when the grace period on one of its dollar bonds expires on Friday.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced market economies, was up 0.1% at 93.62, still stuck more than half a percentage point from where it started the week.
The dollar’s biggest gains were against commodity currencies, as the Evergrande news cast fresh doubt on the demand trajectory for iron ore, copper and oil from a sector that is a big contributor to Chinese GDP.
The yuan, however, remained stable, mainly because of confidence in Beijing’s assurances that it can stop a systemic crisis. The dollar ticked up 0.1% to 6.4011 yuan.
Against European currencies, the dollar was flat against the euro at $1.1643 and 0.2% higher against the pound at $1.3801, after data showing a sharp rise in U.K. government borrowing in September.  
The figures underlined the vulnerability of the U.K. economy to the higher interest rates that most market participants see coming before the end of the year. A higher debt servicing bill will reduce the space that the U.K. Treasury has to support the economy.
The euro fared better against emerging European currencies, rising 0.3% against the Polish zloty and 0.4% against the Hungarian forint ahead of a summit meeting that is likely to be overshadowed by the EU’s dispute with Poland over the rule of law.
Later Thursday, the U.S. will release weekly jobless claims data. Analysts expect initial jobless claims to tick up to 300,000, from a post-pandemic low of 293,000 the previous week.
There is little else of market-moving data due, although the Central Bank of Turkey’s meeting will be in the spotlight after the recent upheaval at the institution. The lira has plunged to all-time lows after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the only policy makers to resist a course that is failing to keep inflation under control."
637,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China's yuan climbs rapidly to its strongest levels in six years against the currencies of the country's trading partners, a notable absence of concern and intervention by the authorities is unnerving investors.
Beijing has so far not intervened directly or verbally during the yuan's ascent since early September, which took it to 4-month highs and past 6.4 per dollar this week. The head of the currency regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange(SAFE), said on Wednesday authorities will keep the yuan stable.
That silence, amid growing signs of weakness https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-self-inflicted-slowdown-tests-beijings-reform-resolve-2021-10-19 in the economy, has analysts guessing that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is keeping to its word about letting market forces dictate the yuan's trajectory. 
One popular theory is that the currency has been left alone while authorities focus on resetting the rules and financing options for property, technology and a host of other sectors. The alternate is that the PBOC is waiting for the Federal Reserve to begin its policy tightening, which could reduce the flow of foreign money pushing the yuan up.
Regardless, as the 24-currency trade-weighted yuan index topped the 100 mark on Wednesday, a level last seen when it was launched in late 2015, market participants are desperate for some clarity.
""Keeping dollar-yuan stable could be the sweet spot at this point,"" analysts at Maybank said, while noting that a stronger yuan is for the moment reining in the rising cost of scarce raw materials and energy for mainland importers.
The PBOC and SAFE did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Power shortages, a crackdown on the property sector and COVID-19 lockdowns caused a big deceleration in the world's second-biggest economy in the third quarter, but the central bank has kept rates steady and a tight rein on cash supply.
OCBC Bank's head of Greater China research, Tommy Xie, points to PBOC monetary policy head Sun Guofeng's latest statements on keeping monetary conditions balanced as a sign of what's to come. 
""My feeling is that the central bank is now very confident and at ease. Risk of capital outflow is low, liquidity is relatively easy to control,"" Xie said.
In addition, the growing trade surplus, capital inflows and a glut of dollars in the banking system would keep the yuan firm, he said.
TOLERANCE HAS ITS LIMITS
While China's monetary authorities have for the past four years tolerated relatively bigger swings in their currency - their stable currency reserves vouching for that hands-off stance - the currency is still tightly managed by the central bank. 
Besides verbal warnings about one-way bets on the currency, authorities have on occasion tweaked reserve requirements, used their daily yuan benchmarks or had state-run banks step into the swap markets when the yuan was appreciating quickly. 
The trade-weighted index has mostly stayed within a 92-98 band since 2016, while FX reserves hover just above $3 trillion.
That CFETS index is up 5.75% so far this year, driven mostly by the yuan's gains against the Japanese yen, euro and South Korean won as capital inflows into Chinese bonds and stocks and exporter earnings swelled.
By comparison, the yuan has firmed about 2.2% against the dollar. 
""A breach of 100 in CFETS index should pressure China's exports,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.
But, he noted shipments have remained exceptionally robust.
""This explains why the central bank can tolerate yuan strength. Plus, a weaker yuan at a time that Beijing and Washington are reviewing the Phase 1 trade deal could be sensitive,"" he said.
One other reason why the PBOC could be resigned to the yuan's moves, analysts say, is because of the glut of dollars in the banking system, accumulated over the past couple of years as state banks and companies placed excess dollar earnings and inflows in deposits.
While the PBOC has kept to the sidelines, that pile of dollar deposits has grown and is just slightly below peak levels above $1 trillion hit in June.
The latest evidence of that overhang of dollars was the SAFE's balance of payments report showing China made 'other' outbound investments worth a net $265.3 billion in the first six months of the year, the bulk of which was deposits and loans.

""We believe that the dollar liquidity stuck onshore is a key reason causing the yuan to detach from its fundamentals,"" said Tao Chuan, chief macro analyst at Soochow Securities.
""The central bank has exited from frequent FX interventions...a lack of foreign investment channels and restrictions faced by domestic financial institutions has led to a large amount of FX, mainly in dollars, piling up on commercial banks' accounts.""

Investing.com – The dollar was up, with the pound was just shy of its Tuesday peak on Thursday morning in Asia, over firming expectations that the Bank of England (BOE) will hike interest rates as soon as November 2021.
Commodity currencies stood near multi-month highs, with strong raw material prices and increasing risk sentiment turning investors away from the safe-haven U.S. currency, which had recently been boosted by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 93.558 by 12:36 AM ET (4:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 114.14.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7526 while the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 0.7190.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.3925 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.3817.
""It looks almost certain that the BOE will raise interest rates in November, perhaps again in December, as inflation could get out of control otherwise given a severe labor shortage,"" Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
""And globally we are likely to see rate hikes to curb inflation in many countries, which means the U.S. dollar is standing out less than before, in terms of rate hike expectations.""
Across the Atlantic, the Fed is widely expected to announce the beginning of asset tapering at its meeting in November 2021. However, it is not expected to begin interest rate hikes until 2022.
""It's as if the BoE is stealing the spotlight from the Fed as it looks likely to raise rates before the Fed. What could be the game-changer, though, is if the Fed is also jumping on the bandwagon of global rate hikes much sooner than expected,"" Ryobi Systems president of Financial algotech company Kyosuke Suzuki told Reuters.
Meanwhile, commodity currencies led gains against the dollar after oil prices climbed to their highest levels in many years. The Australian dollar was at a three-and-a-half-month high while its New Zealand counterpart hit a four-month peak.
""Given the massive rise in commodity prices, commodity-linked currencies will enjoy a tailwind,"" said Teppei Ino, senior currency strategist at MUFG Bank."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Wednesday as risk sentiment improved and as investors focused on rising commodity prices and when global central banks are likely to begin hiking interest rates to fend off persistently high inflation.
The greenback hit a one-year high against a basket of other currencies last week as market participants ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner than expected to quell rising price pressures.
Those bets have faded, however, while investors are pricing for even more aggressive rate increases in other countries and as commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian and Australian dollars outperform.
""When it comes to central banks, there's a lot of aggressive pricing out there,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto, noting that the market is likely overstating how quickly rate hikes will come.
The dollar index fell 0.24% to 93.57.
Rai expects the dollar may outperform if investors pare back rate hike expectations in other countries, though ""that's something that's going to take some time to correct.""
""When push comes to shove, given the underlying fundamentals in the United States, which are still very constructive for growth, we think the Fed is probably going to be the central bank that raises rates over the course of the coming years at a bit of a more aggressive clip than the market is pricing in now,"" Rai said.
Market participants are pricing for the Fed to raise rates twice by the end of 2022.
Fed Governor Randal Quarles on Wednesday said that while it is time for the Fed to begin dialing down its bond-buying program, it would be premature to start raising interest rates in the face of high inflation that is likely to recede next year.
The Fed also said in its latest Beige Book that the U.S. economy grew at a ""modest to moderate"" rate in September and early October, as the latest surge of COVID-19 cases crested and began to recede.
ING FX strategists said in a client note that the dollar's recent decline could be due to a combination of markets closing long-dollar positions and ""a benign risk environment, where a strong U.S. earnings season has continued to offset inflation/monetary tightening concerns.""
""At this stage, it looks like the dollar is lacking some catalysts to contain the ongoing correction, and any support to the greenback may need to come from a cool-off in the recent risk-on mood in markets,"" ING said.
The Australian dollar, seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, gained 0.60% on the day to $0.7522, the highest since July 7.
The New Zealand dollar rose 0.73% to $0.7205, the highest since June 11.
Reduced demand for safe-haven assets saw the dollar hit a four-year high of 114.67 versus the yen overnight, before retracing to 114.27.
The Canadian dollar was higher on the day after the country's annual inflation rate accelerated to an 18-year high in September, putting the focus on the Bank of Canada ahead of a rate decision next week.
The greenback dropped 0.35% against the loonie to CAD$1.2317.
The British pound gained 0.30% in the day to $1.3831 after data showed that British inflation slowed unexpectedly last month. The figures did little to change expectations that the Bank of England will become the world's first major central bank to raise rates.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin hit a record high of $67,017, a day after the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading.

Investing.com — Canadian CPI  data came in above expectations Wednesday, sending the USD/CADto its lowest level in three months.
The monthly CPI came in at 0.2%, above the 0.1% consensus while the yearly was reported at 4.4% against the expected 4.3%. The yearly rate was at an almost two-decade high. 
Speaking to Bloomberg, Derek Holt, an economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said he believes the Bank of Canada will raise its benchmark rate on four occasions in the second half of 2022 and an additional four times the next year as the inflation Canada is seeing isn't transitory.
Canada's rates are currently at 0.25%, and the inflation number may cause the BoC to rethink its rate plan. 
With the USDCAD sliding to a three-month low of 1.2307 on Wednesday, traders look to be betting that the central bank will be forced into raising rates earlier than expected, much like we have seen with the GBP and Bank of England. "

Investing.com -- The dollar consolidated at lower levels in early trade in Europe on Wednesday, after a sharp two-day drop driven by signs of weakening economic activity in the U.S.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index that measures the greenback against a handful of advanced economic currencies was at 93.765, effectively unchanged from late Tuesday but down over half a percent since the end of last week.
On Tuesday, fresh data had pointed to a further cooling-off in the U.S. housing market, with building permits and housing starts both falling. That came on top of industrial production data on Monday that showed U.S. factories increasingly struggling with supply chain issues.
As a result, investors have trimmed expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve next year, having started to put some punchy bets on such a move in previous weeks.
The dollar has weakened in the last two days particularly against currencies where near-term interest rate hikes are more of a certainty. It lost another 0.1% against the New Zealand dollar to $1.3952, although it bounced by a modest 0.1% against sterling to trade at $1.3779.
Sterling failed to get any support from September inflation data released earlier, which showed a slowdown in monthly rates of both consumer and producer prices. The annual consumer price index came in a 3.1%, rather than the 3.2% expected.
The euro, by contrast, received more of a boost from another sharp rise in German producer prices, which added to suspicions that the European Central Bank is starting to fall behind the curve with regard to inflation.
Germany’s PPI rose by 2.5% on the month, and by 14.2% on the year, its fastest increase in over 10 years. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics pointed out, however, that by far the greatest component of the increase was energy prices, and noted that the monthly pace of core price increases was slowing.
In Asia, the dollar had enjoyed another strong session against the yen, where expectations of relative near-term interest rate dynamics are still in the dollar’s favor. The greenback hit a four-year high of 114.71 before retracing a little.
In China, it managed a modest bounce against the yuan after falling to its lowest in over four months on Tuesday. The People’s Bank of China kept its prime loan rate unchanged at a regular policy meeting earlier, having also chosen not to cut its reserve requirement ratio last week."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will watch currency movements carefully as exchange rate stability is important, a top government official said on Wednesday, after the yen hit a four-year low against the dollar.
The dollar has gained 4.6% against the yen since its latest low hit in mid-September, amid growing bets that the United States will soon start unwinding pandemic-era policy, while Japan looks poised to keep interest rates low for some time.
The dollar earlier climbed as high as 114.585 yen for the first time since November 2017.
""Currency stability is extremely important, so we'll continue to watch market moves carefully,"" Yoshihiko Isozaki, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a news conference, when asked about the yen's fall.
But he declined to comment on specific levels.
Japanese policymakers typically favour a weak yen, as it gives exports a competitive advantage overseas.
But the yen's recent decline, coupled with rising energy prices, has heightened concern over higher costs for households and retailers still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.
The pain on consumers bodes ill for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's efforts to distribute more wealth to households, a pledge he made ahead of a lower house election on Oct. 31.
""For consumers, a weak yen aggravates the pain from higher commodity costs. It's particularly damaging for low-income households,"" said Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
With oil prices spiking to seven-year highs, Kishida said on Monday Japan, which imports all but a tiny amount of its energy needs, will urge global oil producers to increase output.
Markets are focusing on what Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will say about the recent yen moves at his briefing scheduled after the bank's policy meeting next week.
Some analysts see 125 yen against the dollar as Kuroda's line-in-the-sand, a level marked in 2015 when he warned the yen's real, effective rate was ""unlikely to fall further.""

If oil and the dollar/yen stay around current levels for a year, core consumer inflation will accelerate to near 1% - below the BOJ's 2% target but high enough to hurt households, said Kono of BNP Paribas. Core consumer prices were flat in August from a year earlier, halting a 12-month run of declines on higher energy costs.
""For Japanese households who have barely seen income rise, this could turn into a big political problem and affect monetary policy down the road,"" he said.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with U.S. bonds impacting currencies. The dollar and yen also came under pressure from a global shares rally that decreased demand for safe-haven assets.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 93.703 by 12:28 AM ET (4:29 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.13% to 114.50.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.36% to 0.7499 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7161.
The USD/CNY pair fell 0.72% to 6.3826, with China keeping its loan prime rate steady at 3.85%. The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3811.
""The move in equities has seen the dollar and yen shunned,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""It's really just pick a yen cross and see the 'rip your face off' move. This is a momentum play here and timing the pullback in yen crosses is key, but it doesn't feel like we're going to see a rush to cover yen shorts anytime soon in this dynamic.""
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a fresh five-month high at 1.6630%, with higher long-term U.S. yields attracting Japanese investors. However, two-year yields hovered around 0.4050% after a sharp retreat from Monday's 19-month high of 0.4480%, an indication of decreasing bets for early interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
""Risk sentiment remains in the ascendancy,"" while ""a fall-back in front-end U.S. yields, so symptomatic of a slight paring back in expectations for when Fed rates 'lift-off' might occur,"" dealt the dollar a double-whammy, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
At the same time, markets are coming to ""the highly belated realization that whether the Fed raises its interest rate in 2022 or not until later, other central banks are getting in ahead of them... with the Bank of England likely next cab off the rank as early as next month,"" the note added.
Meanwhile, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday that U.S. labor shortages could outlast COVID-19 and limit overall economic growth unless the U.S. improves education, health, and childcare policies to boost the number of people willing and able to work."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses on Tuesday as Treasury yields climbed but remained lower on the day as other currencies, including sterling, were boosted by expectations of sooner-than-previously expected interest rate hikes.
The greenback reached a one-year high against a basket of other currencies last week as Treasury yields surged and as investors bet the Federal Reserve may need to increase rates to address stubbornly high inflation.
Yields appeared to stabilize on Tuesday, before grinding higher again, with benchmark 10-year yields reaching more than three-month highs. 
The dollar’s move lower on Tuesday was likely exaggerated by technical factors as investors unloaded long positions.
“The movement in rates hardly explains the extent of the USD drop,” analysts at Scotiabank said in a report. “Rather, it seems USD long liquidation has snowballed into a broader clear out of positioning, triggering a technical reversal in the USD generally,” they said.
The dollar also dipped after data showed that U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labor, supporting expectations that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday that U.S. labor shortages may outlast the coronavirus pandemic and limit overall economic growth unless the country comes up with better education, health and childcare policies to boost the number of people willing and able to work.
The dollar index against a basket of other currencies was last down 0.22% on the day at 93.73, after earlier dropping to 93.50, the lowest since Sept. 28. 
The euro gained 0.25% to $1.1640.
Currencies, including sterling and the New Zealand dollar, are benefiting from rising interest rate increase expectations.
The British pound rose 0.51% to $1.3798 as money markets priced in a cumulative 35 basis points in rate hikes by the end of the year.
New Zealand's dollar jumped 1.14% to $0.7159 after data on Monday showed the fastest consumer-price inflation in more than a decade.
It earlier rose to $0.7172, the highest since June 11.
Britain and New Zealand have led a rise in short-term bond yields, with short-dated yields climbing comparatively more than in the United States.
The Aussie rose to $0.7485, the highest since July 15, shrugging off dovish minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's last meeting.
The yuan hit a four-month high as fears about contagion from property giant China Evergrande's debt troubles receded and some of its peers made bond coupon payments. Policymakers said late last week the situation was controllable.
The offshore yuan strengthened to as much as 6.3674 per dollar, the strongest since June 1.
Bitcoin rose to $63,789 as the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading, the highest since April when it set a record high of $64,895.

Investing.com -- The dollar traded mostly lower in early dealings in Europe on Tuesday, ahead of what is set to be a quiet day dominated by U.S. corporate earnings and sentiment.
By 3 AM ET (0700 AM GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies was down 0.3% at 93.64%, after falling by the same amount already on Monday.
Most of the greenback’s losses were against commodity and emerging currencies, with the kiwi still surging after higher-than-expected September inflation figures brought the prospect of more aggressive interest rate hikes into play on Monday. Commodities in general remain red-hot, with copper, tin, crude oil and coal all trading at significant premiums for immediate delivery relative to futures markets. The Russian ruble rose to its highest since July 2020, while both the kiwi and Aussie rose over 0.7%.
However, the euro also rose by 0.3% to $1.1648, its highest in three weeks, while sterling – another currency supported by shifting interest rate expectations rose to a two-month high of $1.3775.
The dollar was undercut by a drop in U.S. bond yields, which have turned down after failing to breach their June high during last week’s inflation scare. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield was down 1 basis point at 1.57%, in the wake of data on Monday showing a drop in U.S. industrial production in September. 
The data calendar for Tuesday is relatively light, with only housing starts and building permit numbers out of the U.S.  Instead, the day is filled with speeches from central bankers, including the Federal Reserve’s Mary Daly, Michelle Bowman, Chris Waller and, inevitably, Raphael Bostic. In Europe, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, BoE chief economist Catherine Mann and European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane are both due to appear.
Hungary’s central bank is expected to raise its key interest rate later for the fifth meeting in a row, by another 15 basis points to 1.80%. The forint is testing a three-month low against the euro at 360.56, one of a handful of central and eastern currencies that have been forced into an early tightening of monetary policy by rising inflation."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, remaining near the bottom of its recent range. Weaker-than-expected U.S. factory data and increasing bets that monetary policy will normalize faster in other countries also contributed to the U.S. currency’s losses.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.23% to 93.727 by 11:44 PM ET (3:44 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 114.14.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.50% to 0.7447, with the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's September meeting released earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.55% to 0.7122.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.25% to 6.4127 and the GBP/USD pair was up 0.30% to 1.3767.
The dollar has stayed in a range between 93.671 and a one-year high of 94.563 hit last Tuesday for the past three weeks. However, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset tapering in November and a first interest-rate increase in 2022 already priced in, the dollar has been on a downward trend.
""The sense that 'transitory' inflation will last longer than previously thought has been the main catalyst"" as ""the market re-calibrated rate hike expectations in most jurisdictions,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
However, the U.S. is likely to be insulated by energy market bottleneck that is ""casting an ongoing cloud over rebound prospects in Europe and China,"" which ""should leave yield spreads at the front end continuing to drift in the dollar's favour,"" with pullbacks in the dollar index limited to 93.70, the note added.
Data released on Monday in the U.S. showed that industrial production contracted 1.3% month-on-month and grew a smaller-than-expected 4.6% year-on-year, in September.
""Our strong dollar forecast published in early July reflected, among other things, U.S. economic outperformance, but the dollar's drivers may be changing,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joseph Capurso said in a note.
""The spike in global inflation and interest rates may support the dollar as a safe haven if short-term interest rates price in a global monetary tightening cycle that it so strong it forces equities to correct lower,"" with evidence of that scenario likely seen in a decline in USD/JPY and AUD/JPY, the note added."
647,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China is marketing a dollar bond sale in Hong Kong for the fifth straight year, even as strains emerge in the credit market amid deepening concerns over the financial health of the country’s property developers. 
The Ministry of Finance said Sept. 30 it would sell a combined $4 billion of dollar bonds through a 4-tranche deal, less than last year’s $6 billion sale. A person familiar with the matter said Tuesday that initial price guidance is as follows, with premiums over Treasuries lower than the initial indications on last year’s deal: 
The debt offering will be a test of investor sentiment at a time when China-specific risks have flared. A regulatory clampdown on the nation’s real estate sector and a debt crisis at major developer China Evergrande Group future have sent shock waves through the country’s credit markets. 
Yields on dollar junk bonds recently soared to their highest in a decade at 20%, according to a Bloomberg index, as investors price in increasing default risk for some Chinese borrowers. Still, demand has historically been strong for China’s sovereign debt offerings, which carry investment-grade ratings. And a flood of cash from central banks since the pandemic has cut financing costs for many borrowers around the world.  
China made a comeback to the dollar bond market in 2017 after a 13-year hiatus. It’s since been an annual visitor and met with strong demand. It sold a combined $17 billion of the debt through 2020, as well as 8 billion euros ($9.3 billion) of bonds in that currency since 2019.
This year’s sale continues its reach to institutional U.S. investors. The Ministry of Finance broadened the breadth of potential buyers last year with China’s debut issuance of so-called 144A notes.
There was no immediate reply from the ministry to a fax from Bloomberg News seeking comments on the bond offering.

Investing.com -- On Monday, the pound dipped against most other major currencies, notwithstanding hawkish talk from the BoE and banks saying they see a hike in rates as likely in November.
Sterling slipped 0.12% against the dollar to $1.3728 heading into the U.S. close, despite hawkish comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey over the weekend, who said they “will have to act” as energy prices drive consumer costs higher.
The EURGBP gained 0.35%, climbing to 0.8456.
Some of the biggest banks in the world are following investor predictions in believing the BoE will raise rates before the end of 2021, following Bailey's comments. 
JPMorgan economist Allan Monks said Bailey is ""trying to signal a swifter near-term response"" and that he sees rates moving to 0.25% in November and then to 0.75% next August. 
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs sees three hikes, taking interest rates to 0.75% by May, before climbing to 1% by the end of 2022. 
Whatever happens, it seems investors are fully pricing in hikes, with the GBPUSD climbing from a low of around 1.34 at the end of September to its current price of about 1.3730.
However, economists are concerned that the central bank is moving too fast, with some stating that the current inflation emerging from supply chain issues and increased energy prices is temporary. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Monday after data showed production at U.S. factories fell by the most in seven months in September, erasing earlier gains on expectations that the Federal Reserve may be closer to raising interest rates than previously expected.
U.S. manufacturing output was hurt https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-manufacturing-output-declines-september-2021-10-18 as an ongoing global shortage of semiconductors depressed motor vehicle output, providing further evidence that supply constraints were hampering economic growth.
Supply disruptions are adding to concerns about high inflation and adding to expectations that the U.S. central bank will need to act to stamp out price increases.
""Prospects for global central banks to be more aggressive to counter growing inflation fears may put the USD under some pressure, though the Fed in turn may act sooner than previously expected, supportive of the dollar,"" said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis, at Action Economics.
The dollar fell 0.02% to 93.95 against a basket of currencies. It had earlier reached 94.17 as U.S. Treasury yields increased.
The New Zealand dollar gained after data showed that the country faced its highest price pressures in a decade.
It was last at $0.7081, after earlier rising to a one-month high of $0.7105.
Sterling briefly hit a 20-month high against the euro after Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey sent a fresh signal that the central bank was gearing up to raise interest rates as inflation risks mount.
The euro was last up 0.24% against the British pound at 0.8455, after earlier falling as low as 0.8427.
The euro rose 0.11% to $1.1610, after earlier dropping to $1.1570. It has fallen 5% this year.
Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) noted on Monday that commodity-linked currencies, including the Norwegian krone and the Canadian and Australian dollars, had been the best performers since the summer as energy prices rise, while the euro and the yen had been the worst.
The yen was close to a new three-year low, with the dollar last up 0.01% at 114.27 yen, close to Friday's 114.46 level that was last hit in October 2018.

Investing.com -- The dollar opened the week higher on a fresh bout of global risk aversion as data showed the Chinese economy slowed by more than expected in the third quarter.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies was up 0.2% at 94.15, with its biggest gains against commodity currencies such as the Aussie, and against the Korean won.
Figures out of Beijing indicated that gross domestic product growth slowed to only 4.9% in the quarter, thanks to a wave of Delta-variant Covid-19 that forced the country into its most aggressive lockdowns since early 2020.
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang was reported as saying that the risks from the slowdown were controllable, but the numbers provoked fresh unease, with investors mindful of the ongoing credit crisis in the real estate sector, which accounts for a greater share of business investment than any other in the world’s second-largest economy.
Analysts at Nordea said in a note to clients that China remains well on track to meet its official growth target of 6% over the full year, helped by soft base effects and a strong first half to the year.
“However, the reasons behind the weak development are not expected to disappear any time soon and there are a lot of downside risks to the growth forecasts for 2022,” analyst Tuuli Koivu said.
By 3 AM ET, the dollar was at 6.4360 yuan, little changed from Friday’s close, in a continuation of a pattern that suggests the PBoC is allowing little or no flexibility in the exchange rate at a time of elevated uncertainty.
In Europe, the dollar’s strength stopped sterling from gaining markedly on the back of Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey’s most hawkish comments yet on inflation.
Bailey told an audience of central bankers at the weekend that the rise in energy prices means that this year’s spike in inflation is likely to last for longer than expected, and that the Bank “will have to act” to keep inflation expectations under control. GBP/USD fell 0.1% to $1.3738, but the pound advanced against the euro to 1.1866, testing a 21-month high, as the comments cemented expectations of a first hike in the Bank's key rate before year-end.
The euro remained under pressure, as one of few major currencies where the central bank is still committed to not tightening monetary policy. By 3 AM ET, EUR/USD was at $1.1578, down 0.2% from Friday’s close.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia. Inflation data from New Zealand was higher than expected while data from China showed slower-than-expected economic growth. Hawkish comments from the Bank of England (BOE) governor also placed the possibility of interest rate hikes on investors’ radars.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.18% to 94.105 by 12:19 AM ET (4:19 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 114.36.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.7404. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7067. New Zealand’s consumer price index grew a higher-than-expected 4.9% year-on-year and 2.2% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4369. The yuan was firm in offshore trade, with Chinese data released earlier in the day said that the GDP grew 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and 4.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021. Industrial production grew 3.1% year-on-year, retail sales grew 4.4% year-on-year in September and the unemployment rate was at 4.9%.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3733.
The dollar fell around 0.6% from last week's 2021 highs, as investors increasingly bet that inflationary pressures could mean earlier-than-expected interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve but other central banks could be aggressive over the tightening cycle.
BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Sunday that surging energy prices would prolong a pulse in inflation and policymakers ""will have to act"" if they see risks.
""The rest of the world is probably outpacing the U.S. in inflation, for now, and it puts more pressure on those central banks than the U.S. one,"" Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
In New Zealand, the surprise leap in the CPI would only reinforce the need for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to keep its interest rate hike trajectory unchanged, he added.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin remained just below its record high of $64,895 and last bought $62,233. Bitcoin is viewed as an inflation hedge and hopes are high that the U.S. will approve a futures-based exchange-traded fund that would funnel cash into the sector."

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil central bank monetary policy director Bruno Serra said on Friday the bank expects pressures to devalue the real to ease next year and discussed forex intervention.
Serra said the bank has been intervening in the forex market since the end of September, having already sold $3.5 billion. The main reason for the real devaluation currently, according to Serra, is the risk to fiscal sustainability.
He also mentioned that over the last two years, Brazilian companies have been repaying foreign debt, and that reduced normal levels of inflows. Serra expects this movement to end next year with around $20 billion in annual inflows. That would reduce the devaluation pressure over the real.
Serra said Brazilian investors sending their savings abroad to diversify investments have also weighed on the forex market. The central bank director said Brazilians send around $600 million a month abroad to invest, and the accumulated volume has reached $12 billion.

Serra also said he expects the real to rise against the dollar over the next months as liquidity improves and investors begin to react to higher interest rate differentials after recent Brazilian interest rate hikes to fight inflation.
Separately, Brazil's central bank said on Friday it will offer $500 million in currency swaps at an extraordinary auction on Monday, half the amount it has been offering in similar sales this week to prop up the real.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged lower against a basket of major currencies on Friday, on track to end its five-week winning streak, as global risk appetite rebounded, helping reduce demand for the safe-haven currency.
Global stock markets have rallied this week as fears about a stagflationary economy have been eased by forecast-beating corporate earnings in the United States.
Unexpectedly strong U.S. retail sales data for September also boosted sentiment. Retail sales rose 0.7% last month, versus expectations of a 0.2% decline, helped in part by higher prices. 
""The risk appetite here remains really, really strong for the time being,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management.
""That's helping the high beta currencies like the pound, the euro and the Aussie, simply because the market is feeling much more positive,"" he said.
The dollar index initially firmed after the retail sales data, but then trended lower and was last down 0.106% at 93.941. The greenback was down 0.19% for the week, after having appreciated for the previous five weeks, and hitting a one-year high of 94.563 on Tuesday.
The big run-up in dollar strength, based on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may begin hiking rates sooner than had been anticipated, may have been overblown, and the dollar is now consolidating, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
""Next week will help clarify whether we are consolidating, and whether the consolidation is just like a breath that refreshes or is a prelude for a correction,"" he said.
The greenback had rallied against its major peers since early September on expectations the U.S. central bank would tighten monetary policy more quickly than previously expected amid an improving economy and surging energy prices.
Minutes of the Fed's September meeting confirmed this week that a tapering of stimulus is all but certain to start this year, although policymakers are sharply divided over inflation and what they should do about it.
Money markets are currently pricing in about 50/50 odds of a 25 basis point rate hike by July.
Sterling rose 0.57% to $1.3765, hitting its highest since Sept. 17, while the euro edged down 0.03% to $1.1595 after touching $1.1624 on Thursday for the first time since Sept. 4.
The risk-sensitive Aussie dollar added 0.02% to $0.7417, having climbed to $0.7439 earlier in the session. New Zealand's dollar jumped 0.54% to $0.7068, extending Thursday's 1% surge.

The Japanese yen was the biggest loser, dropping to as low as 114.46 yen per dollar, its weakest since October 2018. The yen is a safe-haven currency and has been knocked by the rebound in risk sentiment including in Asia. The dollar was last up 0.53% against the yen at 114.28 yen.
In cryptocurrency markets, the price of bitcoin topped $60,000 for the first time in six months and was not far from its record high on bets U.S. regulators will approve a bitcoin futures exchange traded fund.

Investing.com -- The dollar was slightly lower in early trade in Europe on Friday, after a strong rebound in risk appetite on Thursday supported higher-yielding currencies against safe havens.
By 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies was down less than 0.1% at 93.938, thanks mainly to declines against the basket’s commodity currencies.
USD/NZD was down 0.2% and USD/AUD and USD/CAD were both down 0.1%, a day after a slightly weaker-than-expected producer price inflation print and reasonably solid bank earnings triggered a sharp rise in U.S. stocks.
The EUR/USD also traded back above $1.16 for the first time in 10 days, while sterling was consolidating its Thursday gains at $1.3697, after rising strongly in reaction to progress on negotiations with the EU over implementing the Brexit agreement in the market of Northern Ireland.
The week is set to end on a reasonably relaxed note as inflation fears recede a little. Yields on benchmark 10-Year Treasury bonds are back at 1.54%, some eight basis points below their highs earlier this week.
However, the factors behind inflation – including massive fiscal and monetary stimulus that has led to higher energy prices and shortages of semiconductors and other components – are taking time to unwind. Analysts pointed out that the slight undershoot in the PPI owed much to a - possibly short-lived - decline in airline prices. Prices for crude oil, natural gas and other industrial commodities continue to trade near multi-year highs, and there are increasing signs of organized labor demanding higher pay rises (notably at U.S. agricultural equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co.).
Richmond Federal Reserve President Tom Barkin said on Thursday that there would be “no shame” in admitting that inflation is proving ‘stickier’ than expected – comments taken by some as a veiled criticism of a Fed board that has stuck doggedly to the narrative that this year’s rise in prices is only ‘transitory’.
The day’s main data will be U.S. retail sales at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), where a decline of 0.2% on the month is expected, extending a pattern of stop-start consumption that has established itself over the last six months. Attention will also be given to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment index for September at 10 AM ET, especially with regard to its inflation expectations. Last month’s survey showed consumers expect prices to rise 4.6% over the next 12 months, down from a 10-year high of 4.7% in July.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Currency stability is ""very important"" and Japan's government will scrutinise the economic impact from the foreign exchange moves, Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Friday, as the yen slid to its lowest level since late 2018.
The dollar rose to a near-three-year high against the yen at 113.885 yen on Friday before the minister's comments, partly on expectations inflation risks could prod the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected. It remained near that level in early afternoon trading.
Later Friday, the dollar touched 114.075 yen for the first time since December of 2018.
""Stability in currencies is very important,"" Suzuki told a news conference. ""We will continue to closely watch currency market moves and their impact on the economy.""
While a weak yen pushes up import costs for some firms and consumers, it helps exporters, he said.
Japanese policymakers tend to fire off verbal warnings against an unwelcome yen rises, which could threaten to derail export-reliant Japanese economy, the world's third largest.
In September, Japan's wholesale inflation hit a 13-year high as rising global commodity prices and a weak yen pushed up import costs, putting pressure on corporate margins and raising the risk of unwanted consumer price hikes.
""I was a bit surprised at the minister's remark, which gave an impression that he was concerned about a weak yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""He probably wanted to signal a message that a weak yen doesn't make everything rosy as he needed to show a sympathy towards consumers facing higher import costs ahead of elections.""
That said, no one in the market expected the government to respond to the yen moves at this stage via measures such as intervening through yen-buying, he added.
Japan has stayed away from intervening in the currency market since 2011 when devastating earthquakes and subsequent Fukushima nuclear crisis triggered a spike in a safe-haven yen.

Economy Minister Daishiro Yamagiwa said ""there's no doubt"" that rising fuel costs would affect resource-deficient Japan's economy.
However, Yamagiwa declined to comment on the economic impacts of a weak yen, saying that commenting on currencies in his capacity could ""cause problems"".

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, set for its first weekly decline since the start of September. It retreated from a one-year high as investors focus on when the U.S. Federal Reserve will start to hike interest rates.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 93.938 by 12:54 AM ET (4:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.27% to 113.97.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7420 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.28% to 0.7055.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.4356 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 1.3687.
Improving risk sentiment, which boosted global stocks, commodity prices, and bond yields, also weighing on the safe-haven dollar. It only maintained the momentum of the past five weeks against the yen, its fellow safe haven.
""We end the week with risk flying. Equities are going up hard, and the yen has no place as a hedge,"" because it would just drag on overall portfolio performance, Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
The U.S. currency had rallied since early September 2021 on expectations the Fed would begin asset tapering earlier than expected as the economic recovery from COVID-19 continues and energy prices continue to climb.
Minutes from the central bank’s latest meeting that took place on Wednesday said that that asset tapering is likely to begin in November 2021 but that officials remain sharply divided over inflation. Money markets are now pricing in about 50/50 odds of a 25-basis point rate hike by July 2022.
The dollar index is ""looking a little shaky, but any slippage should prove modest"" with Fed asset tapering now imminent, Westpac strategists said in a note. Any dips in the index should be limited to 93.70, the note added.
U.S. data, including retail sales as well as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment and Michigan consumer expectations indexes, will be released later in the day.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar was slightly lower on Thursday in choppy trading, having erased most of its early session losses, as investors bet the Federal Reserve would begin tapering its asset purchases next month and attention turned to the timing of interest rate hikes.
The greenback had rallied since early September on expectations the U.S. central bank would tighten monetary policy more quickly than previously expected amid an improving economy and surging inflation.
But the dollar reversed course on Wednesday, even after the minutes of the Fed's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting confirmed the tapering of stimulus is likely to start this year and data showed that pricing pressures were still hitting U.S. consumers.
""I think what we've seen over the last day or two is a little bit of profit-taking,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotia Capital.
""I don't think this is, at the moment, anything close to a significant reversal in the dollar trend, and in fact, I think what we've seen today might be a sign that the corrective rebound that we've seen over the past day or two has perhaps run its course,"" he said.
The market is expecting that the Fed will begin tapering its asset purchases as early as next month, and that the wind-down of the massive bond-buying program will happen fairly quickly, Osborne added. 
""That seems to be advancing to some extent towards when and how quickly the Fed is going to raise interest rates, so that's another potential positive for the dollar,"" he said.
At 3:25 p.m. EDT, the dollar index was down 0.036% at 93.982, having climbed back from a 10-day low of 93.754 earlier in the session. On Tuesday, the greenback hit a one-year high of 94.563.
The euro was flat against the dollar, at $1.15955, falling from a nine-day high reached overnight, while the British pound was up 0.15% against the dollar, at $1.36815.
A return in risk appetite may also have dented demand for the safe-haven greenback, with U.S. equity markets notching solid gains on upbeat earnings, said Vassili Serebriakov, FX and macro strategist at UBS.
Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell sharply last week to the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
In another report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose, but the increase was less than economists polled by Reuters expected, both on a monthly and a year-on-year basis.
The Australian dollar, which is seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, was up 0.47% versus the dollar at $0.7414, its highest level since Sept. 7. 

The New Zealand dollar also rose, up 0.93% at $0.7030, its highest mark in 2-1/2 weeks.
Elsewhere, the cryptocurrency bitcoin was up 0.13% at $57,451. It hit a five-month high of $58,550 earlier in the session.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan dismissed three central bank policymakers on Thursday, two of whom were seen to oppose the last interest rate cut, clearing the way for more policy easing and sending the lira to a new all-time low. 
Analysts viewed the move - announced at midnight in the Official Gazette - as fresh evidence of political interference by Erdogan, a self-described enemy of interest rates who frequently calls for monetary stimulus.
With no explanation for the decision, Erdogan fired deputy governors Semih Tumen and Ugur Namik Kucuk, along with the longest-serving monetary policy committee (MPC) member, Abdullah Yavas, the gazette said.
He appointed two new members - Taha Cakmak as a deputy and also Yusuf Tuna - who are little known at the central bank or among economists, leaving the MPC with little monetary policy experience after a years-long overhaul by the president. 
Two sources familiar with internal deliberations said Kucuk and Yavas were ousted after disagreeing with last month's 100 basis-point rate cut, which at the time surprised investors and sent the currency tumbling. 
Soon after the announcement the lira weakened to a record low against the dollar, before paring its losses during the day. However it hit a fresh all-time low of 9.1950 at 1444 GMT.
The currency has shed some 19% this year, primarily due to the central bank's bruised credibility and worries among investors and savers over premature rate cuts in the face of inflation that has risen to nearly 20%.
""The lira has lost its institutional support in recent years ... and last night's changes strongly indicate that the central bank is no longer capable of managing Turkey's monetary policy,"" said Arda Tunca, economist at Eko Faktoring.
The combination of monetary policy and financial regulations have left the ""Turkish economy extremely fragile,"" he added.
Last month the central bank cut its policy rate to 18% as Erdogan - sliding in opinion polls and keen to boost credit and exports - had publicly sought. Most analysts called the easing a mistake at a time of accelerating global inflation.
TURNAROUND
The MPC overhaul came after the presidency said on Wednesday evening that Erdogan had met Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu and it published a photo of the two men together.
That marked a turnaround from last week when Reuters reported, citing three sources, that Erdogan was losing confidence in Kavcioglu and that the two had communicated little in recent weeks. 
Though the MPC has seen a rapid turnover this year, Kavcioglu pushed for changes in recent days, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter. 
""Kavcioglu sort of cleared the path to be able to cut rates more quickly with the new members,"" the person said. Now, those who were distant towards rate cuts have been removed.""
Erdogan named Kavcioglu governor in March.
In just over two years, Erdogan has abruptly fired three bank governors over policy differences, a dizzying display of political interference that badly hit the bank's credibility and predictability.
""Firing central bank officials in the middle of the night without a very good explanation is not how you build central bank credibility or bolster market confidence,"" one foreign investor said on Thursday.
Turkey's headline inflation hit a 2-1/2 year high of 19.58% in September, while a core measure - which Kavcioglu has been stressing over the last month - was 16.98%. 
INTERNAL OPPOSITION
Addressing a parliamentary committee this week, Kavcioglu said September's rate cut was not a surprise and had little to do with the subsequent lira sell-off. 
The bank's next policy-setting meeting is on Oct. 21, when another rate cut is seen as likely. 
Market reaction to Thursday's changes included a jump in the premium demanded by investors to hold Turkish debt over safe haven U.S. Treasuries, based on the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) EMBI Global Diversified index. It hit 521 basis points, the highest since April, leaving spreads above those of Ukraine and Kenya.
The second source who spoke to Reuters said both Kucuk and Yavas - who missed September's policy meeting - had opposed some recent bank decisions.
Kucuk also opposed an unorthodox policy in 2019-2020 of using the bank's forex reserves to support the lira via state bank sales, the person said, adding that Kucuk had warned the MPC that failing to keep rates high enough now only leads to even higher rates in the future. 
Cakmak, the new deputy governor, was a deputy chairman at Turkey's BDDK banking watchdog from 2019. Previously he held posts at state lender Ziraat Bank, including head of human resources. 

Tuna, the other MPC hire, was a professor and also served as management board member at the BDDK from 2003-2009. 
""It can be assumed that the newly appointed members of the central bank committee will support Kavcioglu's and Erdogan's monetary policy,"" said Antje Praefcke, analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""That is not a good omen for the Turkish lira."" 
 
"
660,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 05:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira risks falling out of favor with local investors, compounding a depreciation that’s dragged the currency to successive record lows over the past month.
So far, they’ve helped take the edge off the rout, selling more than $5 billion of their foreign-currency deposits in the three weeks through Oct. 1, according to central bank data. While the numbers can get amplified by changes in exchange rates, the headline figure is still the biggest draw down in half a year.
Now, with the prospect of another interest-rate cut looming large after the ouster of three key policy makers on Wednesday night, the fear is that households and companies may begin switching back into dollars and euros.
“The FX sales could quickly turn into FX purchases, creating extra pressure on the Turkish lira,” said Onur Ilgen, the head of the treasury at MUFG Bank Turkey in Istanbul, noting that recent foreign-currency sales were motivated by profit-taking.
Residents hold $233 billion of foreign currency, equivalent to around half of all deposits. While they’re nibble traders -- buying dollars when the lira is strong and selling when it’s weak -- over the longer-term they tend to accumulate hard currency. 
It’s a hedge against the inflation that’s debased the lira and eroded their savings. The Turkish currency is on track for its ninth straight year of depreciation, having lost more than 80% of its value since the end of 2012, the most in the developing world after the Argentine peso. 
“If locals become more concerned about the effects of lower interest rates on the lira, there is room for Turks to switch more deposits from liras into dollars,” said Nick Stadtmiller, director of EM at Medley Global Advisors in New York.
Surprise Cuts 
Last month, the central bank unexpectedly reduced interest rates to 18%, even with inflation running just shy of 20%. Investors say policy makers are falling in line with Erdogan’s call for lower interest rates while ignoring the risks to the outlook.
Speculation is building that the president is now paving the way for another cut after he fired three members of the central bank’s interest-rate setting committee in a midnight decree.

Which side of the trade residents decide to take over the coming days and weeks also matters because foreign investors have already exited the market. They now hold less than 5% of the local-currency government debt stock, down from close to 30% in 2013.
“I think the downside risk for the lira with easier monetary policy is through domestic flows – not foreign outflows,” Stadtmiller said.
One redeeming factor for the lira is that a credit growth is slowing, which should help narrow the current-account deficit, reducing demand for foreign exchange in Turkey, according to Evren Kirikoglu, an Istanbul-based independent strategist.
Data on Monday showed the economy posted its first monthly surplus since Oct. 2020. 
But even then, with the lira breaching the psychologically important 9-per-dollar mark this week, local investors could “stop and even reverse” their foreign-currency purchases, Kirikoglu said.

Investing.com -- The dollar eased against high-yielding currencies but advanced against the yen in early European trading on Thursday, as the market absorbed the implications of Wednesday higher-than-expected inflation data out of the U.S.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index  that tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market economies was down 0.1% at 93.995, trading below 94 for the first time this week as sterling and the Canadian, Aussie and New Zealand dollars all advanced.
The dollar’s only notable gains were against the yen, where it rose another 0.3% to 113.53, supported by ever stronger expectations of a widening interest rate differential with Japan.
The U.S. inflation rate hit a fresh 13-year high of 5.3% in September while core inflation stayed at 4.0% thanks only to a sharp drop in air fares. Three senior Federal Reserve officials – Raphael Bostic, Mary Daly and Thomas Barkin – will have the opportunity to give their two cents’ worth on the developments in the course of the day. Minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting, released on Wednesday, cemented expectations that the Fed will announce the start of the withdrawal of stimulus at next month.
U.S. weekly jobless claims, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) head the day's economic calendar.
In emerging markets, the dollar surged to a new record high of 9.1872 against the Turkish lira, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired three deputy central bank governors, further undermining its independence and anti-inflation credibility. The dismissals included the only member of the CBRT’s  decision-making council to vote against its shock interest rate cut in September, which happened against a backdrop of near-20% inflation.
The Chinese yuan edged lower after producer price inflation rose to a 26-year high at 10.7% in September, above expectations. China is one of few countries for whom an easing of monetary policy is on the table as it grapples with an ongoing credit crunch in real estate. The official yuan fixing of 6.4414 was the highest in nearly a month.
Further inflationary pressure is in the pipeline for China’s factories after the government allowed industrial electricity prices to rise to ease the pressure on the country’s utilities earlier this week.  
The Chilean peso came off a 17-month low against the dollar after the country’s central bank raised its key rate by a chunky 125 basis points to 2.75%, more than the 100 basis point rise expected."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell from its one-year high on Wednesday as longer-dated Treasury yields dipped after U.S. inflation data showed prices rose solidly last month, while the minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting confirm tapering will begin ""soon."" 
The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month versus a 0.3% rise anticipated by economists polled by Reuters. Year-over-year, the CPI increased 5.4%, up from 5.3% in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core CPI climbed 0.2% last month versus 0.1% in August.
Yields on shorter-term Treasuries, which typically move in tandem with interest rate expectations, increased after the report, while longer-dated yields dipped, indicating the market is still not pricing in a sustained period of inflation. [US/]
The gap between the two- and 10-year Treasury notes closed to its narrowest in two weeks after having widened to a 3-1/2-month high on Friday.
""The market is now seeing a major pivot here as far as how inflation is showing more signs of being persistent than transitory, and that's likely to force the Fed's hand to deliver a rate hike well in advance of what people were anticipating,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
The market had been pricing in a rate hike for December 2022, but now it is eyeing September of that year, he said.
The greenback initially moved higher after the CPI data, touching a nearly three-year high versus the Japanese yen, before edging lower along with the longer-dated bond yields.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was last down 0.515% at 94.036 from Tuesday, when it touched 94.563, its highest since late September 2020.

""Tapering is baked in the cake,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.
""The bigger question is will the inflation dynamics lead them to be more aggressive and quicker in raising interest rates? So interest liftoff now becomes the big focus for the markets, and that's where we're really seeing price action along the yield curve,"" she said.

Investing.com — The dollar slide continued Wednesday following consumer price index data that showed a continued rise in prices, increasing market expectations for a potential rate hike. 
The inflation rate for September was reported at 0.4%, coming in above the expected 0.3% figure. The year-on-year inflation rate rose to 5.4%, again beating expectations of 5.3%.
The news has seen the dollar weaken against all of the other major currencies on Wednesday, with the dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of foreign currencies, falling over 0.4% and moving lower from the 13-month high it posted earlier this week.
At the time of writing, the major FX pairs show the AUD/USD, which is closely linked to commodities, trading 0.37% above Tuesday's close. XAU/USD has climbed close to 2%.
The GBP/USD has posted a 0.44% gain, despite issues surrounding Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol.
The euro is up over 0.5% against the greenback, retracing significantly since it fell to 15-month lows. 
Elsewhere, the USD/CAD is down 0.18%, the USD/CHF is down 0.58%, the USD/JPY is down 0.16% and the NZD/USD is up 0.45%. Despite the minutes of the Federal Reserve's recent meeting showing the central bank could taper bond purchases in mid-November or mid-December, we have yet to see a strong reaction in the dollar crosses."
664,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 06:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Canadian dollar, Norwegian krone, and Russian ruble have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the sprint up in oil prices since August. The good news for investors betting on these currencies is that their sensitivity to the price of crude increases when oil trades between $80 and $100 per barrel.
The major crude exporters have shrugged off gains in the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, and their currencies have appreciated an average of 3% versus the greenback since the 3-month Brent contract broke above $70 per barrel.
Based on a Bloomberg study that controls for the effect of global stock prices and yields, the ruble appreciates by 2.3% when Brent moves from $80 to $100 per barrel, compared with a 1.6% gain when oil rose from $69 to $82. The sensitivity of the krone and Canadian dollar also increased, and the currencies appreciated by 2% and 1.3%, respectively, when oil moved in the higher range.   
The results are surprising, given that Russia and Norway use their sovereign wealth funds and central bank interventions to curb currency appreciation when oil revenues are elevated. Furthermore, each marginal oil dollar spent onshore should have less of an impact on the real economy and on yields.
Still, the U.S. oil balance has improved markedly since the last occasions when oil prices were in the $80-$100 range. That may mitigate the positive impact of oil prices on these currencies against the dollar -- although not against non-dollar rivals. On top of that, the recent run-up in oil prices has increased concerns about stagflation, and a larger risk-aversion shock would boost the dollar against all assets.

Investing.com -- The dollar weakened in early trade in Europe on Wednesday as markets regained their appetite for risk a little ahead of key inflation data later in the session.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index that measures the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies was down 0.2% at 94.362, only a little off the 13-month high it posted earlier in the week. USD/JPY was flat at 113.58. The dollar was also flat against the yuan, in the absence of major news out of China overnight.
The rate of consumer price inflation in the U.S. is expected to have stayed at 5.3% in September, with core price inflation staying at 4.0%. Any number in excess of that is likely to feed expectations that the Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates well before the end of next year.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic had signaled on Tuesday that belief in the narrative of only ‘transitory’ inflation pressures – something that has guided Fed policy for the last 12 months - may be fading at the central bank. Bostic said there were increasing signs that the disruptions to supply chains that have been responsible for a large part of this year’s inflation will be around for longer than previously expected.  
Inflation data out of Europe earlier failed to generate any sort of surprise however, neither positive nor negative. Industrial production data for the euro zone are also likely to be weak when they are released at 5 AM ET, given the poor numbers out of Germany last week.
As a result, EUR/USD stayed close to the 15-month low it hit overnight at $1.1549, weighed on by the comparatively remote prospect of monetary tightening in the single currency area.
Sterling, by contrast, edged up 0.1% against the dollar to $1.3605 and was flat near its recent high against the euro despite data showing that GDP disappointed in the three months through August.  The data still keep the pound on course for an interest rate hike before year-end, but it faces headwinds from a dispute with the European Union over the implementation of the Brexit agreement in Northern Ireland. The EU is due to present fresh proposals to lower the tension there later on Wednesday, while the Bank of England’s John Cunliffe speaks at 10:30 AM ET.
Concerns about the global growth outlook had been alleviated a little on Tuesday as the International Monetary Fund left its forecast for 2022 global GDP growth unchanged at 4.9%, although it cut its forecast for the current year marginally."

Three Fed officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, said on Tuesday that the U.S. economy has healed enough to begin to scale back the U.S. central bank's asset-purchase program. Money markets are now pricing about a 50-50 chance of a rate increase by July 2022.
Meanwhile, surging energy prices continue to fuel inflation concerns and increased bets that the Fed could normalize its monetary policy much sooner than planned, sending two-year Treasury yields to their highest levels in more than 18 months during the previous session.
Investors now await the U.S. consumer price index, due later in the day, for clues to the Fed’s interest rate hike timeline.
""CPI is the main economic draw"" and ""has the potential to see Fed rate hike expectations move again, one way or another,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.

Investing.com – The pound is unlikely to be rescued by the increasing odds of a Bank of England rate hike as the currency may struggle to escape the clutches of stagflation just as the impact of Brexit begins to emerge. 
GBP/USD was flat at $1.3594.
""GBP's fall from grace has been swift. Stagflation is the current buzzword which seems to be hitting UK harder than most,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said, according to Forexlive.
“Our concerns about structural Brexit headwinds have crystallised. 2022 could put even greater focus and pressure on GBP,"" BofA added as it maintained its bearish outlook on the GBP.
The malaise in the pound comes just days after the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey hinted at a sooner rather than later rate hike to stave off the threat of inflation spiralling out of control.
“[We] have got to in a sense prevent the thing becoming permanently embedded because that would obviously be very damaging,” BoE Governor Bailey said on Saturday.
The Bank of England has held off any clear signaling on tighter amid uncertainties over the labor market outlook but as signs emerge that the unemployment rate is unlikely to pick up steam in the near term, the door to a rate hike is widening.
“Bailey thought that a pickup in unemployment over the near term was now unlikely, a view that was seemingly supported by the record high vacancy-to-employee ratio in today's figures,” Daiwa Capital Markets said Tuesday.
“[T]here is certainly a non-negligible chance of a 15bps hike in Bank Rate (to 0.25%) at next month's MPC meeting, when the BoE will update its economic forecasts. And if that hike is not forthcoming, a clear signal of the likelihood of a hike before year-end might now seem more likely than not.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-year high on Tuesday on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce a tapering of its massive bond-buying program next month, and as concerns over soaring energy prices also sent investors to the safe-haven greenback. 
Yields on the U.S. two-year Treasury note jumped to their highest in more than 18 months, as investors sold U.S. debt, reckoning that surging energy prices would fuel inflation and add to pressure on the Fed to take action sooner than anticipated. [US/] 
""The focus right now is Treasury rates,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com. ""The credit markets are anticipating the taper starting, I think, in November.""
Investors will watch U.S. Consumer Price Index data on Wednesday and retail sales data on Friday for further clues as to when the Fed might begin winding down stimulus.
""The data is going to be huge,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
""These numbers will speak to both the inflation outlook, as well the extent to which third-quarter growth likely moderated. So if we get another hot print on inflation tomorrow, that would tend to cement tapering this year and maybe lead the market to fine-tune expectations on when we could see lift-off on interest rates,"" he said.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, touched 94.563, its highest since late September 2020.
The spike in U.S. yields prompted investors to dump the Japanese yen versus the dollar, resulting in the second-biggest daily fall in the Japanese currency on Monday.
As Treasury yields rose further on Tuesday, the dollar hit a three-year high versus the yen, which has fallen 4% versus the greenback in three weeks.
""The primary driver of the move is the further rise that we've seen in U.S. Treasury yields - so it's a fairly simple story of a widening rates differential ... adding to the attraction of the carry trade,"" said Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) monthly market sentiment survey this month noted that an overwhelming majority of respondents expect U.S. Treasury yields to rise from current levels.
The dollar also strengthened against the euro, with the common currency down 0.23% at $1.1525, its lowest since July 2020 as rising energy prices fed worries inflation may dent economic growth. 
Oil passed $84 a barrel, within sight of a three-year high, before easing slightly, as a rebound in global demand after the worst of the pandemic caused price spikes and shortages in other energy sources. Coal has scaled record peaks and gas prices remain four times higher in Europe than at the start of 2021. 
The ZEW indicator of economic sentiment in Germany slipped for the fifth month, the latest in a string of indicators showing supply bottlenecks holding back recovery in Europe's largest economy.
The commodity-linked Australian dollar was up 0.16% at $0.7357.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 3.02% at $55,750. Ether, the world's second biggest cryptocurrency dropped 1.38% to $3,495.

Investing.com — The USD/JPY has had another bumper day, trading around 0.3% higher on Tuesday after yesterday's move saw it break the 2019 and 2020 highs, reaching levels not seen since December 2018.
The pair has reached a session top of 113.78 today, where it last traded in November 2018. The price has only fallen 13 pips since the peak, currently trading at 113.65.
If the price continues climbing, the next critical level for the pair is 114.03.
On the hourly chart, the USDJPY has stalled somewhat since the day's high, however, there hasn't yet been anything to suggest that sellers will step in anytime soon.
During the Asian session, the price peaked at 113.48 before taking a dive down toward 113.00. The Asian session high is yet to be tested as a possible support level and could be an area to watch for a likely pullback.
A move below that hints at a more significant fall to 113.20 may be on the cards. On the opposite end of the scale, a break above the 113.78 level looks more likely at this moment."
671,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira extended its slide to a record low after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted at a possible military offensive into neighboring Syria.
The currency depreciated as much as 0.4% to 9.0398 per U.S. dollar after Erdogan said late Monday that Turkey is determined to eliminate threats emanating from Syria “either through forces that are active there, or by our own means.”
While Ankara has been embroiled in the conflict for years, the move threatens to stoke tensions with the U.S., which is backing Kurdish militants in the region that Turkey opposes. And it comes at a fraught time for the NATO allies, with Washington warning it could impose sanctions on the country again.
“Market players seem to perceive these comments as a cross-border operation,” Emre Degirmencioglu, a group manager at the treasury department at Iktisatbank in Nicosia, wrote in a note.
The losses were exacerbated by a bout of dollar strength and fragile global risk appetite. An unexpected rate cut last month reduced the allure of Turkish assets and fueled concern that inflation -- already running at the fastest pace in two years -- would continue to accelerate.
The lira has weakened more than 6% against the dollar since the Turkish central bank governor last month shifted focus to a narrower set of core prices, stirring speculation he was giving policy makers more room to ease rates despite the risks.
“We could be witnessing the beginning of yet another vicious cycle of monetary policy easing,” said Piotr Matys, a senior currency analyst at InTouch Capital in London. A precipitous fall in the value of the lira could force the central bank to “abruptly make a U-turn and raise rates to stabilize the currency,” he said.
Turkey Rate Shock Imperils Reserves, Hurts Credibility: Analysts
For its part, the central bank says the latest jump in inflation is transitory. Governor Sahap Kavcioglu told investors and analyst in a teleconference last week that Turkey’s monetary policy stance remains sufficiently tight.

Investing.com -- The dollar was little changed in early trading in Europe Tuesday but still firmly in an upward trend, supported by rising long-term interest rates and by high demand from commodity buyers.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies, was down less than 0.1% at 94.320, having touched a high of 94.442 overnight.
The dollar is being firmly underpinned by the rising trend in U.S. bond yields, as the market positions for a reduction in bond purchases by the Federal Reserve from next month onward. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hit a new five-month high of 1.63% during the Asian session after a quiet day when the cash bond market was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.
Demand for Treasuries will be tested later Tuesday at 1 PM ET with a 10-year note auction. Before that, the U.S. will also publish its monthly JOLTS job openings survey. Vacancies have surged in recent months, hitting 10.934 million in August.
Vacancies are also at record levels in the U.K., topping 1 million for the first time in August, according to data released early Tuesday. The Office for National Statistics also recorded a 235,000 rise in employment in the three months through August, meaning that more people are now in work in the U.K. than in February 2020.
All of that was unable to lift sterling much, however, given that the market has already all-but priced in a first interest rate hike by the end of the year. GBP/USD rose less than 0.1% to $1.3607, while EUR/GBP rose by 0.1% 0.8501. The euro also inched higher against the dollar to $1.1567, but analysts see it staying under pressure after the European Central Bank indicated it won’t be hurried into tightening policy. ECB chief economist Philip Lane said on Monday he still believes the bulk of inflation pressure is coming from temporary factors.
“A combination of high energy prices and a rising yield differential will crimp the Euro from here and a fall through 1.1500 signals the next stage of its retreat,” said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley in a note to clients.
Widening interest rate differentials are also helping the dollar against the yen. USD/JPY inched down in European trading but had hit a new three-year high of 113.49 overnight.
The other supportive factor for the dollar remains the strength of energy markets. Crude oil prices have stayed firmly above $80 a barrel overnight, having hit seven-year highs on Monday. Base metals and agricultural commodities have also performed strongly over the last month. Given that oil and other commodities are traded overwhelmingly in dollars, that raises the amount of dollars that need to be bought – at least until high prices start to destroy demand.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira fell below 9 to the dollar for the first time, the market punishing one of the rare banks in emerging markets that refuses to tighten monetary policy. The dollar also rose 0.4% against the Korean won to 1200.38 after the Bank of Korea left its key rate unchanged at 0.7%, having raised it in August."
673,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 10:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s won dropped below the psychological barrier of 1,200 per dollar level for the first time in more than a year, as concerns over faster inflation and weaker growth weighed on risk appetite.
The won declined as much as 0.5% to 1,200.35 Tuesday morning in Seoul, the lowest level since July 2020. The currency has declined more than 9% this year, making it Asia’s second worst-performer after Thailand’s baht. 
The currency has been under pressure since May as the dollar gained and and South Korean authorities tightened restrictions to curb a rise in virus infections. Bearish sentiment around won assets has intensified of late with global funds dumping the nation’s stocks amid concerns over the memory-chip business outlook and expectations for the Federal Reserve to start tapering soon.  
“If concerns over rising energy prices continue, the won may extend losses to as low as 1,250 per dollar,” said Ha Keon-hyeong, an economist at Shinhan Investment Corp. “Inflation increases the fear of faster policy normalization and raises the cost for companies,” which will keep weighing on the won. 
On Tuesday, South Korea’s central bank held off from a second-straight rate hike, opting instead to monitor the impact of August’s move before continuing its march toward higher borrowing costs.

""What we're seeing in currency markets is a combination of the outlook for the Federal Reserve - largely markets are expecting a tapering announcement in November - and what is happening with commodities with a pretty broad rally at the moment,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist and senior economist Kim Mundy told Reuters.
These factors were affecting the yen, because Japan is a net energy importer ""and so spiking energy prices are effectively a tax on consumption"" and because it ""reiterates the fact that Bank of Japan will probably be one of the last major central banks to even consider reducing ultra-accommodative monetary policy,” she added.
Soaring energy prices, and their inflationary impact, also make it likelier that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering as planned in November 2021 and hike interest rates in 2022 despite last Friday’s disappointing U.S. jobs report.
Other central banks are also paying attention to price concerns, with the Bank of England signaling that it will hike interest rates to curb inflation. The South Korean won fell to 1,200 per dollar for the first time in 14 months after the Bank of Korea kept its interest rate steady at 0.75% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Monday as surging energy prices prompted investors to seek safe havens, with the greenback hitting a nearly three-year high against the yen on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce a tapering of its bond purchases next month. 
Oil prices surged on Monday to multi-year peaks, fueled by the rebound in global demand. Concerns that the price rises may exacerbate global supply-chain backlogs caused Wall Street to give up early gains.
""Risk aversion is kind of settling in,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at FX broker Oanda. ""We’re not going to get any answers on the global energy crisis or inflationary pressures anytime soon and those risks are likely to keep a lot of investors focused on safety in the short-term,"" he said.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was up 0.174% at 94.328, not far from its one-year high of 94.504 touched earlier this month. 
U.S. fixed income markets are closed on Monday for a holiday but the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries hit a four-month high of 1.617% on Friday, even after data showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September, missing forecasts. 
However, data for August was revised up sharply and the jobless rate dropped to an 18-month low, suggesting fears of labor shortage remain justified, keeping inflation worries alive and giving the Fed justification to reduce its emergency stimulus begun last year. 
The yen, which is known for being particularly sensitive to interest rate differentials, hit 113 yen per dollar for the first time since December 2018.
With Japanese government bond rates well anchored and the Bank of Japan keeping policy on ice, expectations of a Fed tapering announcement soon should press U.S. Treasury yields higher, favouring higher dollar-yen ranges, said Roberto Cobo Garcia, head of FX strategy at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
The main risk for the dollar-yen pairing this week comes from U.S. data, with consumer price index and retail sales both due.
""Investors need to be a bit careful, because if inflation and consumer spending numbers this week fall short, it will be very hard for the dollar to hold onto its gains,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management.
The Australian dollar hit its strongest since Sept. 14, and was most recently up 0.57% against the dollar at $0.73505, helped by strong commodities prices and a partial reopening of Sydney, Australia's largest city. 
Concern about inflation is not limited to the United States, with supply disruptions and rising commodity prices affecting many countries.
The British pound had risen in early London trading on growing expectations the Bank of England could raise interest rates to curb inflation, but faded later in the session over energy price concerns, last down 0.08% at $1.3607.

Following the arrest of scores of foreign currency traders over the past few weeks alleged to be involved in black market U.S. dollar trading, the government on Thursday threatened to suspend the licences of businesses using black market rates to price their goods and services.
The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), the largest representative body for business, said it had cautioned the government against criminalising firms and traders, according to the letter sent last week and shared with the media on Monday.
""The greatest risk facing the economy right now is an inappropriate policy response to the rising parallel market premium,"" the organisation said, referring to the difference between official and black market currency values. 
""Clamping down on informal foreign exchange trading in the absence of a viable formal market will have catastrophic consequences for the economy.""
The value of the domestic currency has weakened to 88 per U.S. dollar on the official market as of Oct. 11 from 2.5 a dollar in February 2019. It trades significantly weaker, at around 170 to the dollar, on the black market, according to online currency rate monitoring website zimrates.com.
The CZI said the weekly foreign currency auction system introduced by the government in June 2020 needed to be overhauled as it was no longer efficient, taking as many as 15 weeks - instead of the intended two days - to allocate foreign exchange, which was hobbling growth of business.

""The Zimbabwe dollar is now in real peril ... well considered policy measures must be implemented by the authorities aimed at bringing back confidence into the currency markets,"" the CZI said.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - The dollar is at a crossroads after a 5% rally in four months, as many investors assess how much of the Fed's bond purchase taper and future rate hikes are priced in, and if any further increase in U.S. yields will be for ""good"" or ""bad"" reasons. 
Not hedge funds though, who continue to hoover up dollars.
If central banks' post-2008 interest rate policy could generally be summed up as 'lower for longer', speculators' stance on the dollar now appears to be 'longer for longer'. 
The latest positioning data from U.S. futures markets show hedge funds and other speculators significantly added to their net long dollar position against a range of global currencies in the week to October 5 for a 12th straight week.
The total net long position now stands at $22.5 billion, the largest since June 2019, while the $7.2 billion increase from the previous week was the third largest in more than three years. 
The dollar bullishness could not be more broad-based.

Clearly, the rise in U.S. bond yields - in nominal, real and relative terms - is all the speculative FX trading community needs to see. 
Hedge fund industry data provider HFR said its benchmark currency index rose 1% in September. That may not be anywhere near the commodity index's stunning 5.2% surge, but it was its best month since March last year. 
Last week, the 10-year U.S. yield rose 15 basis points, the most since February, and is now above 1.60% for the first time since June. The dollar has risen against a basket of currencies for five weeks, and is hovering close to a one-year high.
The question now is, are the factors driving up U.S. bond yields supportive of further dollar appreciation, or not?
The recent increase in Treasury yields has been driven by rising inflation pressures fueled by supply chain shocks, shortages, and sky-high energy prices. Breakeven inflation rates have popped higher across the curve and are now close to scaling the year's peaks reached in May.
All this while the medium-term U.S. growth outlook, as evidenced by the latest non-farm payroll disappointment, has dimmed. 
In short, a kind of 'stagflation' scenario.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Zach Pandl and his team argue that this is generally a constructive environment for the dollar, whose performance ""tends to differ depending on whether higher inflation reflects better growth or other factors, such as adverse supply shocks.""
But when inflation expectations rise for more benign reasons such as better growth prospects, the dollar tends to depreciate against most currencies. This is what they expect in the coming months as COVID-19 cases fall and economies open up, leading to a ""moderately weaker"" dollar going into the year-end.
The urge for many traders who have been on the crest of this dollar wave to simply take profit is also likely to limit the potential for much more upside from here, at least in the short term.

But Derek Halpenny and his team at MUFG argue that funds' $22.5 billion net long dollar position is ""not yet excessive"" compared with what was in place pre-pandemic. They have a point. In May 2019, CFTC speculators' net dollar holdings stood at $35 billion. 
They also argue that Friday's sub-par September employment report will not derail the Fed from its tapering schedule, which should be outlined next month. Momentum and fundamentals both point to a stronger dollar going into the year-end, they reckon.

Investing.com -- The dollar was up against high-yielding currencies but lower against the euro and sterling on Monday, as Friday's jobs report left room for significant room for uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve may start to raise interest rates. 
The jobs report was the weakest this year, with only 194,000 nonfarm jobs being added, well short of consensus. A big upward revision to August's data softened the disappointment a little, but average earnings came in above expectations,  increasing fears that inflation may strengthen at the same time as growth slows due to constraints in both global supply chains and local labor markets. The numbers did nothing to suggest that the Fed won't start tapering its bond purchases next month, however.
By 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies was effectively flat at 94.073, having failed to push beyond its September high in response to the jobs report on Friday. The dollar advanced 0.4% against the yen, and by 0.3% against the New Zealand dollar, supported by high global commodity prices that require dollars for trade settlement. 
However, it was lower against the pound, after comments from two senior Bank of England officials - including Governor Andrew Bailey - at the weekend, which signaled very clearly that the Bank is looking to raise interest rates in the near term. Inflation expectations have risen to over 4% within five years in the U.K., a country that is still more scarred than most by memories of stagflation in the 1970s. 
Bailey told the Yorkshire Post in an interview that ""obviously"" he is ""concerned"" at above-target inflation, adding that: ""We are going to have a very delicate and challenging job on our hands so we have got to in a sense prevent the thing becoming permanently embedded because that would obviously be very damaging.”
His colleague Michael Saunders, meanwhile, told the Sunday Telegraph that the U.K. would have to brace for ""significantly earlier"" rate hikes. The Bank's key rate has been set at 0.1% since the start of the pandemic.
Sterling rose 0.4% to a three-month high of 1.1804 against the euro and rose 0.4% against the dollar to a one-month high of $1.3664. 
Oil-themed currencies continued their strong run as crude prices stayed well above $80 a barrel over the weekend. The Russian ruble tested a 14-month high against the dollar at 71.6724, while the Canadian dollar was testing a two-month high after it posted a much stronger labor market report on Friday. Canada added 157,000 jobs in September and has now replaced all the jobs it lost at the start of the pandemic. 
U.S. markets will be thinned out slightly by the Columbus Day holiday in the U.S., while speeches from the European Central Bank's chief economist Philip Lane and Frank Elderson will be scanned for any sign that the ECB - increasingly an outlier to the global trend of monetary tightening - is starting to react to higher inflationary pressure."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, hitting a two-and-a-half-year high versus the yen. Figures from the latest U.S. report did not alter market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering as soon as November 2021.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 94.093 by 10:54 PM ET (2:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.30% to 122.56, remaining above the 112-mark.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.27% to 0.7326, with Australia’s Sydney re-opening after a more-than-100-day lockdown. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.6935.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4373 while the GBP/USD pair was up 0.25% to 1.3645.
The U.S. jobs report was disappointing, with non-farm payrolls at 194,000 and the unemployment rate at 4.8% in September. With labor shortages still a possibility and fanning inflation concerns, the Fed is likely to begin asset tapering within 2021, as is widely expected.
U.S. bond yields climbed after the data’s release, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield hitting a four-month high of 1.617%.
""Although the headline payroll figure was weak, when you look into details, the outlook remains solid and there isn't anything that would prevent the Fed from tapering next month,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota
""The dollar/yen is now at the top end of its trading range, its 2019 peak of 112.40, so I do expect heavy selling there for now. Still, should it break that level, we could see the dollar rising to 113 or 114 handled quite easily,"" he added.
The U.S. releases further data, including the consumer price index, on Wednesday. Should the data be higher than expected, expectations of an earlier interest rate hike after asset tapering could bring further gains for the U.S. currency, according to analysts.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England also signaled that it could also hike its interest rates. The pound extended its recovery from August’s nine-month low over the news.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was firm at $54,782 after hitting a five-month high of $56,561 on Sunday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. dollar net longs in the latest week surged to their highest level in more than two years, according to Reuters calculations and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $22.89 billion in the week ended Oct. 5, compared with $16.37 billion in the previous week. U.S. dollar positioning has been net long for 12 straight weeks after being net short for 16 months.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Swiss franc, as well as the Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a broader measure of dollar positioning, which includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long position of $22.535 billion this week, from $15.33 billion previously.
The dollar has been on a tear since the September 21-22 Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting that suggested a possible tapering of the Fed's asset purchases starting November this year and ending in June 2022.
Tapering tends to be dollar-positive because the Fed would be buying less debt assets, which means that there will be less dollars in circulation, making the currency more valuable.
Since the September meeting, the dollar index has risen more than 1%.
The dollar pulled back, however, on Friday after an underwhelming U.S. non-farm payrolls report. Data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 194,000 jobs last month, compared with forecasts for 500,000 new jobs. But data for August was revised to show 366,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 235,000 positions.
""U.S. inflation data released next Wednesday may add to evidence that inflationary pressures are proving less 'transitory' than generally anticipated,"" wrote Jonathan Petersen, markets economist, at Capital Economics in its latest research note.
""Our view remains that this will push U.S. yields and the dollar a bit higher in the coming months.""
In other contracts, euro positioning turned short in the latest week with net short contracts of 22,334, from a net long position of 872 the previous week. The euro remains a laggard among G10 currencies, weighed down by the European Central bank's dovish stance.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin net shorts totaled 1,518 contracts in the week ended Oct. 5, from net short contracts of 883 the previous week. This week's net short contracts in bitcoin were the largest since late July.
That said, bitcoin on Friday soared to a five-month high of $56,168, boosted by continued institutional demand, gaining some legitimacy among investors.
Since a low of $28,600 hit in June, bitcoin has gained 87.5%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar was little moved by a disappointing U.S. employment report on Friday, as traders bet that the numbers will not sway the Federal reserve from starting a tapering of its asset purchases as early as November.
The Labor Department said in its employment report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 500,000 jobs.
The fact that the gain was modest could temper expectations for a swift acceleration in economic growth following an apparent sharp slowdown in the third quarter, but is unlikely to stop the Federal Reserve from starting the process of reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November, analysts said.
September's employment report is the last one available before the Federal Reserve's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting.
""(It's a) miss on the headline number for sure, but the underlying details are not as really nefarious as the top-line miss would suggest and so, ultimately, it’s still consistent with the Fed delivering taper next month,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.067, not far from the one-year high of 94.504 touched last week.
""I think that the Federal Reserve made it very clear that they don’t need a blockbuster jobs report to taper in November, so while you’re seeing a little bit of a pullback in the dollar, I think the Fed remains on track,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.
TD's Issa said the disappointing jobs number could lead to a dip in the dollar but any such weakness was likely to be fleeting.
""I think the market is going to need a lot more convincing that just one jobs report that’s on the softer side is going to price the Fed out beyond late 2022 and into 2023,"" Issa said.
In the week following jobs data the dollar tends to reverse most of the gain or loss that has occurred from the day of the NFP release, FX strategists said in a BofA Global Research report on Thursday.

The weaker dollar helped sterling steady on Friday, putting it on track to close out the week up 0.6%, its best weekly performance in 5 weeks, as interest rate hike expectations offset worries about a fuel crisis and labour shortages.
In the digital currency space, bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value, was 1.5% higher at $54,569.9, just shy of the 5-month high of $56,168 touched earlier in the session. Bitcoin is up about 13% for the week, its second straight weekly gain.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday ahead of the release of the highly-anticipated monthly U.S. jobs report, which looks likely to confirm assumptions that the Federal Reserve will start to normalize monetary policy in November.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 94.305, only marginally below last week’s 94.504 peak, its highest level since September 2020.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 111.89, just short of a one-month high, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1547, close to a 14-month low, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3603, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7299. 
The Federal Reserve indicated at its last meeting that it is likely to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November to be followed by interest rate increases potentially next year.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 500,000 in September, a sharp improvement from August’s 235,000 increase.
However, there could be room for more jobs to be created, especially after private payrolls processor ADP reported 568,000 jobs were added by the private sector in September, well ahead of expectations. Last week's jobless claims also suggested the labor market was recovering from a soft patch triggered by Delta-variant Covid-19. Initial claims fell by more than expected to 326,000 (although this is after the cut-off point for September's employment report.
“This month’s U.S. jobs report will likely only have to clear the lowest of hurdles to keep the Fed on track; indeed, some analysts are suggesting that as long as [the] U.S. economy creates at least 100K net new jobs, the Fed will feel comfortable announcing its tapering plan,” said Matthew Weller, Global Head of Market Research at GAIN Capital.
Weighing slightly on the safe haven dollar Friday was the news that the U.S. Senate voted late Thursday to temporarily lift the debt ceiling, thus averting a catastrophic debt default, at least for now.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4493 after China’s services sector made a return to growth in September, with the Caixin services purchasing managers index coming in at 53.4 in September. It had dipped to 46.7 in August under the weight of widespread Covid-19-driven lockdowns. The People's Bank of China was able to drain liquidity from the system after the Golden Week holiday without triggering any notable volatility.
USD/INR rose 0.3% to 75.014 after India’s central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at a record low for an eighth straight meeting, attempting to support the country’s nascent recovery from the damage caused by the pandemic.
In Europe, meanwhile, the euro strengthened 0.4% against the Polish zloty, after a Polish Constitutional Court ruling that challenged the primacy of EU law. The ruling will make it harder for the EU to disburse not only the funds earmarked for its post-pandemic recovery, but all other transfers under the EU budget.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia. However, the safe-haven dollar remained below a one-year high as risk sentiment improved. The riskier Australian dollar traded near the three-week high that it hit during the previous session, when it gained 0.55% against its U.S. counterpart.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 94.233 by 10:37 PM ET (2:37 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.25% to 111.87. Japanese data released earlier in the day showed that household spending contracted by a higher-than-expected 3% year-on-year and 3.9% month-on-month in August. The adjusted current account was at JPY1.04 trillion ($9.33 billion) while the current account was at JPY 1.666 trillion.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7316 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.34% to 0.6945.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.08% to 6.4502. China’s Caixin services purchasing managers index for September, released earlier in the day, was 53.4.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3615.
The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to temporarily lift the debt ceiling, thus averting a catastrophic debt default. Easing global energy prices also somewhat calmed stagflation concerns.
""The improvement in risk appetite favors pro-growth currencies, with safe-haven pairs the underperformers,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
The Australian dollar has made ""a decent go at breaking higher,"" but the test will be whether it can stay about $0.7315 following several failed attempts in 2021, the note added.
Investors also await the latest U.S. jobs report, which includes non-farm payrolls and is due later in the day. The data could impact the U.S. Federal Reserve's timetable for asset tapering, which it has said is likely to begin as soon as November 2021. The central bank could also hike interest rates in 2022.
Across the Atlantic, newly minted Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said that inflation pressures were proving stickier than initially thought. His comments reinforced expectations for an interest rate hike by February 2022, and perhaps even as soon as 2021."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies on Thursday, the day before U.S. labor market data that could provide clues to timing of the Federal Reserve's next move.
Most major currency pairs clung to familiar ranges, with traders disinclined to place large wagers before the data's release.
""A rather typical pre-nonfarm payrolls lull has taken over the market today,"" said Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton in London. 
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was unchanged, trading at 94.199, not far from the one-year high of 94.504 touched last week.
""I think we’ll probably range like this until the jobs report is out of the way, though even then any USD weakness should be faded given how a November taper looks near-certain,"" Brown said.
The Federal Reserve has said it is likely to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and then follow up with interest rate increases, as the U.S. central bank's turn from pandemic crisis policies gains momentum.
Friday's non-farm payrolls data is expected to show continued improvement in the labor market, with a forecast for 455,000 jobs added in September, a Reuters poll showed.
""A steadily improving U.S. labor market and solid U.S. economic growth should provide the Federal Reserve with the green light to start curbing its quantitative easing program,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note.
In the week following the data the dollar tends to reverse most of the gain or loss that has occurred from the day of the NFP release, FX strategists said in a BofA Global Research report on Thursday.
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but layoffs increased from a 24-year low in September in part as hospitals fired unvaccinated staff and lack of workers forced closures of facilities.

Sterling rose 0.3% on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved a tad and analysts said the prospects of a Bank of England rate hike reduced some downside potential for the currency.

The top 1% of households by income held $887 billion of those assets as of June, the smallest amount in 17 years and down from a peak of $1.5 trillion a decade ago. 
Americans lower down the income ladder have been trimming their holdings too. Public and municipal debt held by the bottom 99% of households peaked at about $3 trillion in June 2019, and is down by almost $400 billion since then.
High-earners traditionally tended to buy municipal bonds to take advantage of tax exemptions on the interest income. 
But with rates on Treasuries and munis near historic lows, it’s likely that they “searched for higher yields elsewhere, whether via equities, high-yield or investment-grade debt, private credit, non-fungible tokens, crypto, etc.,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Advisory Group.
Benchmark 10-year Treasuries are currently trading around 1.55%. That’s up from the all-time trough they hit last year, but still just a fraction of the long-run average. Meanwhile, inflation has been above 5% for months.
“Higher-income households are likely well aware that they are receiving negative real returns on U.S. government and municipal securities,” said Chris Ahrens, a strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
The top 20% of households held 74.2% of U.S. government and municipal securities, the lowest share in records dating back to 1989, according to the Fed.

686,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England’s new chief economist says the current spike in U.K. inflation looks set to last longer than originally thought, in comments that may boost speculation that interest rates may be about to rise.
In his first public remarks since taking up the role, Huw Pill said that risks to the economy are far more two-sided than they have been for some time, and as a result policy decisions will become more finely balanced. U.K. government bonds briefly dipped after the questionnaire was published, boosting yields.
Pill’s view, contained in written responses to questions from Parliament’s Treasury Committee, come amid growing bets that spiking inflation will force the BOE to hike interest rates in the near future. A flurry of news in recent days has undercut the the BOE’s view that much of the jump in prices will prove transitory. Markets are almost fully pricing in a 15-basis-point rate rise by the end of the year.
“In my view, that balance of risks is currently shifting towards great concerns about the inflation outlook, as the current strength of inflation looks set to prove more long lasting than originally anticipated,” Pill wrote.
Pill, who was appointed last month, voted to keep rates unchanged at the bank’s September meeting. Officials at the time raised the prospect of hiking interest rates as soon as November to contain a surge in inflation.
Still, his thoughts on the forces shaping the likely path for borrowing costs have largely remained a mystery until now. Analysis from Bloomberg Economics placed him in the middle of the range views on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee.
Pill’s comments weren’t all hawkish. He also noted that the U.K. economy is yet to return to it’s pre-virus level, leaving potential supply available. 
“Monetary policy should seek to support a level of activity that exploits that potential as fully as possible,” he wrote.

Sweden and Norway recently ended almost all remaining social restrictions amid a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and a corresponding drop in infections, allowing businesses to thrive.
After plunging when the coronavirus hit last year, the currencies have recovered to trade slightly stronger against the euro than their pre-pandemic levels. They will continue to rise, but the likely scope of gains is more limited, the poll showed.
Norway's crown has rallied about 6% since late August to trade at around 9.94 against the euro and could move to 9.83 in the coming year, the poll showed, which would be its strongest level since January 2020.
Analysts attribute the crown's lift in recent weeks to hawkish monetary policy and a surge in the price of Norway's oil and gas https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/fossil-fuel-demand-shakes-off-pandemic-blow-climate-fight-2021-10-04 exports.
Norges Bank last month raised rates https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-raises-interest-rates-says-another-hike-likely-december-2021-09-23 for the first time since 2019 and plans four more hikes over the coming 15 months, with the next tightening pencilled in for December.
But the often-volatile Norwegian currency is also at risk of periods of decline and is forecast to be weaker than its current level at the end of 2021 before rising again next year.
""NOK is no safe haven in troubling times and could easily weaken if sentiment in markets sours,"" Nordea Markets cautioned.
In Sweden, where the currency has weakened slightly against the euro this year, the crown is expected to make gains over the coming 12 months to hit its strongest level since early 2018, the poll showed.
The Riksbank has held its benchmark repo rate at 0% and expects to keep it there for several more years despite strong economic recovery and above-target inflation.
Nonetheless some economists see the rebound in the Swedish economy as an opportunity for the central bank to tweak its overall monetary policy approach in 2022.
""The stars are starting to align behind our view that policymakers will start to allow the balance sheet to contract next year,"" Capital Economics said in a recent note to clients.

The Reuters poll predicted the Swedish currency would make gains of around 2.5% against the euro to trade at around 9.92 one year from now, the median forecast showed.

The news that U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has offered to allow an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December, a move that would head off a historic default with the likely associated financial crisis and recession, has taken the edge off the dollar’s appeal Thursday, This is because the U.S. currency is often seen as a safe haven in times of stress.
That said, the dollar remains near recent highs on worries that the surge in energy prices will fuel inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to withdraw its extremely accommodative monetary policy sooner than expected.
“How central banks respond to this energy price spike will be a key driver of FX rates over coming months,” said ING analysts, in a note.
The Fed is widely expected to begin tapering its bond-buying program in November, with the question being how far high energy prices are acting as a brake on a economic growth.
The latest release of ADP private payrolls seemed to answer that question, with U.S. companies adding more jobs than forecast in September. Companies’ payrolls increased by 568,000 last month, the most since June, above a revised 340,000 gain in August, and well above the expected 428,000 rise.
This puts the focus squarely on the weekly jobless claims due later Thursday, but, more importantly, Friday’s official employment report, with nonfarm payrolls seen rising by 488,000 jobs, up from 235,000 jobs added the previous month.
“We think a bullish cocktail is being mixed for the dollar,” said ING. “Add in any strong employment data and market expectations may swing towards Fed projections of a steepish three year tightening cycle starting next year.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, but remained close to a 14-month high against the euro. Investor concerns that surging energy prices, and the resultant inflation, could impair the economic recovery from COVID-19 persist, while also keeping an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s timeline to begin asset tapering.
The U.S. currency steadied at $1.1558 per euro after strengthening to $1.1529 on Wednesday for the first time since July 2020.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 94.248 by 10:53 PM ET (2:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 111.47.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.7280 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.6917.
The USD/CNY pair steadied to 6.4467, with Chinese markets closed for a holiday. The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3582.
Meanwhile, crude oil hit a seven-year high overnight before easing from its recent gains, while natural gas climbed to a record peak in Europe and coal prices from major exporters also hit all-time highs.
""All the talk on the trading floors, on social media, and through broad markets has been around natural gas, and it was deafening,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note titled ""OMGas"".
""Traders feared stagflation risks were on the march and questioned how on earth do central banks deal with a stagflation event driven by a supply shock?” the note added.
Investors also continue to monitor progress on the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations, after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his Republican party would allow an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December 2021.
They also await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, to be released on Friday. The ADP non-farm employment change for September, released on Wednesday, was a higher-than-expected 568,000 as subsiding numbers of COVID-19 cases allowed Americans to travel, eat out at restaurants, and re-start other high-contact activities.
The report could provide clues to the Fed’s timeline to begin asset tapering, widely expected to happen as soon as November 2021.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - King dollar will dominate currency markets in the near term before ceding ground to its peers in a year, found a Reuters poll of FX strategists who said U.S. Treasury yields would give the greenback the most direction over the next 12 months.
Bolstered by the U.S. Federal Reserve's tapering plans and a growing chorus of Federal Open Market Committee members now forecasting a rate hike by the end of next year, benchmark yields in the U.S. have risen sharply. That has sent the dollar to levels not seen in more than a year.
Tracking the rise in U.S. Treasury yields, the dollar index was up around 5% against majors for the year. Nearly half of those gains came in the past month, a trend expected to remain over the coming year.
An 85% majority of analysts, 46 of 54, who answered an additional question said U.S. Treasury yields and rate expectations would give the dollar the most direction over the next 12 months.
Six said incoming economic data, one said its safe-haven status. The remaining analyst said developments around the COVID-19 pandemic would be the main driver.
Results from a separate Reuters bonds poll forecast that while yields on U.S. Treasuries would rise further from current levels, the rate at which they have soared over the past month would not be sustained. [US/INT]
Those findings lined up with the latest Reuters poll of more than 80 FX strategists, taken Oct. 1-6, who expected the dollar to dip marginally against most major currencies over the next 12 months.
""The market in the near term is going to focus on the fact that we expect U.S. Treasury yields to keep rising on the back of the Fed's tapering of QE and also the ongoing recovery in the U.S. economy,"" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.
""Treasury yields are not going to rise indefinitely. At some point they're going to stabilize and I think that's when the dollar is going to face a bit more downward pressure and that's why we are still expecting the dollar to get weaker.""

The latest CFTC data showed speculators had raised their net long dollar positions to the highest since March 2020.
While analysts held to their view the euro and other major currencies would strengthen against the dollar over the next 12 months - a view they have clung to for several years now - they forecast weaker gains than just a month ago.
Last changing hands around $1.15 on Wednesday, the common currency was forecast to rise around 2.3% to trade at $1.18 in a year. The latest median prediction was the lowest since August 2020.
Indeed, 22 of 76 analysts - nearly a third - who had forecasts that far into future expected the euro to weaken.

""I think at this point in time, unless there's a real significant shift in fundamentals I don't think a correction in the dollar would extend very far,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
Among analysts who answered an additional question on whether the greenback's strength was at an inflection point, a near 60% majority of analysts, 29 of 48, said no.
Asked when that point would be reached, only a handful expected it to come this year. The remaining majority gave a timeline ranging between early 2022 to end-2024.

""The extrapolation of the dollar move and the rates move is probably excessive. I think you have to be careful not to exaggerate how much you actually know,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed across the board on Wednesday, as surging energy prices fuelled concerns about inflation and interest rate hikes, knocking investors' appetite for riskier assets and driving flows to safe-havens. 
With oil prices hitting their highest in seven years, shares fell and government bond yields rose across the world early on Wednesday, before reversing some of the moves later in the session.
""What you are seeing this week is more inflationary fears percolating into the overall market,"" said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
Rising inflationary pressures could pose headwinds to growth and have implications for how soon the Federal reserve can raise interest rates.
The Federal Reserve has said it is likely to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and then follow it up with interest rate increases, as the U.S. central bank's turn from pandemic crisis policies gains momentum.
""The question will be, does it force the Fed to move faster than expectations,"" Trang said.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.3% higher at 94.228. The index hit a 1-year high of 94.504 last week.
Investors remained on edge regarding U.S. debt ceiling negotiations, even as the top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said his party would allow an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December, a move that would head off a historic default with a heavy economic toll.
The U.S. payrolls report at the end of the week, which could provide clues to the U.S. Federal Reserve's next move, remains a point of focus for investors.
Friday's non-farm payrolls data is expected to show continued improvement in the labor market, with a forecast for 473,000 jobs to have been added in September, a Reuters poll showed.
""If we are somewhere in the ballpark ... it supports the dollar trend that we have been seeing,"" Trang said. 
GRAPHIC: US nonfarm payrolls https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/akpezqdgmvr/Pasted%20image%201633526576693.png 
U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in September as COVID-19 infections started subsiding, allowing Americans to travel, frequent restaurants and reengage in other high-contact activities, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday.
Sterling/dollar implied volatility, a gauge of expected swings embedded in currency options, rose to a seven-month high around 7.9% on Wednesday, as soaring energy prices and a surge in bond yields sent the pound 0.3% lower against the greenback.
On Wednesday, Poland's central bank raised its main interest rate to 0.5% from 0.1% on Wednesday, it said in a statement, moving to increase borrowing costs earlier than analysts had expected to counter a surge in inflation. The move helped lift the Polish zloty up about 0.4%.

The greenback's strength, combined with an aversion toward riskier currencies, sent the New Zealand dollar down 0.7% despite New Zealand's central bank hiking interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in seven years and signalling further tightening to come. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value, jumped 6.27% to $54,728.39, its highest since May. 
 
"
692,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Dislocations in the Treasury-bill curve are getting deeper, with investors becoming more concerned about the U.S. potentially exhausting its borrowing authority as each day passes without a resolution.
Longer-dated bills normally pay higher yields than shorter ones, but that hasn’t been the case lately. Investors have been shying away from bills due in late October and early November -- viewed as most at risk of delayed payment if a legislative agreement on the debt limit isn’t reached. The yield on the Oct. 21 maturity climbed as much as 3 basis points to 0.16% Wednesday, with most bills due earlier and later yielding 0.05% or less.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week that action is needed by Oct. 18, while the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, now projects that the Treasury Department will exhaust its extraordinary measures to avert breaching the debt limit between Oct. 19 and Nov. 2. That compares with a previous BPC calculation of Oct. 15 to Nov. 4. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans Wednesday to hold a vote in his chamber whether to take up a measure approved by the House that would suspend the nation’s debt ceiling until December 2022. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told a closed meeting of Senate Republicans that he would offer a short-term debt ceiling extension today or an expedited reconciliation process, Punchbowl reports.
Avoiding Bills 
If the U.S. runs out of borrowing capacity, debt maturing immediately afterward might not be repaid on time. Investors in those securities are therefore demanding compensation for the risk in the form of higher bill yields.
The backup in Treasury bill yields and recent dislocations in the market -- in some cases by as much as 20 to 25 basis points for potential debt-ceiling risk -- is not inconsequential for securities that have yielded closer to zero for more than a year, according to Deirdre Dunn, managing director and co-head of global rates, at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), who spoke on a panel at the Brookings Institution Tuesday. 
Still, there seem to be investors willing to buy the dips as yields start to climb, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Jay Barry. While Treasury bill yields have risen due to anxiety surrounding a potential default, “there’s been other less constrained investors in a very abundant liquidity world who seem to be stepping in to buy those securities every time they’ve cheapened,” he said during the same Brookings event.
Full Speed Ahead for Reverse Repo
Meanwhile, investors in need of an alternative to certain T-bills are flocking to the Federal Reserve’s facility for reverse repurchase agreements. That’s adding to demand created by T-bill supply cuts made in an effort to keep the debt load under the ceiling. Usage of the facility increased to a record high on Thursday.
Protecting Against Default
The cost to protect against nonpayment over the next year through credit-default swaps has risen to about 27 basis points, from 4 basis points in mid-September. That means it costs 27,000 euros ($31,000) to insure 10 million euros worth of Treasuries against default. The expense reached 45 basis points during the 2015 debt-limit episode, and 80 basis points during the 2011 saga, which resulted in the U.S. losing its top credit rating from S&P.
Smaller Buffer
One of the starkest proxies for debt-ceiling risk is the Treasury’s cash pile. Inflated by fiscal stimulus and Fed asset purchases, the cash balance exploded to a record $1.83 trillion in July 2020, but has since dwindled to around $141 billion, the smallest since August 2019. A large part of that drawdown was mandated by the reinstatement of the debt ceiling at the start of August. But the pile is now well below what the Treasury itself had forecast for the end of the third quarter. The upshot is that the government has less of a buffer to pay its bills if there’s a disruption in debt markets.
Meanwhile, the department said in a statement Friday that around $173 billion of headroom remained as of Sept. 29 under extraordinary measures that have been put in place to avoid the government breaching its debt ceiling, assuming the Debt Issuance Suspension Period ends on Oct. 18.
Still, Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) projects the cash balance will fall below $90 billion by Oct. 6 due to fiscal withdrawals that are concentrated at the beginning of the month, and will have less than $35 billion of unused extraordinary measures remaining on that day.

693,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 08:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A supply chain crisis, sky-rocketing energy prices, inflation expectations at historic highs. It’s easy to see why the case against U.K. is catching on. 
Options traders are bracing for the currency to weaken, and big investors have turned bearish. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management has been underweight the pound since the summer and BlueBay Asset Management LLP’s Mark Dowding sees a risk of a 10% decline in the next six months. 
“Supply constraints and a potential winter of discontent are weighing on the pound,” said Neil Jones, head of foreign-exchange sales to financial institutions at Mizuho Bank.
Sterling has weakened about 2% since June, and slumped another 0.5% to $1.3562 on Wednesday. Jones sees the losses extending as low as $1.3250 over the coming month. “If it’s going to go, it’s going to go soon,” he added. 
Here’s three metrics that show pessimism on the pound: 
Inflation Is Coming 
Traders are increasingly betting that the purchasing power of the pound is going to be eroded. The U.K.’s 10-year breakeven rate, a market-based measure of expected inflation, topped 4% on Wednesday, the highest since 2008.
U.K. Inflation Expectations at 13-Year High Lift Rate-Hike Bets
It’s Getting Expensive to Hedge the Pound
The cost of hedging swings in the pound over the next year has jumped to the highest since April. 
Risk Reversals Are Hot 
There’s a lot of demand for options that bet on a weaker pound. Three-month risk reversals, a gauge of market positioning and sentiment, show that the appetite for bearish wagers is near the strongest since March.
“We’re seeing a lot of potentially damaging events bubbling underneath the surface, leaving traders on tenterhooks,” said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Wednesday, with this safe haven boosted by concerns rising energy prices will translate into higher inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to promptly tighten its monetary policy.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 94.188, just below the 94.504 level seen last week, its highest level since September 2020.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 111.72, at a one-week high, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1581, just above last week’s 14-month low of 1.1563, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3611, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7261.
Also of interest, NZD/USD fell 0.5% to 0.6925 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted its official cash rate for the first time in seven years earlier Wednesday, and hinted at further interest rate hikes to come in order to tame rising inflation. That came a day after Romania became the latest central bank in emerging Europe to raise rates.
This hawkish tone has added to expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering asset purchases this year and prepare for an early increase in the rock-bottom pandemic-era interest rate settings.
The dollar also has benefited from climbing bond yields as investors fretted about the lack of agreement in U.S. Congress over the country’s debt ceiling and the potential for a default.   
In addition there remains concerns about the Chinese property sector, the news that another Chinese property developer, Fantasia, has also failed to repay $205 million of bonds, suggesting concerns extend well beyond Evergrande. 
“Ultimately, this is likely a reminder that the headwinds to risk sentiment stemming from China’s property sector are far from over,” said ING analysts, in a note. “In FX, we think this will continue to provide reasons not to turn any bearish on the dollar.”
Attention now turns to the release of the ADP private payrolls release later Wednesday, as a guide to Friday’s important official employment report.
The ADP number is expected to rise by 428,000 jobs in September, up from 374,000 jobs the previous month, while Friday’s nonfarm payrolls are seen rising by 488,000 jobs, up from 235,000 jobs added the previous month.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, remaining close to highs for 2021 even amid volatile trading earlier in the session. Investors turned their attention to an interest rate hike in New Zealand as well as to the latest U.S. jobs report due later in the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 94.047 by 10:46 PM ET (2:46 AM GMT).

Investors have turned to the safe-haven dollar recently as the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin asset tapering within 2021 and hike interest rates in 2022. The U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is due to be released on Friday and is seen as crucial to the Fed’s timeline for asset tapering.
A large miss on market expectations for around 428,000 jobs to have been added in September could dampen expectations for Friday's broader figure, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Carol Kong told Reuters.
""We maintain our view that a solid improvement in Friday's payrolls will prompt the Fed to announce a taper in November,"" she said.
In other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) hiked its interest rate to 0.50% from the previous month’s 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The Reserve Bank of India will also hand down its policy decision on Friday.
Meanwhile, commodity-linked currencies were boosted by oil, which was down on Wednesday but still remaining near three-year highs. The Canadian dollar traded near a one-month peak and is close to testing its 200-day moving average.
The Australian dollar, a fellow risk-sensitive currency, also got a boost but concerns about slowing economic growth in China, a top market for Australian commodity exports, capped gains."

Investing.com – The dollar is approaching 'critical resistance' that may force some to take profit, but this isn't the time to turn bearish as any dips will likely be bought paving the way for further upside, experts say.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.22% to 93.99.
The dollar is approaching “critical resistance” of 94.47 to 94.76, and could be set for “some consolidation,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
While the short-term path for dollar is likely paved with resistance, the overarching backdrop for the dollar is favorable as further positive economic data will likely strengthen the Federal Reserve’s case to tighten its monetary policy measures.
Data on Tuesday showed the ISM services index rose to 61.9 from 61.7, confounding economists’ expectations for a decline to 59.9.
In sign that inflationary pressures remain elevated, the prices paid component of the ISM non-manufacturing report showed prices paid rose to 77.5 from 75.4.
“Prices paid remains at a very high level, and it is consistent with a host of other metrics that reflect elevated prices pressures,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The ongoing pace of inflation could force the Fed to hike rates sooner than many expect.
“[A]gainst the backdrop of elevated inflation and rapidly rising energy costs, many market participants are skeptical the FOMC will be able to maintain these low rates for another year, let alone two,” Stifel said in a note.
As well as expectations for tighter monetary policy, the dollar has been boosted by a rise in safe-haven demand in the wake of difficulties in China that are set to continue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar edged higher on Tuesday, lingering close to the one-year high hit last week, as traders remained circumspect ahead of key payrolls report at the end of the week that could provide clues to the U.S. Federal Reserve's next move.
Moves in the FX market were likely to remain largely muted for the rest of the week as investors await the update on the U.S. labor market that could help provide clues to whether the Fed will begin tapering its asset purchases before year's end, analysts said.
""Nonfarm payrolls is always a market mover,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at FX payments firm Tempus Inc.
""An underwhelming print will give the Fed dovish cover, but a blowout reading, paired with rising inflation made worse by the energy crisis will put more pressure on the Fed to begin tapering and help the greenback,"" said Doyle.
Friday's non-farm payrolls data is expected to show continued improvement in the labor market, with a forecast for 488,000 jobs to have been added in September, a Reuters poll showed.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against six rivals, was 0.2% higher at 93.981, moving back towards Thursday's peak of 94.504, its highest since late September 2020. 
""Generally, the U.S. dollar is trying to find new ranges after a strong rally at the end of September. In my opinion, the greenback's rally was overdone and we have seen that unwind over the past three to four days,"" Doyle said.
Others, however, expected the greenback to resume its upward move. 
With the Fed likely to soon begin scaling back asset purchases, ""conditions are ripe for continued USD strength once the current, likely consolidative, correction in the dollar passes,"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
Worries about the debt ceiling are beginning to rattle investors as the deadline nears for Congress to raise the U.S. borrowing limit to avoid a historic default on U.S. debt.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was little changed on the day after the Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated that it does not expect to raise interest rates until 2024.
Sterling rose to a near three-week high against the euro, recovering from a sharp sell-off last week as traders turn their attention back to the prospect of interest rate rises in Britain.

Cryptocurrencies rallied, a day after data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed cryptocurrency investment products and funds recorded inflows for a seventh straight week, as institutional investors warmed to more supportive statements from regulators.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Tuesday, helped by rising U.S. Treasury yields, but traded below last week’s peak with investors waiting for Friday’s key U.S. employment release for clues on the Federal Reserve’s thinking over bond-buying tapering. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 94.015, just below the 94.504 level seen last week, its highest level since September 2020.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 111.17, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1597, and GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3594. The risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7257 after the Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated it doesn't expect to raise interest rates until 2024 after keeping its monetary policy steady, as expected, at its latest meeting.
The dollar has benefited from climbing bond yields as investors fretted about the lack of agreement in U.S. Congress over the country’s debt ceiling with American politics seemingly as partisan as ever.   
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note now yields close to 1.50% after President Joe Biden said late Monday that he cannot guarantee the government will not breach its $28.4 trillion debt limit, as the United States faces the risk of a historic default in just two weeks.
Also helping the dollar has been a spate of recent data which have painted a picture of a fading pandemic and a recovering economy, fuelling expectations that the Federal Reserve could start tightening its monetary policy sooner than expected.
With this in mind, the focus for most of this week will be on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release, with the Fed undoubtedly looking for a stronger recovery in the labor market following August’s disappointing release.
This labor release is expected to show continued improvement in the job market, with a forecast for 488,000 jobs to have been added in September, up from 235,000 jobs added the previous month.
“Almost everyone likes the greenback right now, and it’s easy to explain why: investors are waiting for the U.S. Fed to back up its words about an early reduction of the Quantitative Easing (QE) program with actions,” said Dmitriy Gurkovskiy, an analyst at RoboForex.
Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is scheduled to make its latest policy decision on Wednesday, and is expected to hike by 25 basis points, while the Reserve Bank of India will hand down its own policy decision on Friday. The central bank of Romania is also expected to become the latest in central and eastern Europe to raise interest rates.

""There's a lot of bad global news priced into the dollar. The key for markets in the weeks ahead is to sort out the extent of the risk premium already priced in versus how these factors play out,"" TD Securities global head of FX strategy Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said in a report.
""While the near-term dollar bias leans higher, we're wary about chasing the move at these levels,"" the report added.
Meanwhile, the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is due on Friday. It is widely expected to show continuing improvement in the labor market. The improvement is also expected to be good enough for the Fed to begin asset tapering within 2021 as planned."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on Monday, pulling back from the 1-year high hit last week, as traders looked to U.S. jobs data at the end of the week for clues to the Federal Reserve's next move.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.2% lower at 93.802. The index rose 0.8% last week to its highest since late September 2020.
With Chinese mainland markets closed until Thursday for the National Day holiday and South Korean markets also shut on Monday, investor attention was firmly on the upcoming U.S. data. 
""Nonfarm payrolls will be the big focus for markets this week,"" Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in New York.
Friday's data is expected to show continued improvement in the job market, with a forecast for 488,000 jobs to have been added in September, according to a Reuters poll - enough to keep the Federal Reserve on course to begin tapering before year's end.
The Fed has signalled it will likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November but a big stumble in labor data could delay its plans, traders worry.
""Will the Fed react negatively to a 300k print? Likely not. With the momentum on taper already really high, the Fed will have a hard time making an about face after a small miss on what has been a very volatile series,"" Bechtel said.
""If we were to see something more extreme like a negative NFP print for example, then we could have a different story and the Fed may be forced to at least pause,"" he said.
The dollar found little support from data on Monday that showed new orders for U.S.-made goods accelerated in August, even as economic growth appeared to have slowed in the third quarter because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
Still, speculators in the FX market have grown increasingly bullish on the U.S. currency in recent weeks, with net long bets on the U.S. dollar climbing to its highest since March 2020, data on Friday showed.
With oil prices rising to a near 7-year high, the greenback was particularly weak against the energy-sensitive Norwegian crown and the Canadian dollar.
The dollar fell 0.6% against the crown and slipped 0.5% against the loonie.

The British pound was 0.5% higher at $1.3611, extending its rebound from the 9-month low touched last week.
""We think the GBP is still on fragile footing since the country will likely still have energy and food shortages in the fourth quarter. This, combined with strong U.S. data this week, could see the GBP re-test the 1.34 zone and resume its September decline,"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - If hedge fund plays on the dollar and U.S. Treasuries are a weather vane for investors' risk appetite and the economic outlook more broadly, then hold on to your hats. 
Chicago futures markets data show they have built up their largest long position in 10-year U.S. government notes in four years and increased their multibillion-dollar bet on a stronger greenback to its biggest in 18 months.
These trades - banking on low long-term borrowing costs, a flatter yield curve and a firmer dollar - indicate concern over future growth prospects, a strong desire for safety or lack of concern over inflation. Or all three.
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show that in the week to Sept. 28 hedge funds and speculators ramped up their net long 10-year Treasuries holdings by almost 120,000 contracts to 181,207 contracts, the most since October 2017.
This is the first glimpse into how hedge funds are repricing interest rate risk since the Federal Reserve's Sept. 22 policy meeting, which opened the door to an earlier and more aggressive tightening process than previously anticipated. 
Funds' rush into 10-year Treasuries completely reversed their selloff ahead of the meeting, and coincided with a deterioration across financial markets as investors grappled with the prospect of interest rates rising next year. 
Reflecting the Fed's hawkish tilt, speculative accounts more than doubled their net short two-year Treasuries futures position to 62,829 contracts. 
So far at least, this bet is not paying off: the 10-year yield jumped to 1.55% this week from 1.30% the day of the Fed's policy statement, and the two-year/10-year yield curve steepened by 15 basis points to 125 bps. 
But the warning bells are ringing. The S&P 500 had its first 5% drawdown in almost a year and September marked the biggest monthly fall since March last year; the VIX index jumped above 20; U.S. consumer sentiment hit a seven-month low, and the near-term growth outlook is dimming.
KING DOLLAR
This is the kind of environment that favors bonds, a flatter yield curve and the dollar. On that final note, at least, funds are on a winner.
CFTC data show they increased their net long dollar holdings for an 11th straight week, by almost $2 billion to $15.3 billion. That is the largest since March last year. 
The dollar strengthened for a fourth consecutive week to hit an 11-month high against a basket of currencies, boosted by rising short-term real yields, safe-haven demand and a spike in ultra short-dated bill rates due to the U.S. debt ceiling impasse.
The dollar often performs well in times of slowing growth and rising economic uncertainty. On the face of it, this appears counter-intuitive, but in the relative world of exchange rates the dollar provides safety and liquidity.
Domestic U.S. and global growth momentum is slowing. Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) note that softening business investment is consistent with the slowing in demand amid renewed Covid-19 infections, ongoing supply constraints and a cautious consumer. 
Their third quarter GDP tracker closed last week at 3.4%, suggesting further downside risks to their official forecast of 4.5%. 
Right now though, of course, the hottest issue for investors is inflation. Are current elevated levels transitory, as the Fed still insists? Is a more damaging, longer lasting overshoot in the cards? And more pertinently, what will the Fed do?
For all the talk of inflation taking hold, some key inflation expectations measures offer a different perspective. 
Breakeven inflation rates across the curve have popped higher since the Fed's Sept. 22 meeting, but they are still well below where they were earlier in the year. Inflation-protected Treasury bonds, or TIPS, have gone down in price since then too. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists just raised their 2021 forecast for core PCE inflation - the Fed's preferred measure - to 4.25% from 3.9%. But their end-year projections for the following three years are 2.00%, 2.15% and 2.20% - hardly runaway inflation.
This is the kind of outlook that suggests current price pressure will indeed prove transitory, which hedge funds and speculators - at least for now - appear to be buying into.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Monday, but remained just below last week’s highs given the on-going concerns over China’s property sector ahead of key U.S. employment data
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.995, after climbing last week to its highest level since September 2020.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 111.09, after climbing to a 19-month high last week,  EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1607, after falling to a 14-month low last week, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3563, just above a 9-month low, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7266.
The dollar has benefited from risk aversion after shares in the highly indebted China Evergrande were halted in Hong Kong, following on from the property developer missing a key interest payment for the second time last week.
This rekindled market worries about the possibility of global contagion as Evergrande is struggling to refinance over $300 billion in liabilities.
That said, the focus for most of this week will be on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release, with a strong number likely to confirm the view that the Federal Reserve will start its asset purchase tapering before the year end, and then rate hikes starting in 2022 or early in 2023. 
This labor release is expected to show continued improvement in the job market, with a forecast for 460,000 jobs to have been added in September, up from 235,000 jobs added the previous month.
“Technically the dollar looks on the verge of a significant break-out and a strong U.S. jobs report could cement that trend,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
In the week ahead, the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday and is expected to keep policy steady, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to hike by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, but remained near the highs hit during the previous week, thanks to renewed concerns about China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt woes and the latest U.S. jobs report, due later in the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 94.052 by 11:39 PM ET (3:39 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 111.06.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.7258 while the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.6934.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4467 with Chinese markets closed for a holiday. The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3536.
Shares in developer China Evergrande Group were halted in Hong Kong earlier in the day. No reason was given for the suspension, which re-triggered fears about global contagion from the developer’s debt woes.
""There's a bit of nervousness,"" even if most traders still think China Evergrande’s systemic risk can be contained, Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim told Reuters.
""It's part of the wall of worry,"" which the market could eventually ""climb"" if the COVID-19 backdrop improves, growth stabilizes and inflation concerns subside, but which for now is keeping investor sentiment fairly dour, he added.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision on Tuesday, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand following a day later and the Reserve Bank of India will hand down its decision on Friday.
The U.S. will also release its latest jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, on Friday, and is likely to be good enough for the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin asset tapering before the end of 2021.
""The question is whether there is a number that alters the Fed's view on tapering its bond purchases in November, and what a really weak or hot number means amid the backdrop of rising stagflation fears,"" Pepperstone head of research, Chris Weston told Reuters.
""If U.S. treasuries find further buyers this week into non-farm payrolls, the dollar may go on sale this week."""

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Friday, on course for its best week since June, as traders position for a tighter U.S. monetary policy in the near future.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 94.315, near its highest level since September 2020 having gained over 1% so far this week, the largest weekly rise since late June.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 111.16, with the yen boosted by Japan's business mood improving for a fifth straight quarter in September. EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1579, near its lowest levels since July 2020, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3449, just above a 9-month low, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7198, just above one-month lows.
Foreign exchange traders have started positioning for the Federal Reserve to begin tapering its asset purchases before the year end, and for interest rate hikes starting in the second half of 2022. 
Fed chief Jerome Powell stated Wednesday that resolving ""tension"" between high inflation and still-elevated unemployment is the most urgent issue facing the central bank right now.
U.S. second-quarter growth was revised slightly higher on Thursday, and the focus Friday will be on the release of the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the inflation measure the Federal Reserve uses to set policy.
This is expected to rise 0.2% in August and 3.6% year over year, unchanged on an annual basis from July, which was the highest level since May 1991.
Elsewhere, USD/CZK traded flat at 21.8660, after the crown posted sharp gains on Thursday on the back of the Czech National Bank hiking interest rates by 75 basis points, its biggest interest rate hike since 1997, after a spike of inflation. 
The increase was larger than the already big 50-basis point move that markets had priced in. It lifted the bank's two-week repo rate to 1.50%.

""Keep an eye on the USD index … the base this currency is building has been very impressive, and it implies we could continue to see dollar strength in the coming months,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said.
The greenback has been supported by a sharp increase in Treasury yields amid an increase in real rates.
“US interest rates have moved sharply higher during the past two weeks, driven almost entirely by real rates,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
Since September 15, the real 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has increased by 20 basis points to 0.85%.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of central banks sketched out a potential operating manual for digital cash on Thursday as they aim to strike a balance between keeping up with cryptocurrencies and concerns that the new technology could upend commercial lenders.
Worried that the explosion of bitcoin and its ilk could weaken their control of money, policymakers from Beijing to Washington are exploring central bank digital currencies, known as CBDCs. 
And while a widely-used digital dollar or euro may still be years away, work by central banks is gathering pace as consumers increasingly ditch coins and notes in favour of digital payments on debit or credit cards and mobile phones.
The seven central banks - including those in the United States, Britain and the ECB in the euro zone, but not China - said publicly-used ""retail"" CBDC must harness both public and private players to mesh with existing payment systems.
The tech should be useable with existing domestic payments systems, with strategies for adoption tailored to on-the-ground economic conditions, said the central banks, working alongside the Bank for International Settlements. 
The existing financial system must be given time to adjust to the introduction of CBDC, they said, flagging risks of what could amount to slow-motion bank runs if commercial bank customers suddenly shifted savings to the new tech. 
""Regardless of the design, developing and running a CBDC system would be a major undertaking for a central bank,"" they said, stressing the involvement of private operators must be closely monitored to ensure public trust in the tech. 
How a central bank digital currency works: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgngxympq/Pasted%20image%201633001136766.png 
STABILITY RISKS 
Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that are usually run by private actors, CBDCs would be equivalent to cash, issued and backed by central banks. They differ from the electronic money used in billions of transactions daily that is mostly funnelled via commercial banks.
The People's Bank of China is the most advanced among major economies on CBDCs, and is planning its biggest digital yuan trial at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will ""soon"" release research examining the costs and benefits of a CBDC, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week.
Commercial banks, fretting that a retail-focused CBDC could cannibalise their deposit bases, are trying to exert influence on their design.

The central banks sought to downplay the threat of retail-focused CBDC to lenders' business models. 
""Our analysis suggests the impacts on bank disintermediation and lending could be manageable for the banking sector,"" they said, with any impact likely limited in ""plausible"" levels of adoption.

708,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 05:02AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's ongoing economic problems were caused by ""outside factors"" and two waves of COVID-19 infections, but the military government takes full responsibility and is working hard to address them, a spokesman said on Thursday.
Speaking after the kyat currency hit new lows this week, the ruling military council's spokesman Zaw Min Tun said the central bank had been unable to meet local demand for dollars.
Myanmar's currency has lost more than 60% of its value since the beginning of September, driving up food and fuel prices in an economy that has tanked since a Feb. 1 military coup.
""The government is working its best to solve this situation as best as possible,"" Zaw Min Tun told a regular news conference.
""As it is happened under this government, the current government will have to take responsibility."" 
Many gold shops and money exchanges have closed in Myanmar due to the turmoil, while the slumping kyat has been a hot topic on social media networks, where users on Thursday posted images of panic-buying of fuel, or gas stations closing due to shortages. 
Rising prices of goods and fuel have posed major challenges to previous military governments in Myanmar, with the cost of cooking gas among the triggers of a monk-led ""Saffron Revolution"" in 2007. 
Zaw Min Tun said the economy had worsened due to outside factors as well as the coronavirus, but did not specify what those were. 
""We have responsibility to build it back,"" he said of the economy. 

The World Bank predicted on Monday the economy would slump 18% this year and Myanmar would see Southeast Asia's biggest contraction in employment.
In August, the Central Bank of Myanmar tried tethering the kyat 0.8% either side of its reference rate against the dollar, but abandoned that earlier this month as pressure on the exchange rate mounted.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, but remained near its one-year high on the back of ongoing safe-haven demand and expectations for tighter U.S. monetary policy in the near future.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded just lower at 94.320. It hit the 94.435 mark on Wednesday, the first time it has done so since September 2020.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 111.91, after climbing to its highest level since February 2020. EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1599, just above a 10-month low, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3443, helped by second-quarter GDP growing 5.5%, more than expected, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.4% to 0.7205. 
Stock markets have edged higher Thursday, rebounding after Tuesday’s equity-market rout a day earlier, but U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, with the benchmark 10-year yield still close to its highest levels since June, providing the dollar with support.
Pushing yields higher are concerns that the Federal Reserve could start tapering its bond-buying program before the end of the year in a period of slowing global economic growth and persistently high inflation. 
Also helping the safe-haven dollar is the current impasse over the U.S. debt ceiling that threatens to shut the government down. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said late Wednesday that lawmakers had reached an agreement to extend government spending until Dec. 3, but this just kicks the can down the road and the threat of a catastrophic default remains real, albeit one that has been averted many times before in similar situations.
“The uncertainty around the timing of debt-ceiling legislation may continue to unnerve a debt market that is already weighing inflation and tightening concerns,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Ultimately, this should contribute to keep any dollar weakness caused by improvements in the risk environment as short-lived, in our view.”
Also helping the greenback are concerns about the growth outlook in China, the second largest economy in the world, especially after factory activity unexpectedly contracted in September as high raw material prices and power cuts continued to pressure manufacturers.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4646, after the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.6 in September versus 50.1 in August, slipping into contraction for the first time since February 2020.
USD/CZK rose 0.2% to 25.5095 ahead of the Czech National Bank’s policy-setting meeting later Thursday, which is expected to see the bank raise its benchmark rate by half a point to 1.25%. That would be the biggest increase since 1997 after the recent spike in inflation.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 94.287 by 11:38 PM ET (3:38 AM GMT). It hit the 94.435 mark on Wednesday, the first time it has done so since September 2020.

The AUD/USD pair gained 0.42% to 0.7205 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.6884.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.4710. Chinese economic data released earlier in the day showed that September’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 49.6. The non-manufacturing PMI and the Caixin manufacturing PMI were at 53.2 and 50 respectively.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.25% to 1.3455. However, concerns remain about soaring natural gas prices alongside petrol shortages in the U.K. that have lasted almost a week.
The safe-haven dollar saw a bid over concerns that the Fed could start tapering in a period of slowing global economic growth and persistently high inflation. It also got a boost as an impasse over the U.S. debt ceiling that threatens to shut the government down continues.
U.S. Senate Republicans blocked efforts by the Democrats to avert a potentially crippling U.S. credit default as federal funding expires on Thursday and borrowing authority on around Oct. 18.
""King U.S. dollar is in the house, it doesn’t matter the currency, just buy dollars has been the vibe,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""We’re effectively seeing both the left and right side of the U.S. dollar 'smile' theory [which says that the dollar does well in good times or bad times for the U.S. economy, but not in between] working in earnest,"" with ""stagflation concerns"" on the rise and the Fed making it clear that it will begin asset tapering in November 2021 and investors pricing interest rate hikes in December 2022, the note added.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde spoke at an ECB forum on Wednesday alongside Bank of England and Bank of Japan Governors Andrew Bailey and Haruhiko Kuroda. The central bank chiefs said that they were keeping an eye on inflation, but were cautiously optimistic that the phenomenon will be temporary."
711,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The highly public unraveling of China Evergrande Group is shaking markets worldwide, but analysts are confident the nation’s own currency will be spared.
The yuan has been the subject of almost no short recommendations. Even among bearish analysts, few suggest betting against it directly amid soaring trade surpluses, negative carry for short positions and potential intervention by the People’s Bank in the case of Evergrande’s collapse.
“The Evergrande episode is likely a short-term sentiment hit for CNY FX rather than an instigator of durable currency weakness,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) analyst Tiffany Wang last week.
That could seem counter intuitive. Evergrande has debts of more than $300 billion, equivalent to over 2% of China’s gross domestic product, not to mention its potential impact on suppliers across local markets and industries. Yet while the offshore yuan lost 0.9% in the four days before the company’s first missed interest-payment deadline, it has since bounced back with one-month implied volatility also returning to early-September levels.
One main reason for the yuan’s renewed stability is China’s central bank, which is likely to step in given any sudden depreciation,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts led by chief Asia economist Chetan Ahya wrote in a research note released Sept. 23. 
Trade and Tensions
Morgan Stanley recommends going long the Chinese currency, paired with short positions in the euro and Taiwan dollar as “underlying flows remain healthy for CNY.” The euro has lost 1.8% versus the yuan in the third quarter, while the Taiwan dollar has gained about 0.4%.
The release of a senior Huawei Technologies Co. executive last Friday also rekindled hopes of easing U.S.-China trade tensions, which could further aid the yuan. JPMorgan’s Wang recommends positioning through options for potential U.S. tariff reviews on select Chinese products. While the timing and outcome of tariff developments are highly uncertain, “waiting for such news is carry positive even if there is no eventual delivery,” according to a note dated Sept. 16.
A two-month CNH call option with 6.38 strike price, coupled with 6.30 reverse knock-out to reduce the cost, is favored by JPMorgan. The trade is essentially a bet that yuan will appreciate past 6.38 per dollar, but not go beyond 6.30, if Washington eases some of its tariffs on Chinese products. Year-to-date highs for the onshore and offshore yuan were both reached on May 31 near 6.35 per dollar.
Bearish Views
Still, investors will have to tread carefully.
“We cannot fully rule out a messier situation” with Evergrande, said Becky Liu of Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). In that case, she expects modest yuan depreciation fueled by a stronger dollar, increased risk-off sentiment and foreign investors selling Chinese assets.
Whether or not the company fails to repay its debts, Well Fargo’s Erik Nelson expects the yuan to drop to levels not seen since November 2020 over the next month, fueled by capital outflows and slower economic growth. Even with this “out of consensus call,” as he puts it, he prefers a short AUD/CAD trade rather than a direct bet against the yuan.
Other strategists see more risk to the yuan from rising U.S. yields than from the Evergrande contagion. Iris Pang, Chief Greater China economist at ING, expects mild depreciation through the end of the year as the U.S. begins tapering. Cui Li of CCB International Securities said she thinks Evergrande’s impact on the currency will be be “quite small,” but a rebounding dollar could exert downward pressure on the yuan.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields surged above 1.56% during Tuesday’s New York session to the highest since June 16. That has pulled the U.S.-China yield spread to the lowest level since February 2020. Back then, the Chinese yuan was weaker, trading around the 7 per dollar level.
For most analysts, China’s trade surplus - which has surged more than 50% since the pandemic on a 12-month rolling basis - will help its currency weather this crisis. 
“As long as the pandemic and the global supply chain disruption situation drags on, China’s trade surplus will keep the yuan up,” said Stephen Chiu of Bloomberg Intelligence.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar surged on Wednesday to a one-year high against major currencies, boosted by increased expectations for a reduction in the U.S. Federal Reserve's asset purchases starting in November and an interest rate hike, possibly in late 2022.
The greenback also fared well despite an impasse in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling that threatened to plunge the government into a shutdown.
The world's largest reserve currency, seen as a safe-haven bet at times of market stress, has strengthened in recent days as investors instead focused on fears of a global slowdown, a rise in energy prices and higher U.S. Treasury yields.
Traders are also concerned that the Fed will start to withdraw policy support just as global growth slows.
""Fed has sounded the starting gun on monetary policy normalization,"" Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), wrote in his latest research note.
""As the U.S. escapes the interest rate zero-bound, leaving the Eurozone and Japan behind, the global savings glut is set to be drawn towards the dollar, which can outperform the majority of other currencies in the coming year, and may start its move earlier than we expected,"" Juckes added.
The dollar index - which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major currencies - rose for the fourth consecutive day, to 94.435, its highest since late September of last year. It was last up 0.7% at 94.404.
Erik Nelson, macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York, sees a further 2% to 3% upside in the dollar index.
The greenback was also unfazed, even as U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked a bid by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats to head off a potentially crippling U.S. credit default, with federal funding due to expire on Thursday and borrowing authority on around Oct. 18.
The Senate could vote on Wednesday or Thursday on a bipartisan resolution to fund federal operations through early December, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
The euro was among the currencies to lose ground, falling below the $1.16 level, the lowest since late July 2020. It last traded down 0.8% at $1.1592.
The yen showed little reaction to the election of Fumio Kishida as leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which put him on course to become the country's next prime minister.
The yen, the currency most sensitive to U.S. yields as higher rates can attract flows from Japan, touched an 18-month low against a resurgent dollar. The dollar climbed as high as 112.04, its strongest level since late February last year, and was last up 0.4% at 111.99 yen.
The dollar also rose to a more than five-month high of 0.9355 francs. It was last up 0.7% at 0.9351.
Currency traders also took note of comments from major central bankers on Wednesday, who were panelists at a European Central Bank forum in Sintra, Portugal.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said they were keeping a close eye on inflation amid a surge in energy prices and the persistence of production bottlenecks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that he expected Britain's economy to recover its pre-pandemic level of output early next year, a little later than the central bank had predicted last month.
His new forecast reflects signs that Britain's economic recovery has slowed by more than expected following its initial rebound from the last COVID-19 lockdown.
Complicating the outlook for the BoE, inflation is also surging, fuelled by widespread supply chain disruption including the panic-buying of petrol over the last week.
Speaking at a European Central Bank panel with other major central bank chiefs, Bailey said the BoE would need to keep a close eye on these forces.
""I expect us to be back to the pre-pandemic level in the early part of next year, possibly a month or two later than we thought we would be at the start of August,"" Bailey said.
The BoE forecast in August that the economy would regain its pre-pandemic size in the final quarter of this year.
Bailey declined to comment on the likelihood that the BoE might raise interest rates before the end of this year, when its asset purchase programme will still be in its final stages.
Some investors interpreted the BoE's explicit reference to this possibility in September's policy minutes as a signal that an early rate rise would be under active consideration for November or December.
""The preferred tool will always be rates because we understand the effect of rates in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. But that's not to pre-judge what we will decide in November,"" Bailey said.

He added that the BoE would need to be very focused on inflation expectations and watch for potential second-round effects on inflation from supply shortages, including long queues at petrol stations.
Financial markets currently price in a first interest rate rise to 0.25% from 0.1% by February's BoE meeting, and see a 60% chance of one by December.

(Reuters) -The first phase of a multi-year research project the Boston Federal Reserve is doing with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the technology that could be used for a digital dollar is nearly done and could be released over the next month or so, a Boston Fed official said on Wednesday. 
The initial findings from the Boston Fed research are ""basically done"" and will include open-sourced code that could serve as a potential model for a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, said Jim Cunha, a senior vice president with the Boston Fed, during a virtual panel focused on payments. It will also focus on the system's ability to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second, he said. 
""We think it’s really important that what we learn we share with the rest of the world and that others can contribute to it,"" said Cunha. ""We'll be doing that some time over the course of the next month or so.""
The research, dubbed ""Project Hamilton,"" will look at the technical challenges that need to be addressed when building a CBDC and is separate from a discussion paper https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-release-paper-central-bank-digital-currency-soon-powell-says-2021-09-22 the Fed board is expected to release soon examining the policy questions surrounding a digital dollar. Both papers were initially due to be released over the summer.
Powell said last week that the discussion paper will launch a process for collecting feedback from the public about the potential uses of a digital dollar, as well as the risks and benefits. 

That input will help to inform the later phases of the research being done by the Boston Fed and MIT, which could tackle issues such as balancing the trade-offs between protecting users' privacy and preventing illegal activity, Cunha said. 
""We’re building a system that can handle any policy outcomes, so it’s very flexible,"" said Cunha.

A gauge of the dollar’s strength against major peers rose to the highest in almost 11 months on Wednesday. The dollar outperformed all of its Group-of-10 peers, with the New Zealand dollar and Norwegian krone among the biggest losers. The euro declined to a 10-month low. 
Stocks rose and Treasury yields fell on Wednesday following an equity-market rout a day earlier. Treasury yields still remain elevated, though, as yields on 10-year notes sit close to their highest levels since June. 
Japan’s yen has been particularly hard hit from the dollar rally, reaching its lowest level against the greenback since February 2020. Month-end portfolio rebalancing could lead to further dollar buying, as traders look to sell their yen-denominated equities bets.
Putting a timeframe on the dollar’s outlook is difficult given how recent the repricing is, but a stronger dollar is more likely than not through year-end, according to Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe. 
“We will see some idiosyncratic risk clearly, especially around currencies where the repricing has been aggressive due to bullish positioning prior,” he said in an email, noting the British pound and New Zealand dollar. “But generally we are shifting our views onto a more sustained bout of U.S. dollar strength, with the pro-cyclical rally to be delayed now until 2022.”

716,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's currency has lost more than 60% of its value since the beginning of September, driving up food and fuel prices in an economy that has tanked since a military coup eight months ago.
Many gold shops and money exchanges closed on Wednesday due to the turmoil, while the kyat’s dive trended on social media with comments ranging from stark warnings to efforts to find some humour as yet another crisis hits the strife-torn nation. 
""This will rattle the generals as they are quite obsessed with the kyat rate as a broader barometer of the economy, and therefore a reflection on them,"" Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert at the International Crisis Group, said.
In August, the Central Bank of Myanmar tried tethering the kyat 0.8% either side of its reference rate against the dollar, but gave up on Sept. 10 as pressure on the exchange rate mounted.
The shortage of dollars has become so bad that some money changers have pulled down their shutters.
""Due to the currency price instability at the moment...all Northern Breeze Exchange Service branches are temporarily closed,"" the money changer said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Those still operating were quoting a rate of 2,700 kyat per dollar on Tuesday, compared to 1,695 on Sept. 1 and 1,395 back on Feb. 1 when the military overthrew a democratically elected government led by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
WORLD BANK WARNS ECONOMY TO SLUMP 18%
The World Bank predicted on Monday the economy would slump 18% this year and said Myanmar would see the biggest contraction in employment in the region and the number of poor would rise. 
The increasing economic pressures come amid signs of an upsurge in bloodshed, as armed militias have become bolder in clashes with the army after months of protests and strikes by opponents of the junta. 
""The worse the political situation is, the worse the currency rate will be,"" said a senior executive at a Myanmar bank, who declined to be identified.
Myanmar is also struggling to deal with a second wave of coronavirus infections that started in June with the response by authorities crippled after many health workers joined protests. Reported cases have comes off their highs though the true extent of the outbreak remains unclear.
In the immediate months after the Feb. 1 coup, many people queued up to withdraw savings from banks https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/lines-tokens-money-brokers-myanmars-crumbling-economy-runs-low-cash-2021-05-14 and some bought gold, but a jewellery merchant in Yangon said many desperate people were now trying to sell their gold.
The central bank gave no reason to why it abandoned its managed float strategy earlier this month, but analysts believe its foreign currency reserves must be seriously depleted.
Central bank officials did not answer calls seeking comment, but World Bank data shows it had just $7.67 billion in reserves at the end of 2020.
After coming off its managed float, the central bank still spent $65 million, buying kyat at a rate of 1,750 to 1,755 per dollar between Sept. 13-27. 
The bank executive said the central bank's efforts had limited impact in a currency market shorn of confidence.
The economic crisis has driven up the price of staples, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this week that around three million people now require humanitarian assistance in Myanmar, up from one million before the coup. 

In a country where gross domestic product per capita was just $1,400 last year, a 48-kg bag of rice now costs 48,000 kyat, or around $18, up nearly 40% since the coup, while gasoline prices have nearly doubled to 1,445 kyat per litre.
""If you have money, you buy gold, you buy dollars, you buy (Thai) baht. If you do not have money, you will starve,"" said Facebook user Win Myint in a post.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, but remained near its best levels this year as higher U.S. Treasury yields, potential Federal Reserve tapering and global growth concerns stemmed any losses.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.718, just under its 11-month high of 93.805 reached during the last session.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 111.44, after earlier touching an 18-month high of 111.68, EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1682, after falling to a one-month low overnight, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3553, rebounding a touch after dropping 1.2% on Tuesday, its largest daily fall in more than a year, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7255. 
U.S. Treasury yields edged lower early Wednesday, with the benchmark 10-year yielding below 1.53%, but the dollar has been generally supported by the recent surge in yields, up more than 25 basis points in five sessions to peak at around 1.56%.
These gains followed the Federal Reserve indicating at its policy-setting meeting last week that it could begin asset tapering as soon as November, concluding around mid-2022, opening the way for interest rate hikes after that.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also highlighted “upside risks” to inflation in his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, not helped by surging global energy prices.
The dollar is also benefiting from its status as a safe haven as concerns grow about the growth outlook in China, the second largest economy in the world, with power outages hitting production and property developer China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) still at risk of collapse despite raising $1.5 billion with the sale of a stake in a banking affiliate. The proceeds will not be available to pay bondholders, however.
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4644, with the yuan only hit marginally after China’s central bank injected 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) into the financial system on Wednesday, for a ninth day in the longest run since December.
Closer to home, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the debt ceiling must be raised or suspended by sometime in October or the U.S. government will be unable to pay its bills.
“Financial markets are already ‘concerned’ judging by the rising yields on short-term Treasury bills from mid-October,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “In previous years, uncertainty has caused interest rates on some Treasury bills to spike in anticipation of reaching the debt limit.”
 "
718,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's regulators are tightening control over the inner workings of its currency market, pressuring banks to trade less and in smaller ranges, two banking sources told Reuters, as part of a sweeping push to curb speculation.
The moves follow recent efforts at curtailing financial risks that include dampening commodity price rises, banning cryptocurrency transactions and restricting property speculation. And they bring the campaign deeper into day-to-day operations on the dealing desks of a $30 trillion market.
It is also the latest example of scrutiny focused on foreign exchange, which analysts said might be aimed at tightening the leash on the yuan at a sensitive time when U.S. policymakers prepare to withdraw monetary stimulus and China seems poised to add more.
Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-brokers-drop-yuan-forecasts-avoid-regulators-ire-2021-09-15 earlier in September that brokers have dropped currency forecasts following regulatory pressure and reports the scrutiny of the interbank market for the first time. Authorities have also been hinting that banks and companies should prepare for volatility.
In recent months many banks have also withdrawn individual FX trading products, closing another avenue for speculation.
Recently, representatives of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) have embedded themselves on currency trading floors from commercial banks to major state-owned lenders, said the two sources at separate market-making banks.
They said the officials stayed for months, far longer than supervisory visits previously, and urged them to price customer deals faster and in tighter ranges, or spreads.
The bid-ask spread is the difference between the price the bank charges clients and price in the market, so narrowing it reduces trading banks' profit. It could also help hem the yuan in a tighter trading range, but at the same time moves risk from customers to the bank while a deal is being executed.
One source said the regulator reminded them their role is to keep things steady or ""smoothen fluctuations without pushing the yuan to either side"". They added that regulators had not visited foreign banks this year. Banks in Hong Kong do not participate in China's onshore interbank market.
The other source said they were told to cut volumes to reduce the turnover of interbank trades - once a badge of honour for so-called market makers who provide liquidity to each other and the wider trading pool.
""(Now) you get calls from regulators if you trade too much,"" he said. Both requested anonymity as they are not authorised to talk to the media about the matter.
SAFE told Reuters by fax it has ""always supported"" market participants in trading ""reasonably"", and to promote the integrity, fairness, order and efficiency of the foreign exchange market.
The scrutiny comes at a delicate time for China's currency, which sits near multi-year highs but faces headwinds as markets prepare for the United States to begin tapering pandemic-era policy support just as China seems ready to step in and ease as its economy slows.
The People's Bank of China has pumped a net 750 billion yuan ($116 billion) into the banking system since mid-September as markets have been rattled by fears of contagion from a debt crisis at China Evergrande and economic damage from power cuts.
""Policymakers would rather maintain a loosening bias in the cash conditions, but one side-effect is that too much cash could prompt speculation,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, noting that is something the latest crackdown might curb.
""The central bank has said multiple times not to bet on currency appreciation or depreciation,"" he said.
MORE INTENSE
As President Xi Jinping makes his case for a third term, the country's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is driving what some observers describe as a mini revolution, curbing the excesses of capitalism and returning China to its socialist roots.
Crackdowns on tutoring and on tech firms have unnerved investors and hammered share prices in those sectors. But regulators have also been changing the way markets operate.
""(It's) certainly becoming more intense this year,"" said one currency trader at a mid-sized bank, noting extra training sessions, stricter scrutiny from compliance and even chatter among peers that was becoming more guarded.
Since SAFE head Pan Gongsheng warned in June against laying bets on the yuan's direction, brokers in China have shied away from publishing once-routine currency forecasts.
Around the same time a handful of banks also began quietly closing foreign exchange trading businesses that had let individual clients bet on non-yuan currency pairs.
Turnover in such accounts was small and has now all but vanished, with the Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank among those to post public statements about restricting access to trade.
SAFE said it had not offered any guidance to commercial banks regarding personal foreign exchange businesses, and nor did the banks provide clear reasons for their decisions.

Yet all used similar language in their explanations.
Huaxia Bank, which said it will suspend its personal FX business in December cited market changes, while ICBC and China Merchants bank both said the move was necessary ""to respond to changes in market conditions.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, but remained near its strongest levels in 2021. Climbing U.S. Treasury yields investor nervousness about the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning asset tapering as economic challenges start to emerge, all capped losses for the safe-have asset.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 93.722 by 12:56 AM ET (4:56 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 111.52. Japan’s incumbent Liberal Democratic Party will vote for a leader, likely to be the country’s next prime minister, on Wednesday.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.7250 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.6951.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12% to 6.4672 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3548.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were up 25 basis points in five sessions to 1.5548% as the Fed preps to begin asset tapering before the end of 2021 and inflation worries continue.
""Compared to the unencumbered optimism at the start of 2021, it is a twilight zone for markets as the year approaches its end,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note.
""Persistently stagflationary dynamics, i.e. a lower growth but a hawkish Fed, leave little room for a dollar downtrend,"" the note added.
Surging energy prices, concern about the growth outlook in China, with developer China Evergrande Group facing its latest bond interest payment interest on Wednesday, and rolling power outages that are impacting output all remained on investors’ radars.
The pound took a particular beating overnight due to concerns over the economic impact of a shortage of gas and a scramble for fuel.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is due to hand down its policy decision in the following week and is widely expected to hike interest rates.
""NZD/USD remains stuck around $0.7000, as the effect of the hawkish RBNZ is offset by increasing expectations of the Fed,"" Westpac analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
Meanwhile, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will participate in an ECB forum later in the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar surged to its highest in more than 10 months on Tuesday, tracking the rise in Treasury yields, as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve possibly reducing asset purchases in November and an interest rate hike likely to follow.
On Tuesday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a three-month peak, and were last up four basis points at 1.5253%. 
The rise in yields accelerated after the U.S. central bank turned hawkish at last week's monetary policy meeting, reinforcing the market view for a sooner-than-expected Fed taper.
""Yields are generally moving higher as rising inflation expectations weigh on the relative attractiveness of government bonds, but are climbing even faster in the United States as traders bet the Federal Reserve will move more quickly than its global counterparts,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""Rate differentials are tilting toward the dollar, weakening low-yielders and putting pressure on economies with significant borrowing needs."" 
In afternoon trading in New York, the U.S. dollar index reached its highest level since early November and was last up 0.3% at 93.719.
Risk aversion exacerbated the currency market moves, said Neil Jones, head of FX sales at Mizuho, with Wall Street shares down.
The Australian dollar, which is seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, dropped 0.6% at US$0.7240.
The euro was down 0.1% versus the dollar at $1.1681 . Earlier in the session, it hit a six-week low of $1.1668, after comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, saying that U.S. inflation at the end of the year would be closer to 4%, double the Fed target.
""One theme that seems to be gaining traction is that the market lies on the cusp of reassessing the path for the Fed tightening cycle,"" ING strategists wrote in a note to clients.
""A big move higher in the short-end is the key reason why we are bullish on the dollar, particularly from 2Q next year, but we will closely monitor and reassess whether that move needs to come earlier - largely a function of timing the take-off in short-end rates."" 
The Japanese yen weakened to its lowest level in nearly three months against the dollar. The greenback was last up 0.5% at 111.57 yen..
The yen is the G10 currency most correlated with U.S. two-year and 10-year Treasury yields, MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said in a note to clients.
Minutes from the Bank of Japan's July meeting showed that some central bank policymakers warned of the risk of a delay in the country's economic recovery.
The British pound, meanwhile, was down 1.2% at $1.3532. The currency jumped last week after a hawkish tone by the Bank of England, but analysts struck a cautious note on the currency as Britain struggled with supply chain chaos due to a shortage of truck drivers.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can slash the time needed for cross border payments to seconds from days and cut costs, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said, citing a pilot scheme to test the digital forms of fiat currencies.
The trial showed cross border transactions could be made in a few seconds, instead of three to five days, as CBDCs help skirt complicated arrangements under which payments are passed via a network of banks, the BIS said in a report on Tuesday.
CBDCs also helped reduce costs by up to 50%, it added.
Typically, global banks with no network in a given country channel payments there via a local bank that acts on its behalf.
But the process has become long and complicated with banks cutting ties with potentially risky partners and withdrawing from some markets due to compliance and cost reasons. 
""Enabling faster and cheaper cross-border wholesale payments, including to jurisdictions that don't benefit from a vibrant correspondent banking system, would be positive for trade and economic development,"" said Benedicte Nolens, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, Hong Kong Centre.
Many governments and central banks around the world are exploring the use of CBDCs. Some, like China https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-setting-pace-central-bank-digital-currency-japan-ex-regulator-endo-2021-06-29, are testing retail-focused CBDCs designed to replicate cash in circulation, while others are considering using so-called wholesale CBDCs to improve the internal workings of their financial systems or cross border financial flows.
The BIS-backed pilot scheme, which initially involved the Hong Kong and Thai central banks, used blockchain to synchronise transaction data across participants in the payment chain. 
It helped to slash costs by up to half by reducing some liquidity management, compliance and foreign exchange operations, BIS said in its report.

The project has since expanded to include China and the UAE's central banks, and is now known as the ""mBridge"".
The next steps, the report said, include ""developing the prototype into a production-ready solution"".

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, boosted by rising U.S. Treasury yields as traders position for the Federal Reserve tapering its bond-buying program this year after last week’s policy-setting meeting. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 93.472, just under a one-month high.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 111.29, climbing to levels not seen since early July, GBP/USD traded largely flat at 1.3696, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7295. Data released earlier in the day showed that Australian retail sales contracted 1.7% month-on-month in August, hit by Covid-19 restrictions, but better than the 2.5% fall expected.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1686, with traders having to balance the uncertainty surrounding Germany’s political climate following Sunday’s general election and an unexpected rise in German consumer confidence.
The GfK consumer sentiment index rose to 0.3 points in October, its highest level in a year and a half, a survey showed on Tuesday, from a revised -1.1 points a month earlier. 
However, the major driving force behind the recent moves in the foreign exchange markets has been the rise in U.S. Treasury yields, where the  benchmark 10-year briefly topped 1.5% on Monday, a level not seen since June 2021, and the two-year yield rose to its highest since March 2020. 
This follows the Federal Reserve indicating at its policy-setting meeting last week that it could begin asset tapering as soon as November, concluding around mid-2022, opening the way for interest rate hikes after that.
“Unless the nonfarm payrolls report for September falls off a cliff, the November taper decision seems carved in stone,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, adding “a $40 billion-a-quarter tapering process commencing in November (with initial focus on MBS purchases) and a first lift-off in the late autumn of 2022 seems likely to bet on for now.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify later Tuesday in front of the Senate Banking Committee, and is expected to highlight ""upside risks"" to inflation as bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other drivers of price pressures continue, but will continue to suggest these pressures will prove transitory, according to prepared remarks. 
Powell's appearance comes a day after two regional Fed presidents resigned, less than a week after revelations that they had actively traded stocks and other financial instruments while sitting on the Fed's policy-making committee. 
U.S. data later in the session includes consumer confidence for September, as well the S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, with the yen trading near an almost three-month low to the dollar, with rising U.S. bond yields attracting Japanese investors.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 93.448 by 11:54 PM ET (3:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.21% to 111.23, climbing above the 111.07 mark hit on Monday, a level not touched since Jul. 5.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7299, with data released earlier in the day showed that Australian retail sales contracted 1.7% month-on-month in August. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7017.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.4545 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 1.3704.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield briefly topped 1.5% on Monday, a level not seen since June 2021, and the two-year yield rose to its highest since March 2020. This attracted investors from Japan, with 10-year Japanese government bond yields remaining near zero due to the Bank of Japan's yield curve control policy.
""The main impact of higher Treasury yields on currencies has been to see USD/JPY make further upward progress, now banging against 111,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
""111 will be a tough (nut) to crack, bearing in mind the pair has spent only two days with time above this level so far in 2021, and with 10-year Treasury yield having been as high as 1.77%,” the note added.
The climb in U.S. yield was attributable to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s more hawkish stance in its latest monetary policy handed down during the previous week. The central bank could begin asset tapering as soon as November 2021 and hike interest rates sooner than expected.
Some investors predicted an upward trend for the dollar could continue over time.
""As much as asset tapering in and of itself is not a surprise, an earlier end to its program will reinforce that downside risks to the dollar have diminished,"" TD Securities senior FX strategist Mazen Issa said in a note.
""If the last tapering cycle was any indication, about half of the dollar's cyclical upswing was observed three months afterward,"" the note added, with TD expecting the Fed to end its quantitative easing program by June 2022."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Citi launched on Monday a global technology hub at its Bahrain offices, the first of its kind in the region and with the aim of employing 1,000 coders over the next decade.
The hub, based at Citi's Bahrain premises, was set up in partnership with Tamkeen, a government-funded labour fund, and Bahrain's Economic Development Board (EDB), which are also investing, a Citi executive said.
Under the plan, Citi will hire at least 100 people in coding-related roles each year over the next 10 years.
The new hires will initially work on two of the bank's main platforms, Citi Velocity and Citi FX Pulse, said Ala'a Saeed, Citi FX's global head of electronic platforms and distribution.
""Selecting our two flagship systems to develop out of here in Bahrain is a huge endorsement of the talent and the calibre of people that we've found here,"" he said.
Tamkeen will subsidise a portion of the salaries and cover training costs locally and abroad, said Tamkeen Chief Executive Hussain Mohammed Rajab, without disclosing figures.
Bahrain, where Citi has operated for 50 years, has sought to market itself as a financial technology hub for the Middle East and North Africa in a bid to revive its reputation as a regional banking and business centre.

The heavily indebted state, which does not have the oil or gas resources of its Gulf neighbours, received a $10 billion bailout in 2018 from some of its Gulf allies to avoid a credit crunch.

Investing.com -- The dollar opened flat against the euro on Monday after a narrow win for the center-left in Germany's parliamentary elections.
The center-left Social Democratic Party took the biggest share of the vote, with preliminary estimates showing it on 26%, two percentage points ahead of the center-right Christian Democratic bloc. As such, the party of the retiring Angela Merkel looks likely to go into opposition for the first time in 16 years. 
Any fear of radical change under a new government was tempered by the poor performance of the far left Linke party, which all but ruled out any chance of it joining the new government.
""The tail risk of significant tax hikes, a denser web of regulations, reform reversals and a tight lid on housing rents has evaporated,"" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in Berlin.
However, the tightness of the result means that the next government will need three parties to command a majority in the Bundestag. Both of the third- and fourth-largest parties, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, have signaled they will work with either of the bigger parties. That suggests that negotiations on coalition-building are likely to be complex and time-consuming. 
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the euro was at $1.1711, unchanged from late Friday in Europe. It was also effectively unchanged against sterling at 0.8561, failing to gain ground despite the increasing signs of crisis coming out of the U.K. economy. Well over half the gas stations across the country were reported to be without fuel at the weekend after reports of shortages triggered a nationwide wave of panic-buying. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, having signalled a retreat on allowing EU truck drivers to work in the U.K. on Friday temporarily, was reported earlier as planning to dispatch military drivers to ensure deliveries.
Elsewhere, both the dollar and the euro rose against the Swiss franc as risk aversion receded in response to the deal signaling a slight relaxation of the tensions between the U.S. and China on Friday. Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou will be released and allowed to return to China, after a compromise deal. Meng had been arrested in Canada nearly three years ago at the request of President Donald Trump's Justice Department.  
USD/CHF rose 0.3% to 0.9271 while EUR/CHF rose 0.3% to 1.0855. 
In emerging markets, the Russian ruble hit its highest in nearly a week as crude oil prices continued to rise, while the Turkish lira appeared to find a bottom after sliding dramatically in response to a surprise interest rate cut by the country's central bank on Thursday. USD/RUB fell 0.2% to 72.5972, while USD/TRY fell 0.1% to 8.8677.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, while the yen, a fellow safe-haven asset, sank to its lowest level in nearly three months.
Riskier assets, such as the Australian dollar, continued to recover from an almost one-month low as fears of the economic contagion from China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt situation receded slightly.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 93.222 by 12:11 AM ET (4:11 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 110.56.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.32% to 0.7281 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7020.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.12% to 6.4585 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.3677.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to 1.466% for a second day on Monday, its highest level since Jul. 2, 2021.
""The correlation between U.S. bonds yields and USD-JPY has picked up. USD-JPY looks a little stretched, so I’d be wary to chase here, but I would be looking for a re-test of 110.50 as a potential support zone within what is a progressively bullish trend,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
The higher U.S. yields also attracted Japanese investor money, also contributing to the yen’s fall.
""The U.S. dollar is likely to remain caught in the cross-currents of a more hawkish Fed and fading concerns around a potential Evergrande default,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA) analysts said in a client note.
Concerns that China Evergrande could default on its $305 billion of debt have cast a shadow over markets recently, although some of those fears seem to be receding. The People's Bank of China injected a net CNY100 billion ($15.46 billion) into the financial system on Monday, on top of the net CNY320 billion added last week.
However, investors continue to keep a wary eye on the situation.
""Nevertheless, the risks are skewed to a firmer dollar,"" with any renewed Evergrande worries unlikely to trigger the level of market volatility of the previous week, the CBA note added.
In Europe, the euro was little changed at $1.1724 even as Germany’s Social Democrats narrowly won over incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union of Germany party in Sunday’s election."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday and was poised for its third straight week of gains against a basket of major currencies, as uncertainty over beleaguered Chinese property developer Evergrande helped the greenback bounce back from a sharp decline in the prior session. 
China Evergrande Group owes $305 billion and has run short on cash, missing a Thursday deadline for paying $83.5 million and leaving investors questioning whether it will make the payment before a 30-day grace period expires. A collapse of the company could create systemic risks to China's financial system. 
The safe-haven dollar had its biggest one-day percentage drop in about a month on Thursday after Beijing injected new cash into the financial system and Evergrande announced it would make interest payments on an onshore bond, boosting risk sentiment.
The offshore Chinese yuan weakened versus the greenback at 6.4641 per dollar.
The decline came a day after the greenback was lifted by Wednesday's announcement from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it will likely begin to trim its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and flagged interest rate increases may follow suit sooner than expected as the central bank moves away from its pandemic crisis policies.
""We are in one of the situations, and this doesn’t always happen, where the dollar is the beneficiary of multiple ideas,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.
""The U.S. economy does look better than most of its competitors, there is lingering fear out there over Evergrande and what else is out there in the rather untransparent Chinese economy and political system, plus the Fed appears finally ready."" 
The dollar index rose 0.237%, with the euro down 0.2% to $1.1713.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said the U.S. labor market has already met the central bank's test to pare its monthly bond purchases, and the discussion should now turn to how its massive bondholding could complicate the decision on when to hike rates. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester echoed the sentiment for a tapering this year, and said the central bank could start raising rates by the end of next year should the job market continue to improve as expected.
In prepared remarks in a listening session with a wide swath of economic players, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did not elaborate on his own economic or monetary policy outlook, which he had outlined at the close of the two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday.
Sterling weakened a day after hawkish comments from the Bank of England on Thursday pushed the pound to its biggest one-day percentage gain since Aug. 23.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.43% versus the greenback at 110.77 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3666, down 0.36% on the day. 
Cryptocurrencies slumped after China's most powerful regulators increased the country's crackdown on the digital assets, with a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and crypto mining.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, last fell 5.89% to $42,256.47. 
Smaller coins, which generally move in tandem with bitcoin, also dropped. Ether last fell 8.08% to $2,899.10 while XRP last fell 7.2889413% to $0.93.

Investing.com -- The dollar nudged higher against both developed and emerging markets currencies on Friday, as a fresh wave of caution hit global markets in the wake of real estate group China Evergrande’s failure to pay all holders of its dollar bond on Thursday.
By 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the US Dollar Index which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies was up 0.2% at 93.190, with its biggest gains coming against commodity currencies such as the Aussie, kiwi and loonie.
At least three holders of the bond told Reuters that they had still not been paid as of 8 AM in Hong Kong on Friday. The company has a 30-day grace period before it is officially classified as being in default, but the news was a further reminder of the challenges facing Chinese authorities as they try to stop contagion spreading through local financial markets.
The People’s Bank of China again intervened in the money market to keep conditions orderly, although the scale of its seven and 14-day repos, at only 71 billion yuan ($10.9 billion), was slightly lower than earlier in the week. The official yuan rate was essentially flat at 6.4633 to the dollar.
In Europe, the euro kept its weak tone as markets priced in the widening policy gap between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which President Christine Lagarde said is still far from starting a tightening cycle. The single currency was little changed from Thursday’s close at $1.1733, up over half a cent from the lows of Wednesday but still down by half a cent on the week.
Fed chair Jerome Powell, vice-chair Richard Clarida and board member Michelle Bowman are all due to speak late at an event that begins at 10 AM ET. The economic data calendar is headed by business confidence surveys from Germany and Italy, which come a day after IHS Markit’s flash purchasing managers index for September showed a sharper-than-expected slowdown in activity.
Sterling also struggled to make any headway against the dollar, staying flat at $1.3710, and edging up less than 0.1% against the euro.
The pound is caught in a two-way tussle between the threats of food and energy shortages and the prospect of higher inflation that would force the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank’s monetary policy committee made only a modest shift towards tightening its policy at Thursday’s meeting. Consumer confidence took a turn for the worst in September, according to GfK.
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira remained under pressure after the central bank’s surprise decision to cut interest its key rate by 1 percent on Thursday, despite having an inflation rate that’s currently running at over 20%. The dollar is up 2.5% against the lira this week and 5.7% over the last month, making the Turkish currency the worst performer of all G20 currencies."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, but remained near its lowest level in a week. Improving risk sentiment, as concerns about contagion from a potential China Evergrande Group default eased somewhat, erased the U.S. currency’s recent gains.

The People’s Bank of China injected fresh cash into the financial system on Thursday, a day after China Evergrande said it would make interest payments on an onshore bond. However, it was not clear whether the developer made coupon payments on dollar bonds due on Thursday, with more payments due in the following week.
However, risk sentiment took its cues from news around China Evergrande, according to some investors. “Chinese authorities are readying restructuring teams, alleviating fears of a Lehman's-type moment,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) analyst Tapas Strickland said in a note.
Two BOE policymakers voted to begin asset tapering, but the central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.10% as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday.
Elsewhere in Europe, Norges Bank raised its interest rate to 0.25% from the previous month’s 0% as it also handed down its policy decision on Thursday. More hikes could follow in the coming months, according to governor Oystein Olsen.
The U.S. Federal Reserve also hinted that asset tapering could begin in November, with interest rate hikes following in 2022, when it handed down its own policy decision on Wednesday.
""The hawkish soundings from BOE and Norgesbank reinforce the hawkish tilt in the Fed's dot plot. BOE appeared to open the door to an interest rate hike before the end of 2021,"" said NAB's Strickland in his note.
Several Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell who will give the opening remarks, are due to speak at a Fed Listens event later in the day."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top two Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Thursday said they had reached a deal to pay for President Joe Biden's sweeping social agenda, as the White House warned federal agencies to begin preparing for the possibility of a government shutdown.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi provided no details on how they would pay for Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion social spending plan. 
The party remains deeply divided about the bill, with moderates objecting to its size and progressives saying they won't accept anything smaller.
Even as that intra-party fight is playing out, Congress faces a pair of critical fast-approaching deadlines.
Funding for federal agencies will run out on Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't act, which would prompt a partial shutdown of the federal government. The U.S. Treasury has also warned that unless Congress raises or temporarily lifts the nation's borrowing limit it will run out of money to pay the government's bills by mid-October, which could cause a historic default. 
Republicans, who see the debt ceiling debate as a way to derail or scale back Biden's agenda, have vowed to oppose the debt ceiling and government funding measure that passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday.
The White House characterized its warning to federal agencies to prepare for a possible government shutdown as a formality. 
""It's just a reminder,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. ""We're seven days out, and we need to be prepared, of course, in any event of any contingency.""
Still, even with those risks approaching, Pelosi and Schumer sought to present Thursday's deal as a victory the morning after Biden met with congressional Democrats to try to hash out an agreement on the size of the package.
""We know that we can cover the proposals that the president has put forth,"" Pelosi said at a news conference. ""This is a giant step forward.""
Neither she nor Schumer offered details about the agreement or the overall price of the legislative package. Multiple members of the Democratic rank and file said they have not yet seen the framework. 
BRIDGING MODERATES, PROGRESSIVES
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said the framework was a bid to overcome differences between moderate and progressive Democrats, whose support is crucial to enacting Biden's legislation without Republican votes. Democrats' razor-thin majorities leave them just three votes to spare in the House and none in the Senate if all Republicans vote against them.
""The moderates are right when they say you ought to pay for the areas you want to invest in,"" Wyden told reporters. ""I also believe that the issue of paying for things has to bring in a new measure of fairness and everybody's got to pay their fair share, and that's what we're working on.""
Democratic moderates and progressives have sparred over the scale of the president's spending plan, as well as a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill the House is due to consider on Monday.

The framework announcement signals agreement between the chairs of the House and Senate tax-writing committees on a menu of options that could be used to pay for the emerging spending bill, according to a Senate Democratic aide. 
The Senate next week plans to vote on a measure to suspend the $28.4 trillion debt ceiling and keep federal agencies operating after Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell across the board on Thursday as improved risk sentiment in global financial markets wiped out its gains in the previous session after the U.S. Federal Reserve flagged plans to dial back its stimulus this year.
Investors' risk appetite improved after Beijing injected fresh cash into its financial system ahead of an $83.5 million bond coupon by embattled property giant Evergrande, at risk of becoming one of the world's largest-ever corporate defaults.
Worries about Evergrande's payment obligations and what systemic risks to China's financial system the property giant's difficulties pose have weighed on global financial risk sentiment in recent sessions.
""Commodity currencies are broadly higher while havens are weaker, leaving the USD trading generally lower after a firm close following the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee),"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, was 0.5% lower at 93.037. The index, which had risen 0.25% on Wednesday, was on pace for its biggest daily percentage drop in a month but remains close to the near 10-month high touched in late August.
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened versus the greenback at 6.4599 per dollar.
The dollar found little support from data that showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week amid a surge in California.
Thursday's improved mood boosted risk-sensitive commodity currencies, with the Australian dollar rising 0.9% and the New Zealand dollar up 1.0%.
The improved risk-appetite was reflected in Wall Street's major equity indexes, with the S&P 500 on track for a gain of more than 1% and its largest two-day percentage gain since late July. 
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said it will likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
While positive for the dollar, the boost from the Fed's announcement was undercut by hawkish messages from several central banks in Europe, and as Norway became the first developed nation to raise rates.
Norway's crown jumped to a 3-1/2 month high versus the euro on Thursday after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate and said more hikes will follow in the coming months.
Sterling extended its rise on Thursday after the Bank of England said two of its policymakers had voted for an early end to pandemic-era government bond buying and markets brought forward their expectations for an interest rate rise to March.

In emerging markets, the Turkish lira plummeted to a record low after a surprise interest rate cut of 100 basis points to 18% that came despite inflation hitting 19.25% last month

(Reuters) - Bearish bets on most Asian currencies rose marginally in the run-up to a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting where it hinted at possible rate hikes next year, while bullish bets on the yuan reversed, according to a Reuters poll on Thursday.
In its policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed left key rates unchanged and didn't announce the start of its asset purchase tapering, as expected, but Chair Jerome Powell said board members believed tapering could conclude in the mid of next year, paving the way for potential rate hikes.
The Fed's stance sent the dollar to its highest level in a month on Thursday, while its counterparts in Asia were broadly unchanged.
Mildly bullish positions in the yuan from two weeks ago were reversed, the poll of 11 respondents showed, on concerns over the fate of embattled property developer China Evergrande - Asia's biggest junk bond issuer and a key component of the Chinese economy.
Losses in the yuan, however, were capped after the heavily indebted property giant said it would make a bond coupon payment on Thursday, easing some fears of a possible default. Financial markets were closed in China and Taiwan through Tuesday and in South Korea until Wednesday for the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.
Short bets on the South Korean won climbed to their highest level since March last year, while bear positions rose significantly in the Thai baht and the Philippine peso.
As Thailand continues to reel under its most severe coronavirus outbreak, the government announced plans on Wednesday to speed up vaccinations and said it would introduce urgent stimulus measures.
Most of Thailand's 1.5 million infections and 15,000 deaths occurred since April, following a year of successful containment during which its key tourism sector collapsed.
The Philippines eased some curbs last week, allowing small businesses in its capital region to reopen after being shut for weeks as the country fights one of Asia's worst COVID-19 outbreaks.
Long bets on the Indonesian rupiah firmed after the country's central bank left policy steady earlier this week and kept its target range for 2021 growth unchanged after a downgrade in July.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com - The dollar eased lower in early European trade Thursday, retreating from a one-month high as traders digested the previous session’s Federal Reserve meeting and what it means for future monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.332, slipping from a one-month high of 93.526.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1711, bouncing off a one-month low, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.88, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7241, near multi-week lows.
The Fed left policy settings unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, and also decided against announcing the beginning of asset purchase tapering. However, the central bank said ""a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted"", with Chairman Jerome Powell adding that board members believed tapering could conclude around mid-2022, opening the way for interest rate hikes after that.
“The key story is the dot plot for interest rates. The FOMC is now split 9-9 on whether rates will be raised next year,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Note too that there is only one FOMC member who doesn’t expect a rate rise by the end of 2023, a massive change from just six months ago.”
Additionally, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3654 with traders positioning for a potential surprise at the Bank of England’s latest policy-setting meeting later in the session.
The BOE has a tricky task with the U.K. economic recovery stalling but inflation accelerating. That said, at least one of the nine members on the MPC is likely to vote for an early end to asset purchases.
USD/TRY rose 0.3% to 8.6693, with the Turkish central bank meeting later Thursday and widely expected to keep the policy rate at 19%. 
The country’s consumer price index climbed to 19.25% last month, climbing above the policy rate for the first time in nearly a year, suggesting Turkey’s central bank governor will keep interest rates at high levels despite pressure from the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Also, USD/NOK fell 0.4% to 8.6267 and EUR/NOK fell 0.1% to 10.1130, with the Norwegian central bank expected to become the first central bank of a G10 currency to hike interest rates post pandemic.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia hitting its highest level in a month as the U.S. Federal Reserve plans to begin asset tapering and raise interest hikes a lot sooner than its developed market peers.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 93.470 by 10:44 PM ET (2:44 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 109.89. Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 0.7234 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.6995.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.17% to 6.4690 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3626.
The Fed did not announce that it would begin asset tapering as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday. However, the central bank said ""a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted"", with Chairman Jerome Powell adding that board members believed tapering could conclude around mid-2022, opening the way for interest rate hikes after that.
""Powell didn't give any specifics about the start of the taper, he said there was broad agreement in the end of asset tapering, one which 'concludes around the middle of 2022,'"" NatWest Markets strategist John Briggs told Reuters.
""This is in our view more important than when the tapering starts, as it starts the clock on when the next hike may occur.""
The safe-haven yen also recorded its sharpest drop in more than three months after the Fed policy decision, falling 0.5% for the session. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept its interest rate steady at -0.10% as it handed down its latest policy decision on Wednesday. Both BOJ and the European Central Bank are not expected to hike their interest rates anytime soon.
The yen also suffered some losses on Wednesday after developer China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) main unit agreed to settle a bond interest payment with some domestic creditors. However, some $83.5 million in interest on an offshore bond remains due on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England and Norges Bank are among the central banks handing down their policy decisions later in the day, with the latter widely expected to deliver the first hike among G10 central banks."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was choppy on the heels of the latest policy announcement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, while risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar and Chinese yuan strengthened after China's Evergrande said it would make a bond coupon payment. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cleared the way to reduce its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected, with half of the 18 U.S. central bank policymakers projecting borrowing costs will need to rise in 2022.
""The tapering of quantitative easing seems very likely now in November but this was something of a given and remains couched in a lot of qualifying criteria in the event that various risks emerge, whether it is the debt ceiling debate, COVID outlook, the China property market intervening,"" said Steven Violin, portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management Company in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
The dollar index rose 0.094%, alternating between gains and declines after the announcement, with the euro down 0.1% to $1.1711.
Property giant and Asia's biggest junk bond issuer Evergrande said it ""resolved"" one payment due on Thursday via a private negotiation, easing concerns of default and possible contagion risk, while the People's Bank of China injected 90 billion yuan into the banking system to support markets. 
""Being able to make tomorrow's bond coupon payment, that definitely lifted risk sentiment overnight and you saw a typical follow-through reaction in risk currencies, so Canadian dollar high, Aussie dollar higher, Kiwi dollar higher - that was kind of an understandable reaction,"" said Erik Bregar, an independent FX analyst in Toronto. 
Still, uncertainty remains whether the developer will be able to pay the coupon on its offshore dollar bonds, due on Thursday. 
The Australian dollar rose 0.33% versus the greenback to $0.726 after rising as much as 0.49% to $0.7268 while the Canadian dollar rose 0.58% versus the greenback to 1.27 per dollar.
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened versus the greenback to 6.4628 per dollar.
The safe-haven Japanese yen weakened 0.50% versus the greenback to 109.78 per dollar in the wake of the Bank of Japan's decision to keep policy on hold.

Sterling was last trading at $1.3637, down 0.16% on the day ahead of a policy announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday, with expectations for a rate hike being pushed down the road by investors. 
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last rose 6.93% to $43,409.48 following three straight days of declines.

LONDON (Reuters) - Whether investors run for the hills or not after the past week's stock market shakeout, the episode provides a glimpse of where to run for cover - and the U.S. dollar came up trumps.
Dollar cash has routinely provided a haven during moments of global funding stress in the past - most recently as the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in March of last year.
The anxiety about a likely debt default by giant real estate firm China Evergrande - and even feared ripple effects across regional property firms, high-yield debt markets and banks - may not be quite on that scale. 
But the worries provided enough of a trigger for the steep pullback in world shares this month, and the dollar has been one of the few clear winners during the turbulence.
Although that stock correction has been widely predicted - with a majority in a recent  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) client survey saying they expected a 5-10% correction by year's end - the peak-to-trough plunge in MSCI's all-country index this month almost reached 5% on Monday. 
China property nerves are far from over, and financial volatility gauges are their highest in months.
The dollar has performed impressively as a haven, its main trading index gaining more than half a percent over the last week - and it was up almost 1% against gold, more than 1.4% against sterling, almost 7% against Bitcoin. 
Rival havens such as Japan's yen and the Swiss franc matched or outstripped that over the seven days just gone - but the dollar is clearly pumped up independently.
Of course, it's not all down to stress. The other big event of the week, the Federal Reserve's latest policymaking meeting, provides alternative fuel for the currency.
And some currency strategists see the dollar now getting a peculiar dual boost.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Paul Meggyesi and team reckon the greenback stands to gain from both corners of the so-called 'dollar smile' at the same time. 
That 'smile' describes the observation that the dollar tends to benefit from both extreme stress and tension at one extreme - when highly dollar-borrowed firms around the world scramble for dollar cash and liquidity - and from rapid world growth and risk taking at the other - where U.S. equity outperforms and U.S. rates push higher. In between, it's at its weakest. 
""Our confidence has increased that the dollar is on the cusp of a clearer break-out from either end of the dollar-smile, or indeed both ends concurrently,"" the JPMorgan team wrote.
On the left side of the smile, they see growing angst that world growth has peaked, policy support is being withdrawn, global stocks are overstretched and there are ""mounting global tail risks"" from China and related geopolitical fears.
On the right side stands the Fed and ""U.S. rate-driven exceptionalism"", they say. Fed policymakers this week are likely to signal the start of U.S. interest rate hikes from late next year and - crucially - up to six increases through to end-2024.
REAL TIME
Interest-rate support for the dollar is sometimes overlooked by focusing on nominal U.S. bond yields in isolation - especially in a year like this one, when the dollar held firm even as U.S. Treasury yields recoiled during the summer.
A better measure of the dollar's fortunes is often seen in relative real, or inflation-adjusted, bond yields between the U.S. and other major economies or regions. 
Having spent most of 2021 in negative territory, for example, the gap in two-year real yields between the U.S. and Germany turned positive last month, and this week the new premium on U.S. rates hit its highest level since June 2020. Ten-year equivalent U.S. rate premia are also at their highest since April.
This real rate view makes sense to those who see inflation expectations and growth potential dominating a currency's fortunes.
All things being equal, a tighter monetary policy today means lower inflation expectations, less erosion of the currency's value over time and a higher currency rate - all assuming growth potential is robust enough to sustain high rates and a higher 'terminal rate' in the tightening cycle. 
And that needs to be set against growth and inflation expectations in Europe or Japan.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Matthew Hornbach and team also see the dollar lifted further by the rising real rate view. And they think this week's Fed meeting could be a big moment.
""The September FOMC may be a key catalyst driving U.S. (real) yields higher, which we expect to boost the dollar broadly,"" they wrote this week.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, but moves have been capped ahead of the conclusion of the crucial Federal Reserve meeting later in the session. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 93.255, just off Tuesday’s high of 93.455, the strongest level since Aug. 23.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 109.54 after the Bank of Japan kept its negative interest rate and asset-buying targets unchanged earlier Wednesday, as largely expected, while flagging Covid-linked pressures on the economy.
EUR/USD edged lower 0.1% to 1.1721, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3651, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7252, rebounding from a three-week low, helped by an improvement in risk sentiment after China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) pledged to pay the scheduled coupon on a yuan bond that is due on Thursday.
The highlight Wednesday is the conclusion of the latest Fed meeting, with traders looking to see if the central bank signals the scaling back of asset purchases later this year.
“Markets may be more sensitive to any signals about the timing of monetary tightening as the Dot Plot projections are released along with other economic forecasts,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “It is quite a close call, but we do not expect the Median Dot Plot for the first rate hike to shift from 2023 to 2022.”
The central bank will release a statement at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), plus updated quarterly estimates, including its dot plot of rate projections, to be followed 30 minutes later by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.
Meanwhile, USD/HUF rose 0.1% to 300.88 and EUR/HUF climbed 0.1% to 352.70 after the Hungarian central bank increased its benchmark rate by just 15 basis points to 1.65% on Tuesday, halving the 30 bps hikes it has undertaken in each of the past three months.
The central bank is trying to balance surging inflation with the fallout from the latest wave of the global pandemic.
USD/CNY traded 0.1% higher at 6.4686, with the yuan weakening after the northeastern city of Harbin went into semi-shutdown after reporting new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases for the first time since early February. That outweighed any short-term relief at the news from Evergrande.

Investing.com – The dollar was flat Tuesday, and experts suggest that the greenback could struggle to advance as the improved pandemic backdrop may sour investor appetite for the safe-heavens including the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.07% to 93.19
The U.S. dollar has been riding a wave of safe-heaven demand as investors contend with economic headwinds including the difficulties in China. But in the near term, “the U.S. dollar is expected to slip slightly lower as pandemic uncertainties gradually recede,” Desjardins said.  
While the Federal Reserve’s plan to tighten its monetary policy measures could help offset less favorable factors for the greenback, such as a wide trade deficit and a higher inflation, the boost to the dollar from Fed tightening isn’t expected to be as meaningful as many expect.
“The dollar is threatened with trouble on two fronts: a slowdown in economic momentum combined with falling inflation should put an end to speculation about interest rate hikes fairly quickly - perhaps even faster than we expect,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting on Tuesday, and is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged when its delivers its monetary policy statement on Wednesday.
But with the Fed’s plan to taper largely priced in, a raft of updates to the central bank’s economic and interest rate projections are likely to be closely watched.
“The SEP [summary of economic projections] is likely to show an expectation for still solid growth and elevated inflation,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.  “The dots, meanwhile, are likely to show an array of opinions regarding the timing of the first rate increase."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased slightly from a near one-month high as global markets firmed somewhat on Tuesday a day after a risk-off mood dominated by solvency uncertainty of China's Evergrande, while investors awaited the results of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. 
After reaching its highest level since Aug. 23 on Monday, the dollar straddled around the unchanged mark on the day, briefly moving higher as early gains on Wall Street's benchmark equity indexes faded.
Investors are looking toward the Fed's policy announcement on Wednesday for any signs of when the central bank will begin to scale back its massive bond-buying program, in a week filled with policy statements expected from a host of central banks around the globe. 
""The market was trying to get a sense of was this turnaround Tuesday going to last, and if we had that continued improvement of risk appetite the dollar was going to pull back even more here,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. 
""But there is just a lot of wait-and-see as far as what is going to happen with the Fed, what is going to happen with Evergrande. And right now if you are trying to make a dollar bet you really just want to wait until you get a better sense of what is going to happen with Evergrande and what the Chinese government is going to do."" 
The dollar index fell 0.019% after reaching a high of 93.455 on Monday, while the euro was down 0.01% to $1.1724.
The greenback strengthened on Monday, along with other safe-havens such as the yen and Swiss franc, as concerns about the fallout from the possible default of China Evergrande unnerved financial markets.
Those concerns overshadowed efforts by Evergrande's chairman to lift confidence in the embattled firm on Tuesday, as Beijing showed no signs it would intervene to stem any domino effects across the global economy.
The offshore Chinese yuan weakened versus the greenback to 6.4817 per dollar.
Before Evergrande's debt crisis rattled markets, the dollar had been supported ahead of the Fed meeting this week, with economists surveyed in a Reuters poll expecting policymakers to signal expectations of a tapering plan to be pushed back to November.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback, to 109.23 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3658, up 0.01% on the day. 
The Canadian dollar was poised to halt three straight days of declines against the greenback, after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was re-elected to a third term but failed to win a majority in the parliamentary elections.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The offshore Chinese yuan weakened versus the greenback to its lowest level in nearly a month on Monday, as worries about the repercussions from property developer Evergrande's solvency issues spooked financial markets and lifted safe-haven currencies. 
Market sentiment has been rattled by the potential contagion from Evergrande, which is trying to raise funds to pay a host of lenders, suppliers and investors. A deadline for an $83.5 million interest payment on one of its bonds is due on Thursday, and the company has $305 billion in liabilities.
On Thursday, the yuan strengthened to its highest level in three months at 6.4226 per dollar before starting to reverse as Evergrande's woes worsened. The move sharpened on Monday after warnings from Chinese regulators that the company's insolvency could fuel broader risks in the country's financial system if not stabilized. 
Analysts at Wells Fargo said on Monday they expect the dollar to reach 6.60 per yuan within the next month. The offshore Chinese yuan last weakened versus the greenback at 6.4839 per dollar.
""We are seeing a classic flight to safety in the dollar until we get some sense of clarity on whether or not it is going to be an orderly or disorderly resolution to Evergrande,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington DC. 
""We were likely to see a continuation of the decline we’ve seen in risk assets going into this week and you throw in Evergrande and it has really unsettled the markets.""
The dollar and other safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc gained with the risk-off sentiment, which saw Wall Street's S&P 500 index on pace for its biggest one-day percentage drop 11 months. 
The dollar index rose 0.025%, with the euro unchanged at $1.1725.
The dollar has also been gaining ground on expectations the Federal Reserve will begin reducing its monthly bond purchases this year, with the central bank's policy announcement due on Wednesday. 
Aside from the Fed, multiple central banks around the globe will hold policy meetings this week, including those of Sweden, England, and Norway. 
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.58% versus the greenback at 109.32 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3656, down 0.63% on the day. 
The Canadian dollar, also a commodity currency that correlates with risk sentiment, weakened to as low as C$1.2895 per dollar, its lowest level in four weeks. It last fell 0.42% versus the greenback at C$1.28 per dollar.
Polling for Monday's national election in Canada points to an advantage for incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but he is unlikely to gain a parliamentary majority.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Funds are loading back up on U.S. Treasuries ahead of the Fed's Sept. 22 policy decision, suggesting they are not as confident as they were a few weeks ago that yields are headed higher.
Positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show hedge funds and speculators in the week to Sept. 14 bought the most 10-year Treasuries futures since April. 
They added 128,643 contracts to their net long position, reversing the historic shift in the opposite direction only two weeks earlier. In more than three decades of weekly CFTC data, funds have hoovered up as many contracts as that only 10 other times.
This comes ahead of the Fed's meeting on Wednesday where it is expected to open the door to reducing its monthly bond purchases, but push back announcing the actual details until November or possibly December.
That's because recent economic data has been soft, most notably the August employment report which showed a huge miss on net new jobs relative to consensus forecasts. 
Other indicators have undershot forecasts, the U.S. economic surprises index slumped to the lowest since June last year, growth forecasts have been ratcheted down, and Wall Street has wobbled. Against that backdrop, it may be little coincidence that funds have piled back into 10-year Treasuries.
The demand for longer-dated bonds has not been mirrored at the shorter end, according to CFTC positioning data, indicating a ""bull flattening"" of the 2s/10s yield curve. 
Funds reduced their net short position in 2-year Treasury futures in the week to Sept. 14 to 24,633 contracts from 65,257 contracts the week before. 
The curve did indeed flatten to 106 basis points, the flattest in three weeks. But it has since widened back out, thanks to the 10-year yield spiking to 1.38% on Friday, the highest in two months. 
Could funds find themselves flat-footed? As Steve Major at HSBC points out, the 10-year yield just above 1.30% is broadly in the middle of its 0.91%-1.74% range this year. So the market is delicately poised.
Much will depend on the Fed on Wednesday and the strength, or otherwise, of incoming economic data, particularly the September jobs report. Major is sticking with his 1.0% year-end forecast for the 10-year yield, much lower than most others. 

Macro funds appear to share his skepticism, however, that yields will go much higher. For the most part, they have been long of Treasuries for the past year or more.
But they will be hoping for some kind of fireworks from the Fed on Wednesday. They had a good second quarter, but are banking on a pickup in volatility to maintain that performance into year-end.

746,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Foreign-exchange traders are feeling a bit on edge about Canada.
While voters prepare to render their verdict on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government at the polls on Monday, the market is taking a distinctly downbeat view of the local currency, despite recent buoyancy in resource prices. Indeed the rise in global commodity costs could even become a headwind for the country’s economy rather than a tailwind as concerns about domestic inflation take center stage for citizens, politicians and central bankers alike.
The loonie, as it is affectionately dubbed because of the bird that graces Canada’s coinage, has been one of the worst-performing developed-market currencies in the second half of this year. After outstripping all its Group-of-10 counterparts in the first six months of 2021, it’s fallen 2.9% since June 30 through last week’s close. And activity within derivative markets suggests there could be more pain to come for the currency even as the Bank of Canada starts to pave the way for monetary policy tightening.
“It’s been pretty clear over the last week or two that the CAD is just not responding to some of the positive fundamental impulses in the way we would have expected,” said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. “I suspect the CAD may continue to struggle a little bit.”
In the options market, the right to sell the Canadian dollar versus the greenback in three months’ time has been rising in cost relative to the price of purchase rights. So-called risk reversals, which compare the costs of these puts and calls, this month reached levels unseen since June 2020, suggesting increased interest in hedging against Canadian dollar losses.
Data from CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) shows that traders have built a notional portfolio of more than $50 billion in low-delta Canadian dollar put options at strikes of C$1.33 per greenback, a further sign of concern about loonie weakening from current levels near C$1.28. One- and three-month implied volatility measures, meanwhile, have ticked up in recent weeks, suggesting that some investors are bracing for an increase in activity.
Positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also shows a dialing back of Canadian dollar bullishness. While speculators maintain a net long position, it has fallen notably from its recent peak in mid July, while asset managers are also holding smaller bullish positions than they were a couple of months ago.
All this comes even as the Bloomberg Commodity Index has risen 3.2% since June 30 through last week, although crude oil is around 2% lower.
Opinion polls in Canada have indicated that Trudeau’s Liberals are in a tough fight to remain in power, despite promises to boost spending. While elections have not typically been a source of major investor disquiet when it comes to Canada, there are a number of elements to this year’s battle between Trudeau and Conservative challenger Erin O’Toole which could potentially sway markets.
The biggest risk will be if a minority government is formed and is unable to make any headway on policy decisions, potentially triggering another election in the not-too-distant future, according to Toronto-Dominion Bank analyst Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC). This could lead to elevated volatility in the short-run, he said.
Trudeau Holds Slight Election Edge, With Help From His Opponents
Another major potential impact is on the monetary policy backdrop. The central bank’s five-year inflation targeting mandate is up for renewal this year and there is a chance that Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem might request more flexibility, so whoever is in power could hold the key to that.
O’Toole has said he favors the inflation target at 2% as regular people struggle to make ends meet. Trudeau said that families, not monetary policy, would be his government’s top economic priority and wants to continue with increased stimulus.
New data released Wednesday showed year-on-year consumer-price gains accelerated to 4.1% in August, the fastest inflation since 2003 and the fifth consecutive reading above the Bank of Canada’s 3% cap.That landscape of accelerating inflation will, of course, be critical for monetary policy: the BOC boss said earlier this month he intends to scale back bond purchases as the economy recovers, leaving open the possibility for higher rates if consumer costs keep on rising. But it will also potentially have an effect on the election result itself, the kinds of fiscal policy that emerge in its wake and the eventual decision surrounding the BOC mandate.
“Election outcomes can have an impact on fiscal policy which reverberates into monetary policy or vice-versa,” said Tom Nakamura, a portfolio manager at AGF Management. “There is some concern about the election.” 
Looming over all this is the specter of the U.S. monetary policy decision this Wednesday. Any notable signals from the Federal Reserve about its potential timeline for asset-purchase tapering or interest-rate hikes are likely to have a significant impact on risk assets around the world, including the Canadian dollar and the commodities complex.
“It’s clear the Fed is going to start the taper process this year and at the same time we reached peak BOC hawkishness,” said McCormick. “The biggest driver of loonie now is the outlook for the dollar and global risk sentiment.”

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Monday, rallying to a  month-high on the back of safety flows given concerns about the health of Chinese property giant Evergrande and ahead of this week’s crucial Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 93.328, having earlier climbed to 93.356, its highest since Aug. 23.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 109.83, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1715, falling to its lowest since late August, GBP/USD fell 0.3% 1.3706. The risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7237, a three-week low, hit by the slump in iron ore prices, one of Australia’s key exports.
Worries about the financial health of Evergrande have hit equities, prompting risk-off sentiment within the foreign exchange market, to the benefit of the safe-haven dollar.
Evergrande is China's second-largest property developer by sales, and has managed to rack up some $300 billion in debts. Doubts are growing over whether it will be able to make a bond interest payment of $83.5 million due on Thursday. A messy default could have wider implications on the Chinese economy at a time when growth is already looking fragile.
However, the main focus remains on the Federal Reserve, with the U.S. central bank set to hold a two-day policy meeting this week, ending on Wednesday.
The Fed is widely expected to stick with broad plans for tapering this year but will hold off providing details or a timeline at this meeting. 
That said, Friday’s U.S. consumer sentiment release showed improving confidence, while retail sales were surprisingly strong in August, implying an improving economy.
“The August job report pulled the rug from under most analysts/market participants betting on a firm September taper announcement,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “We are not certain that the Fed will dare to present a firm tapering plan on Wednesday, but we remain firm that they will have to take further steps toward becoming concrete on how and when [this week].”
The Fed isn’t the only central bank meeting this week, with the likes of the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank also scheduled to get together. But the main news could come from Scandinavia, with Norway's Norges Bank expected to become the first central bank in western Europe to lift rates.
Elsewhere, USD/CAD rose 0.3% to 1.2810, with the oil-sensitive Canadian dollar hit by Monday’s fall in oil prices as well as political uncertainty ahead of an election where polling suggests incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will remain leader of a minority government.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia. However, moves were small as key Asian markets were closed and a slew of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, prepare to hand down their latest policy decisions.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 93.282 by 11:16 PM ET (3:16 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 109.95.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.39% to 0.7237 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 0.7028.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4662 and the GBP/USD pair was down 0.22% to 1.3712.
Chinese and Japanese markets were closed on Monday. Investors now wait for the Fed to hand down its latest policy decision on Wednesday for clues on the asset tapering and interest rate hike timelines.
""The dollar is having a bit of a rebound,"" Westpac analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters, with the U.S. currency drawing support both from an expectation of imminent asset tapering from the Fed and from caution as a rally in global shares starts to cool.
""Everyone is eying the Fed, waiting for a tapering signal, he added.
Central banks in Japan, the U.K., Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Hungary will also hand down their policy decisions throughout the week.
It would only take two Fed members to change their minds for the ""dot plot"" of median projections to reflect hikes in 2022, according to BDSwiss’s Marshall Gittler.
""So it's quite possible that they go from forecasting no rate rises in 2022 to at least one. Similarly, they are now forecasting two hikes in 2023 that could easily go to three as well,"" he told Reuters.
The Canadian dollar was on a downward trend ahead of the federal election later in the day. Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is widely predicted to win, but will likely lead a minority leader.
Voters in Germany will also cast their ballots on Sep. 26.
In Asia Pacific, the Chinese yuan came under pressure offshore, with the focus on whether China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) will be able to make good on its bond interest payment of $83.5 million due on Thursday. China’s slowing economic recovery and recent regulatory tightening also added pressure to the yuan."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar scaled three-week peaks on Friday, supported by better-than-forecast U.S. retail sales data released on Thursday that backed expectations for a reduction of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year.
The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against six major currencies, rose to 93.220, the highest since the third week of August. It was last up 0.4% at 93.207.
For the week, the dollar index gained 0.6%, its largest weekly percentage rise since mid-August.
The Fed holds a two-day monetary policy meeting next week and is expected to open discussions on reducing its monthly bond purchases, while tying any actual change to U.S. job growth in September and beyond.
""While we doubt that the FOMC will set out a plan for tapering its asset purchases, the new economic projections may shed some light on its reaction function given building cyclical inflationary pressures,"" wrote Jonathan Petersen, markets economist at Capital Economics, in its latest research note.
""Our view remains that inflation in the U.S. will stay elevated for longer than the FOMC and investors currently anticipate, in turn supporting higher U.S. yields and a stronger dollar,"" he added.
Speculation about a Fed taper this year gathered pace after U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in August, data showed on Thursday, rising 0.7% from the previous month despite expectations of a 0.8% fall. A business sentiment survey also showed a big improvement.
In afternoon New York trading, the euro slid 0.3% to $1.1729, after hitting a three-week low of $1.1724 earlier in the session.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment for September inched higher to 71 versus the final August reading of 70.3, but overall analysts said the rise was nowhere near the improvements seen in the Empire States and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys. 
The dollar held gains after the Michigan sentiment report.
Currency markets were generally quiet on Friday with traders reluctant to take on new positions ahead of a clutch of important central bank meetings next week including the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England.
The dollar was up 0.5% against the Swiss franc at 0.9320 francs, after earlier hitting a five-month high of 0.9324 francs .
The dollar rose 0.2% to 109.92 yen.
The yen has shown limited reaction to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, which formally kicks off on Friday ahead of a Sept. 29 vote. The LDP's parliamentary dominance means the party's new leader will become prime minister.
The dollar also rose to a two-week high against the offshore yuan and was last up 0.3% at 6.4711. The yuan is being pressured by growing worries about China's real estate sector as investors fear property giant China Evergrande could default on its coupon payment next week.
The British pound fell 0.4% to $1.3738 as UK retail sales undershot expectations. However, with investors bringing forward forecasts for a Bank of England interest rate hike to mid-2022, sterling remains supported.

LONDON (Reuters) - Although markets have become increasingly aggressive in pricing a UK interest rate rise as soon as next May - several months at least before the United States or euro zone - sterling seems reluctant to follow.
Bank of England policymakers meet next week and, according to governor Andrew Bailey at least, they are split evenly on whether the basic conditions for lifting the central bank's main interest rate from its historic low of 0.1%.
Britain's annual inflation rate raced more than a percentage point above the BoE's 2% target in August amid pandemic-related base effects and supply bottlenecks associated with this year's economic reboot as well as Brexit disruptions. The latest numbers also show UK labour markets tightening more than expected as businesses open up and government subsidies fall away from next month, and domestic energy prices have soared.
It has been so much so that forecasters at major international banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC now expect UK interest rates to rise as soon as May - some six months ahead of consensus forecasts in a Reuters poll earlier this month and, perhaps crucially, some six months before the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to pull the trigger.
The rethink has sent two-year gilt yields to their highest level since the pandemic unfolded in March last year - at 0.28%. And that has pushed the 2-year rate differential with U.S. Treasuries into positive territory for the first time since well before the Brexit vote shock in 2016.
But the pound, one of the currency market's best performers of the past two years after Brexit was sealed in late 2019 and amid cyclical recovery plays after the COVID-19 shock, has hesitated.
Perhaps few in the currency market believe Bank of England would be so bold as to pre-empt the Fed and other G4 central banks by six months or more with the economic and inflation outlook so uncertain. After all, if the pound were to soar further in anticipation, then the Bank simply risks tightening financial conditions too much at a delicate time.
That said, the BoE may have to be that clumsy as it remains tied to a flat 2% inflation target even as the Fed has given itself more wiggle room by its recent adoption of a new average inflation goal over time.
But there are other factors reining in sterling.
TERMINAL RATES 
HSBC's Dominic Bunning reckons sterling's outperformance earlier in the year largely priced the chance the BoE would be an early mover on rates and points out that speculative market positioning has already turned on the pound.
But, crucially, he reckons the longer-term implications of being forced into an early move on policy rates was to lower the trajectory of interest rates over time - or a drop in the BoE's so-called terminal rate. As a result, HSBC is sticking with its $1.34 yearend forecast - some 3% lower than at present.
""Any hiking cycle in the UK is likely to be incredibly gradual and limited in terms of the terminal rate, as highlighted by the flatness of the UK yield curve and the comments from numerous Bank of England policy makers that the UK's neutral interest rate is lower than before,"" he wrote.
Although up from pre-pandemic levels, the UK's 2-10 year yield curve gap of just 50 basis points is some 30bp below May's peaks and still at least half pre-Brexit vote levels from 2016. 
More immediately, concerns that retail energy price surges across the UK will feed inflation angst at the Bank and among the public through the coming winter could also be a double-edged sword for the pound.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Shreyas Gopal reckons the jump in energy prices has been a key factor in repricing in the rates market as it points to UK retail prices jumping from next April just as other inflation base effects are ebbing.
But not only would an early hike weigh on trend growth and the terminal rate, he reckons it also has a materially negative impact on UK's terms of trade and current account.
Extrapolating rising demand and this year's sharp drop in domestic energy production into the fourth quarter, Deutsche estimates the UK trade deficit in gas could jump to 0.75% of gross domestic output from 0.25% two years ago - widening the UK current account deficit from the already hefty 3% of GDP.
For the BoE to move into an interest rate tightening cycle before the Fed is rare but not unprecedented. It hiked policy rates in 2003 more than six months before the U.S. began.

But much has changed structurally for Britain since then - the banking crash of 2008, Brexit and the pandemic. For one, the UK policy rate has remained consistently below the U.S. equivalent since the Brexit vote in 2016, having spent all but very brief periods of the preceding 30 years above it.
The Bank may feel obliged to move early next year if it's bound rigidly by its standing inflation target - but the pound seems unimpressed that there is much more in the tank after that.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, but remained near a three-week high after strong U.S. economic data shifted tapering expectations ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.843, just below Thursday's three-week high of 92.965.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 109.88, EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1772, bouncing off Thursday’s three-week low of 1.1750, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7307.
The dollar received a boost on Thursday after U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in August, rising 0.7% from the previous month despite expectations of a 0.8% fall. This came as a surprise as markets had expected the Covid-19 delta variant to have severely hit consumption. 
U.S. economic data Friday centers around the release of University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which surprised many investors last month by tumbling to a decade-low.
Traders are now fully focussed on next week’s Federal Reserve meeting amid uncertainty over whether this data will be enough to prompt the central bank to announce a timeline for asset tapering after a tame consumer inflation reading and soft job growth data earlier this month.
“It seems unlikely investors will want to build momentum behind any fresh trends in the dollar until the Sep 22nd FOMC event risk has passed,” said ING analysts, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3794 despite U.K. retail sales falling unexpectedly for a fourth month, dropping 0.9% on the month in August and suggesting that a resurgence of coronavirus cases is taking a toll on confidence.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4517 after the People’s Bank of China injected short-term funds into the banking system to try and soothe frayed nerves over the country's real estate sector with all eyes on China Evergrande Group and its coupon payment due next week.

The GBP/USD pair was steady at 1.3788.
The U.S. data, released on Thursday, showed that core retail sales grew 1.8% month-on-month and retail sales grew 0.7% month-on-month in August.
September's Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index was 30.7, while the Philly Fed Employment was at 26.3.
""Yesterday's data were pretty strong across the board. Markets have been worried that consumption would be weak in August because of the COVID-19 Delta variant. But retail sales were surprisingly strong,"" Nomura Securities chief currency strategist Yujiro Goto told Reuters.
Investors will now wait and see whether the data will impact the Fed’s timeline for asset tapering when the central bank hands down its policy decision next week. They also await the Michigan Consumer Expectations and Michigan Consumer Sentiment indexes for September, due later in the day.
In Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership race that determines who becomes the country’s next prime minister, had a limited impact on the yen so far. The race formally kicks off on Friday ahead of a Sep. 29 vote.
COVID-19 vaccine minister Taro Kono is the forerunner in the race, followed by former foreign minister Fumio Kishida and former internal affairs minister Sanae Takaichi.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose and hit its highest level in nearly three weeks against a basket of currencies on Thursday after data showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in August, easing some concerns about a sharp slowdown in economic growth.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others, added to gains following the report and was last up 0.5% at 92.866. It hit its highest level since Aug. 27.
Retail sales rose 0.7% last month, boosted in part by back-to-school shopping and child tax credit payments, while data for July was revised down. 
A separate report showed U.S. initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Sept. 11. Economists had forecast 330,000 applications for the latest week.
""If you look at the retail sales number, it's quite constructive even with the revisions, so we are seeing the dollar benefit from that, particularly against the funding currencies like the euro, Swiss and the yen,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy for CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
The news could bolster investor expectations for next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting and how soon the U.S central bank will start to taper stimulus. 
""It feels like whatever lingering concerns there were with the underlying economy ... that was kind of washed away a little bit. So as we move towards the Fed next week, the evidence backs up the idea that we're going to get a taper signal from the Fed at the meeting,"" he said.
On Tuesday, the dollar index fell to a one-week low of 92.321 after a softer-than-expected inflation report. Its low for the month was 91.941, on Sept. 3, when payrolls data disappointed.
Investors are looking for clarity on the outlook for both tapering and interest rates at the Fed's two-day policy meeting that ends next Wednesday.
Tapering typically lifts the dollar as it suggests the Fed is one step closer to tighter monetary policy. 
It also means the central bank will be buying fewer debt assets, in effect reducing the amount of dollars in circulation, which in turn lifts the currency's value.
The dollar also gained 0.3% to 109.70 yen , after sliding to a six-week low of 109.110 in the previous session.
The euro was 0.4% lower at $1.1766.
The Swiss franc also fell against the dollar and was last at 0.9263 franc per dollar.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was down 0.5% at $0.7296.
Earlier, data showed the country's jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 4.5%, but the statistics bureau said the change reflected a drop in the participation rate rather than a strengthening of the labor market.

In cryptocurrencies, moves in bitcoin were relatively subdued. It was last down 0.9% at $47,711. Ether changed hands at $3,589, down 0.7%.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc boss Adam Aron said in a tweet this week that the theater chain would accept ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin alongside bitcoin for ticket purchases.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Delta variants, spending splurges, inflation scares and debt ceilings all threaten to bamboozle U.S. bonds, and yet it's the delicate and often misread dance between the Fed and Treasury that's likely keeping everything in check.
On one side the Federal Reserve will likely start reducing its $80 billion-a-month Treasury purchases by year-end - a moment many investors had feared would undermine the market and send yields surging. 
But the U.S. Treasury will be borrowing less over the year ahead too, with a rapidly shrinking budget deficit and funding needs compared to the blowouts of 2020.
All else equal, if the gradual exit of the biggest single buyer from the market is matched by an equivalent cut in the supply of new debt, the two should cancel each other out pricewise. And perhaps that's what the seemingly peculiar stability of the bond market since April has been telling us. 
The question is whether one of those forces ends up dominating - or whether they are deliberately kept in synch. 
The exact numbers or timeframe of the Fed's taper are still unknown of course, much less details on what part of the maturity spectrum Treasury will concentrate debt sales. Wider growth and inflation developments remain critical and unknown variables. 
But the basic dynamics are a powerful stabilizer.
Joseph Wang, a former senior trader on the Fed's open markets desk, reckons that the two will ""roughly cancel each other out ... so the stock of private sector Treasury holdings will continue to grow at around the same pace. The Fed will just own a smaller share of the overall stock.""
OVER-FUNDING
On the funding side, Treasury will borrow significantly less in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 than this year thanks to rebounding economic growth and tax revenues, a reduced need for crisis-level support for individuals and businesses, and new spending bills being pushed further out into the future. 
This will mean a smaller debt-raising program. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group made up of major fixed income market participants, says its baseline scenario calls for a 19% reduction in coupon issuance in calendar year 2022 growing to an accumulated 35% reduction 12 months later.
It's also worth noting that Treasury goes into next year having borrowed significant amounts in the year following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gennadiy Goldberg at TD Securities estimates net coupon issuance in fiscal year 2021 was $2.73 trillion, up $1.37 trillion from the previous year.
But not all of it was needed, a key reason why Treasury's cash balance at the Fed ballooned and caused distortions at the ultra-short end of the curve, and why borrowing will be lower next year. 
According to TBAC's baseline recommendation, gross issuance of two- to 30-year bonds should fall by $749 billion to $3.21 trillion in 2022, declining further to $2.59 trillion in 2023.
The net amount will largely depend on the government's fiscal plans. Despite headlines of the Biden administration's ambitious $3.5 trillion spending plans over the next decade, U.S. fiscal policy will tighten significantly in 2022 and 2023. 
The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the fiscal 2021 deficit of $3 trillion, or 13.4% of GDP, will fall sharply to $1.153 trillion, or 4.7% of GDP in fiscal 2022, and to $789 billion, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2023.
In terms of funding requirements, the CBO projects a net borrowing need of just under $1.5 trillion in fiscal year 2022, falling to around $750 billion in 2023. That compares with just under $2 trillion this year.
TAPER TIME
The Fed, meanwhile, is expected to lay out its taper timetable before the end of this year, and begin winding down its purchases of Treasuries next year. At $80 billion a month currently, it is hoovering up $960 billion on an annual basis.
If it tapers that at a steady $10-$15 billion-a-month pace, fresh purchases will cease in around six to eight months. 
Over the course of fiscal year 2022, however, the Fed will still accumulate more than $500 billion in new purchases. Still, that will be around $400 billion less than in 2021, roughly similar to the fall in government net funding needs. 
If the Fed's $960 billion bond purchases in 2021 are reduced to zero in fiscal year 2023, that again roughly offsets the $1 trillion reduction in government funding needs over the same time frame, according to CBO estimates. 

A multitude of other factors will determine the Treasury market's course over the coming years, such as President Joe Biden's stimulus and tax-raising plans, and where inflation and inflation expectations are headed.
But shifts in Fed demand and Treasury supply could provide the broad framework within which everything else plays out.

Investing.com - The dollar drifted higher Thursday, with traders keeping their powder dry ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, looking for indications on when the central bank will start withdrawing its monetary stimulus. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.612. 
The index has been stuck in a trading range between the two-week high of 92.887 seen at the start of the week and Tuesday’s one-week low of 92.321 after a softer-than-expected inflation report. 
USD/JPY traded flat at 109.36, while EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1795, not helped by weak car registration numbers for August. GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3812, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7310, despite the country's jobless rate unexpectedly falling to 4.5%.
The foreign exchange market is now focusing squarely on the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day policy meeting next week, expecting it to provide some clarity on the outlook for both tapering and eventual interest rate hikes.
“If anything, the risks for the dollar heading into next week’s Fed meeting may be slightly tilted to the downside if markets cement their view that the tapering announcement will indeed be delayed,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Thursday’s U.S. retail sales for August could well add to the view that tapering may be paused, as the release is expected to show, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), that sales weakened again in August after they fell in July. On a month-over-month basis, they are seen 0.8% lower compared with July’s 1.1% erosion.
Additionally, the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time in the U.S. is also seen rising to 330,000 for the week ending Sept. 11 from 310,000 for the week before.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7110, after data released earlier Thursday showed the economy grew at a much faster pace than expected, with gross domestic product accelerating to 2.8% in the second quarter.
This strong growth cemented the view that the country’s central bank will start lifting interest rates in the near future, having shelved a rate hike last month in response to an outbreak of Covid-19 that triggered a harsh lockdown from the government.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, moving towards the middle of a range that it has stuck to for the past month. Investors now look to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision, due to be handed down next week, for further clues on when the central bank will begin asset tapering.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.05% to 92.485 by 11:57 PM ET (3:57 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.05% to 109.31.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7324. Australian jobs data released earlier in the day showed that the employment change contracted by 146,300, while the full employment change contracted by 68,000, in August. The unemployment rate was 4.5%.
The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.7114, with New Zealand’s GDP growing a better than expected 2.8% quarter-on-quarter and 17.4% year-on-year in the second quarter.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.4347 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3834.
""We're waiting for the Fed next week that remains the key focus. I do not think the dollar is going to go too far in either direction before that,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
""The Fed’s two-day policy meeting ending Sep. 22 should provide some clarity on the outlook for both asset tapering and eventual interest rate hikes.”
The yen's strong performance on Wednesday may have been helped by foreign flows into Japanese stocks with the Nikkei reaching a multi-decade high this week, as well as covering of short positions, said
Japan also released trade data earlier in the day showed that exports grew 26.2% year-on-year and imports grew 44.7% year-on-year in August. The trade balance was at a deficit of JPY635.4 billion ($5.8 billion).
Meanwhile, Norway's crown rose slightly to 8.5710 per dollar, moving back toward the more than two-month high of 8.5598 reached overnight as oil prices rose. The crown also hit its strongest level against the euro since Jun. 25 at 10.1119.
""EUR-NOK is one of the preferred exposures to play a rising crude price, and we're seeing a solid bearish trend here,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""If Brentand WTI futures are headed for their respective double tops then EUR-NOK is going one way in my view."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slumped against major currencies on Wednesday after softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data released on Tuesday eased short-term expectations about tapering of asset purchases from the Federal Reserve.
The dollar index last stood at 92.514, down about 0.2% from Tuesday, when it dropped following the inflation data but recovered on haven demand as stocks slid on Wall Street.
But the dollar trimmed losses after positive data showing import prices fell unexpectedly in August and a higher-than-expected reading for the New York Fed's business survey.
These reports offset figures showing U.S. manufacturing output slowed in August, rising 0.2% from a 1.6% increase the previous month.
""The reality is that there is no guidance other than the obvious: poor economic indicators mean the recovery from the pandemic has slowed down more than expected by Delta,"" said Juan Perez, FX strategist and trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.
""The buck in the midst of all this will still have room for gains and spikes as doom and gloom play a role in diminished risk-appetite, but idiosyncratic improvements in the UK as we saw with CPI, and other regions could eventually start weakening the dollar more consistently.""
Wednesday's data showed Britain's inflation rate hit its highest in almost a decade last month after a record jump that was largely fuelled by a rebound in restaurant prices.
The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against six major currencies, has traded between 92.3 and 92.9 over the past week as several Fed officials suggested the U.S. central bank could reduce buying debt securities by the end of the year, even after a weaker-than-expected payrolls report earlier this month.
While elevated inflation has kept pressure on policymakers, data overnight showed the U.S. consumer price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, edged up just 0.1% last month.
The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) two-day policy meeting next week should provide some clarity on the outlook for tapering and interest rates.
Tapering typically lifts the dollar as it suggests the Fed is one step closer to tighter monetary policy. It also means the central bank will be buying fewer debt assets, in effect reducing the number of dollars in circulation and increasing the currency's value.
""We think a combination of modest economic revisions (by the Fed) and steady messaging on the interest rate outlook should be supportive for the U.S. dollar, given that many other central banks are likely to lag the Fed's policy normalization process by a substantial margin,"" Scotiabank FX analysts wrote in a research note.
In late afternoon trading, the euro was up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.1813.
The dollar fell to a four-week low of 109.14 yen, and last changed hands at 109.38, down 0.3%.
Meanwhile, the yuan and Australian dollar slid earlier after Chinese data showed factory and retail sales growth cooled more sharply than expected last month. [L1N2QH08P]
The dollar was last down 0.1% against the Chinese currency at 6.4275 yuan.
The Aussie dollar sank as low as US$0.7301, its lowest in more than two weeks following China's data, but recovered to trade up 0.1% US$0.7331.

Investing.com - The dollar drifted in tight trading ranges Wednesday, with the recent release of soft U.S. inflation data raising uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve will start its stimulus withdrawal this year.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally higher at 92.620. 
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 109.51, EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1805, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7312.
Tuesday’s U.S. inflation data for August came in below expectations, with the core consumer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, edging up just 0.1% last month. This suggested that the upward pressure on inflation was starting to wane. 
Several Fed officials have suggested the U.S. central bank could reduce its buying of debt securities by the end of the year, but a weaker-than-expected payrolls report at the start of the month and lessening inflationary pressure has created some doubt ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
“The Fed passed on the opportunity to signal taper in August and now it looks like it could do it again in September,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management, in a note.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Fed officials will seek an agreement to begin paring bond purchases in November.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3816, after U.K. inflation surged more than expected in August, adding to pressure on the Bank of England to rein in its monetary stimulus. Money markets are now pricing in two interest rate hikes from the BoE by the end of next year.
Consumer prices jumped 3.2% on the year in August, the most since March 2012, after dipping back to the central bank’s 2% target month before. Ominously, the figures don't even capture the huge spike in energy prices that has happened in the last months.
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4426 after a number of Chinese data releases pointed to a slowdown in growth in the second-largest economy in the world.
The country’s retail sales grew 2.5% year-on-year, a sharp drop from July’s 8.5% growth and at the slowest pace since August 2020, while industrial output grew 5.3% year-on-year, its weakest pace since July 2020.

The dollar has been stuck in a 92.3 to 92.9 range during the week as some Fed officials pushed for the central bank to begin asset tapering by the end of 2021.
Meanwhile, U.S. data released on Tuesday showed that the core consumer price index (CPI) grew 4% year-on-year and 0.1% month-on-month in August. The data also showed that the CPI grew 5.3% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month respectively.
Investors now look to the Fed’s latest policy decision, due to be handed down next week, for further timeline clues.
""The softer print eases concerns over an imminent acceleration in prices and should nullify any lingering pressure on the Fed to taper in September. But a taper this year still looks like a good bet with November or December now looking more likely,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA) is more bullish on the dollar's prospects, predicting that accelerating employment costs in the U.S. will keep consumer prices elevated.
""Above‑target inflation will prove more persistent than the Fed expects,"" CBA strategist Carol Kong said in a report.
""The implication is the Fed will likely need to raise the Funds rate by more than what markets are currently expecting, which could support the dollar down the track,” the report added."
761,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Swipe your bracelet, watch or even a walking stick, and you can pay for your goods with digital yuan. 
These are just some of the quirky gadgets that China’s central bank, lenders and technology giants are showcasing to Beijing residents ahead of a broader rollout of the e-currency when the city hosts the Winter Olympics in February. The wearable devices, embedded with a digital yuan chip, can be tapped against a scanner, transferring the currency from an e-wallet without needing an internet connection. 
The People’s Bank of China is pulling out all the stops to promote the e-currency to a population far more used to transacting on a daily basis using Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s WeChat Pay and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s Alipay. The central bank has rolled out pilot programs in 11 cities and regions from Shenzhen to Hainan so far and has recruited major banks and technology firms to help get an otherwise indifferent population to make the switch to the e-yuan.

Beijing consumers got their first taste of what a digital yuan future might look like during a services trade fair in the capital city last week, which attracted 36,000 visitors. Major banks like Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (OTC:IDCBY) Ltd. and China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp. as well as tech firms like Alibaba’s Ant Group Ltd. had booths promoting the e-currency.
Hao Xiujie, a 45-year-old resident of the city, queued for 20 minutes at a booth run by Bank of China Ltd. to sign up for an e-yuan account and get a cup of cappuccino for one cent of the digital currency. 
“I’ve always wanted to try the digital yuan and experience how different it is from Alipay and WeChat Pay, after seeing it so much on TV,” she said, as she waited in line for her cup of coffee. “It’s really easy to use, whether it’s paying or topping up.”
Long queues formed at vending machines that take digital yuan to buy stamps, drinks and Winter Olympic-themed souvenirs. A handful of shops including a book store, dental clinic and museum shop set up booths to sell products that could be bought with digital yuan at the fair. 
Li Jun, 36, who works in asset management and had spent 200 yuan ($31) in a free digital-yuan handout in February, said he would prefer digital yuan, which is backed by the central bank, to WeChat Pay and Alipay when it’s officially launched, because he feels it’s safer. 
At Ant Group’s booth at the Beijing fair, staff showed visitors how to open the e-CNY wallet through the Alipay app and top-up funds through it. E-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc also showcased vending machines and self-service payment machines at its booth. Food delivery firm Meituan launched a promotion in nine cities last week that gave out free digital yuan to users who register for shared bike rides.
 
Bank officials at the fair said it’s no easy job to promote the digital yuan, as its use is still limited in real life and many people still can’t wrap their head around the concept of a virtual legal tender. But the upcoming Winter Olympics will be a key opportunity to popularize the digital yuan, not just among Chinese but also foreign visitors. 
At the Beijing trade fair, a staff member at Postal Savings Bank of China Co. demonstrated an ATM-like machine that can take foreign currency notes and convert them into digital yuan stored in a card. China Construction Bank also had a similar machine that allows foreigners to apply for an e-CNY account with their passports and overseas mobile phone numbers.
ICBC showcased a subway turnstile that takes digital yuan by tapping your phone in the same way that Beijing commuters have been using WeChat Pay and Alipay to pay for rides for years.   
Staff at the bank also demonstrated a walking stick mounted with a digital yuan chip that enables transactions by near-field communication technology, requiring no internet connection. The device is meant for elderly users who may not have access to smartphone technology, part of the PBOC’s goal of promoting financial inclusiveness.
ICBC has tested over 360,000 application scenarios, and entered strategic partnerships with nearly 60 banks. 
The bank is “actively exploring innovative uses of digital yuan in banking, wealth management, investment and financing, as well as securities and asset trading,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We are building convenient payment and settlement methods around supply chain management, smart transportation and wearable devices.”
Among all the wearable products, credit card-like wallets have been the easiest to promote, according to Fu Jiajie, manager of the technology support department at CEC Huada Eletronic Design Co. Ltd., which manufactures chips used for digital yuan. An official at the Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd. said about 2,000 cards have been issued to individuals and companies for the initial phase. Another 30,000 card-wallets will be distributed over the Winter Olympics, according to Fu.
Consumers, merchants and bank officials all agree that it’s critical for the yuan to be used in more ways for it to become popular. PBOC officials have said they won’t use administrative measures to force people to adopt the digital yuan.
“People are already so used to WeChat Pay and Alipay, so many are reluctant to get digital yuan all of a sudden,” said Chen Ling, a 26-year-old staffer at a booth selling Palace Museum’s souvenirs. “Even though it is more convenient than those when you are using it” because of its simpler and easy to use app interface design, she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell against major currencies on Tuesday after data showed a less-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation last month, creating uncertainty about the timing of the Federal Reserve's tapering of asset purchases.
Several Fed officials have suggested the U.S. central bank could reduce its buying of debt securities by the end of the year, but said an eventual interest rate hike would not happen for some time.
The Fed will hold a two-day monetary policy meeting next week, with investors keen to find out whether a tapering announcement will be made.
Tapering tends to benefit the dollar as it suggests the Fed is one step closer toward tighter monetary policy. It also means the central bank will be buying fewer debt assets, effectively reducing the number of dollars in circulation.
Data on Tuesday showing the U.S. consumer price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, edged up just 0.1% last month has raised doubts about tapering this year, some analysts said. 
August's core CPI rise was also the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3% rise in July. The so-called core CPI increased 4.0% on a year-on-year basis after gaining 4.3% in July.
""The softer inflation prints caused investors to push back on bets that the Fed could move sooner to taper bond purchases. Easing inflation would take the heat off the Fed to move prematurely,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.
She also cited U.S. core producer prices (PPI) data for August released last week, which also rose at a slower pace. Excluding the food, energy and trade services elements, producer prices rose 0.3% last month, the smallest gain since last November. The so-called core PPI shot up 0.9% in July.
""So the evidence does appear to be building that peak inflation has passed. That said, supply chain bottlenecks are expected to persist for a while so it's unlikely that either PPI or CPI will drop dramatically or rapidly,"" Cincotta added.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index was slightly down at 92.601, moving away from a more than a two-week high on Monday.
The euro was flat against the dollar at $1.1807. 
Risk appetite soured on Tuesday as well, with Wall Street shares down while U.S. Treasury prices were up sharply, pushing yields lower.
Investors looked past decelerating inflation and focused on uncertainties about U.S. growth now clouded by the economic impact of the Delta variant. 
Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, the dollar dropped 0.4% to 0.9189 francs.
Versus another safe-haven, the Japanese yen, the dollar fell 0.4% to 109.615 ye
In other currencies, the Australian dollar fell to a two-week low after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe painted a very dovish policy outlook with no rate hikes on the horizon until 2024.
The Aussie dollar was last down 0.7% at US$0.7319. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was last up 3.1% at $46,400 . Ether changed hands at $3,344, up 1.9%.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged lower Tuesday, with traders waiting for the release of the latest U.S. inflation numbers for guidance on the timing of the start of the Federal Reserve’s stimulus withdrawal.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 92.627, having retreated from Monday’s two-week high of 92.887. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 110.09, EUR/USD was flat at 1.1808, having bounced back from Monday's low of 1.1770, its lowest since Aug. 27, while GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3838, helped by U.K. employment data showing that the total number of payrolled employees climbed in August above their level in February 2020, just before Britain first went into Covid-19 lockdown.
The main focus Tuesday will be on the release of the U.S. consumer price data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), especially with the Federal Reserve's next policy review being so close, on Sept 21-22.
Annual consumer price inflation is expected to dip slightly to 5.3% from 5.4% in July, while core CPI, an index which strips out volatile energy and food prices, is seen easing slightly annually to 4.2% from 4.3% in July.
“Recent Fed communication has not diverged from the view that inflationary pressures have a transitory nature, so even in the event of another rise in inflation we doubt Fed rate expectations - and by extension, the dollar - will be particularly impacted,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Fed officials will seek an agreement to begin paring bond purchases in November.
Elsewhere, the risk sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.4% to 0.7335, after Australian central bank chief Philip Lowe pushed back against market pricing for early interest-rate increases.
“I find it difficult to understand why rate rises are being priced in next year or early 2023,” Lowe said earlier Tuesday. “While policy rates might be increased in other countries over this time frame, our wage and inflation experience is quite different.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, as investors await U.S. inflation data that could provide a clue to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s timetable for asset tapering.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 92.597 by 10:21 PM ET (2:21 AM GMT), after retreating from a two-week high of 92.887 hit earlier on Monday.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 110.08.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.7362 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7114.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.4495 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3847.
The U.S. will release consumer price index data later in the day, which will be closely watched by investors.
""With the core CPI still seen above 4%, inflation is at a very abnormal level. Powell has been saying inflation will be transient since March but the Fed will probably have to adjust its wording in the next policy statement,"" Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Investors also await the Fed’s policy decision, due to be handed down next week, where the central bank is expected to agree to begin asset tapering in November.
""Asset tapering in 2021 is a done deal. The next question will be whether the Fed will raise interest rates in 2021. Given persistent inflation, the Fed may not be able to afford to be relaxed about it for too long,"" said Ishizuki.
Although global shares remain near record highs, increasing investors’ risk appetites, some investors warned of risks up ahead.
""Global risk appetite is edging toward a more tenuous and twitchier phase. A discordant G2 is increasingly the problem,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) macro strategist Alan Ruskin told Reuters.
""The U.S.-China trade dispute has not found any resolution. On the contrary, market forces are dominating quantity targets, and widening bilateral balances will again prove a source of tension,"" he added.
Another development in China on investors’ radars is China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt situation. The cash-strapped property developer is struggling to calm solvency concerns while the country’s tech firms deal with the latest round of regulatory tightening.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell to as low as $43,400, the lowest level in almost a week and last traded at $44,973. Ether also fell to $3,283."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a two-week peak against a basket of currencies on Monday, bolstered by expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve could reduce its asset purchases by the end of the year despite a surge in COVID-19 cases.
The greenback, however, came off its highs in afternoon trading. 
The dollar index earlier rose to 92.887, its highest since Aug. 27. It was last up slightly at 92.664. 
A round of U.S. economic data is due out this week, starting with consumer prices on Tuesday, which will give the latest update on how hot inflation has been ahead of next week's Fed meeting.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker became the latest official to say he wants the central bank to start tapering this year, saying in a Nikkei interview that he was keen to scale back asset purchases.
Tapering talk has boosted the dollar, said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
""We noticed from the Fed communication that they would like to de-link the taper from the rate hike,"" Nelson said. ""But it will take a lot of convincing and frankly a lot of time for the market to change its reaction function. For now, a taper timeline is closely linked to a rate hike timeline in the market.""
Tapering typically lifts the dollar as it means a step toward tighter monetary policy. It also means the Fed will be buying fewer debt assets, which suggests there will be fewer dollars in circulation.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Fed officials will seek an agreement to begin paring bond purchases in November.
Aside from inflation, U.S. retail sales and production figures are also scheduled for release this week.
""Another high CPI (consumer price index) reading this week in the face of weakening economic data could begin to paint the Fed into a corner as pressure mounts for stimulus normalization,"" said Christopher Vecchio, senior analyst at DailyFX.com, the research unit of forex broker IG.
The euro was among the currencies to lose ground to the dollar, dipping to $1.1770, its lowest in a little over two weeks, after the European Central Bank said last week it would start to trim its own emergency bond purchases. The euro was last down 0.1% at $1.1801.
Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.1% at 110 yen. The dollar also gained 0.5% versus the Swiss franc to 0.9228.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin was down 2.8% at $44,762.

Litecoin, with a market cap of nearly $12 billion and one of the earliest digital currencies in circulation, fell 2.6% to $180.78, according to crypto data tracker CoinGecko, after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said a press release regarding the retailer's partnership with the cryptocurrency was fake.
Litecoin rose as much as 27.4% on the fake news.

Investing.com -- The dollar traded higher Monday, with traders starting to focus on the upcoming U.S. inflation numbers as the debate surrounding the timing of the start of the Federal Reserve’s tapering continues.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.2% to 92.778.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 110.16, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1782, GBP/USD was down 0.2% at 1.3819, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.1% to 0.7347.
The dollar has posted its first winning week in three on Friday, and this positive tone has continued at the start of this week, as a number of members of the Federal Reserve continued to point to a reasonably prompt tapering of its bond-buying program despite the rising numbers of Covid-19 cases and the disappointing recent nonfarm payrolls release.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker continued the theme Monday, in a Nikkei interview, indicating that he was keen to begin scaling back asset purchases.
""I'd like to start the taper process soon, so that we can finish the tapering process, so if we need to increase the policy rate, we have the room to do that. And I think we need to buy ourselves that option,"" Harker told the Nikkei.
This puts the Fed’s get together later in September firmly in focus. Tuesday’s U.S. consumer price data, along with retail sales and production figures later in the week, will be studied carefully in the lead-up to the central bank meeting.  
“We suspect that the dollar will trend higher in the run-up to the FOMC meeting, where a clear signal of the Fed's tapering intentions is expected,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, in a note. “The seven Fed officials who in June thought a hike may be appropriate next year may have persuaded a colleague or two.” 
USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 6.4542, with the yuan struggling, in line with the country’s stock markets, following a further regulatory clampdown on the important tech sector.
A key batch of economic data is due for release on Wednesday, including retail sales and industrial production, and these numbers could add to concerns about the world's second biggest economy.
Finally, USD/RUB dropped 0.1% to 73.139, after the Bank of Russia delivered a smaller-than-expected increase in its key interest rate on Friday, hiking by 25 basis points to 6.75%, while leaving the door open to further tightening after inflation hit a five-year high last month.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, continuing its gains from the previous week. Investors remain wary of the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning asset tapering even as the number of COVID-19 cases surges globally.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 92.668 by 10:43 PM ET (2:43 AM GMT). It rolled over to the Dec. 21 contract on Sep. 12.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 109.95.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7359, with the Australian dollar struggling to remain above the $0.74 mark. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7108, also battling to break out of a months-long range even as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand prepares to hike its interest rates.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.15% to 6.4534 in offshore trade. Economic data, including industrial production and fixed asset investment, will be released on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3836.
Some investors were optimistic about the U.S. currency.
""A couple of dynamics favor the dollar,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril, particularly risk aversion as even vaccinated countries such as Singapore and the U.K. report surges in COVID-19 cases.
""Re-opening still faces challenges from the consumer, who is cautious and from bottlenecks which restrict the ability for the economy to rebound with some gusto. At the same time, rising infections suggest we may still need to reintroduce restrictions of some sort. The other thing is that the Fed continues to signal that asset tapering is coming,"" he added.
The U.S. will release consumer price index data on Tuesday, while Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker joined the calls to begin asset tapering sooner rather than later.
""My baseline forecast is still to have inflation around 4% this year, ending this year, and then starting to fall back to 2% over the years 2022 and 2023. However, I do see elevated risk that inflation could run higher,"" Harker told the media.
""I'd like to start the taper process soon, so that we can finish the tapering process, so if we need to increase the policy rate, we have the room to do that. And I think we need to buy ourselves that option."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday in line with higher U.S. Treasury yields as investors focused on when the Federal Reserve is likely to begin reducing its asset purchases.
The greenback has risen from a one-month low reached last Friday after jobs data for August showed that jobs growth slowed, while wage inflation rose more than expected.
It has not yet been able to establish a strong trend, however, as investors wait on new clues on when the Fed is likely to begin paring its bond purchases and, eventually, raise rates.
“That to me is the most important thing, is when does the Fed hike rates, and unfortunately we may not know that for a little while,” said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Friday that she would still like the central bank to begin tapering asset purchases this year, joining the chorus of policymakers making it clear that their plans to begin scaling back support were not derailed by weaker jobs growth in August.
Fed officials are grappling with rising price pressures while jobs growth remains below their targets.
Data on Friday showed that U.S. producer prices increased solidly in August, indicating that high inflation is likely to persist for a while, with supply chains remaining tight as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The Wall Street Journal on Friday wrote that Fed officials will seek to make an agreement at the Fed’s September meeting to begin paring bond purchases in November. 
The dollar index gained 0.05% to 92.57. It is up from a one-month low of 91.94 on Friday.
The U.S. currency had dipped earlier on Friday on improving risk sentiment on news that U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke for the first time in seven months.
In a statement, the White House said Biden and Xi had ""a broad, strategic discussion,"" including areas where interests and values converge and diverge. The conversation focused on economic issues, climate change and COIVD-19, a senior U.S. official told reporters.
The dollar was last down 0.13% to 6.4419 yuan, nearing a more than two-month low of 6.4233 yuan reached last week.
The euro fell 0.07% to $1.1816 on Friday, a day after the European Central Bank said it will trim emergency bond purchases over the coming quarter.

769,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 06:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Russia delivered a smaller-than-expected increase in its key interest rate, while leaving the door open to further tightening after inflation hit a five-year high last month.  
The benchmark rate was raised by 25 basis points to 6.75% on Friday, the Bank of Russia said in a statement. The move followed the biggest rate increase since 2014 -- a full percentage point -- in July. Sixteen economists in a Bloomberg survey of 44 correctly forecast Friday’s move, while 27 expected a bigger move and one expected no change.
“Given high inflation expectations, the balance of risks for inflation is tilted to the upside,” the central bank said in its statement. “The Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its upcoming meetings.”
Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina is easing the pace of monetary tightening as the economic recovery is losing steam. The central bank has now boosted rates by a total of 250 basis points this year in an effort to contain inflation, which is running well above target. 
One of the most aggressive tightening paths in emerging markets has so far failed to rein in price growth, while data for August suggest Russia’s economic recovery may be faltering. Parliamentary elections next week are also complicating the picture, with President Vladimir Putin’s pledge of nearly 700 billion rubles ($9.6 billion) in new social spending adding to potential price pressures.
Ten-year bond yields trimmed their increase, trading up two basis points at 7.04%. The ruble kept an advance of 0.2% against the dollar, set for a third day of gains as crude oil rose and most emerging-market currencies advanced.
Inflation is set to accelerate further and peak in September at 6.9%, before slowing to about 6% by the end of the year, still well above the central bank’s 4% target, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analyst Clemens Grafe.
Nabiullina will hold an online news briefing at 3 p.m. Moscow time.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday, set for a winning week as traders reassess the likely timing of the start of the Federal Reserve’s stimulus withdrawal  helped by concerns about the strength of the global recovery, while the euro received minimal support from the European Central Bank.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged higher to 92.505, on course for a 0.4% weekly rise, its first winning week in three.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 109.91, EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1826, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3845, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7376.
The dollar has rebounded, to a certain extent, from last week’s low of 91.941, its weakest level since the start of August, as traders have started to reconsider the likelihood of the Federal Reserve’s tapering its bond-buying program in reasonably short order.
Last Friday’s weak nonfarm payrolls suggested this would be delayed, but since then the JOLTS survey showed a large number of unfilled job openings and initial jobless claims fell on Thursday to the lowest level in almost 18 months.
Additionally, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman stated last Thursday that the weak August labour report won't throw the central bank off course, comments that were echoed by New York Fed President John Williams. Atlanta's Raphael Bostic, previously a supporter of an immediate start to tapering, said on Thursday that a slightly later start may now be warranted.
Across the pond, the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program over the coming quarter.
However, this only provided minor support for the single currency as this was widely expected and seen as only a token step towards removing the central bank’s vast stimulus measures.
“We continue to think that the Fed will be faster in changing its monetary policy setup, and see more downside potential for the EUR/USD,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Elsewhere, Britain's economy barely grew in July, with its GDP rising by just 0.1% from June, the weakest expansion since January when the country went back into strict lockdown rules.
This was considerably below the month-on-month growth of 0.6% expected, and followed a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in the month, resulting in thousands of workers having to self-isolate at home.
USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4446, heading for its weakest closing level since June, with the Chinese yuan helped by news of a call between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden, raising hopes of improved relations between the two countries.
Finally, USD/RUB dropped 0.3% to 72.7915 ahead of the latest policy-setting meeting by the Bank of Russia later in the session.
The central bank is expected to raise its key benchmark rate for the fifth meeting in a row as consumer prices rose by 6.7% last month, the highest level in five years, and way above the central bank’s 4% inflation goal.
 "
771,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan is headed for its strongest close in nearly three months, as a call between Present Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart raised hopes of improved relations between the two nations.
The Chinese currency rose as much as 0.2% to 6.4446 per dollar, set for the strongest closing level since June 16. Fueling the gains was a report that Xi spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden by phone Thursday night, during which the two countries vowed to hold regular communications, although the American leader expressed his frustration with recent dead-end talks. 
The rally could push the yuan out of a narrow 1.3% band it has been boxed in since mid-June. The Chinese currency has remained resilient, despite a resurgence in Covid cases and Beijing’s crackdown on the country’s biggest technology companies, thanks to the authorities’ cautious approach in policy easing and capital inflows into the onshore markets. 
“The talk should help improve risk sentiment in the short-term,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). In the near term, “whether the gains in the yuan could continue will mainly depend on moves in the dollar.”
Xi said during the talk that the China-U.S. ties should get back to the right track, according to Chinese state media. The call was the second between the leaders and comes as the relationship is becoming increasingly adversarial. The conversation was initiated by Biden after meetings involving his cabinet officials and Chinese counterparts over the past months remained unfruitful. 
The onshore yuan pared gains to trade 0.13% stronger at 6.4475 as of 12:02 p.m. in Shanghai, while the offshore currency rose 0.14%. Some big Chinese banks bought the dollar after the yuan jumped amid headlines on the call, which helped to ease the rally, according to traders. They asked not to be named as they aren’t authorized to talk to the media. 
The yuan has barely moved since the start of June, after jumping 1.5% in the second quarter amid a drop in the dollar. The onshore yuan’s one-month implied volatility slid for a fourth day to the lowest level in more than two years, suggesting traders are expecting the currency to remain steady. 
The calmness in China’s foreign-exchange market, however, could end as the yuan will weaken on the central bank’s monetary easing, according to Claudio Piron, co-head of Asia foreign-exchange and rates strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore. The currency will drop to 6.60 by year-end, a level unseen since late 2020, he added.
“Signs of willingness to nudge bilateral conversations onto a more serious path could be a net positive for yuan and regional currencies,” said Yanxi Tan, foreign exchange strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. But the room of any further advance “could be constrained without more discernible translation to policy changes.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, rebounding from a selloff triggered by the latest U.S. jobs report. However, investors continue to bet on when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 92.530 by 10:53 PM ET (2:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 109.78.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7372 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7114.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.4523 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3846.
The dollar sank to its lowest level since Aug. 3 during the previous week after the release of the jobs report for August. The report, which was much weaker than expected, reduced expectations of the Fed beginning asset tapering.
However, the Fed could still be on course to begin the process later in 2021, with Governor Michelle Bowman suggesting overnight that the report would not necessarily deter the central bank.
Meanwhile, data released on Thursday showed that Americans filed 310,000 initial jobless claims throughout the week, the lowest number in almost 18 months.
""The Fed looks set to taper later in 2021, underscored by recent comments this week,"" TD Securities global head of FX strategy Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said in a note.
However, even with the trend toward monetary policy becoming less accommodative globally, financial conditions remain ultra-loose, which ""binds how much room the dollar has to run and favors selling rallies,"" the note added.
Across the Atlantic, the euro was flat at $1.18235 and set for a 0.47% decline to end the week. However, ECB’s policy decision, handed down on Thursday, did give the single currency a small boost.
Although the central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at 0%, it indicated it would slow the pace of purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2021.
But with ECB President Christine Lagarde assuring markets that “the lady isn’t tapering” and the decision well within expectations, some investors were not surprised.
""It was a big event for economists, not so much for traders. The volatility was not there,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
Euro support at $1.18 ""needs to give way for shorts to get any real traction here,"" the note added."

The dollar index dropped 0.23% to 92.47, up from a one-month low of 91.94 on Friday.
Investors are focused on when the Federal Reserve is likely to begin paring bond purchases as it balances rising price pressures against a still relatively soft employment picture.
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans on Thursday said the U.S. economy is ""not out of the woods yet,"" and that despite strong economic growth and the promise of vaccines, challenges remain, including supply chain and labor market bottlenecks.
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, meanwhile, added her voice to the growing number of policymakers who say the weak August jobs report likely won't throw off the central bank's plan to trim its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases later this year.
Data on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly 18 months, offering more evidence that job growth was being hindered by labor shortages rather than cooling demand for workers.
The euro was also supported after the ECB maintained a dovish tone and offered no major surprises as it took a first small step toward unwinding the emergency aid that has propped up the euro zone economy during the pandemic.
In the past two quarters, the bank has purchased around 80 billion euros worth of debt each month. It provided no numerical guidance for the three months ahead, but analysts had predicted before the meeting that purchases would fall to between 60 billion and 70 billion euros in those months.
“The ECB is delivering mainly as expected today,” analysts at TD Securities said in a report. “Looking ahead, the focus will be on how the ECB defines ""moderately"" - anything less than €60bn/mo could be bearish.”
The euro gained 0.11% on the day to $1.1828.
Bitcoin edged higher it attempted to recover from a large and sudden price drop on Tuesday.
The cryptocurrency gained 1.28% to $46,680.

(Reuters) - Bearish bets on Thailand's baht hit a more than six-month low, while investors turned bullish on some emerging Asian currencies after months, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as worries around COVID-19 ease and vaccinations pick up pace.
Countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, have seen a drop in infections, enabling them to relax restrictions, while Singapore last month became the world's most vaccinated country after it fully inoculated 80% of its population.
The U.S. Federal Reserve holding off on earlier-than-expected tapering of its massive asset purchases kept the dollar in check and further supported sentiment towards emerging currencies.
Investors placed long bets on the Chinese yuan for the first time since mid-July, and cut short bets on South Korea's won, Malaysia's ringgit and the Philippine peso, according to the poll of 11 respondents.
They also turned bullish on Singapore's dollar and Indonesia's rupiah for the first time since mid-June.
Short positions on the baht unwounded to their lowest since Feb. 25 as the tourism-reliant economy relaxed COVID-19 curbs, prompting its leading joint-business group to raise its 2021 economic forecast.
Market view of the region's worst performing currency this year was also buttressed after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha survived a no confidence vote in parliament last week.
The baht is not out of woods yet, however, analysts at DBS Bank said while highlighting Thailand's flip to a current account deficit since last year and potential policy normalisation from the Fed.
""Thailand's need for external financing is coming at a potentially challenging period. The Thai baht is therefore vulnerable to any surprise in the Fed's hawkish tilt,"" they said.
The baht was seen weakening to 35-36 against the greenback by the first quarter of 2022. The currency traded at around 32.70 against the dollar on Thursday.
Long bets on India's rupee rose to their highest in more than six months, as investors were convinced that a sustained economic recovery was underway despite warnings of a possible third wave of COVID-19 infections.
""Policy makers are likely to remain wary about potential increases in infections and their impact on economic activity,"" Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Global Research said in a note this week.
""However, given the recent increase in vaccinations and the reduced sensitivity of economic activity to COVID-19 infections, the impact of any future rise in infections is unlikely to derail the recovery process.""
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Thursday, helped by concerns about the strength of the global recovery, while the euro was largely unchanged ahead of a key meeting of the European Central Bank.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, gained 0.1% to 92.730. 
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 110.06, EUR/USD edged higher  to 1.1815, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3769, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7359.
The dollar was hit hard by Friday's disappointing jobs report, which the market took to suggest that the Federal Reserve’s tapering of its bond-buying program would be delayed. 
However, the mood has turned a little more risk averse since, with several Fed policymakers on Wednesday signalling the U.S. central bank remains on track to reduce asset purchases this year even while rising Covid cases suggested a slowing in economic growth.
Earlier Thursday, China's factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August, with the producer price index rising 9.5% from a year earlier in August, driven by sharply rising raw materials prices.
Against this backdrop of rising global inflation, the European Central Bank will have to decide later Thursday whether the region’s economic recovery is strong enough to support an imminent reduction of its bond-buying.
Expectations are running high that the central bank will announce a timeline to slow down bond purchases, but also try to reassure markets that interest rate increases are still some way off.
“We expect the ECB message to fall short of such expectations, we think the risks are skewed towards a weaker EUR today,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “EUR/USD may therefore continue to unwind recent gains and move back towards the bottom of the 1.17-1.20 range.”
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.5% to 8.4992, with the lira on the back foot following Wednesday’s comments from the governor of the Turkish central bank, Sahap Kavcioglu, to the effect that core inflation was the key determinant of monetary policy.
“Given that headline and core are currently starting to diverge … the market seems a little fearful that a shift to early easing could emerge – perhaps even at the September 23rd CBT meeting,” said ING.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia ahead of the latest European Central Bank (ECB) policy decision. Worries about COVID-19's impact on economic recovery also gave the safe-have asset a small boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 92.668 by 10:54 PM ET (2:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 110.14.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7359 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7092.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.4604. Chinese inflation data released earlier in the day said that the consumer price index grew 0.1% month-on-month and 0.8% year-on-year in August. The producer price index grew 9.5% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3771.
New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams’s comment on Wednesday that more progress is needed in the job market before asset tapering can begin gave risk sentiment a small boost. However, the Fed is widely expected not to announce asset tapering anytime soon after the weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report released during the previous week.
Meanwhile, the ECB is likely to begin asset tapering when it hands down its policy decision later in the day. It could reduce its buying under the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) as low as EUR60 billion ($75.96 billion) monthly from the current EUR80 billion, before a further fall in early 2022 and the scheme’s expiry in March 2022.
However, some investors expect the ECB to continue monetary support for much longer even after PEPP ends.
""If the ECB board is going to discuss reducing its bond purchase under PEPP, it will make sure that it will continue with its conventional asset purchase program. So it is likely to be a policy change with a caveat. The euro may end up getting little boost in the end,"" Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno told Reuters.
The euro fell to $1.1819, continuing a retreat from a two-month high of $1.1909 hit during the previous week.
The Bank of Canada kept its interest steady at 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin continues its recovery from Tuesday’s 11% tumble. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s threat to sue Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) if it launches its ‘Lend’ product is also adding to bitcoin’s woes."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar pared gains on Wednesday as Treasury yields dipped after a Federal Reserve official offered a dovish outlook on the economy, and a day ahead of a European Central Bank policy decision.
New York Fed Bank President John Williams said that more progress is needed in the labor market to achieve the ""substantial further progress"" for the Fed's maximum employment goal.
He added, however, that it may be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to start reducing the pace of its asset purchases later this year if the economy continues to improve.
""The Fed is clearly in wait-and-see mode over the next couple of months to see how the economy holds up. Fed's Williams delivered some dovish comments that support the idea that the soonest the Fed could taper is December,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, said in a report.
Separately, the Fed said in its latest Beige Book that the U.S. economy ""downshifted slightly"" in August as the renewed surge of the coronavirus hit dining, travel and tourism.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six rivals, gained 0.14% to 92.66, after earlier rising to 92.86, the highest since August 27.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields fell to 1.33%, after earlier trading at 1.38%. The yields have risen since data on Friday showed that U.S. jobs growth slowed while wage inflation was higher than expected. [US/]
An uptick in inflation is complicating the picture for Fed officials who want to see further progress in employment before reducing bond purchases.
""At its very worst, there is some concern that nominal wages are still lagging consumer price increases by cycle extremes ... and that nominal wages are struggling to keep up with prices, which is how a wage-price spiral develops,"" Alan Ruskin, a macro strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said in a report on Tuesday.
Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. job openings rose to almost 11 million in July.
The euro dipped before the European Central Bank meeting set for Thursday. The ECB could tighten policy sooner than many anticipate as inflationary pressures could prove to be persistent, ECB policymaker Robert Holzmann said in a contribution to Eurofi Magazine on Wednesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters see PEPP purchases falling possibly as low as 60 billion euros a month from the current 80 billion, before a further fall early next year and the scheme's end in March.
The single currency was last down 0.13% on the day at $1.1823.
The greenback also gained against Canada's loonie on worries that the global economic outlook is deteriorating even as the Bank of Canada looked past a soft patch in the domestic economy. [CAD/]
Sterling dropped after the British government on Tuesday announced a tax hike to fund health spending and social care.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies struggled to rebound from hefty losses from Tuesday, when El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender and several trading platforms said they experienced performance issues.
Bitcoin dipped 1.22% to $46,283 after sinking as low as $42,900 on Tuesday. Earlier that day it had touched an almost four-month high of $52,956.
