Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Wednesday, benefiting from higher Treasury yields, caution ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy meeting and concerns over global growth. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, gained 0.1% to 92.635, just off its highest level so far in September. 
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 110.44, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1833, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3760, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7370, following the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision on Tuesday to extend its bond-buying the program through February.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded at 1.37% early Wednesday, just off Tuesday’s high of 1.39%, which was the highest level since mid-July, and a boost to the dollar. 
This yield soared in the wake of Friday's disappointing jobs report, which the market took to suggest that the Federal Reserve’s tapering of its bond-buying program would be delayed despite a spate of high inflation prints. 
The weak report added to fears that the rise in Covid cases, with the United States having recorded roughly 650,000 deaths and last week exceeded 40 million cases, would stunt U.S. economic growth in the second half of the year. Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) earlier this week cut its estimate for 2021 GDP growth in the U.S. to 5.7% from 6.2%.
Also attracting a degree of caution is the upcoming meeting of the European Central Bank, with discussions about the potential scaling back of its monetary stimulus becoming more vocal.
“The time to call an end to the pandemic-era bond purchases is not here, but we think the ECB will decide to slow down the pace of its bond buying at its meeting,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “Financial markets could interpret such a step with a slightly hawkish tilt.”
Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, both the Bank of Canada and Poland’s central bank are due to meet later Wednesday.
The BoC isn’t expected to change monetary policy at this meeting, particularly after disappointing second-quarter GDP data. The Polish central bank is also expected to leave its benchmark at a record-low 0.1%, where it has been for well over a year, but the European Union’s fastest inflation is putting pressure on the bank to lift interest rates.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, remaining near a one-week high. A weaker euro ahead of Thursday’s policy decision from the European Central Bank (ECB) gave the U.S. currency a boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 92.543 by 12:01 AM ET (4:01 AM GMT). It remained just below Tuesday's high of 92.571, last hit on Sep. 1.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 110.30.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7389 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7107.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.4636 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3779.
Investors now await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision for September, where the central bank is widely expected to hold off announcing that it will begin asset tapering.
The rising number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. could also give the Fed reason to delay withdrawing its support, with the total number of deaths passing 650,000 as of Sep. 8, according to Johns Hopkins University data. U.S. President Joe Biden is also due to outline a plan to tackle the rising number of daily COVID-19 cases on Thursday.
""Risk aversion in the air alongside the move up in UST yields have helped the dollar extend its post-payrolls recovery,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior foreign-exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
""Investors are wary of the ECB policy decision on Thursday, anticipating a potential trim to the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program bond-buying pace,” the note added.
In Asia Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its interest rate steady at 0.10% when it handed down its policy decision on Tuesday. The central bank also confirmed that it would begin asset tapering, with the program to continue until February 2022.
Lower oil prices weighed, while investors anticipate a dovish narrative in the Bank of Canada's policy decision, due later in the day following an unexpected economic contraction during the previous quarter, according to Catril's note.
In cryptocurrencies, El Salvador had a rocky start to its implementation of a law that makes bitcoin legal tender. Several trading platforms also reported performance issues."
2,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t read too much into the euro’s recent bout of strength -- its headwinds are continuing to swirl.
The common currency has advanced nearly 2% since Aug. 20 as dovish signals from the Federal Reserve weighed on the dollar. Yet with the European Central Bank’s policy decision just around the corner, and the pandemic damping the prospect of a hawkish shift, it may be running out of steam.
“The risks are skewed toward a lower euro-dollar pair because it’s been rallying and I think the ECB will out-dove market expectations,” said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management, who is short the shared currency.
But a hawkish tilt could also weigh on the euro, Athey said. The BTP-bund spread has narrowed to around 100 basis points this week, from close to 120 in May. Should the central bank surprise investors by scaling back stimulus faster than they expect, this risk gauge would widen again, weighing on appetite for the common currency.
Signs are mounting that the euro is bumping up against a ceiling. The euro-dollar pair is seen trading little changed at $1.19 by year-end, according to the median forecast of 84 analysts. It fluctuated close to that level on Tuesday. 
The euro could test $1.20 this week, its highest since late June, but it may require a bigger surprise than anything the ECB can offer to break out of its current range, said Kit Juckes, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London. “The best I can hope for is ‘steady as she goes,’” he said. 
To be sure, there are still bulls out there. At Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd., senior international economist Brian Martin sees the ECB scaling back bond buying soon, which could help the euro to rise.
Until now, the ECB has insisted that any surge in consumer prices is destined to be temporary, allowing officials led by President Christine Lagarde to keep crisis stimulus flowing. That contrasts with global counterparts such as the Federal Reserve, which has flagged the need to start talking about scaling back.
The currency will likely push higher if the ECB announces that it will taper its monthly asset puchases, but this is unlikely to last, according to Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange at Rabobank. “Lagarde will likely be keen to underpin the ECB’s dovish credentials and may try and avoid using the term ‘taper’ altogether,” she said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Tuesday, but remained near recent lows after last week’s frail jobs report, while attention turns to a number of central bank meetings during the week. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, gained 0.2% to 92.215, rebounding a touch after falling to a one-month low of 91.941 on Friday. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.92, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1865, just off last week’s high of 1.1909, while GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3824, after British house price growth slowed to 7.1% in August from 7.6% in July, the weakest reading in five months, according to mortgage lender Halifax. Prices still rose a surprisingly strong 0.7% on the month.
Monday’s U.S. holiday limited activity in the foreign exchange markets, after the latest U.S. jobs report disappointed, suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to delay any dialing down of monetary stimulus until November at least.
The “chances of the Fed announcing tapering at the September 22nd meeting seem to be dwindling,” analysts at ING said, in a note, after only 235,000 payrolls were added in August, with a resurgence in Covid-19 infections hurting the hospitality sector, in particular.
Still, with the jobs report now out of the way, the focus is now on policy decisions outside the U.S.
AUD/USD dropped 0.3% to 0.7416, falling from the recent high of 0.7477, after the Reserve Bank of Australia pushed ahead with a cautious reduction of its bond-buying program, although it extended the length of time it will exist.
The central bank said earlier Tuesday that it will purchase government bonds at a pace of A$4 billion ($3 billion) a week, down from A$5 billion previously. However, it will do this until at least mid-February, after originally planning to review the program in mid-November.
Next is the Bank of Canada, which will make its policy decisions on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar remains near its highest level in about three weeks, supported by belief that it will be reluctant to put off tightening policy despite the wave of Delta-variant Covid-19. 
Poland’s central bank is also due to meet on Wednesday, amid rising expectations for interest-rate increases. Inflation recently hit 5%, equaling its highest level in two decades.
The European Central Bank’s policy decision on Thursday will probably be the week’s highlight, with hawkish members becoming more vocal about the gradual scaling back of the central bank’s monetary stimulus. The ECB had increased its pace of bond-buying earlier in the year to stop Eurozone long-term rates being pulled higher by U.S. ones.
The debate within the ECB is likely to become more vocal after euro area inflation surged to a 10-year high at 3% last week, but it's not clear tthat there is a majority in the governing council for reducing purchases now.
Finally, on Friday, Russia’s central bank meets just a couple of weeks after annual inflation hit a five-year high. It raised its benchmark policy rate by 100 bps to 6.5% at its July meeting, and is expected to hike again.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, remaining near recent lows. Investors now await a central bank policy decision from Australia, and other central bank decisions due throughout the week, for any clues that they will begin asset tapering.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 92.112 by 10:33 PM ET (2:33 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 109.80.
The AUD/USD pair edge d up 0.12% to 0.7448 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7141.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.4559 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3851.
With the U.S. Federal Reserve likely to delay beginning asset tapering after the latest U.S. jobs report, the focus is now on policy decisions outside the U.S.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will go first, handing down its decision later in the day.
If RBA pauses its asset tapering plans, investors are likely to sell the Australian dollar and possibly push it towards its support level of around $0.7420. A hawkish central bank would send the currency higher, according to IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda.
Next is the Bank of Canada, which will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar remains near its highest level in about three weeks and is also above its 200-day moving average at C$1.2525 per dollar.
The European Central Bank’s policy decision will round up the week on Thursday.
The U.S. report, released during the previous week, showed that non-farm payrolls were lower than expected and put paid to expectations that the Fed would announce it is beginning asset tapering in September.
But how long this delay could be will not be clear for another month, NatWest's head strategist John Briggs said in a note.
""It does not necessarily derail our current timeline of a November announcement for December start. The next payroll report on Oct. 8 now looms very large as the main event in considering the timing of asset tapering,” the note added.
In Asia Pacific, Chinese trade data, including imports, exports and the trade balance, will be released later in the day. Further data, including the consumer and producer price indexes, will be released on Thursday."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar erased all losses sustained after last week's poor U.S. jobs report and extended broad gains on Monday as concerns about slowing global growth boosted its safe-haven appeal in holiday-calmed trade.
While the weak jobs report doused expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve might strike a hawkish note at a meeting later this month, analysts said the data is yet another reminder of global growth losing steam after a bounce earlier this year, a significant headwind for cyclical currencies such as the euro and the Aussie dollar. 
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six rivals, edged 0.2% higher to 92.25. It had dipped to 91.941 for the first time since Aug. 4 on Friday, when a closely watched U.S. labour report showed the world's largest economy created the fewest jobs in seven months in August. 
Though currencies stuck to recent well-worn trading ranges, the underlying sentiment turned in favour of the dollar in London trading as fears rose the global economy is set for a rough patch. U.S. markets are shut for a holiday.
Economic surprise indexes from the United States to China have slipped sharply in recent weeks while latest manufacturing surveys from Britain to Japan show the rise in coronavirus delta cases is sapping sentiment. 
""The key to the narrative in the next few weeks will be how sharply the growth data can snap back globally, if at all, how the Delta variant cases evolve as pupils return to school, and from a momentum perspective do we continue to see real money begin to put money back to work,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank.
The weak jobs report did not spark a new wave of dollar selling on Monday as the greenback spent the Asian and European session pushing higher against its rivals, prompting some major currencies including the euro and the Australian dollar to move back to pre-Friday jobs report levels.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields firming to more than one-week highs also boosted the dollar. U.S. markets were shut for a holiday, contributing to lower volumes.
HEDGE FUNDS BULLISH
While analysts remain bearish on the outlook for the greenback with Citibank strategists expecting it to weaken in the coming months as the Fed postpones tapering plans to November, hedge funds have quietly ramped up bullish bets.
Latest data showed they have increased bets on the greenback versus the euro for a second consecutive week, boosting net bets to their highest since March 2020.
Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), ascribed the dollar's rise to profit-taking on the euro and other currencies before central bank policy meetings this week.
Most of the dollar's gains was focused on the Australian dollar, which weakened 0.2% to $0.7436 ahead of a central bank decision on Tuesday where analysts remain divided on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will call time on its stimulus plans.
National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) predicts the central bank will reduce asset purchases again, ""although the optics of tapering amid protracted lockdowns means it is likely to be a close decision,"" NAB analyst Tapas Strickland wrote in a report.
The euro also failed to extend its gains on Monday after rising above the $1.19 level for the first time since the end of July. It was trading 0.1% weaker at $1.1866 before a European Central Bank policy decision on Thursday.

Economists reckon it is still too early for the ECB to call time on emergency stimulus, but it could agree to slow the pace of its bond buys after euro area inflation surged to a 10-year high at 3% last week.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was about flat at $51,862, after earlier touching $51,601, a level not seen since May 12. Smaller rival ether traded little changed at $3,932.77 after topping $4,000 last week for the first time since mid-May.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, but remained near a one-month low as Friday's disappointing jobs report weakened expectations of an early tapering of the Federal Reserve monetary stimulus.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, gained 0.2% to 92.172, after falling to 91.941 for the first time since Aug. 4 on Friday. Volatility is likely to be limited Monday with the U.S. markets on holiday. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.80, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1875, just off last week’s high of 1.1909, and GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3851.
The risk sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7440, but remained not far from the previous session’s high of 0.7477, its peak since July 15. The Reserve Bank of Australia holds its latest policy-setting meeting on Tuesday, and could reverse its tapering decision given the still rampant Covid-19 outbreak throughout the country. 
The dollar was hit hard by Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release, with the disappointing report impacting expectations of when the Federal Reserve will start tapering its massive bond-buying program.
Chairman Jerome Powell has made a recovery in the country’s labor market a key condition for such a move, but only 235,000 payrolls were added in August, following a resurgence in Covid-19 infections. That was the smallest gain in seven months, and was way below the previous month’s over one million growth. 
“A tapering plan launched in September would either need to be 100% data dependent or else the discussion will have to be postponed until November,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
The weekly jobless claims data will now be studied carefully on Thursday for further clues about the strength of the labor market, but Friday’s producer price release for August will also be of interest after July data showed the largest annual increase in over a decade.
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank is due to hold its latest monetary policy setting meeting this week, with hawkish members becoming more vocal about the gradual scaling back of the central bank’s monetary stimulus.
German factory orders, released earlier Monday, rose 3.4% on the month in July, a slight slowdown in growth from the previous month, but still a lot better than had been expected.

In Europe, the U.S. data gave the euro a boost as expectations that the European Central Bank would begin asset tapering when it hands down its policy decision on Thursday. The euro was flat at $1.18775 after hitting its highest level since Jun. 29, $1.1909, at the end of the previous week.
With labor market recovery a condition for the Fed to begin asset tapering, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA) analysts now expect the process to begin in December 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell for a fourth straight day against a basket of other major currencies on Friday after a much weaker than expected U.S. payrolls report that is likely to keep the Federal Reserve at bay in scaling back its massive stimulus measures.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 in August, well short of the 728,000 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, while the unemployment rate dipped to 5.2% from 5.4% in the prior month.
The dollar index dropped to a low of 91.941, its lowest level since Aug. 4, and was last down 0.231% at 92.014. The index is down about 0.7% on the week. 
The dollar has been subdued on uncertainty over the path of Fed policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last Friday that while tapering of its stimulus could begin this year if job growth continues, the central bank was in no hurry to do so. 
Rising COVID-19 cases in recent weeks have brought on concerns the economic recovery could stall. The jobs data will likely keep the Fed on hold. 
""It adds more concern or focus on the October number, because now we want to see if there is a trend,"" said JB Mackenzie, managing director for futures and forex at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
""(The Fed) is trying to telegraph that if the economy continues to heat up and they need to take action, they will, and that transparency is important to the markets and that is one of the main reasons you continue to see not a huge reaction to the downside here because the market feels as though they have been given that clear direction.""
Mackenzie said the 92 level was an important support level for the greenback after having bounced back from that level in early August. 
Separately, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed activity in the services sector grew at a moderate pace in August, with signs that rising prices and supply constraints were beginning to ease. 
The euro strengthened against the greenback following the report, touching a high of 1.1909 to match its best level since July 30. 
The single currency has been supported by data earlier this week that showed regional inflation at a decade high and hawkish comments from European Central Bank officials ahead of a policy meeting on Sept. 9.
The euro was last up 0.15% to $1.1891.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.29% versus the greenback to 109.62 per dollar, gaining ground after the jobs data, but showed little reaction to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's decision to step down at the end of the month.
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last rose 2.2% to $50,358.39 while ethereum last rose 4.48% to $3,956.04 after rising as high as $4,025 to top the $4,000 mark for the first time since May 15.

TORONTO (Reuters) - There is less upside for Canada's dollar over the coming year, according to analysts who are weighing the effect of a surprise contraction in the economy and signs of a cooler housing market on the Bank of Canada's policy outlook, a Reuters poll showed.
With about 68% of its population fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Canada's economy could be positioned better than some others to cope with a fourth wave of the virus.
Still, the economy surprisingly shrank in the second quarter, when lockdowns were in place, and likely had far less momentum than had been expected heading into the summer, data showed on Tuesday.
The Bank of Canada had expected second-quarter growth of 2%, so the data could cause it to raise its estimate of the economy's spare capacity.
That's crucial because the BoC has pledged to keep interest rates on hold until slack is absorbed, which would occur in the second half of 2022 according to the central bank's latest forecast. 
The data ""does create a bit of a question mark about just how quickly the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates going forward,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.
""It does raise the risk of maybe a slightly more dovish than we are currently expecting Bank of Canada, at least on the messaging front.""
The BoC is due to make an interest rate decision next Wednesday but an update of its economic projections is not expected until October.
Meanwhile, a snap Canadian election has been called for Sept. 20 but analysts see little difference between the major parties on fiscal and economic policy and doubt it will have much lasting impact on the currency.
The median forecast of 36 strategists, polled Aug. 30-Sept. 2, was for the Canadian dollar to strengthen around 1.6% in three months to 1.2350 per U.S. dollar, or 80.97 U.S. cents, compared to 1.2250 in last month's poll.
It was then expected to rise further to 1.22 in a year's time. In August, the forecast was 1.21.
The currency has gained 1.4% since the start of the year, the best performance among G10 currencies, helped by higher commodity prices. Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil.
But oil has pulled back from a July peak, with the outlook for demand becoming more uncertain and OPEC raising output.
A combination of more oil supply and weakening residential investment could weigh on the Canadian dollar next year, said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.
Housing investment boomed during the pandemic but the market has cooled from its March peak, while a recent Reuters poll showed property market analysts expect prices to come off the boil next year.[CA/HOMES]

The Bank of Canada ""will not be as eager to raise rates"" should the slow down in housing activity continue, Brown said.

BUENOS AIRES/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Brazil's real will continue to get some aid this year from solid trade surpluses and further interest rate hikes that should help avoid bigger losses for the currency as domestic tensions intensify, a Reuters poll showed.
The real has been rangebound, trading 4.90-5.40 against the U.S. dollar for roughly three months, while Brazil benefits from an export boom fueled by China's recovering demand and a weak exchange rate after the coronavirus-related hit of 2020.
A strong current account result has become the economy's brightest spot, driving hard currency into Brazil at a time when some investors who are too worried about local politics keep selling the real, pushing it downwards. 
In the short term, it is likely to settle near the mid-point of its recent interval, close to 5.15, not far off where it is trading now, according to median estimates of 22 strategists in a poll taken Aug. 31-Sept. 2. 
""The trade balance, commodity prices, terms of trade, interest differentials, and a reduction in global risk aversion, in general are associated with a stronger BRL,"" said Ramon Wiest, executive manager at Caixa Economica Federal.
Brazil posted a $7.7 billion trade surplus in August, keeping a stellar performance of record monthly levels due to a steady flow of high-volume sales of key commodities like soybeans and iron ore.
Also favoring the local currency, the central bank is expected to hike its rate further to 7.0% by the end of 2021, according to a separate Reuters poll, closing the year with a staggering increase of 500 basis points, cumulatively.
Still, the real was projected to depreciate 4.0%, from Thursday's levels of 5.18, to change hands at 5.40 against the greenback in 12 months, when Brazil will be going through the final leg of the campaign for next year's presidential vote. 
Reuters poll graphic on the outlook for USD/BRL and USD/MXN: https://tmsnrt.rs/3kQKV3a
That softer outlook reflects the country's bitter political climate. Cranking up the rhetoric, President Jair Bolsonaro said last week he saw three alternatives for his future: winning the 2022 elections, death or prison.
He has previously questioned Brazil's electronic voting system and threatened to not accept October's vote results. Bolsonaro trails former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in most opinion polls.
In Mexico, the peso will follow a softer trend into next year after months of unremarkable trading performance. It is expected to trade at 20.45 per U.S. dollar in 12 months, shedding around 2.3% from this week's trading levels.

The main concern is how stimulus tapering will pan out in the United States. ""The peso will tend to weaken as expectations of a more restrictive stance by the U.S. Federal Reserve increase,"" said Ricardo Aguilar, chief economist at Invex.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The zloty has further space to climb after a rally this week as chances grow that Poland's central bank will begin lifting interest rates sooner rather than later, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The Polish currency has lagged peers in central Europe in 2021 with the Hungarian forint and Czech crown leading as their respective central banks have started tightening cycles amid a post-pandemic economic recovery and rising inflation pressures.
While Poland's central bank has resisted turning too quickly to interest rate rises, a spike in headline inflation to a two-decade high in August has spurred speculation that a hike as soon as November is now possible. Other analysts have said a first move is only likely next year.
The zloty jumped 1.2% on Tuesday and Wednesday after the inflation data came out, its biggest two-day rise since April.
The Reuters poll forecasts the zloty to gain another 1.8% over the next 12 months, reaching 4.425 to the euro, a forecast similar to the poll a month ago.
But with risks around issues - like the treatment of foreign currency loans that have gone to courts, or political battles between Warsaw and the European Union - the zloty's ride is unlikely to be smooth.
Malgorzata Krzywicka, an analyst with Erste Group Bank, said the zloty would still underperform peers until the Polish central bank launches rate hikes.
""The recent strengthening is overdone and there could be a correction coming, but nothing very strong. I think the reaction (to an eventual rate hike) will be lighter but in the next year there could be some more appreciation.""
The forint has been central Europe's top gainer in 2021 with a climb of more than 4%. 
It is forecast to continue to strengthen and rise 0.8% over the next year to 345.2 to the euro. The crown was expected to gain 1.0% to 25.10 per euro in 12 months' time.
""The positive interest rate differential against the euro should support both (the crown and forint) currencies in the coming months,"" said Radomir Jac, chief economist for Generali (MI:GASI) Investments CEE.

""But I share the view that the Hungarian central bank will moderate the pace and frequency of interest rate hikes...This is likely to lead to a slower pace of strengthening of the forint compared to the appreciation seen in summer and compared to the crown and zloty.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Friday, trading near a one-month low, with all eyes on the release of the monthly U.S. jobs report given its potential impact on Federal Reserve policy. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged lower to 92.210, after earlier falling to 92.153 for the first time since Aug. 5. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 110.03, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3836, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7422, trading at its highest level since Aug. 5.
The Federal Reserve, and Chairman Jerome Powell in particular, has made a recovery in the country’s labor market a key condition for starting to withdraw its extraordinary monetary stimulus, a move that would benefit the dollar.
This puts the official monthly employment report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), firmly in investors’ crosshairs, amid worries that spiking Covid-19 cases will weigh on the labor market recovery.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 750,000 in August, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.2% from 5.4%, but this would still represent a fall from the 943,000 jobs created in July, and the omens aren’t positive.
ADP private payrolls grew by just 374,000 in August, much lower than the around 600,000 jobs that had been widely expected, while Thursday’s weekly jobless claims only showed a small improvement.
The Fed is likely to wait until November to announce the tapering of its asset purchases, former Federal Reserve official Dennis Lockhart said on Thursday, providing policymakers with more data on the labor market's recovery and economic growth.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% at 1.1877, not far removed from the day’s high of 1.1884, the highest level since Aug. 4.
The euro has been bid of late, helped by sIgns of economic growth in the eurozone as well as rising inflationary pressure, with annual PPI climbing to 12.1% in July, data showed Thursday.
The European Central Bank is due to meet next week, and the policymakers are sure to have a vigorous discussion about the gradual scaling back of the central bank’s monetary stimulus.
“It is no longer carved in stone that the Fed will taper ahead of the ECB,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
USD/CNY edged higher to 6.4582 after China’s Caixin services purchasing managers’ index for August fell into contraction territory at 46.7, the lowest level since April 2020."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, tumbling to its lowest level in almost a month as the week draws to a close. Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report that could prod the Federal Reserve to begin asset tapering earlier than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 92.188 by 10:32 PM ET (2:32 AM GMT). It hit the 92.189-mark earlier for the first time since Aug. 5.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 109.89.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7402, with Australia releasing retail sales figures earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 0.7114.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4593. China’s Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for August was 46.7, below the 50-mark indicating growth.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3841.
The U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is due later in the day. However, the non-farm payrolls estimate ranges from as little as 375,000 to over a million.
A Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) note forecasts the U.S. added 800,000 jobs in August, which is enough to spur the Fed to begin asset tapering although the bar for an announcement at the central bank’s next meeting has been raised by the current COVID-19 outbreak.
""The risk is uncertainty associated with COVID-19 stands in the way of an imminent asset tapering announcement,"" which would reverse any dollar gains from a strong payrolls report, the note added.
The Fed has made labor market recovery a condition to begin asset tapering, with expectations that it would begin imminently giving the U.S. currency a boost for much of August. Although the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. also climbed, this further boosted the safe-haven dollar.
However, investors sounded a retreat from the dollar’s nine-and-a-half-month high hit on Aug. 20 as the Fed hinted that it could delay tightening monetary policy due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that asset tapering could still possibly begin within 2021 at the Jackson Hole symposium that took place during the previous week. He also said that there was no rush to subsequently hike interest rates, which sent the greenback down further."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's direction is in limbo as financial markets await a clearer path from the U.S. Federal Reserve, according to a Reuters poll of FX strategists who were split on where they expected the currency to trade over the next three months.
On the back foot even before Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments last Friday at Jackson Hole, the greenback has lost almost 1.4% since it hit a nine-month high about two weeks ago. But it is still up around 3% for the year.
While analysts in the Aug. 30-Sept. 2 poll of nearly 60 FX strategists expected the greenback to give up most of those gains over the coming year, they were increasingly uncertain about both the short- and medium-term outlook.
""There's two important forces when we look at the direction of the dollar. The first is the global recovery and the momentum we've seen most recently and the second point is obviously the central banks' response to that,"" said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Melbourne.
""Because those two forces are competing at the moment, we're relatively neutral about the direction of the U.S. dollar.""
Eventual Fed tapering of its $120 billion of monthly bond purchases, which an over 75% majority of 51 analysts expected the central bank to announce in the final quarter of this year, should help U.S. Treasury yields to move higher.
""Ultimately, we think in a world where real yields will continue to rise over the coming months, it's likely to be dollar positive,"" said David Adams, head of FX strategy in North America at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""We continue to be dollar bullish, particularly versus the low yielding funding currencies - that would be the Japanese yen and the euro.""
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Aug. 27 showed speculators had once again increased their net long U.S. dollar positions.
But underscoring the prevailing uncertainty, there was no consensus among analysts who answered an additional question on how the dollar would trade over the next three months.
Although 23 of 60 strategists said they expected the currency to trade around current levels, 25 said broadly higher. The remaining 12 chose broadly lower.
While sticking to their long-held view of a weakening dollar over a 12-month horizon, analysts were turning skeptical.
Asked how confident they were in that view, 62% of strategists, 36 of 58, said they were not confident or not at all confident. Twenty-two chose confident. 
With most major currencies expected to strengthen against the dollar in the next 12 months, the euro was forecast up a little over 2% for the same period. The common currency is down 3% this year. 
Most emerging market currencies were also forecast to weaken or at best cling to a range over the next three to six months as U.S. stimulus withdrawal could push investors to shun the currencies coined the ""fragile five"" - Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, India and Indonesia - as they did in 2013. [EMRG/POLL]
""The dollar tends to weaken when we have a lot of risk appetite, pulling money into emerging markets and what we've seen recently is the Delta variant really shaking up Asian markets and that degree of uncertainty has been amplified by this tapering debate,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank in London.

""It is a combination of those two factors that have seen flows being pulled back to the dollar. In order for the dollar to weaken again we would have to have a huge amount of flows going into emerging markets, and I can't see that happening imminently.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Thursday following strong labor market data, while the euro remained near a one-month high versus the greenback after European Central Bank policymakers made comments that kept inflation concerns in focus.
U.S. weekly initial jobless claims fell last week, and layoffs dropped to their lowest in more than 24 years. Still, rising COVID-19 cases in recent weeks have threatened the economic recovery, keeping the Federal Reserve from pulling back on its massive stimulus.
""It was better than expected but it wasn’t enough to change anyone’s views about what is going on, or the pace of tapering or what Friday’s number might be. It was just within the range of estimates,"" said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss. 
On Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report was much weaker than expected. On Friday, the U.S. government will report on payrolls for August. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 750,000, with the unemployment rate anticipated to dip to 5.2% from 5.4%, according to Reuters estimates. 
The dollar has been subdued on uncertainty over Fed policy. Last Friday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said that tapering of its stimulus could begin this year, yet the central bank was in no hurry.
""They’ve pretty much nailed their colors to the mast, they said unless all hell breaks loose they are going to start tapering this year, so we would have to see a massive miss or probably several massive misses for them to delay it,"" said Gittler. 
Other data showed new orders for U.S.-made goods rose in July, while business spending on equipment remained strong, despite supply constraints and spending trends moving away from goods towards services.
The dollar index fell 0.303% at 92.229, after falling as low as 92.219, its lowest level since Aug. 5. 
The euro was up 0.31% to $1.1874.
Other data this week showed inflation rose 3% in the euro zone for August, which helped push the euro to a one-month high of 1.8745, its highest since Aug. 4. On Thursday, data showed manufacturing remained strong in the region but supply chain issues sent prices higher.
Recent comments from European Central Bank hawks including Austria's Robert Holzman and Bundesbank boss Jens Weidman also supported the single currency. ECB President Lagarde said the region was recovering from the pandemic and only needed ""surgical"" support.
The ECB is scheduled to hold a policy meeting on Sept. 9.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback at 109.96 per dollar. Sterling was last trading at $1.3834, up 0.48%. 
Among crytpocurrencies, Bitcoin broke the $50,000 mark for the first time since August 23 and last rose 0.98% to $49,333.82. Ethereum last fell 1.5% to $3,774.04 after touching a 3-1/2 month high of $3,837.20 on Wednesday.

Investing.com - The dollar remained trading around multi-week lows Thursday, with weak U.S. private payrolls data raising doubts about the country’s labor market recovery, while the euro surged to a one-month high.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, edged higher to 92.483, after dropping to a four-week low of 92.376 overnight. 
USD/JPY edged lower to 109.97, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3782, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7380, helped by Australia's trade surplus widening to a record in July as exports of resources all rose strongly.
U.S. employment data released on Wednesday showed the ADP private payrolls grew by 374,000 in August, much lower than the around 600,000 jobs that had been widely expected.
Although the ADP report has been an inconsistent guide as to the official monthly jobs report, this was a very big miss and it could point to nonfarm payrolls falling short of the 750,000 gain expected. This would prompt investors to push out expectations for Fed asset tapering.
The weekly initial jobless claims release, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), will also be carefully studied for clues of the strength of the labor market. Economists are looking for 345,000 claims, a small drop from the 353,000 seen the previous week.
Contrasting with the dollar weakness, the euro climbed to a one-month high against the greenback of 1.1857, with EUR/USD currently up 0.1% at 1.1843.
SIgns of economic growth in the Eurozone, coupled with inflationary pressure as the region’s CPI climbed to 3% on Wednesday, have boosted the single currency.
Additionally, European Central Bank policymakers have begun talking publicly about their tapering plans, with Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank, mentioning on Wednesday the gradual scaling back of the central bank’s monetary stimulus.
“We have to watch the risks to the outlook for prices. In my view, upside risks predominate,” the influential German central bank chief said.
“The ECB July meeting was all about revising the forward guidance on rates. The debate on what to do with the bond purchases will be ahead in the September meeting,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Eurozone producer prices for July are due later in the session, and these will be carefully studied as an indication of the pressures manufacturers are under to raise prices.
Emerging market currencies, whose central banks have been quicker to tighten monetary policy than advanced economies, continue to benefit from perceptions that the Fed will stay on hold for at least another month or two. The South African rand gained 0.4% to its highest in a month, In Latin America, The Mexican, Chilean and Colombian pesos have all gained nearly 2% against the dollar in the last week.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia but remained near multi-week lows. However, disappointing U.S. employment data ahead of the latest U.S. jobs report, which is expected to guide the timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve's asset tapering timeline, capped gains for the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 92.507 by 10:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 109.97.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7361, with Australia releasing better-than-expected trade data for July earlier in the day. Exports grew 5% and imports grew 3% month-on-month, while the trade balance stood at AUD12.117 billion.
The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7063, as investors bet on a Reserve Bank of New Zealand interest rate hike in October.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.4622 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3775.
Data from the U.S. released on Wednesday showed the ADP nonfarm employment change was 374,000 in August, much lower than the 613,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
""The big miss was too big to ignore,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters, since it could point to the jobs report figures falling short of forecasts and prompt investors to push out expectations for Fed asset tapering.
""Bad news in the labor market is good news for risk assets given the punchbowl will remain well liquefied for a bit longer,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing purchasing managers index was 59.9 in August.
Further U.S. data, including factory orders as well as trade data including exports, imports and the trade balance, will be released later in the day. The U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, will follow a day later.
With Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasizing that the labor market recovery will determine the asset tapering timeline, the jobs report is likely to provide investors with clues. However, they are finding it tough to predict the non-farm payrolls number.
""Given the dollar flow, one could argue that the market is now positioned for non-farm payrolls to come in modestly below expectations, perhaps in the 550,000 to 600,000 range. But that is just my guesstimate. Economists' ability to forecast payrolls is low,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after a report on the U.S. labor market missed expectations by a wide margin, while the euro climbed to a one-month high on inflation worries. 
The greenback fell after the ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls rose by 374,000 in August, up from 326,000 in July but well short of the 613,000 forecast. A report on weekly initial jobless claims arrives on Thursday and on Friday the government releases the payrolls report for August, which could provide clues about the Federal Reserve's policy path. 
""Certainly the recovery has been uneven but if nonfarm payrolls should also disappoint, that would seemingly close the door to an imminent taper and keep the dollar in a bit of a funk,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington DC. 
The dollar has been under pressure since Friday, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the Jackson Hole conference that while tapering could begin this year, the central bank was in no hurry to raise interest rates.
Concerns about rising COVID-19 cases denting the economic rebound could also serve to keep the central bank from scaling back stimulus. 
Other data showed U.S. manufacturing activity increased more than anticipated in August, but a measure of employment in factories fell to a nine-month low, likely due to a shortage of workers. 
The dollar index fell 0.203% and hit a new one-month low of 92.376. 
The euro rose against the greenback to a one-month high as inflation worries persisted following data on Tuesday which showed euro zone inflation increased to 3% year-on-year in August, the highest in a decade and above the European Central Bank's 2% target, as well as the 2.7% Reuters forecast.
The euro was up 0.3% to $1.1843, after rising to as much as 1.1857, its highest level since Aug. 5.
""We have seen numbers that argue against keeping policy so low for so long and that has been helping the euro... it is certainly going to heighten the focus on the QE debates next week when we hear from the ECB,"" said Manimbo. 
German Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said euro zone inflation risks overshooting ECB projections and the central bank should prepare for the end of its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP).
The ECB is scheduled to hold a policy meeting on Sept. 9. 
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback at 109.97 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3773, up 0.14% on the day. 
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last rose 2.9% to $48,521.68 while Ethereum last rose 8.18% to $3,713.24. Ether rose as high as $3,791.28 on the day, its highest level since May 16.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Wednesday, but remains near its lowest point in three weeks, after weak economic data out of both China and the Eurozone.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.745, after dropping on Tuesday as low as 92.395 for the first time since Aug. 6.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1799, after climbing to 1.1845 in the previous session, the highest since Aug. 5, USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 110.22, GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3757, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7330.
China’s Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 49.2 in August, below the 50-mark indicating growth, contracting for the first time since April 2020.  The [[elease points to slowing growth momentum in the world’s second-largest economy after China imposed strict measures to bring new virus cases under control last month. USD/CNY edged higher to 6.4617.
A further sign of slowing momentum was evident in Germany, where retail sales slumped 5.1% on the month in July, much more than expected. Despite that, upbeat comments from European Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos and policymakers Robert Holzmann and Klaas Knot all pointed to the possibility of ECB policy turning slightly more restrictive toward the end of the year.
However, it is the August U.S. employment report, due on Friday, which remains uppermost in minds. 
“At this stage, it appears that a September tapering announcement will highly depend on this week’s U.S. jobs data,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Another strong number should give some support to the dollar which has otherwise remained broadly offered since the start of this week.”
The payrolls are widely expected to increase by around 750,000 in August, a strong number, but this would still represent a drop from the growth of 943,000 the previous month. ADP's survey of private-sector hiring is due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT).
The dollar was hit by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, who indicated that the central bank was still likely to start to reduce its asset purchases this year but had no plans to start lifting interest rates anytime soon.
“There is an urge at the FOMC to de-link tapering and tightening,” added ING, and this “ultimately weighed on the dollar given the uncertainty around a 2022 rate hike (which, however, remains part of our economist’s forecasts).”
Also weighing on the greenback was Tuesday’s U.S. Conference Board consumer confidence index release, which came in at a six-month low.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia but was trading near its lowest point in nearly three weeks. Investors continued to keep moves small, with the latest U.S. jobs report, which could provide clues to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset tapering timeline, due on Friday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.10% to 92.730 by 11:25 PM ET (3:25 AM GMT). It fell as low as 92.395 for the first time since Aug. 6 on Tuesday.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.16% to 110.19.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7314. The Australian GDP grew 9.6% year-on-year and 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021.The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7040.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.4633, with China’s Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI), at a disappointing 49.2 in August, below the 50-mark indicating growth.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3739.
After climbing to a nine-and-a-half month high of 93.734 on Aug. 20, the greenback has since been on a downward trend as some Fed officials suggested that asset tapering would not begin imminently.
While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that asset tapering could begin in 2021 at the previous week’s Jackson Hole symposium, he did not provide a concrete timetable. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester also said on Monday that she was not yet convinced that recent inflation data satisfied the central bank's price stability goal.
On the data front, the U.S. Conference Board (CB) consumer confidence index was 113.8, a six-month low, while the S&P/Case-Shiller 20 n.s.a. house price index composite grew a record 19.1% in June.
With labor market recovery one of the Fed’s conditions to begin asset tapering, investors will be paying attention to the latest U.S. jobs report that includes non-farm payrolls, due out of Friday.
""The dollar uptrend is over for the time being at least,"" after Powell successfully separated the debate over taper timing from any decisions about higher rates, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
""Positive price action"" in the Australian and New Zealand dollars since their Aug. 20 lows suggests ""a base has now been formed for both currencies,"" the note added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest level in more than three-weeks against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, as investors looked to U.S. jobs figures later this week for insight into the possible path of U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy.
The greenback has struggled since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's said at the Jackson Hole conference on Friday that tapering could begin this year, but the central bank was in no hurry to raise interest rates.
""If the payrolls number disappoints, then eurodollar has another excuse to trade higher again because that is going to bring out all the doves again saying the Fed is not going to taper in September,"" said Erik Bregar, director and head of FX strategy at the Exchange Bank of Canada in Toronto. 
The dollar briefly pared some of its decline on the session after the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas showed U.S. single-family home prices rose in June from the prior year at the fastest pace on record. 
Choppiness for the greenback ensued as a weaker-than-expected Chicago PMI for August saw the dollar trim its decline, only to once again resume a downward move after the Conference Board's reading for consumer confidence fell short of expectations, weighed down by rising COVID-19 cases and higher inflation. 
Investors will look to a round of U.S. data later this week to gauge the strength of the labor market, culminating with payrolls numbers due Friday, in an effort to determine when the Fed may begin tightening its policy. 
""All these releases are having minor influences, but if you are looking for a big move, maybe wait until Friday,"" said Bregar. 
Analysts said trade on Tuesday may also be influenced by month-end stock portfolio rebalancing, which could lead to flows into the Canadian dollar, sterling and the Swiss franc and out of the greenback.
The dollar index fell 0.065%, with the euro up 0.12% to $1.1809.
The dollar hit a low of 92.395 on the day, its lowest level since Aug. 6 but is still up more than 0.6% for the month. 
Data earlier in the day showed euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year-high this month, with consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro up by 3%. 
Sterling strengthened to a two-week high of $1.3807, and was last trading at $1.3753, down 0.04% on the day. 
The Japanese yen weakened 0.04% versus the greenback at 109.96 per dollar. 
In crytocurrencies, bitcoin last rose 0.49% to $47,235.84 while ethereum last rose 4.95% to $3,386.14. Ether rose to as much as $3,475, its highest level since May 18. The cryptocurrency is up more than 30% for August, on pace for its biggest monthly percentage gain since April.

22,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Chile’s peso, the worst performing major currency this month, is about to get some uncharacteristic help from the central bank. 
The currency has tumbled 3% in August ahead of presidential elections in November -- the biggest decline among 32 peers tracked by Bloomberg. That has brought its drop in the past four months to 9.5% -- more than double any other major Latin American currency except Peru’s sol.
In the next month however, economics may trump politics. Policy makers are expected to raise the key rate by a half-point late on Tuesday, the biggest increase in a decade. And with a retail sales boom at fever pitch, some are even contemplating a 75 basis-point increase, something that hasn’t been seen in Chile since 2001. Add in falling Covid cases, and the currency’s worst days may well be behind it.
“The central bank has fallen behind the curve and there are clear signs that the economy is overheating,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a report. 
The bank assigns a 65% probability to a 50 basis-point increase to 1.25%, and a 10% possibility to a larger boost, according to to the report released Friday.
Catching Up
What’s more, the central bank is likely to continue hiking rates well into next year as it grapples with the fastest inflation since 2016, further underpinning the peso.
Swaps now price the policy rate at over 3% in 12 months, implying more than 225 basis points of hikes. Economists surveyed by the central bank are more cautious, forecasting the key rate at 2%.
Expectations of a faster pace of tightening, coupled with a recovery in copper prices, could help the peso strengthen toward its 50-day moving average near 763 per dollar. The currency has traded on the weaker side of that average since mid-May. 
Copper, which accounts for over half of Chilean exports, climbed 1.2% in London on Monday, bringing its gain this year to 21%.
Opening Up
Another positive development comes from falling Covid infections, with the government lifting nearly all lockdown restrictions in the capital Santiago. Investors should take note of the rally in the Thai baht last week, the biggest in 14 years, after the government announced the removal of some quasi-lockdown curbs.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) turned neutral on the Chilean peso in its EM bond portfolio on Monday versus an underweight position previously. The currency’s real effective exchange rate has looked undervalued relative to copper since late 2019, and the performance gap has widened in recent weeks, according to analysts led by Dirk Willer, head of EM Fixed Income Strategy. 
The “idiosyncratic depreciations” tend to have a bigger impact on inflation and may push the central bank to go more hawkish, Citi analysts say.
Others are more cautious. RBC Capital Markets prefers to short the peso, citing the risk of polls showing growing support for the left ahead of November’s election. The central bank may also act “more prudently” at its meeting, disappointing market expectations, RBC says.

Investing.com - The dollar fell to two-week lows in early European trade Tuesday, continuing the weakness stemming from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish speech at the end of last week and looking ahead to Friday’s key employment report.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 92.472, just above its lowest level in a fortnight.
EUR/USD edged 0.3% higher to 1.1829, near its highest levels since the start of the month, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 109.82, GBP/USD gained 0.3% to 1.3799, near a two-week high, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.6% to 0.7338.
The U.S. currency is still suffering the consequences of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell declining on Friday to offer a firm signal on when the central bank plans to cut its asset purchases, surprising many in the market who had been looking for a concrete timetable.
“The most hawkish part of the FOMC has been extremely vocal in recent weeks, including the host of the Jackson Hole, Esther George, but it still seems as if the FOMC is yet to form a consensus/majority view on how to address tapering at the meeting in September,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Helping the general risk-on tone was the official end of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, with the last aircraft departing from Kabul airport, meeting President Joe Biden’s timetable, without any further American casualties.
Attention now turns to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release, particularly given the importance the central bank has placed upon a recovery in the labor market in its tapering thinking.
The payrolls are currently expected to increase by around 750,000 in August, a drop from the growth of 943,000 the previous month, but concerns are rising that the delay in outlining a timetable for tapering was caused by expectations of a poor number.
Weaker jobs numbers could instead cement a case for later action - perhaps a pre-announcement in November with a formal decision in December.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY edged 0.1% lower to 6.4619, not far removed from Friday’s three-week low of 6.4595, with the yuan largely weathering the disappointing economic data released earlier in the day.
Manufacturing PMI dipped to 50.1 from 50.4 last month, showing factory activity expanded at a slower pace. The non-manufacturing PMI in August slumped to 47.5, the lowest reading since February 2020,

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia but remained near two-week lows. Moves were mostly light as August draws to a close, with the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payroll numbers, due later in the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 92.662 by 10:28 PM ET (2:28 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.05% to 109.87.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7293, after peaking at $0.7317 last Friday. The NZD/USD pair was up 0.38% to 0.7025.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.4684. China released lower-than-expected economic data earlier in the day, with the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 50.1 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 47.5 in August. The offshore Chinese yuan remained close to its three-week high of 6.4595 hit on Friday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3765.
The greenback clawed back some of its losses after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell did not provide a firm timetable for asset tapering to begin beyond hinting that it could begin within 2021.
""The jobs report, due on Friday, will be the next highlight given the focus on the Fed's asset taper. A strong reading will boost expectations that the Fed will give markets prior notice in September before a formal decision in November,"" Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
However, numbers that are lower than expected could delay the notice to November with the formal decision following a month later.
In Europe, the consumer price index for August is due later in the day. The euro traded at $1.1799, near Monday's three-week high of $1.1810, earlier in the Asian session.
Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was at CAD1.2610, after hitting a two-week high on Monday as strong oil prices led to a wider-than-expected Canadian current account. Oil prices, in turn, climbed to three-week highs, with re-start timelines for platforms, refineries and pipelines in the U.S. Gulf Coast remaining uncertain after Hurricane Ida blew through the region over the weekend."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar stabilized after falling to two-week lows on Monday as the greenback attempted to recover from Friday's drop on comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that were interpreted as dovish.
The dollar had one of its biggest daily percentage declines of the month on Friday after Powell said tapering could begin this year, but the central bank was in no hurry to raise interest rates.
The dollar index hit a two-week low at 92.595 before firming slightly, and was last up 0.008% at 92.677. 
""The market is still digesting Powell’s dovish tapering speech and you are probably seeing the market is a little confused that Treasury yields are not getting the go-ahead for lift-off here, and that is going to be data dependent on everything with inflation and the job markets,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 1.2852%, from 1.312% late on Friday as investors began to turn their focus to Friday's U.S. payrolls report, which will provide more insight into the Fed's likely policy path.
Expectations are for non-farm payrolls to increase by 750,000 in August, with the unemployment rate forecast to dip to 5.2% from 5.4%. Other data likely to be eyed this week include inflation figures from Europe as well as gauges of the U.S. and Chinese manufacturing sectors.
""You are probably not going to see a whole lot of conviction behind anything before we get past Friday,"" said Moya. 
The dollar briefly ticked higher following data on Monday that showed pending home sales declined for a second straight month in July and a report on manufacturing activity in August from the Dallas Federal Reserve showed a slowing from the prior month.
The euro was up 0.06% to $1.1799 after hitting its highest in more than three weeks at 1.181.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.03% versus the greenback at 109.89 per dollar. 
Overall trade in Europe was subdued because of a public holiday in Britain. Moya noted the holiday tends to disrupt normal currency flows. 
For the month the dollar index has gained about 0.7%.

26,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of this year’s best-performing emerging-market currencies are falling out of favor as traders trim back bets on further interest-rate hikes.
The Brazilian real and the Russian ruble, which outpaced most of their peers in the first half amid policy tightening, have now gone into reverse. The real has slumped about 4.5% since the end of June, more than any other major currency tracked by Bloomberg.  
The tightening cycle was in full force in emerging markets long before the Federal Reserve started laying out a timeline for scaling back its bond-buying program, which Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday could begin as soon as this year. The early hikes in Russia and Brazil have helped stem flows from emerging markets, though policy makers are still balancing the need to battle inflation with the desire to support economies battered by Covid-19. 
Poland and Colombia may be next to lift rates. That offers some upside potential for lagging currencies such as the Polish zloty, protecting their relative yield advantage against accelerating prices and the prospect of rising U.S. rates.
“Early hikers, where the speed of tightening has been in line with or in some cases faster than historical hiking cycles, are likely to slow the pace of hikes or pause in the months ahead,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by London-based Kamakshya Trivedi wrote in a note this month. “The second half of the emerging-market hiking cycle is likely to be even broader, with more central banks commencing some form of normalization.”
Evolving Environment
Brazil’s central bank has already increased its key rate by 325 basis points this year, more than most peers, and forward-market bets are pricing in slowing rate hikes after September’s meeting. In Russia, traders predict the central bank will increase its benchmark by about 50 basis points over the next three months, down from more than 130 points in early July. 
This evolving rate environment presents a crucial opportunity for traders to take advantage of variations in the next phase of the emerging-market tightening cycle, according to Goldman Sachs.
South Korea became the first major Asian country to raise interest rates this year Thursday, with more hikes in the pipeline as the focus pivoted from propping up the economy to curbing a debt-driven asset bubble. 
The won rose before relinquishing its gains after Korea’s central bank governor remained ambiguous on the timing of the next move. The currency should strengthen on a hawkish “Bank of Korea, economic resilience and a technically oversold won,” said Mitul Kotecha, chief emerging markets Asia & Europe strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.
“Markets will likely continue to chase yield, meaning those countries, with relatively aggressive monetary stances and higher real yields will benefit most,” he said.
Balancing Act 
It’s a delicate balancing act for policy makers, who have to battle rising prices without stifling growth as the threat of Covid-19 variants continues to loom over the global economy. Poland for one has signaled it wants to keep monetary policy loose until the economic rebound is well under way despite surging inflation.
Still, the eastern European country may be the next in line after the economy expanded at its fastest-ever annual pace in the second quarter, with  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) predicting hikes in October and November. The zloty this year has underperformed the currencies of Hungary and the Czech Republic, which have embarked on aggressive monetary-tightening campaigns to keep inflation under control. 
Listen: EM Weekly Podcast: Powell Taper Talk; China Manufacturing Data
Poland stands out as an emerging market that has been “behind the curve when it comes to raising rates,” said Oliver Harvey, a London-based strategist at Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn). Its dovish policy stance has weighed on the currency, which the bank says is about 10% undervalued based on its models. If the central bank were to turn more hawkish later this year, the zloty could be a catch-up trade, he said. 
Fresh hawkish sentiment is also emerging in Colombia, where the central bank has signaled it may soon join the regional trend for higher interest rates as inflation quickens. Policy makers see the economy expanding at 7.5% this year. Economists see policy makers increasing the key rate by 75 basis points this year, from a record low of 1.75%.
“We expect policy makers in Asia and Eastern Europe to tighten very gradually, with timing of hikes dependent on decisions by the Fed” and European Central Bank, said Lewis Jones, an emerging-market debt portfolio manager at William Blair Investment Management LLC in New York. “Central Banks in Latin America and among the higher-yielding countries elsewhere are acting more aggressively to stave off medium-term inflation outlook concerns, while the overall hiking cycle is likely to be relatively short.”
In the coming week, investors will also watch rate decisions from Chile and Zambia.

Investing.com -- The dollar is starting the week little changed, with no real correction after lurching downward on Friday in response to the speech of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
The greenback had lost around half a percent against its major trading partners on Friday after Powell hinted that the central bank will start to withdraw its monetary stimulus this year, but stressed that that didn’t mean an accelerated timetable for raising interest rates.
By 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six advanced economy currencies, was effectively unchanged from late Friday at 92.707. 
""We do not expect a tapering announcement in September but do expect it November, with the likelihood that the actual reduction in the pace of purchases begins in December,"" said John Velis, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, in a note to clients. 
The closest Powell came to announcing any reduction in the Fed's asset purchases, which have been running at $120 billion since spring 2020, was to say that ""if the economy evolves broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”
That was a much softer line than the one urged by a handful of regional Federal Reserve Presidents during the week, who had argued for tapering to start ""sooner rather than later."" 
The apparent reason for Powell's caution was evident in Friday's data for personal spending in July, in which spending on goods fell more than expected and spending on services rose less than expected as a result of the growing impact of the latest Covid-19 wave on consumer activity. Economists across Wall Street - not least those at Goldman Sachs - have been revising down their forecasts for third-quarter growth on the back of similar numbers since the start of the month.
The euro was one of the biggest gainers in early trade, hitting a three-week high of $1.1810 before retreating somewhat. The euro was supported by the strong performance of Olaf Scholz in Sunday's televised debate between the major German parties' leaders. The debate was the first to be held ahead of next month's elections, and appears to have cemented the opinion poll lead of Scholz's center-left SPD. As such, Germany is on course to push the center-right Christian Democratic Union out of power for the first time in 16 years. For markets, the most direct consequence of that is likely to be the abandonment of a fiscal policy that has kept government borrowing to a minimum since the Great Financial Crisis. 
Spain's inflation rate rose to 3.3%, according to figure just released, while German preliminary inflation data are due later in the day. Neither number is likely to shake the European Central Bank out of its taper torpor. Bank of France Governor Phlippe Villeroy de Galhau dominated early headlines with comments that there was no risk of overheating, or a sustained overshoot in inflation in the euro zone. 
Sterling was becalmed by the closure of London's forex market for the summer bank holiday, something likely to depress trading volumes around the continent. By 3 AM ET, it was up less than 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3769.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia in the wake of U.S. Federal Reserve Jerome Powell's dovish speech on bond tapering at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 92.640 by 12:01 AM ET (4:01 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.06% to 109.76.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.10 % to 0.7303 while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.6999.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.4678, with Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) due on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3769.
Powell said the Fed is likely to start paring back stimulus measures before the end of 2021 without specifying the timeline.
""It could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year,"" Powell said in a speech. However, he also suggested it is in no hurry to raise interest rates. “The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test,” he added.
""Powell was vague on the timing of tapering, and his reiteration that it is separate from a decision to raise rates was read to imply that there'd be a gap,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.
""That has, in turn, seen the market take a Goldilocks view of the Fed - stimulus will be reduced, but not so quickly as to snuff out the recovery.""Investors are awaiting the U.S. nonfarm payroll due on Friday to get clues on when the asset tapering will start.
""Together with COVID-19 trends, Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls will make or break the case for announcing tapering at the (Fed's) September meeting,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Kim Mundy told Reuters.
""We consider another 800,000 jobs should be enough to announce tapering. We expect the dollar to regain some lost ground this week while market participants are still worried COVID-19 will slow the world economy,"" Mundy said."
29,"<span>Aug 29, 2021 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- From Covid risks to talk of a reduction in U.S. stimulus, there’s been no shortage of bad news for Asian currencies. An upcoming report on China’s manufacturing sector may add to the pressure.
Traders are looking to Chinese factory data for clues on the global outlook after the world’s second-largest economy slowed more sharply than expected in July. The nation’s key manufacturing gauge has fallen since April and a slide into contractionary territory could spur a rise in risk-off sentiment and hurt Asian currencies. 
Regional exchange rates have struggled to navigate the fallout from the pandemic, with the Thai baht falling over 8% to lag all its Asian peers this year. Taiwan’s dollar and the Chinese yuan have proven to be more resilient, but even they could find it hard to extend gains as the outlook dims, according to TD Securities.
“Markets are already starting to price in weaker global growth prospects in the months ahead, with peak growth having already passed,” said Mitul Kotecha, chief EM Asia and Europe strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. “China is contributing to this as seen in its recent data releases and this is likely to be echoed in the release of China’s August PMI data.” 
Economists predict this week’s report will show that China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dropped to 50.1 in August, the lowest since February 2020. A reading above the 50-mark signals an expansion in output.
Chinese exports, retail sales and industrial production growth all missed economists’ estimates in July as a new wave of virus infections hurt consumption and global growth. The central bank has since pledged to stabilize the supply of credit and boost the amount of money supporting smaller firms and the real economy.
“For Asia, the most growth-sensitive currencies are the more open trade economies such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China,” said TD Securities’ Kotecha. “These have outperformed through the Covid crisis, but weaker growth prospects and slowing trade could limit gains in these currencies.”
The pandemic has hurt Southeast Asian currencies particularly hard, with the baht tumbling to a a three-year low in August. The Malaysian ringgit dropped to the the weakest in more than a year while the Philippine peso slid to a 15-month trough.
It may be worthwhile noting that even if China’s manufacturing print surprises on the upside, the bout of relief for Asian currencies could be brief. Attention will quickly turn to U.S. non-farm payrolls data due Sept. 3, with the dollar expected to resume its advance if a strong report delivers another boost to Treasury yields.
Here are the key Asian economic data due this week:

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slid on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated in a highly anticipated speech that the U.S. central bank could start tapering its massive support to the economy could start by year's end, which was not as fast as many in the market had assumed.
Powell said there had been clear progress toward maximum employment and he believed that if the U.S. economy improved as anticipated, ""it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.""
But Powell told the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium the timing and pace of tapering should not be construed as a signal for when interest rates will begin to rise. The speech showed Powell has not adopted the hawkish stance of some Fed officials, said Gregory Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets. 
""It's pretty clear that if you were worried about the timeline, that we announce in September that we're going to taper starting Oct. 1, that's not there in this speech,"" Anderson said.
""It's not as bad as feared based on the most extreme of the hawks,"" he added. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.39% to 92.6760. 
The euro rose 0.37% to $1.1794, while the yen fell 0.24% at $109.8200.
After minutes of the Fed's policy-setting meeting in July were released last week, the dollar advanced because most market participants anticipated tapering to begin this year. 
Powell was clear to detach tapering from ""the rate liftoff,"" or raising interest rates, said David Petrosinelli, senior trader at Insperex in New York. ""He was very clear to delineate that.""
The dollar fell as market participants sharply lowered expectations for the Fed’s long-term tightening trajectory, said Karl Schamotta, director Of global product and market strategy at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
The dollar began to retreat about 15 minutes before Powell spoke, after James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, reiterated his hawkish view that tapering should begin soon and end by next year's first quarter. [nS0N2O301G}
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell 3.4 basis points to trade at 1.3104%. On Thursday yields jumped to 1.375%, the highest since Aug. 12. 
The New Zealand dollar dipped slightly after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that a lockdown against COVID-19 in Auckland is likely to remain in place for another two weeks.
The Swedish crown was flat at 8.7070 after mixed economic data.
The Canadian dollar rose 0.56% to 1.2612 versus the U.S. dollar. Brent futures, the international benchmark for crude, rose $1.63 to settle at $72.70 a barrel and gained 11.5% for the week.
Marc Chandler, managing director at BK Asset Management, said the Canadian currency generally takes its cues from oil, risk with the S&P 500 as a proxy and interest rate differentials. 
""The Canadian dollar's strength today is a reflection not so much of Canada, but what's happening in the U.S. and the market takeaway from Powell's speech,"" Chandler said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, but volumes are limited as traders eagerly await a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that will likely point to future central bank policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.998, after bouncing from Thursday’s one-week low of 92.807.
EUR/USD edged 0.1% higher to 1.1763, just off the previous day's high of 1.1779, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 110.00, GBP/USD edged higher to 1.3703, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7253.
Powell’s speech is the highlight of the annual Jackson Hole symposium, a gathering of central bankers that is being held virtually this year. He is widely expected to provide strong guidance over when the Fed will begin paring back in its massive bond-buying program. This would mark the beginning of the end for the central bank’s emergency measures put in place to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard started the discussion on Thursday, stating that the central bank should begin curbing its monthly stimulus efforts soon and the members are ""coalescing"" around a plan to begin cutting its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases. Two other regional Fed presidents, Esther George and Robert Kaplan, expressed similiar statements but none of the three has a vote in the Federal Open Markets Committee this year.
Powell himself has tended to be on the dovish side of the debate in the recent past, and traders are wary that this stance will continue in his speech at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
“The FX reaction to Powell’s remarks will likely depend on his tone on: a) the U.S. economic growth in light of the Delta-variant spread; b) the timing and length of tapering; c) any guidance on when the hiking cycle will start,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Still, losses are limited with the situation in Afghanistan deteriorating following suicide bomb explosions outside the Kabul airport late Thursday killed numerous civilians and at least 13 U.S. soldiers.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.6952 despite Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announcing the lockdown in Auckland, the country's biggest city, is likely to remain in place for further two weeks.
USD/CNY edged higher to 6.4824 after the People’s Bank of China’s central bank said it will provide financial support for rural development with monetary policy tools including the reserve requirement ratio for banks. The yuan hit its highest level in trade-weighted terms in three years earlier this week.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, with investors digesting hawkish comments from some U.S. Federal Reserve officials ahead of Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 93.037 by 10:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 109.98.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.10% to 0.7241, with data released earlier in the day showing that retails sales contracted 2.7% month-on-month in July. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.6944.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.4853 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3695.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he expects the central bank to start hiking interest rates in 2022. Kansas City Fed President Esther George and St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard also made separate hawkish comments, with Bullard repeating his call for the Fed to begin asset trimming soon.
However, some investors expected Powell to adopt a more dovish tone in his speech.
""While Powell is likely to... lay the groundwork for an eventual taper, we expect him to err on the side of caution and patience this week given that the macroeconomic landscape has deteriorated since the July policy gathering,"" Fiera Capital portfolio manager Candice Bangsund told Reuters.
There is a rough consensus among investors that Powell could announce asset tapering in the fourth quarter of 2021, and will give a hint at the Fed’s policy meeting before the actual announcement.
""For Powell, there is no merit in specifying the exact timing for asset tapering in today's speech. If he doesn't drop a clear hint, that will be mildly positive for stocks,"" Kyosuke Suzuki, president of Financial AlgoTech Company at Ryobi Systems, told Reuters.
Risk-sensitive currencies will likely gain while the yen is likely to weaken in that case, he added.
A suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan's Kabul airport for which Islamic State has claimed responsibility did gave the safe-haven U.S currency a boost."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar jumped from one-week lows on Thursday after two regional Federal Reserve presidents suggested a faster pace of reducing the U.S. central bank's asset purchases, comments that pushed the greenback toward a key resistance level.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major trading currencies, traded a bit higher just before the remarks by James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, who is considered a hawk on policy.
Bullard said in comments to CNBC that he was skeptical that inflation would moderate and for that reason the Fed needed to start tapering its bond-purchasing program. 
""We have to get going on taper, get the taper finished by the end of the first quarter of next year. Then we can evaluate inflation, what the situation is,"" Bullard said. 
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the strength of the U.S. economy still puts the Fed on track to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases in October or soon after.
The dollar index jumped above 93, a key resistance level, to trade 0.27% higher at 93.0361. On Wednesday, the index had dropped to 92.801 for the first time since Aug. 17. 
The euro fell 0.18% to $1.175, while the dollar gained 0.50% to 0.9181 against the Swiss franc. 
Two weeks ago the dollar index rose above 93 and has been testing that level since then as a support level, said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC. 
The market will likely discount what Bullard said, in part because he is a non-voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee, but ""his voice is heard in the room and you have to assume therefore it does have some impact,"" Ricchiuto said. 
POWELL EYED
Bullard and Kaplan's comments came as the Fed's annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium opened, with the spotlight on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday. 
Analysts doubt Powell will offer new hints about when the Fed may start to cut its asset purchases.
Powell will reiterate Kaplan's message last week of being flexible and will have done a good job if the markets don't move when he speaks, said Lee Ferridge, North American head of multi-asset strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. 
""He doesn't want the markets to panic that they're going to taper into a slowing economy,"" Ferridge said. ""He’s going to walk this line of leaving the taper on the table but putting out the idea of flexibility as well."" 
Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields were last at 1.3424%, after reaching 1.375% following Bullard's comments, the highest since Aug. 12. 
The yen slid 0.04% to 110.04. Among commodity currencies, the dollar rose 0.76% to 1.2682 versus the Canadian dollar  and 0.51% to 0.7289 versus the Australian dollarD.
Currency market swings have eased ahead of Powell's speech, with implied euro-dollar volatility at a one-week low.
Meanwhile, more central banks worldwide are exiting or contemplating exiting from ultra-easy accommodative policies. South Korea's central bank on Thursday raised interest rates for the first time in three years.
The won gave up initial gains, however, to fall 0.6% after the hike, which had been well-flagged. (Graphic: Bank of Korea's policy interest rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/SOUTHKOREA-ECONOMY/RATES/jnpweeloopw/chart.png) 
Declining oil prices weighed on the Canadian dollar. Brent crude futures settled down $1.18, or 1.63%, at $71.07 a barrel. 

The looney has not broken through the 1.25 level with the U.S. dollar because of growth expections, uncertainty over the upcoming election in Canada and a recent decline in commodity prices, State Street Global Markets' Ferridge said. 
""It’s caught up in the commodity sell-off we’ve seen of late, the narrative of declining growth expectations - U.S. growth expectations have come down - and the Bank of Canada not being as hawkish,"" he said.

Investing.com – The dollar climbed Thursday, as Fed's Jackson Hole symposium draws closer, but the carrot of Fed bond tapering isn't likely to save the greenback as the well of the good news for the reserve currency is running dry.  
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.25 % to 93.06.
""After its good performance in recent months, the U.S. dollar is likely to start edging down against several currencies in the near future,"" Desjardins said in a note.
The somber outlook on the dollar comes on the eve of the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium.
The symposium has traditionally served as platform for the Fed to tee up monetary policy announcements, but there is a sense of the uncertainty on how much Powell is likely to shed on monetary policy.
Some suggest that with the monthly jobs report and the Fed's September meeting on the horizon, Powell will opt for caution. Others suggest the Fed chief could use the annual symposium to finetune the central bank's signaling ahead of the announcement later this month.
""It likely the Fed will announce that it will begin the bond tapering process at the September monetary policy meeting,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
The backdrop of tighter monetary policy isn't likely to spur a meaningful move higher in the greenback, however, as most of the good news appears to be priced already,"" Desjardins added.
Others appear to be signing from the same hymn sheet, reigning in their bets on a rally in yields, often an ally to the greenback.
""We are reducing our 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury yield year-end targets for 2021 and 2022,"" Wells Fargo said.
But even as the most of the good news appears to have been priced in for dollar upside, the path of the pandemic can quickly turn fortunes around for the greenback. In the event of an unfortunate return of pandemic mania, traders are likely to run into the safe arms of the king dollar.
""This time, the rise seems to be primarily based on concerns over the new COVID‑19 variants, the decline in efficacy of the vaccines and the emergence of a fourth wave in several countries,"" Desjardins added. ""In a context of elevated uncertainty, investors tend to favor safe-haven currencies like the U.S. dollar. """

(Reuters) - Investors trimmed bearish bets on most Asian currencies as the dollar weakened on hopes of a temporary pushback in the Federal Reserve's tapering timeline, while sentiment on the Indian rupee turned marginally bullish, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Investors unwound their bearish bets on the Indian rupee to be slightly bullish for the first time since mid-June, with the currency appreciating 0.2% in August after vaccination programs were ramped up and the central bank continued its monetary policy support.
Economic growth in India is expected to touch a record high in the June-quarter on the back of very weak base last year and a rebound in consumer spending, despite the drag from the deadly second virus wave, another Reuters poll showed. 
Elsewhere, short bets were largely trimmed on the Malaysian ringgit, the Philippine peso, and the Thai baht, the poll of 10 respondents on Asian currencies showed.
The U.S. dollar has eased 0.4% over the last two weeks and has slipped from a 9-month high as positive economic data and easing worries about the impact of the Delta variant has kept the Fed away from dialling back its monetary stimulus. [USD/]
Bearish bets on the Malaysian ringgit were at their lowest since mid-July, as the currency appreciated over 1% in the past two weeks after a new Prime Minister took an oath. It ended a brief period of political uncertainty that had rattled the markets.
Short bets on the baht were at their lowest since July, even as the currency weakened more than 9% and is the worst-performing unit in the region so far this year.
However, worries surrounding rising infections in the region have increased, with South Korea, India, and Thailand experiencing pressures on their vaccinations, and China witnessing new outbreaks recently.
Meanwhile, investors slightly raised their short bets on the Chinese yuan in the last two weeks as the latest virus outbreak continues to pressure economic activity.
South Korean won's bearish bets ticked higher as the currency hit its lowest since September 2020 earlier this month, pressured by offloading of stocks by foreign investors and surging cases.
On the Taiwanese dollar, investors turned bearish once again after being marginally bullish two weeks ago.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally higher in early European trade Thursday, but remained near a one-week low amid healthy risk appetite ahead of the Federal Reserve’s key Jackson Hole symposium.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.930, after falling to 92.801 overnight for the first time since mid-August.
EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.1761, after touching a one-week high of 1.1775 the previous day, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 110.05, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3744, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.3% to 0.7255.
Risk appetite has been boosted this week by the decision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant full approval to the Covid vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (DE:22UAy), with the market assuming that the full approval of other vaccines will follow shortly and thus the peak of the Covid wave is near.
This move prompted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, to say earlier this week that Covid-19 could be under control by early next year.
Adding to the optimism was the news Wednesday that new orders for U.S durable goods, excluding transportation equipment, grew by 0.7% in July, a better than expected result.
There’s more important data on tap later Thursday, including the weekly jobless claims and another reading of the second quarter GDP figure, but the focus remains on Friday’s speech by Fed chair Jerome Powell at a virtual gathering of U.S. central bankers, usually held at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
“Powell’s speech is set to be a “litmus test” for risk assets,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Essentially, it will tell us how sustainable the rebound in risk sentiment is and to what extent it has been driven by expectations of a more cautious tone by Powell tomorrow (i.e. hints that tapering will be delayed) due to the Delta-variant spread.”
Elsewhere, USD/KRW rose 0.6% to 1,170.58 after the Bank of Korea raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%, meaning South Korea became the first major Asian economy to lift record-low borrowing costs since the start of the pandemic."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia but remained near a one-week low as concerns over COVID-19's impact on the global economic recovery receded. Investors also await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole symposium for clues on an asset tapering timeline.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 92.903 by 11 PM ET (3 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was steady at 110.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7264 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 0.6960.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.08% to 6.4809 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3755.
The FDA’s full approval of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine earlier in the week, which could boost U.S. vaccination rates, improved investor sentiment.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc could be next to receive full approval, which could happen within weeks.
The Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium will open later in the day, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell due to speak on Friday. Signals that the Fed will begin asset tapering within 2021 had boosted the U.S. currency to a nine-and-a-half-month high of 93.734 during the previous week, but it remains to be seen whether the central bank will provide a timeline for asset tapering and interest rate hikes.
In Asia Pacific, South Korea became the first major Asian economy to hike interest rates since COVID-19 began. The Bank of Korea interest rate for August, handed down earlier in the day, is 0.75%, up by 25 basis points from the previous 0.5% and within expectations.
Some investors remain optimistic about the dollar as Fed asset tapering also moves towards becoming a reality, even if it is delayed by COIVD-19 uncertainties.
""While this would be a dollar negative factor on the one hand, COVID-19 Delta worries may simultaneously increase the safe-haven appeal for the dollar,"" Rabobank strategist Jane Foley said in a note.
""On balance, while pullbacks are likely to be par for the course, we see scope for euro/dollar to head towards $1.16 on a six-month view,” the note added. The dollar was $1.1765 against the euro on Thursday, little changed after falling to a one-week low of $1.1775 the day before.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -The dollar was little changed on Wednesday as oil prices slowed after a big two-day advance, U.S. Treasury yields moved higher and investors awaited clues on the tapering of economic support by the Federal Reserve at this week's Jackson Hole symposium.
Risk appetite in global markets improved after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this week fully approved the COVID-19 vaccine made by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, in a move that could accelerate U.S. inoculations.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said on Tuesday the United States could get COVID-19 under control by early next year.
But the focus has turned to Jackson Hole and what Fed Chair Jerome Powell may say about tapering the U.S. central bank's stimulative bond-buying program when he speaks on Friday. 
Markets expect Powell to sound dovish and echo concerns last week by Robert Kaplan, the Dallas Fed president, who said he might reconsider the start to tapering due to the Delta variant of the coronavirus, said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
""The risk is that Powell does not really say anything too different but by virtue of not backing up Kaplan, comes across as more hawkish,"" Osborne said.
The dollar picked up support as Treasury yields nudged higher, he said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury later rose 5.7 basis points to yield 1.3474%. Algorithmic traders selling Treasuries after the 10-year yields broke above their daily 200-day moving average may have exacerbated the gains.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major trading currencies, was higher in early trading, then eased 0.06% to 92.8550. 
The euro gained 0.09% at $1.1766, while the yen fell 0.32% at $110.025. 
The greenback had rallied until the start of this week, with the dollar index hitting a 9-1/2-month high of 93.734 on Friday, on fears over the Delta variant's economic impact and as the Fed signaled its tapering of monetary stimulus was likely this year.
Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier Group, said there's been skittishness over growth and sector rotations, which has boosted the dollar because of its safe-haven status.
""In the short term, we're still going to be trading in ranges, with upside bias,"" Gkionakis said.
Dollar underperformance after Jackson Hole could be a buying opportunity ahead of the release of U.S. data next week, including the non-farm payrolls report for August, said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY).
""Potential positive surprises from the NFP in particular could put QE (quantitative easing) taper back among the main FX market drivers and support the USD,"" Marinov said.
Sterling rose 0.22% to $1.3758 while Australia's dollar recouped early losses to trade up 0.25% to $0.7276. 
The dollar gained 0.08% to 1.2599 against the Canadian dollar. Earlier the dollar was stronger as commodity prices, and especially crude oil, had moderated. But oil later surged. 
Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose $1.20, or 1.7%, to $72.25 a barrel after gaining 9% on Monday and Tuesday from last week's close. 
The Canadian currency still looks fundamentally undervalued but the case for a significant rebound after recent volatility has weakened, Osborne said. The narrowing of U.S.-Canadian spreads will make it harder for the Canadian dollar to strengthen materially for now, he said.
""Generally, we expect the U.S. dollar to grind higher in the next few weeks and months,"" he said.

Investing.com – The dollar remained flat Wednesday in subdued trade amid expectations that the annual Jackson Hole symposium later this week is unlikely to offer up the sort of monetary policy surprise that will trigger wild moves.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.08% to 92.83.
Friday's Jackson Hole event has been earmarked as the key risk event for markets on expectations that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will lay the ground for a bond tapering announcement later this year.
But as the symposium draws closer, the dollar has been on the back foot and trading action has been subdued, suggesting that currency markets aren't anticipating meaningful clues on the Fed's plan to taper its bond purchases.
""FX volatility remains near the lows as investors remain unconvinced that Jackson Hole will light a fire under markets,"" ING said in a note. ""The gains earlier this week of riskier currencies against the dollar seem to be fizzling out, but there have been good local,"" it added.
Still, investors are likely to parse Powell's remarks very carefully to gauge whether rising Covid-19 cases in the U.S. are on the Fed's radar, potentially providing the central bank with further room to maintain the status quo on monetary policy for a while longer.
""The market will examine Powell’s speech very carefully for the Fed’s evaluation of risks in connection with the spread of the delta variant,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
The latest positioning data on the dollar added credence to expectations that the Jackson Hole event is unlikely to provide meaningful insight into the Fed's thinking on monetary policy.
The value of the net long dollar position declined to $1.06 billion in the week ended Aug. 17, from $3.08 billion in the previous week, according to Reuters calculations and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday."

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, but remained near a one-week low as confidence rises that the new surge in Covid-19 cases will have a limited impact on the global recovery.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.993, after falling as low as 92.804 on Tuesday for the first time since Aug. 17.
EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.1743, after climbing a one-week high of 1.1765 overnight, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 109.70, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3720, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7243, after climbing to 0.7271 on Tuesday, also a one-week high.
The dollar has been struggling over the last couple of days with optimism rising over the ability of the U.S. to cope with the recent surge in Covid-19 cases after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech.
Additionally, the Meishan terminal at China’s second-busiest port reopened Wednesday following a two-week Covid-induced shutdown, increasing confidence that the world’s second largest economy has managed to control its coronavirus outbreak.
The main focus this week, though, has been the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole Symposium, and with the Covid outbreak clouding the outlook, expectations have dropped that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will indicate a timeline for the tapering of the central bank’s massive bond-buying program.
“This week the pendulum has swung pro-risk, but we suspect investors will be reluctant to chase the dollar a lot lower before Jerome Powell's speech this Friday,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/HUF rose 0.2% to 296.53 and EUR/HUF climbed 0.1% to 348.14, with the Hungarian forint handed back some of Tuesday’s gains after the country’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 30 basis points to 1.5%, the third such hike in as many months.
Hungarian policy makers have indicated they’ll keep up the tightening cycle until inflation is on track to hit the central bank’s 3% target over the monetary horizon.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, trading near a one-week low. Investors are turning away from the safe-haven asset as COVID-19 concerns that clouded the economic recovery outlook eased.
The U.S. Dollar Index tracking the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.16% to 93.045 by 11:12 PM ET (3:12 AM GMT). It fell to 92.804 on Tuesday, the first time it has done so since Aug. 17.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.17% to 109.81.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.7243 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.6940.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12% to 6.4787 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3717.
The U.S. FDA’s full approval of the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine earlier in the week has raised hopes that inoculations rates will rise and has increased the global risk appetite. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical advisor to the President, even predicted that the U.S. could have COVID-19 under control by early 2022 if vaccination rates rise.
The U.S. currency has rallied in recent weeks, even hitting a nine-and-a-half month high of 93.734 during the previous week. Concerns about the global spread of COVID-19, and the Delta variant particularly, alongside signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve could start asset tapering later in 2021, contributed to this rally.
However, some investors are betting that the continuing spread of COVID-19 will diminish the chances that the Fed will announce a timeline for both asset tapering and interest rate hikes at its’ annual Jackon Hole symposium, taking place from Aug. 26 to 28.
""The tide of optimism seems to have set in,"" lifting commodity currencies at the dollar's expense, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analyst Tapas Strickland said in a note.
Jackson Hole ""looms as the next key test,"" but ""given the uncertainty it is likely the Fed needs to see another one or two stellar payroll prints, though an asset taper announcement in 2021 is still likely,"" the note added."

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -The dollar eased further on Tuesday as risk-related currencies benefited from rising commodity prices and markets set aside concerns about the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant to gauge data that showed a U.S. economy in strong recovery mode.
Risk appetite in global markets strengthened after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech in a move that could accelerate U.S. inoculations.
A bounce in China's technology sector also contributed to risk-on sentiment that helped boost the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.
""The euro, Canada and Aussie currencies made new lows for the year last week, and so the dollar is consolidating and its upside momentum has stalled,"" said Marc Chandler, a managing director at Bannockburn Global Forex.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.095% to 92.899.
The euro was up 0.07% at $1.1751, while the yen traded down 0.01% at $109.6700. 
Rising COVID-19 infections caused by the highly contagious Delta variant have fueled concerns about the recovery from the pandemic. But markets have largely overlooked that this week, with analysts citing thin liquidity as a factor driving apparent swings in risk appetite.
Market attention is focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference on Friday, when some investors expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell to hint at a possible timeline for tapering the U.S. central bank's bond-buying monetary stimulus.
""We think investors will want to wait to hear on this subject from Jerome Powell on Friday before pushing ahead with another major round of risk-buying, dollar-selling,"" ING strategists wrote in a note to clients.
COVID-19 case counts are also being watched closely, particularly in China and New Zealand. Outbreaks in China appear to be coming under control while in New Zealand, where monetary policy was put on hold last week due to measures to contain the Delta variant, a lockdown remains in effect. 
The Australian dollar, viewed as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, rose 0.6% at $0.7256.
The New Zealand dollar gained 0.8% to $0.6944, trading at one-week highs, boosted by comments from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's assistant governor, who said policymakers had actively considered raising rates last week.
The RBNZ left rates on hold at a record low 0.25% but flagged a tightening before the end of the year.
The Norwegian crown rose 0.9% against the euro, with the pair changing hands at 10.3808, while the Canadian dollar was up 0.4% to 1.2594 against the U.S. dollar.
Norway's central bank has said it plans to raise its key interest rate next month as the economy shakes off the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oil prices extended Monday's rally, driven by a bullish demand outlook after the full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and Mexico suffered a large production outage.
Brent crude oil futures settled up $2.30 at $71.05 a barrel, a 3.35% gain.
The rise in oil prices has washed out some of the excessive bearishness toward the Canadian currency, Chandler said. 
The Canadian dollar hit eight-month lows last week. Of the major trading currencies, Canada's is among the most sensitive to the equity market, Chandler said.
Elsewhere, bitcoin edged back below $50,000, which was breached for the first time since May on Monday. The digital currency was down 2.7% at about $48,237.

Investing.com - The dollar stabilized in early European trade Tuesday, following its sharpest one-day fall since May, with traders repositioning ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded largely marginally higher at 93.017, after dropping about 0.5% on Monday.
EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1740, after gaining around 0.4% Monday, USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 109.88, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3734, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.4% to 0.7235, after rising over 1% during the previous session.
Helping risk sentiment was the news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (DE:22UAy), potentially accelerating inoculations as companies mandate jabs in order to return to the office.
The dollar was also hard hit Monday as traders reconsidered their positions ahead of the Federal Reserve’s important Jackson Hole Symposium. Comments made on Friday by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan suggested that the latest wave of Covid-19 could lead the Fed to push back any plans to start reducing its bond purchases. Data on Monday that showed new infections at their highest level since January, while the seven-day average for daily deaths topped 1,000 for the first time since April.  
The annual Jackson Hole meeting begins on Thursday, held online this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s keynote speech on Friday had been widely expected to detail the start of the central bank’s tapering of its massive bond-buying program. 
“Ahead of that - and the potential clarity on the timing of Fed tapering - we doubt that investors will want to heavily add to positions in risky assets and doubt that the dollar needs to sell off too much,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/HUF rose 0.1% to 297.90 and EUR/HUF climbed 0.1% to 349.86 ahead of the latest rate-setting meeting of Hungary’s central bank. The policymakers are widely expected to raise interest rates by 30 basis points to 1.5%, the third such hike in as many months, as they try to stem inflation levels near a nine-year high. Poland's central bank meeting is expected to keep its key rates unchanged, by contrast.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia after its sharpest one-day fall since May 2021. However, investors kept moves small ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve symposium that could herald the beginning of asset tapering and interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 93.062 by 10:33 PM ET (2:33 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.04% to 109.72.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.7210 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.6892.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.4832 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3716.
""A positive risk backdrop has pushed flows out of the dollar,"" with positive analyst commentary around oil and cyclical stocks also boosting the broad mood, Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
""But I wouldn't be going short dollars just because of this... it could easily flip up going into Jackson Hole,"" he added, referencing the Fed symposium that will take place from Aug. 26 to 28.
Other investors are doubtful whether the Fed will provide any hints on when it will begin asset tapering during the symposium, which will put pressure on the greenback as it has gained alongside tapering expectations.
""The weight of positioning and expectations leaves the dollar exposed in the event Jackson Hole does not produce a clear and imminent Fed taper signal. But any setback likely proves short-lived if key Fed officials stress confidence that 'substantial further progress' is on the horizon and that a slowing of asset purchases could commence in coming months,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
In Asia Pacific, New Zealand remains in lockdown until Friday. However, the New Zealand dollar got a small lift from rising bets that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hike interest rates in October.
""On balance, the market seems to be slanting toward the view that New Zealand will beat Delta, and if that is the case, that should put interest rate hikes and carry back on the table later in 2021,"" ANZ Bank analysts said in their own note.
""The market has seen the New Zealand dollar bounce off $0.68 when all the chips were down, and that'll likely be a solid base of support for now,” the note added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slid on Monday, after posting its biggest weekly rise in more than two months last week, as markets embraced a risk-on mood with weak data suggesting the Federal Reserve is unlikely to quickly remove its accommodative monetary stance.
U.S. business activity growth slowed for a third straight month in August as capacity constraints, supply shortages and the rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus weakened the economic rebound, data firm IHS Markit said.
""Today is about a little risk-on rebound. You have almost every risky asset rally here,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange brokerage OANDA in New York. 
The dollar index hit a nine-month high last week, climbing nearly 5% from May lows, as investors firmed up bets the Fed will start scaling back stimulus policies spurred by the pandemic ahead of Europe and Japan.
But Robert Kaplan, president of the Dallas Fed, dented those expectations on Friday when the well-known hawk said he might reconsider the need for an early start to tapering if the virus harms the economy.
Markets have concluded there's not going to be a ""taper tantrum"" like in 2013, Moya said. Fears the Fed would tighten monetary policy caused interest rates to spike at the time.
""Despite the inevitable announcement of tapering at some point this year, it's going to be very slow and it's not going to signal any imminent rate hikes at the end of next year,"" he said.
Riskier currencies, including the Norwegian crown and Aussie and Canadian dollars were among the major beneficiaries of a weaker dollar. All three currencies gained more than 1% against the U.S. currency.
The dollar index, which measures its performance against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.57% to 92.95.
The euro was up 0.44% at $1.175, while the yen traded down 0.11% at $109.680. 
Some investors, such as Stephen Jen who runs hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital, remain long-term dollar bulls.
""Maybe I was too early in making this call, but a muscular U.S. economy that is centred on technology and one that embraces creative destruction will likely enjoy elevated trend growth in the years ahead,"" Jen said.
Elsewhere, the euro popped to a three-day high after data showed euro zone business grew strongly this month, though the pace of expansion slowed on fears new coronavirus strains may bring renewed restrictions.
The Australian dollar was among the major gainers after Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians must start to learn to live with COVID-19 when higher vaccination targets are reached.
The New Zealand dollar edged 0.7% higher to $0.6874, still near Friday's 9 1/2-month low of $0.6807, with the nation under lockdown to contain a Delta outbreak.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin topped $50,000 for the first time since mid-May, and last traded 1.16% higher at $49,875.87.

Canada's commodities-heavy stock index inched toward record highs after oil prices rebounded from a seven-day losing streak. Brent, the international crude benchmark, jumped 5.5% to $68.76 a barrel in the biggest single-day gain since late March.
The Canadian dollar likely will gravitate back to $1.25 to the U.S. dollar and settle in that range, Moya said. (Graphic: FX positions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopannqyjva/FX%20positions.JPG)

46,"<span>Aug 23, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. dollar is getting a boost from an unusual place -- China.
Increasing coronavirus infections, slower growth and rising risk of default in the world’s second-largest economy are combining to help fuel a stronger dollar, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists. But at the same time, these factors are combining to keep the yuan in a tight trading range, which caps how high the greenback can go.
“As a large component of the Fed’s broad USD index, and an influential global currency, a relatively stable CNY limits how far the broad USD index can rally,” strategists led by Matthew Hornbach wrote in a note to clients Friday. 
A sharp jump in the dollar-yuan cross would lift the broad dollar index, as the renminbi has a heavy weighting in it, and there would be a spillover effect from other developing-world currencies, they wrote.
The renminbi is the second-best performing emerging-market currency against the dollar this year, gaining 0.7%. While China’s domestic woes suggest the country risk is “relatively high,” the yuan is set to continue outperforming most peers in a strong-dollar environment, according to the Morgan Stanley strategists.
“China’s balance of payment positions remains extremely strong, and at the same time, the authorities may well prefer to keep the CNY relatively stable to anchor sentiment,” they wrote. “This is why China’s FX policy is actually preventing a more meaningful rally in the USD.” 
Though Morgan Stanley doesn’t expect a big move in the currency pair, if the yuan weakens sharply, it may represent the final stages of the greenback’s rally. Last week,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) warned the Chinese currency could fall as much as 2% in the coming weeks as traders weigh renewed regulatory and economic concerns. Meantime, strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) expect to see a slightly weaker yuan toward year end on the back of a firmer U.S. dollar.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower in early European trade Monday, as gains in equity markets boosted sentiment, prompting traders to take positions in riskier currencies ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 93.328, retreating from Friday’s high of 93.734, it’s strong level since Nov. 4.
EUR/USD was 0.2% higher at 1.1715, off Friday's 9 1/2-month low of 1.1664, USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 109.97, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3660, up from last week’s one-month low of 1.3602, and the risk sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.4% to 0.7158, bouncing off Friday’s 9 1/2-month low of 0.7106.
Equity markets have bounced in Asia Monday, continuing Wall Street’s stronger finish on Friday, and Europe is set to follow suit, helped by the news that China, the world's second largest economy, reported no new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases for the first time since July. 
That said, this renewed confidence still seems brittle, with the release of a raft of manufacturing surveys, both in Europe and the U.S., likely to show slowing growth on the back of the latest outbreak of Covid-19 cases, driven by the highly transmissible delta variant.
Services PMIThe equivalent data in Japan earlier Monday showed Japan's factory activity growth slowing in August, while that of the services sector shrank at the fastest pace since May last year.
Of major interest this week will be the U.S. Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole symposium, beginning on Aug. 26, which will be held online this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak.
This get-together is widely expected to indicate that the central bank will start tapering its massive bond-buying program this year, although influential FOMC member Robert Kaplan threw this into doubt on Friday by stating that he may need to adjust that view if the delta variant slows economic growth materially.
“The Federal Reserve is moving closer to tapering,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, and “this is likely to prove to be a strong USD scenario, as was also the case in 2013/2014 when the Fed tapered the QE3 programme.”
The bank now targets “levels around 1.10 in EUR/USD over the forecast horizon and expect the bulk of the move to happen sooner rather than later in conjunction with the launch of the tapering process.” 
Elsewhere, USD/SEK fell 0.2% to 8.7887 after Sunday’s resignation by Sweden’s Stefan Lofven as prime minister, leaving in November, with the likely replacement being Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson, seen as favoring fiscal prudence.
USD/ILS fell 0.1% to 3.2339, with Bank of Israel’s monetary policy committee expected to leave its key interest rate unchanged at 0.1% when it meets later Monday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia but remained near its highest level in more than nine months. Commodity currencies like the Australian dollar remained near multi-month lows over persistent concerns about how the continuing spread of COVID-19 globally could impact economic recovery.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.17% to 93.352 by 10:27 PM ET (2:27 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 109.82.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.40% to 0.7163 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.34% to 0.6848.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.15% to 6.4911 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.3647.
The continuous surge in COVID-19 will see the U.S. Federal Reserve conduct its annual Jackson Hole symposium online beginning Aug. 26.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has maintained his dovish stance to date. However, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan provided a potential clue before the symposium’s start, saying that his view of beginning asset tapering soon could be adjusted should the COVID-19 Delta variant continue to spread and impact the economic recovery.
A delay in the Fed’s asset tapering timeline might not necessarily hurt the dollar, even as bets on it happening earlier than expected had boosted the greenback so far, according to some investors.
""This can just as easily play out dollar positive as negative, from a risk sentiment/safe-haven dollar demand perspective,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of currency strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
The riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars were slowly starting to claw back some of its losses. However, ""it remains premature to call an end to this down move"" in the Australian dollar, said Attrill said.
The Australian dollar remained close to Friday's nine-and-a-half-month low of $0.71065. Around 60% of Australia's population remains under lockdown as COVID-19 infections remain at record levels. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand also continues to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
Elsewhere in Asia-Pacific, South Korea and Vietnam tightened their COVID-19 restrictions, while Japan tripled COVID-19 tests in a change of strategy to curb its COVID-19 outbreak, with a record number of daily new infections reported on Friday.
The region has been struggling to curb the spread of the Delta variant, with vaccination levels remaining below those in the U.S. and U.K."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. dollar net longs slid in the latest week, according to Reuters calculations and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position declined to $1.06 billion in the week ended Aug. 17, from $3.08 billion in the previous week. U.S. dollar positioning has been net long for five straight weeks after staying net short for 16 months.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Swiss franc, as well as the Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a broader measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the greenback posted a net long position of $796 million, down from $2.993 billion the previous week.
Despite the dip in U.S. dollar net long positioning, the greenback remained supported overall by Delta coronavirus variant concerns and expectations that the Federal Reserve could taper asset purchases under its quantitative easing program by the end of the year.
The dollar this week posted a 1% gain, the most in two months.
""Overall dollar positioning still remains relatively noncommittally small bullish,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank, wrote in a report after the CFTC data.
""The strong performance in the U.S. dollar in the Wednesday to Friday period, not covered in the data in this report, would nevertheless suggest next week's figures will see a move in the U.S. dollar position in the opposite direction,"" he added.
The largest positioning change was in the euro, with net longs rising to 57,640 contracts this week, from 33,857 previously.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin net shorts fell to 726 contracts, in the week ended Aug. 17, from net short contracts of 1,104 the previous week. This week's bitcoin shorts were the smallest since late March 2020.

Bitcoin continues to recover from the doldrums of the past few months. On Friday, it hit a three-month high of $49,163.98. From a six-month low hit in June, bitcoin has gained 67% of its value against the dollar.
Still the prospect of increased regulatory scrutiny globally has cast a somewhat dark shadow on bitcoin's outlook and the overall crypto sector.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The safe-haven U.S. dollar slipped from a 9-1/2-month high on Friday, as risk appetite improved with equities gaining and benchmark Treasury yields higher, although the near-term outlook for the greenback remained upbeat.
The U.S currency remained supported overall by concerns that the coronavirus Delta variant could derail global economic recovery just as central banks begin to reverse COVID-19 pandemic-related stimulus.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, rose to as high as 93.734 for the first time since early November, before trading 0.1% lower at 93.491. For the week, it posted a 1% gain, the most in two months.
While moves in currency markets were much more contained than on Thursday as equity markets steadied, the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were mixed, but their overall bias remained tilted to the downside.
""In the near term, we expect the dollar to appreciate a bit further,"" wrote Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, in his latest research note. ""We think that robust growth in the U.S. relative to other major economies and a gradual tightening of monetary policy will put further upward pressure on the greenback.""
Minutes of the Fed's July meeting, released on Wednesday, showed officials largely expect to reduce their monthly bond buying later this year.
The Australian dollar sank to a new 9 1/2-month low of US$0.7107, and was down 0.2% at US$0.7137. On the week, the Aussie fell 3.3%, its worst weekly performance since September 2020, as a COVID-19 lockdown on Sydney was extended by a month.
New Zealand's Kiwi dollar dipped to a new nine-month trough of US$0.6807 at one point. It last traded up 0.2% at US$0.6838. The government on Friday extended a snap COVID-19 lockdown that delayed the central bank raising interest rates this week.
The Canadian dollar dropped to an eight-month low of C$1.2948 per U.S. dollar and was last at C$1.2840, down 0.1% against its U.S. counterpart as oil prices fell further because of worries about the global economy.
Norway's crown dropped for a second day as weaker oil prices and general nervousness among investors hit the currency despite the Norwegian central bank on Thursday sticking to its plan for a September interest rate hike. The euro was last flat at 10.56 crowns. 
The euro was up 0.2% at $1.1697, not far from the 9-1/2-month low of $1.1665 reached overnight. 
Against the yen, another safe-haven currency, the dollar was flat at 109.80 yen. 
Sterling slipped to one-month lows versus the dollar, and last down 0.1% at $1.3622.
Emerging markets have also had a bruising week. A regulatory crackdown in China and the concerns over growth and COVID-19 have sent investors looking for safer assets.
The Chinese yuan sank to a new three-week low of 6.51 per dollar in the offshore market before trading flat at 6.499.

Investing.com – Analysts at Nordea have said they expect a stronger USD in the coming year as the Federal Reserve begins tightening monetary policy.
“The relative outlook between the Fed and the ECB will likely widen policy-wise over the coming year, leaving the EUR vulnerable versus the USD,” said Nordea analysts Andreas Steno Larsen and Jan von Gerich. “We expect the Fed to deliver four hikes before the end of 2023, while the ECB is on hold.”
There is no doubt that the Fed is looking to reduce stimulus, beginning with tapering asset purchases, which most expect to commence before the end of the year.
The latest minutes from the July meeting showed a majority now expects the process to slow asset purchases to begin before year end.
Nordea expect this to prove to be a strong USD scenario, as was the case in 2013/14 when the Fed tapered QE3.
“We target levels around 1.10 in EUR/USD over the forecast horizon [end-2023] and expect the bulk of the move to happen sooner rather than later,” Larsen and von Gerich said.
On rate hike timing, Nordea expects the first interest rate hike from the Fed in September 2022, followed by another three hikes in 2023.
On the European Central Bank, Nordea says December looks a likelier time to decide when the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) should end, expecting the ECB to begin to taper asset purchases only during the first half of 2022.
Larsen and von Gerich do not see any interest rate hikes from the ECB through the end of 2023.
Outside of the Fed, Nordea note that the Bank of England is probably the most hawkish G10 central bank, apart from the Norges Bank.
They expect the BoE to hike the Bank Rate during the first half of next year and then only one more hike over the forecast horizon.
“This is a decently strong story for the GBP still, which is why we increase the scope for GBP strength against the EUR a bit across the forecast horizons,” Larsen and von Gerich wrote.
Nordea says that commodity-related currencies and those which are linked to China - such as CAD, AUD, and NZD – may struggle to perform this Autumn since China is “visibly slowing” due to renewed Delta restrictions.
With expectations for a stronger USD outlook, Nordea sees EUR/USD dropping to 1.12 by the middle of next year before dropping to 1.11 by the end of 2022 and 1.10 by the end of 2023.
GBP/USD is seen at 1.33 by the middle of the next year, while EUR/GBP is expected to drop to 0.84, before falling to 0.83 by the end of 2022."

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged  in early European trade Friday, but the tone remains positive on worries the Covid-19 virus could stunt global growth just as the Federal Reserve starts to cut back its pandemic-era monetary stimulus.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded flat at 93.558, after earlier Friday rising as high as 93.612 for the first time since early November. It's on track to gain 1.1% this week, the most in two months.
EUR/USD was 0.1% higher at 1.1686, near the over 9-month low of 1.1665 reached overnight, USD/JPY was largely flat at 109.70, while GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3624, not far off a new one-month low after a sharp 2.5% fall in U.K. retail sales in July, a signal that the country’s recovery may be losing momentum. 
That said, the biggest losses against the dollar were reserved for the so-called commodity currencies. AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7127, more than a 9-month low, over 3% lower this week, as a Covid-19 lockdown in Sydney was extended by a month.
NZD/USD dropped 0.3% to 0.6824, just above a new 9-month low, and almost 3% lower this week, with the country’s central bank delaying a rate hike earlier this week because of a snap lockdown over a fresh Covid-19 outbreak, which was extended earlier Friday.
USD/CAD rose 0.3% to 1.2870, a fresh six-month high, with the sudden drop in oil prices hurting the Canadian economy.
The spreading of the highly-transmissible delta variant of the Covid-19 virus is prompting concerns that the economic recovery from the first outbreak may be stalling. But, adding to this is the idea that the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the world’s largest economy and primary growth driver, is one the verge of easing its bond-buying stimulus.
“The mood-music from the Fed is very much one of a glide-path to tapering,” said analysts at ING, in a note, and “it looks like a lot of demand for the dollar is coming from investors pulling out of growth stories overseas.”
This means the market’s focus is now very much on the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, which starts at the end of next week.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY traded 0.1% higher at 6.5015, just off the new three-week high of 6.5104 seen earlier and above the key 6.50 level, after the People’s Bank of China maintained its one-year loan prime rate at 3.85% and the five-year LPR at 4.65%. 
While this move to keep its benchmark interest rates unchanged was widely expected, there had been some looking for a cut given the slowdown in growth at the world’s second largest economy after a spate of localized Covid-19 outbreaks that have resulted in extensive lockdowns.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, remaining near a nine-and-a-half month high, as persistent COVID-19 concerns continued to give the safe-haven asset a boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 93.602 by 10:33 PM ET (10:33 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 109.73.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 0.7134 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.29% to 0.6882.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.14% to 6.5032. The People’s Bank of China released its latest loan prime rate (LPR) earlier in the day, with the one-year LPR remaining unchanged at 3.85% and the five-year LPR at 4.65%.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 1.3624.
The minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting, which hinted that asset tapering could start as soon as 2021, also continued to give the U.S. currency a boost. Investors will now look ahead to the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium, taking place from Aug. 26 to 28, for more clues to an asset tapering and interest rate hike timetable.
However, COVID-19 and its Delta strain continue their relentless upward tick, with the U.S. reporting the most deaths since February 2021.
Riskier currencies also suffered losses, with the Australian and New Zealand dollars remaining near nine-month lows.
""Risk aversion in the air has buoyed the greenback, with pro-growth currencies bearing the brunt of it,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
The Australian dollar has fallen 3% so far during the week and was on track for its worst performance since September 2020 as much of the country remains under lockdown to curb the latest COVID-19 outbreak.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar has sunk 2.9% for the week, also its lowest level since September 2020, as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand delayed hiking its interest rate as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the week. The country remains under lockdown as it deals with its own COVID-19 outbreak."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar rose to a nine-month high on Thursday, as worries about widespread coronavirus infections and Federal Reserve meeting minutes showing it was considering reducing pandemic-era stimulus this year hit global stocks and commodity-linked currencies.
The dollar index, which measures its performance against six currencies, hit 93.587, its highest since early November of last year. It was last up 0.3% at 93.359.
A decline in debt purchases by the Fed is widely considered positive for the dollar as it is expected to raise U.S. government bond yields, making it more attractive for investors to hold dollar-denominated assets.
The minutes of the Fed's July meeting showed officials largely expect to reduce their monthly bond buying later this year, but consensus on other key issues appeared elusive, including the timing of the start of the taper and whether inflation, joblessness or the coronavirus pandemic pose a bigger risk to economic recovery.
Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at UBS in New York, said market expectations ahead of the Fed minutes were probably for a taper later than 2021. ""But I don't think the view that the Fed may taper by the end of the year should come as a surprise,"" Serebriakov added.
The Fed minutes, along with sustained worries about the spread of COVID-19, pushed Wall Street stock indexes lower. European markets were down as well on Thursday, while safe-haven U.S. Treasuries gained, with benchmark 10-year yields 3 basis points lower at 1.241%. 
The dollar hardly reacted to weekly unemployment data showing that the number of people on state jobless rolls dropped in early August to levels last seen in mid-March 2020.
Serebriakov believes the dollar's rally was more about negative risk sentiment related to among others, the Delta coronavirus variant and the slowdown in China.
The euro fell as low as $1.1665 against the dollar for the first time since early November, and was last down 0.3% at $1.1676. Sterling fell 1% to $1.3642. 
With pandemic fears in focus and oil prices falling, commodity-exposed currencies fell sharply on Thursday.
The Norwegian crown extended its fall against the euro even as the country's central bank kept interest rates on hold and reiterated plans to hike them in September.
Norway's currency fell to its lowest since July against both the dollar as well as the euro, and were last down 1.6% at 9.0365 crowns and 1.3% at 10.553, respectively.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars slid to their lowest levels since November 2020. The Aussie dollar last traded down 1.2% at US$0.7149, while the New Zealand unit dropped 0.8% to US$0.6827. 
The Kiwi dollar extended its losses, when New Zealand entered a new lockdown, delaying its central bank from becoming the first in the G10 from raising rates during the pandemic.

Investing.com - The dollar soared in early European trade Thursday, climbing to a nine-month high after the Federal Reserve raised the possibility of starting to cut back its pandemic-era monetary stimulus this year.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% higher at 93.460, just below the 93.517 level reached earlier, its strongest since early November. 
EUR/USD was 0.3% lower at 1.1675, falling to lows not seen since November 2020, GBP/USD fell 0.4% to 1.3708, falling to a four-week low, while AUD/USD fell 0.6% to 0.7188, a level not seen since Nov. 5.
The minutes of the July Federal Reserve policy meeting were released on Wednesday and showed the Fed officials saw the potential to ease bond-buying stimulus this year if the economy continues to improve as expected, although the condition of ""substantial further progress"" toward maximum employment had not yet been met.
This Fed meeting occurred before the strong July nonfarm payrolls report, and in all likelihood cements the view that the central bank will unveil more details of its tapering plan at the Jackson Hole symposium at the end of next week.
Ahead of that, the weekly initial jobless claims data are due later in the session, and should confirm a gradually improving U.S. labor market. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for August is also scheduled for release Thursday, and is expected to show a small improvement from July.
Additionally, USD/JPY traded 0.3% higher to 110.06 and USD/CHF rose 0.2% to 0.9186, with the dollar also outperforming the Japanese yen and Swiss franc after the Fed minutes.
That said, these two currencies have performed strongly elsewhere this week, underscoring persistent demand for havens amid the political turmoil in Afghanistan. EUR/CHF is around 1% lower this week, while EUR/JPY is down 0.8%. 
Elsewhere, USD/CNY traded 0.2% at 0.6959, just off a three-week high, ahead of the latest policy-setting meeting of China’s central bank, scheduled for early Friday.
The People’s Bank of China is expected to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged for the 16th straight month, but that view is not universal amid signs the country's economic recovery is losing steam.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, rising to a nine-month high against both the euro and the riskier Antipodean currencies. The possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering in 2021 also gave the U.S. currency a boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.32% to 93.445 by 11:02 PM ET (3:02 AM GMT), its highest level since Apr. 1.
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.40% to 110.08.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.30% to 0.7209. Australian employment data released earlier in the day said that the employment change was 2,200 and the unemployment rate at 4.6% for July, both better than expected... however, the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the country has hit a fresh record.
The NZD/USD pair slipped 0.44% to 0.6858.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.14% to 6.4932 while the GBP/USD pair was down 0.25% to 1.3721.
The Fed released the minutes from its latest meeting on Wednesday, in which it said that asset tapering could begin later in the year. The condition for the commencement is that economic recovery continues to improve as expected, although ""substantial further progress"" toward maximum employment is yet to be met.
Investors now await the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, taking place from Aug. 26 to 28, for further clues on the asset tapering and interest rate hike timeline.
Some investors shared the Fed’s confidence.
""Our read is that Fed officials will continue to signal ongoing steps toward normalizing policy, providing the dollar with crucial ongoing underlying support,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
""The Australian dollar remains in a powerful four-month downtrend,"" and looks set to drop below $0.72. The New Zealand dollar (NZD) is eyeing a drop to $0.68, although it should rise later in 2021, the note added.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept its interest rate unchanged as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday, removing support for the NZD. However, RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr told parliament earlier in the day that he still expects the official cash rate to slowly increase towards a more neutral level over the next 18 months.
New Zealand is back under a lockdown to tackle a fresh COVID-19 outbreak that delayed RBNZ becoming the first G10 central bank to hike interest rates during COVID-19 times."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar slipped from 4-1/2-month highs to trade little changed on Wednesday after minutes of last month's Federal Reserve meeting suggested there was no consensus about the timing of a tapering of its asset purchases under the U.S. central bank's quantitative easing program.
A reduction in debt purchases is typically positive for the dollar as it means the Fed will not be flooding the financial system with cash, increasing the greenback's value.
The minutes also said most participants ""judged that the Committee's standard of 'substantial further progress' toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met."" 
This means that Fed policy would remain accommodative for some time, providing no support for the dollar. 
""The market ... read the minutes as more dovish, leading to a quick uptick in indices and gold while Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar dipped,"" Matt Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com and City Index, wrote in a note sent after the release of the Fed comments.
""The focus now shifts to next week's Jackson Hole Symposium, where traders will closely scrutinize Fed Chairman Powell's keynote speech for any hints about the timing of a taper announcement,"" Weller added, referring to the Fed's annual economic symposium in Wyoming.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index was little changed at 93.137, sliding from a 4-1/2-month peak of 93.267.
The euro hit a session high versus the dollar after the release of the Fed minutes, rising from its lowest since April 1. It was last flat at $1.1712.
The dollar earlier gained ground as nagging concerns about the global economy forced investors to seek safety in the greenback. 
""We have a lot of macro risks at the moment surrounding markets,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe in London. ""We have the risk of a slowing Chinese economy, rising Delta cases in the Asia-Pacific region, and slower growth generally.""
In the United States, U.S. housing starts dropped 7.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.534 million units last month.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.2% to 109.85.
The commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars trimmed losses versus the greenback after the release of the Fed minutes.
The Aussie dollar was last down 0.2% at US$0.7244, while the New Zealand currency fell 0.4% to US$0.6892. 
A monthly fund manager survey by investment bank BoFA Securities showed that investors flipped to a net overweight on the dollar for the first time in nearly a year.
That shift in positioning was evident in more high-frequency weekly data as well with hedge funds ramping up their net long bets on the greenback to the most since March 2020.
While the dollar failed to draw any sustained strength from Fed Chair's Jerome Powell's comments and mixed U.S. data, markets shifted focus toward the Jackson Hole symposium where some expect the Fed to signal a change in direction with regards to its asset purchase plans.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded up 1.8% at $45,504, not far from Saturday's three-month high of $48,190. Ether stood at $3,064, up 1.8%.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in Europe Wednesday, but remained at elevated levels with global growth concerns, caused by the ongoing Covid outbreak, prompting traders to cut back on their positions with riskier currencies.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 93.093, just below the one-week high it hit on Tuesday.
USD/JPY edged higher to 109.59, EUR/USD was 0.1% higher at 1.1719, after falling to 1.1702 in the Asia session, its lowest since November 2020, while GBP/USD was largely unchanged at 1.3744, despite U.K. inflation slowing more sharply than expected to 2.0%, the Bank of England’s target, in July.
The dip in U.K. inflation is likely to be temporary, analysts said, pointing to sharp rises in household energy bills this year and sustained pressure on supply chains. ""There’s little doubt that headline CPI will go well above 3% later this year,"" said ING economist James Smith in a note to clients. ""It’s not difficult to see inflation coming fairly near to the Bank of England’s forecast of 4% in around November.""
U.S. retail sales dropped 1.1% in July, a lot more than the 0.3% decline expected, according to data released Tuesday. This added to the disappointing growth numbers from China earlier in the week, causing traders to question the global growth profile as many countries struggle to deal with its latest Covid-19 outbreak.
Although a lot of the focus has been on the recent rise in coronavirus cases in China, the U.S. recorded more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, according to Reuters data, with the areas that have low vaccination rates particularly hard hit.
Investors are now looking to the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting, due to be released later in the day, for clues to the central bank’s timeline for asset tapering and interest rate hikes. 
The Fed will also hold its Jackson Hole symposium in the following week, which could also provide more clues, especially as many market participants expect the central bank to announce plans to ease off bond buying at either its September or November policy meeting.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD traded flat at 0.6924 after volatile trading overnight in the wake of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged, instead of raising them for the first time since 2014, as widely expected.
The pair initially fell to a nine-month low at 0.6868, but it soon recovered after the central bank explained that it largely held off on raising rates because of the snap Covid-induced lockdown in the country and hikes were still to be expected in the near future.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the New Zealand dollar (NZD) was up after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) handed down its latest policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 93.073 by 11:51 PM ET (3:51 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.05% to 109.62.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.23% to 0.7265 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.28% to 0.6943.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.4835 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3756.
RNBZ kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% earlier in the day as it handed down its policy decision. The central bank was forced to postpone its plans to hike interest rates as New Zealand went into lockdown following the first local COVID-19 infection in six months.
“RBNZ was ready to pull the trigger, COVID-19 comes along 24 hours earlier and so they’ve just pulled back on that,” BNZ senior market strategist Jason Wong told Reuters.
Investors are now pricing a 60% chance of a hike in October.
""It depends on COVID-19 now... if this lockdown's short, then rate hikes are on the table, but there's always going to be a half-chance it continues longer and the market's not willing to price a hike,” said Wong.
However, other investors had the focus elsewhere.
“The dollar is being supported by the nervous risk environment... markets are paying attention to the COVID-19 Delta variant and the area which is of most concern seems to be China,"" Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim told Reuters.
""There's a stock market that's taken a bit of a beating recently, there's regulatory risk and now there are COVID-19 outbreaks in China. Does this all add up to say that we should be paying a lot more attention to downside risks in China?"" he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar advanced for a second straight session on Tuesday, bolstered by safe-haven demand, as investors fretted about Afghanistan, a slowing Chinese economy, and the rapid spread of the Delta coronavirus variant which forced some lockdowns.
The overall tone in financial markets was one of caution, with shares on Wall Street in the red. 
A much sharper decline than expected in Tuesday's U.S. retail sales curbed gains in the dollar, but that was offset by the higher-than-forecast rise in industrial production, which accelerated the greenback's gains. 
""This morning's retail sales report served to confirm that the U.S. consumer - the world's biggest and most dependable customer - is becoming more cautious,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""This, combined with evidence of a slowdown in the Chinese economy and ongoing political turmoil in Afghanistan, is driving investors to pay off dollar-funded borrowing positions and pull money out of high-risk markets,"" he added.
The Afghan Taliban said on Tuesday they wanted peaceful relations with other countries and would respect the rights of women within the framework of Islamic law, as they held their first official news briefing since their shock seizure of Kabul.
Many investors, however, were not comforted by the Taliban's conciliatory tone.
In afternoon trading, the U.S. dollar index rose 0.6% to 93.119. The euro, the biggest component in the dollar index, fell 0.6% to $1.1709.
The New Zealand dollar, meanwhile, tumbled to its lowest in three weeks after the country identified its first COVID-19 case since February, prompting the government to announce new short-term lockdown measures.
The currency fell sharply earlier in the global session after Prime Minister Jacinda Arden said Auckland - where the case was reported - would go into lockdown for seven days, while New Zealand as a whole will have the toughest level of lockdown for three days.
It was last down 1.7% at US$0.6904, after dropping to US$0.6900, the lowest since late July. 
The Australian dollar fell to a nine-month low after central bank meeting minutes were seen as dovish. It was last down 1.2% at US$0.7253. 
The safe-haven Japanese yen was down against a firm dollar, which rose 0.3% to 109.56 yen. The Swiss franc, another safe haven, also fell versus the dollar, which was last up 0.3% at 0.9149 franc.

Investors are looking to Wednesday's minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting last month, as several Federal Reserve officials have adopted a more hawkish outlook in recent weeks.
That hawkish view, however, does not take into account the most current data releases, which have come in weaker than expected, such as the poor confidence numbers amid the surge in Delta variant cases and the renewed rise in mitigation measures that could slow growth.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher in Europe Tuesday, with the global safe haven receiving a boost from concerns of a Covid-induced global economic slowdown as well as escalating political turmoil in Afghanistan. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 92.757.
USD/JPY was 0.1% higher at 109.31, EUR/USD was 0.1% lower at 1.1764, while GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.3804, despite solid U.K. employment data, with the number of employees on British company payrolls rising by 182,000 in July from June, moving closer to their pre-pandemic level.
“Political developments in Afghanistan could well be adding to the ongoing deterioration of the global risk environment due to Covid and the re-rating of Asia's growth outlook,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The disappointing data from China on Monday, when July industrial production and retail sales fell more than expected, is still causing investors to rethink the growth profile of the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to deal with its latest Covid-19 outbreak.
The turmoil in Afghanistan has also helped safe havens of all stripes, with concerns that a new Taliban regime could foster instability in neighboring Pakistan and elsewhere in Asia. 
The release of U.S. retail sales for July later in the session is expected to add to the concerns of a global slowdown, as consumer spending is likely to be hit by the reemergence of the Covid virus.
Also of interest, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a town hall for educators later in the day. However, it is widely expected that he will not address monetary policy at this meeting but wait until the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, due to take place next week.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD fell 1.3% to 0.6927 after New Zealand announced a national lockdown after discovering its first community case of Covid-19 in six months. The development may stop the Reserve Bank of New Zealand tightening policy at its next meeting on Wednesday.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely expected to authorize the first hike in the country’s benchmark interest rate since 2014.
AUD/USD fell 0.6% to 0.7291 after the release of the minutes from the Australian central bank's last policy meeting.
The Reserve Bank of Australia surprised markets at the meeting by sticking to its plan to start tapering bond buying, but the minutes sounded a more dovish tone, saying the central bank would be prepared to take further policy action should coronavirus lockdowns across the country threaten a deeper economic setback.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia. Disappointing economic data from China, the continuous spread of COVID-19's Delta variant, and political tension in Afghanistan all served to curb the market’s risk appetite, giving the safe-haven U.S. currency a boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 92.668 by 10:43 PM ET (2:43 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 109.25.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.35% to 0.7311, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.50% to 0.6982, with the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand due to hand down its policy decision on Wednesday.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.4786 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 1.3824.
Other safe-haven currencies, such as the yen, also gained against riskier currencies. The euro fell as low as 128.50 yen, its lowest level since late March 2021. The Swiss franc also remained near a nine-month high of 1.0720 reached earlier in the month against the euro, trading at 1.0745 francs to the euro.
""The moves seem to reflect a deteriorating in market sentiment. You could say the impact of COVID-19's Delta variant is behind this,"" Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Investors are still digesting Monday’s data from China that said industrial production and retail sales fell more than expected in July as the world’s second-largest economy continues to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a town hall for educators later in the day. However, it is widely expected that he will not address monetary policy at this meeting but wait until the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, due to take place next week.
The Fed will also release the minutes from its latest meeting on Wednesday, while U.S. core retail sales and retail sales data will be released later in the day.
Developments in Afghanistan, after the Taliban seized the capital city of Kabul, also curbed risk appetite. However, the direct impact for markets has so far been limited, according to some investors."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Monday against commodity currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, while the safe-haven yen gained as disappointing economic data from China, political tension in Afghanistan, and the spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus weighed on risk appetite.
The dollar's gains came after a slump in consumer sentiment on Friday weakened the U.S. unit.
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar was up 0.1% at 92.620, after falling to a one-week low of 92.468 on Friday. Its gains were most pronounced against commodity currencies.
The Aussie dollar was down 0.6% against the U.S. dollar at US$0.7335, while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.4% to US$0.7016 ahead of a Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy meeting on Wednesday, at which economists widely expect the first hike in the benchmark interest rate since 2014.
The greenback, meanwhile, rose 0.4% against the Canadian dollar to C$1.2572, amid Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's early election call for Sept. 20, betting that high vaccination rates against the coronavirus and a post-pandemic economic rebound will help him prolong and strengthen his grip on power. 
""The jump in the U.S. dollar comes from a combination of uncertainty over Delta, as China shut down a major port over safety, and the new geopolitical reality facing Afghanistan,"" said Juan Perez, FX strategist and trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.
""Overall, the buck is indeed playing what could be a short-lived role as a safe haven because nothing is very clear other than the end of a very long-armed conflict others saw ending differently,"" he added. 
Thousands of civilians desperate to flee Afghanistan thronged Kabul airport on Monday after the Taliban seized the capital over the weekend, prompting the United States to suspend evacuations as it came under mounting criticism at home over its pullout.
Currencies overall stuck to broad trading ranges as investors were wary of taking large bets at the start of a busy week for central banks.
China's July retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment were all weaker than expected as the latest COVID-19 outbreak weighed on the world's second-biggest economy.
Long positions on the greenback swelled to their biggest levels since March 2020, suggesting the dollar's recent move lower was more a temporary setback than the beginning of a structural downtrend. 
The release of the Fed minutes this week will be key to the short-term outlook for the greenback, especially if it confirms more policymakers are leaning toward tapering its bond purchase plan by the end of the year.
Currency market volatility, even by its already low levels, is nearing 2021 lows thanks to the summer lull.
Elsewhere, minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's latest meeting are due on Tuesday.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 1.2% to $46,479 after hitting a three-month high of $48,190 over the weekend.

64,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 11:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve told a judge not to scrap Libor as requested by consumers in a lawsuit because it would pose a risk to financial stability and undermine years of global planning for a transition to a new benchmark for borrowing rates.
A staged transition away from the London interbank offered rate is underway globally, but immediately ending the London interbank offered rate by court order would likely harm consumers and businesses, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a filing Friday in federal court in San Francisco.
Dozens of consumer borrowers and credit-card users are seeking an injunction to end Libor, claiming the benchmark is the work of a “price-fixing cartel.” The plaintiffs are also seeking monetary damages.
But ending the benchmark now would likely disrupt the trading of financial contracts, upend consumer contracts like mortgages and student loans and create “an avalanche of litigation,” the Fed said in its filing. The central bank said about $223 trillion of financial products are tied to the U.S. dollar Libor rate.
“Without an orderly transition away from Libor, there would undoubtedly be confusion and uncertainty in all markets that currently rely on Libor on a day-to-day basis,” the Fed said in the filing.
Libor is derived from a daily survey of bankers who estimate how much they would charge each other to borrow. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, regulators discovered that lenders had been manipulating the rates to their advantage, resulting in billions of dollars of fines.
Regulators and market participants around the world are currently in the process of shifting to new benchmarks to replaced the scandal-plagued suite of Libor rates. In the U.S., new contracts tied to dollar Libor are supposed to end this year and the final settings should be phased out by mid-2023, according to current timetables.
The threat of an abrupt end to Libor has also drawn vigorous defenses from some of the world’s biggest banks.
The Fed’s filing echoed claims made in November by defendants including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), who argued an injunction abruptly ending Libor would wreak havoc on financial markets.
In June, the judge overseeing the case refused to move the suit from San Francisco to New York, rejecting an argument by big banks that the case belongs in Manhattan due to the decades of litigation there over the benchmark and court decisions it has produced.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, but remained near a one-week low as rising Covid-19 cases and slumping U.S. consumer confidence could pressure the Federal Reserve to delay tapering its bond-buying program. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded less than 0.1% higher at 92.550, but this is still around 0.5% lower than the levels seen at the end of last week.
USD/JPY was 0.2% lower at 109.38, EUR/USD was marginally lower at 1.1789, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3854, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7340 after Australian Covid-19 lockdowns were extended over the weekend.
A University of Michigan confidence survey released late last week showed U.S. consumer sentiment sliding to the lowest level since 2011 amid an acceleration in Covid-19 cases caused by the fast-spreading delta variant.
The number of children hospitalized with the coronavirus in the United States hit a record high of just over 1,900 on Saturday, an alarming development given that the virus has so far taken more of a toll on the older and unhealthier parts of the population. .
This is causing traders to pause for thought after inflation and employment numbers, also released last week, added to the growing expectations of an asset-tapering announcement from the Federal Reserve by the end of this year.
The Fed's central banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this month is now firmly in the spotlight, but ahead of that Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on Tuesday and the central bank releases minutes of its last policy meeting a day later.
Still, the dollar is trading in narrow ranges with the collapse of the Afghan government pointing risk-averse traders towards safe havens.
“Geopolitical developments in Afghanistan over the weekend are dominating the world’s headlines but it is probably too early to assess what could be the fall-out in the FX market,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
NZD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7022 ahead of a Reserve Bank of New Zealand's policy meeting on Wednesday, which could result in the first hike in the country’s benchmark interest rate since 2014 after last week’s strong employment figures.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, remaining near a one-week low. The U.S. currency slumped the most in almost seven weeks on Friday, after a sharp fall in U.S. consumer confidence lessened the likelihood of a tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 92.498 by 10:45 PM ET (2:45 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.19% to 109.36.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.7352, with the Reserve Bank of Australia due to release the minutes from its latest meeting on Tuesday. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.7036, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand due to hand down its policy decision on Wednesday.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.4773. China’s industrial production rose a lower-than-expected 6.4% year-on-year in July, while retail sales also disappointed, growing 8.5% year-on-year in the same month.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3866.
Investors digested U.S. economic data from the previous week that said consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest levels since 2011. The Michigan consumer expectations for August was 65.2, while the Michigan consumer sentiment was 70.2.
""Does the survey signal an imminent turn in the U.S. economy? We doubt it given vaccine efficacy remains high and the hit to sentiment likely means more people will get vaccinated... instead, the Delta surge in the U.S. is more a case of delay rather than derail as far as the recovery is concerned,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analyst Tapas Strickland said in a note.
Further U.S. data, including core retail sales and retail sales, will be released on Tuesday.
Investors also await the Fed’s next move on asset tapering and interest rate hikes. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at a virtual town hall meeting with educators and students on Tuesday, with the minutes of its last policy meeting to be released a day later. Later in the month, the central bank will also hold its annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. dollar net longs rose in the latest week to their highest since early March last year, according to Reuters calculations and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position climbed to $3.08 billion in the week ended Aug. 10, from net longs of $2.11 billion the previous week. U.S. dollar positioning has been net long for four straight weeks after staying net short for 16 months.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Swiss franc, as well as the Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the greenback posted a net long position of $2.993 billion this week, compared with net shorts of $1.92 billion the week before.
""Speculative traders have held a modest, aggregate U.S. dollar long position for a month now, but positioning remains rather light and somewhat non-committal,"" wrote Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in a note after the CFTC data.
""This may reflect light trading conditions through the northern hemisphere summer or a desire to wait for more evidence in support of building U.S. dollar longs further. Either way, there is clearly some room for the position to grow.""
The dollar has gained about 0.4% over the last two weeks, bolstered by safe-have bids arising out of nagging worries about the Delta coronavirus variant and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to announce a tapering of its asset purchases soon. 
A reduction in the Fed's asset purchases is viewed as a step toward a tighter monetary policy and is considered a positive scenario for the dollar. 
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin net shorts fell to 1,104 contracts in the week ended Aug. 10, from net shorts of 1,290 the previous week. This week's bitcoin shorts were the smallest since mid-May.

Bitcoin has made a recovery the last two weeks, hitting just shy of $48,000 on Friday, its highest since mid-May, after months of sluggish performance. Bitcoin has surged more than 50% from its July 20 low.
A wave of global regulatory crackdown on the crypto sector has weighed on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this year. Since hitting an all-time high of just under $65,000 in mid-April, bitcoin has fallen about 32%.

Investing.com – The dollar is on course for weekly loss Friday, pressured by a sharp decline in yields, but bets on the greenback have swelled to more than five-month highs as investors believe that the Federal Reserve is on course to rein in loose monetary policy measures by year-end.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.57% to 92.51.
The value of the net long dollar position rose to $3.08 billion in the week ended Aug. 10, from $2.11 billion the prior week, according to data from CFTC and Reuters. That was the highest level since early March. 
The data came just as fresh worries emerge about the threat that surges in cases pose to the economic recovery.   
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index slumped to a reading of 70.2 in the preliminary August survey from 81.2 in July, the weakest reading since December 2011.
""The most jarring and unexpected manifestation of the Delta variant was the collapse in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
The dollar retreated, paced by a drop in Treasury yields, with investors seemingly worried that surging Covid-19 threaten to slow the recovery.  
""It's hard to believe that we're at it again, but Covid is back in full force and once again threatens to derail economic activity,"" Jefferies said in a note.
But fresh worries about Covid-19 weren't enough to knock the Federal Reserve off the tapering, with some on Wall Street expecting the U.S. central bank to trim its $120 billion monthly purchases by year-end.
""Rising concerns over the Delta variant and increased angst around inflation are not enough to slow the Fed's march toward tapering, where Fedspeak ramped up this week regarding the timing of an announcement,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. ""Indications of continued labor market progress in our MSBCI, updated forecasts, and nascent signs of cooling inflation we think keep the FOMC on track to announce the taper at its December meeting.""
With next week set to bring the further commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and the minutes of the Fed's July meeting, investors appear to be betting on further clues from the central bank on tapering."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a one-week low against a basket of currencies on Friday, after a survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment dropped sharply in early August, raising worries of a dent in economic activity.
The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 81.2 in July. That was the lowest level since 2011 and one of the six largest drops in the past 50 years of the survey.
Investors this week have been treated to a mixed bag of data. While U.S. producer prices data out Thursday showed surging prices, bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve removing some of its stimulus, it followed U.S. consumer price data on Wednesday, which indicated inflation may be peaking, potentially giving the Fed room to remain accommodative for longer.
""The prime driver this week was this idea that a deceleration in inflation pressures will reduce the impetus for an earlier tapering of Federal Reserve asset purchases,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""What's happened here is traders have moved their expectation for a tapering announcement from September toward November, perhaps even December,"" Schamotta said.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, was 0.5% lower at 92.521, its lowest since Aug 6. For the week the index was down 0.3%.
Traders continue to look toward the Fed's central banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this month, for clues to the Fed's next move.
""(Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell may use the Jackson Hole platform to provide further clarity on the sequencing of the Fed’s monetary tightening operations - making it clear that a tapering announcement, when it comes, will not act as a temporal anchor for changes in the Fed funds rate,"" said Schamotta.
""The goal is to tame a possible taper tantrum before it gets started,"" he said.

Sterling was 0.45% higher against the broadly weaker dollar, but remained on pace for a second straight week of modest declines as investors look for fresh catalysts for the British currency's next move after Britain's growth figures for the second quarter came in as expected.
Elsewhere, bitcoin climbed 4.78% to $46,571.09, nearing Wednesday's three-month peak of $46,787, while Ethereum rose 6.03% to $3,228.33.

The gap was $1.13 billion in June, down from a revised $3.2 billion in May and $3.1 billion a year earlier, the Turkish central bank said on its website on Friday.
The deficit was in line with expectations in a Bloomberg survey, where the median estimate predicted a shortfall of $1.15 billion. The 12-month rolling shortfall narrowed to $29.7 billion.

Investing.com - The dollar slightly retreated in early European trading Friday, but remained near its highest level in four months as elevated inflation levels and a recovering labor market point to the Federal Reserve reining in its hefty monetary stimulus in the near future.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded around 0.1% lower at 92.977, just below Wednesday's four-month high of 93.195, and suggesting a weekly gain of 0.2%.
USD/JPY was marginally higher at 110.41, EUR/USD was 0.1% higher at 1.1738, just above Wednesday’s four-month low of 1.1706, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3813, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7339.
Thursday’s data releases added to the growing expectations of an asset tapering announcement from the Federal Reserve by the end of 2020. 
The producer price index grew 1% month-on-month in July, up 7.8% on the year, the largest annual increase in more than a decade. Wednesday’s consumer price data may have indicated inflation may be peaking, but this wholesale price data suggested inflationary pressures remain.
Additionally, data Thursday showed that 375,000 initial jobless claims were filed throughout the week, which was lower than the 387,000 claims filed during the previous week, and indicative of a gradually improving labor market.
A number of Fed officials have in recent days come out in support of tapering bond buying in coming months, and while Fed chair Jerome Powell has consistently called for more time the pressure is mounting.
The “Fed may struggle to continue arguing that inflation expectations are 'well anchored',” said analysts at ING, in a note, and it’s likely “that the Fed will be having an increasingly public discussion about tapering, with an announcement possible at the 22 September meeting.” 
USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 8.5696 after Turkey’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate steady at 19% on Thursday for a fifth straight month, with soaring consumer inflation providing little room for a cut.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, but remained near a four-month high. Investors now await more hints from the U.S. Federal Reserve on a timetable for asset tapering and interest rate hikes.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 92.968 by 11:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 110.41.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7341 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.7006.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4783.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3810. The pound hit a two-week low of $1.3794 during the previous session, even as the GDP for the second quarter rose a slightly better-than-expected 22.2% year-on-year. The GDP grew 4.8% quarter-on-quarter.
The latest U.S. economic data, released on Thursday, said the producer price index grew 1% month-on-month in July. Although the consumer price index released a day before suggested that inflationary pressures are peaking, the fact that they remain could push the Fed to begin asset tapering.
Several Fed officials called for asset tapering to begin in the coming months, in contrast to the more dovish policies of other central banks such as the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank.
Despite Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s most recent dovish comments putting him at odds with some of the regional Fed presidents, expectations of an asset tapering announcement by the end of 2020 are growing.
""The focus is shifting to the employment from inflation. While we still need to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 Delta variant, if we have a strong payroll growth for the next few months, then there should be a tapering announcement from the Fed,"" Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Asset Management senior economist Naoya Oshikubo told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar advanced against a basket of currencies on Thursday, after data showed producer prices posted their largest annual increase in more than a decade in the 12 months through July, suggesting inflation pressures remain strong.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, was 0.1% higher at 93.019. 
U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in July, a Labor Department report showed on Thursday, suggesting inflation could remain high as strong demand fuelled by the recovery continues to hurt supply chains.
The producer price index (PPI) for final demand increased 1.0% last month after rising 1.0% in June. In the 12 months through July, the PPI jumped 7.8%, a record high since the measure was introduced just over a decade ago.
Separately, data showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell again last week as the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued.
Investors remain vigilant for any signs of inflation running too hot since it could potentially spur the Federal Reserve to pull forward its timing on tapering of asset purchases as well as interest rate hikes.
""The U.S. dollar held near the top of a tight overnight range as fresh data renewed pressure on the Fed to shift away from low rate policy,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
The greenback has broadly strengthened since mid-June - hitting its highest since April 1 at 93.195 prior to Wednesday's data - when the U.S. Federal Reserve flagged that it was gearing up for earlier-than-expected rate hikes and amid evidence that the release of pent-up demand in a rebounding economy was fuelling price rises.
Thursday's data helped the greenback shake off some of the weakness from the prior session when data showed U.S. consumer price increases slowed in July, easing concerns the Federal Reserve will imminently signal a scaling back of bond purchases.
""Today's huge upside PPI surprise follows yesterday's solid but moderating CPI gains, leaving a mix that will keep inflation concerns alive even as economists will continue to expect a slowing in monthly price gains into year-end,"" Action Economics' Mike Englund and Kim Rupert said in a note.

Sterling fell 0.5% on the day against the broadly stronger U.S. dollar as analysts expected the Bank of England to make no moves in its monetary policy after official data showed Britain's economy grew in line with expectations in the second quarter.

74,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the cash sloshing around in the financial system, many investors have been reluctant to scoop up Treasury bills in recent offerings.
That apathy stems from uncertainty surrounding the so-called X-date, when the Treasury is set to exhaust its borrowing authority under the debt ceiling. There’s also a perceived degree of confusion from the department on matters of supply, and the fact that investors are parking a record $1.087 trillion of cash overnight at the Federal Reserve’s reverse-repurchase facility to earn a slightly higher yield.

The Treasury on Thursday sold $40 billion of four-week bills at 0.045% and $35 billion of eight-week securities at 0.055%. Both auctions generated average demand compared to recent weeks, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) -- especially in light of the department’s unexpected move to shrink some bill auctions, announced before Thursday’s sales.
“The announcement placed some focus on October 15 as a potential date where Treasury is concerned about the debt ceiling,” Jefferies economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients. “As a consequence, the four- and eight-week bills saw a bit of yield separation” in the when-issued market.
Treasury bills maturing in October and November -- which align with the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates -- have cheapened relative to the rest of the short-end curve.
The department slashed the sizes of its three- and six-month bill auctions by $3 billion each as it endeavors to remain below the debt limit, which was reinstated at the beginning of the month. At the same time, it will also sell a $50 billion 57-day cash management bill, while ending the 42-day security after the Aug. 19 settlement.
Money-market traders are already starting to get nervous that the battle over the debt cap could go down to the wire, though they acknowledge that the episode will eventually get resolved. However, this time is proving to be more uncertain as the Treasury said last week it’s not able to provide a specific estimate of how long they will last.
“The implications for this are concerns about how much issuance goes on in the front-end Treasury bills,” Jerome Schneider, head of short-term portfolio management and funding at Pacific Investment Management Co., said during a Bloomberg Television interview before the supply announcement. “They tend to be the things that are held hostage in these types of markets.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Thursday, as signs of cooling U.S. inflation relieved the pressure on the Federal Reserve to start reining in its massive bond-buying program.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded around 0.1% lower at 92.898, retreating from Wednesday’s high of 93.195, a level not seen since the start of April.
USD/JPY was flat at 110.41, after pulling back from the five-week high of 110.80 reached overnight, EUR/USD was marginally higher at 1.1741, after falling to a four-month low of 1.1706, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7365.
The U.S. consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after climbing 0.9% in June, the largest drop in the month-to-month inflation rate in 15 months. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.3% after increasing 0.9% in June. That was the smallest gain in four months and the first deceleration in the so-called core CPI since February.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently said high inflation numbers will turn out to be transitory as the economy fully reopens, limiting the need to quickly tighten monetary policy, and these figures will provide some support to this view. 
That said, the weakness in the greenback is limited, with many analysts still expecting the Fed to announce a tapering of stimulus this year, potentially as soon as next month.
“Prices continued to rise from the previous month and, on a year-over-year basis, CPI growth remained unchanged at 5.4% (it was expected to slow to 5.3%),” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management.
“So while Federal Reserve officials may be relieved that price pressures did not accelerate more rapidly, the continued increase in CPI keeps the central bank on track to announce [a] taper in the next six weeks.” 
This point of view was backed up Wednesday by comments from Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who indicated that the standard for reducing the central bank’s bond-buying program may have already been met given the current levels of inflation and recent labor market improvements.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3868 despite U.K. GDP growing 4.8% in the second quarter, a sharp increase on the quarter after the first quarter’s 1.6% drop. 
This report is likely to invigorate discussions about fewer asset purchases from the Bank of England.
USD/TRY fell 0.2% to 8.6079 ahead of a meeting of the Turkish central bank later Thursday. The bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 19%, to the likely annoyance of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after Turkish consumer inflation climbed more than expected in July.
Turkey’s central bank raised its inflation expectations in its latest quarterly report on July 29 but projected a significant drop in price growth in the final quarter.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia. However, the U.S. currency held near a four-month peak as the U.S.’ latest inflation data tempered bets of an earlier-than-expected tightening of its monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 92.898 by 1:08 AM ET (5:08 AM GMT). It fell 0.19% on Wednesday when it rose as high as 93.195, a level not seen since Apr. 1.
The USD/JPY pair was steady at 110.41.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.7365, with Australia’s Canberra entering a lockdown and Sydney aiming to tighten its existing restrictive measures. The NZD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.7033.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.4757% and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3871.
Data released in the U.S. on Wednesday said the core consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month-on-month in July, a pace that was slower than expected. With the labor market recovery a condition for the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin asset tapering and hiking interest rates, the debate on whether the current inflationary pressures are transitory continues.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Wednesday that conditions are already in place to begin asset tapering, thanks to the current spike in inflation, recent labor market improvements and the expectation for continued strong demand.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNBC that the Fed should announce its timeline for asset tapering in September and begin the process a month later. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin told Reuters it could take a few more months before the U.S. job market is sufficiently recovered.
However, some investors still expect the Fed to announce a tapering of stimulus within 2021, potentially as soon as September.
""The general consensus emanating from the Fed currently is that the time to taper asset purchases is nearing,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kim Mundy wrote in a research note.
""Growing expectations for a near-term taper can support the dollar,” the note added, with Mundy expecting an asset tapering announcement in September depending on the strength of August’s labor market data."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell on Wednesday after U.S. inflation data showed consumer price increases eased in July, taking some pressure off the Federal Reserve to begin scaling back the monthly bond purchases that are part of its toolbox to support the economic recovery.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, was down 0.17% at 92.915 at 3:05 p.m. ET (1905 GMT). (Graphic: World FX rates https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E )
Earlier, the U.S. currency hit 93.195, its highest since April 1, and not far off of its 2021 high of 93.439, but it sold off after data showed the consumer price index rose 0.5% last month after climbing 0.9% in June. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.3% after increasing 0.9% in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast overall CPI would rise 0.5% and core CPI 0.4%.
While prices are still rising, the Fed has said it expects inflationary pressures to moderate over time as supply catches up with demand following months of COVID-19 lockdowns.
""The CPI report was enough to cause a bit of profit taking for the U.S. dollar, but at the end of the day, it's not a game changer for the Fed,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management. ""They're still going to be announcing taper,” likely within the next six weeks.
The greenback had enjoyed a lift from last week's better-than-expected U.S. jobs data, as well as from remarks by Fed officials about tapering bond purchases and, eventually, raising rates, sooner than policymakers elsewhere.
Looking forward, the Fed will depend on data when it comes to the timing of the dialing back of its asset purchases, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
""It's all going to be all about next month's employment report and if that does not impress, tapering, as far September goes, might even get pushed out towards the end of the year,"" he said.
In Europe, investor sentiment has declined, with a survey showing a third straight month of deterioration in Germany as rising global COVID-19 cases keep markets on edge.
""Investors have to take on board the possibility of news on Fed tapering at a time when COVID is still very apparent in various parts of the world,"" said Rabobank analyst Jane Foley.
""The consequence of this is likely to be a firmer dollar,"" she added, especially if the euro breaches its 2021 low.
The euro gained 0.16% against the greenback, to 1.17395, following six straight sessions of losses and having fallen as low as 1.1706 in early deals in Europe, near the year's low of $1.1704. 
Sterling gained 0.2% to 1.38645 against the dollar, pulling back from a two-week low. 
The yen was up 0.12% at 110.445, after dropping for five consecutive sessions against the dollar. 
South Korea reported a record number of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, while outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Australia grow steadily.

The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar , seen as riskier currencies, rose after the U.S. CPI report, last up 0.33% and 0.5% respectively.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin touched $46,787.60, its highest since May 17. Bitcoin was last up 1.5% at $46,304.54, while ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, was up 2.7% at $3,226.18.

Investing.com -- The dollar strengthened in early European trading Wednesday, extending recent gains ahead of U.S. inflation data which could influence Federal Reserve’s tapering thinking.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded around 0.1% higher at 93.097, hitting its highest level since the start of April.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 110.67, the highest since mid July, EUR/USD was largely flat at 1.1717, near a four-month low, GBP/USD was 0.1% lower at 1.3830, near a two-week low, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% at 0.7340.
The dollar has been on the rise of late, as improving U.S. labor data and a more hawkish tone from Federal Reserve policymakers have led markets to expect the central bank to begin tapering its asset purchases later this year.
Friday’s official U.S. jobs report impressed, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 943,000 in July and numbers for May and June also being revised higher.
Now the attention turns to the second leg of the Fed’s dual mandate, with the consumer price index for July due out from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Analysts are looking for a gain in the headline figure of 5.3% over last year, marginally lower than June’s 5.4%, which was the biggest monthly gain since August 2008.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to have climbed 4.3% in July from a year ago against the 4.5% jump in June, which was the quickest pace of increase since September 1991.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently said the elevated inflation numbers will turn out to be transitory as the economy fully reopens, but another high release could add pressure to the tapering debate.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans took a dovish slant on Tuesday, saying the current inflation spike shouldn't push the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy prematurely, but he’s in the minority this week with a couple of his colleagues stating on Monday that inflation is already at a level that could prompt tightening.
“Markets would hardly be surprised over a sizzling inflation report in July,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “We expect core inflation around 4.8%, likely unhinging Powell and expediting the talk about tapering as early as in September.”

The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.4830 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 1.3830.
Investors expect the U.S. currency, already boosted by Fed hints that asset tapering could begin soon, to continue its gains.
""With what we have in hand now, we would expect this pattern of dollar gains to continue,"" JFD Group head of research Charalambos Pissouros told Reuters, ahead of U.S. inflation data, including core consumer price index, which is due later in the day.
""Another set of extremely high numbers, well above the Fed's objective of 2%, could add to the view that the surge in inflation may not be transitory, and thereby, increase further the chances for an earlier normalization by the Fed,"" he added.
Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has maintained that inflationary pressure is likely to be temporary, some of his colleagues, most recently Chicago Fed Bank President Charles Evans, are starting to disagree. Other officials, including Kansas City Fed Bank President Esther George, will also speak throughout the week.
The continuous uptick in COVID-19 cases globally also remains concerning, with Australia extending a lockdown in Melbourne.

Investing.com – The dollar continued its climb Tuesday, riding on the coattails of rising Treasury yields as investors bet the Federal Reserve’s threshold to begin trimming its monthly bond purchases will be met sooner rather than later.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.15% to 913.08, as U.S. bond yields fell, with the U.S. rates continuing to trend higher, with 10-year above 1.4%.
The Federal Reserve has set the bar of sustainable further progress in the economy that needs to met to begin tapering its $120 monthly purchases of bonds. The labor market is at the heart of the threshold, and now some on Wall Street are betting the economy will be able to rack up enough job gains by year-end.
“We expect a Fed tapering announcement in December 2021,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. “[W]e expect to continue mean the economy can reach recovery benchmarks earlier than we had anticipated.”
The odds of the sooner rather later tapering from the U.S. central bank were boosted after several Fed members including Atlantic Fed President Raphael Bostic and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren backed earlier action on policy from the Fed.
Rosengren said Monday the Fed should announce in September that it will begin trimming its $120 billion in purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds “this fall.” While Bostic said he is in the favor of faster tapering than in previous rounds.
“We are well on the road to substantial progress toward our goal,” Bostic said Monday. “My sense is if we are able to continue this for the next month or two I think we would have made the ‘substantial progress’ toward the goal and should be thinking about what our new policy position should be.”
Against the backdrop of growing expectations for a sooner rather later monetary policy tightening, Wall Street continued to bet on further dollar upside, supporting by uptick in U.S. yields.
“Strong US data, back-to-school success, ‘advanced notice’ on Fed tapering, and progress on infrastructure make the US stand out. Stay short UST duration, long the USD,” Morgan Stanley said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up on Tuesday, touching a more than four-month high against the euro, as investors speculated further over whether recent strong jobs data could push the Federal Reserve to soon start tapering its bond-buying program.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose for a third straight session and hit its highest level in about three weeks. It was last up 0.1% on the day.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 1.7% at $45,530.05, having hit a three-month high of $46,759 overnight. Ether was down 0.9% at $3,139.15.
The dollar has risen recently with U.S. bond yields as the prospect of reduced Fed stimulus weakened bond prices. 
""The dollar is well bid, and it's been well bid since the middle of last week,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.
""A combination of hawkish comments from several Federal Reserve officials and the second monthly increase of more than 900,000 jobs has reaffirmed what the market has suspected, and that is for a tapering decision to be made shortly."" 
U.S. job openings hit a record high in June while hiring also increased, the Labor Department said in a monthly survey on Monday.
On Friday, the department's non-farm payrolls report showed jobs increased by 943,000 in July, above the 870,000 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Monday the U.S. economy is improving faster than expected, with the time when the Fed could start slowing its bond purchases nearing quickly.
Investors will be looking for signals from the Fed at the annual Jackson Hole conference of central bankers this month. They also await further economic data. U.S. consumer price data is due on Wednesday.
The euro is near a key level against the dollar at $1.17, and the next key level lower for the currency would be $1.16, which is ""where we were when the early election results were coming in last November,"" Chandler said, referring to the U.S. presidential election.
Against the dollar, the euro was last down 0.1% at $1.1720.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.2% to 110.575 yen.
The dollar was also up 0.2% versus the Swiss franc, extending recent gains.
Investors continue to be worried about growth in China and the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Germany's ZEW survey found investor sentiment deteriorated for a third month in a row in August, due to fears that rising COVID-19 infections could hold back the recovery in Europe's largest economy.

""The Delta variant (spread) is on the rise in the U.S., and some states are at record levels. It's a global phenomenon, and countries that looked to have done well in handling it, like in East Asia, are now bombarded by it. Sydney's in lockdown,"" Chandler said.
Against the U.S. dollar, the Aussie dollar was last up 0.3%.

Investing.com -- The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Tuesday, as a series of strong jobs releases raised expectations of an early tapering of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s massive monetary stimulus. 
At 1:55 AM ET (0555 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded around 0.1% higher at 92.972, after earlier trading above 93 for the first time since early April.
USD/JPY edged higher to 110.32, EUR/USD was largely flat at 1.1736, just above a four-month low, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3845, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% at 0.7323.
Helping the dollar’s tone was the release of the U.S. Labor Department’s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Monday, which showed that job openings increased by 590,000 to a record-high 10.1 million on the last day of June.
This followed on from Friday’s official U.S. jobs report, where nonfarm payrolls rose by 943,000 in July, more than expected, while numbers for May and June were also revised up.
This labor market strength has prompted the market to reassess when the Federal Reserve will start to rein in its $120 billion asset-purchase program, potentially starting to taper this year with higher interest rates following as soon as 2022.
Federal Reserve policymakers have also started to guide the market towards an early tapering. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated Monday he is eyeing the fourth quarter, if not earlier, for the start of a bond-purchase taper, while his colleague from Boston, Eric Rosengren, suggested September for the tapering announcement.
The next major event risk for the foreign exchange markets will be the release of U.S. consumer inflation data on Wednesday, particularly as the question over whether a well-flagged and gradual tapering could still upset asset markets.
“A litmus test here may be Wednesday's release of U.S. July CPI, expected to peak around the 5.3/5.4% year-on-year area,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Any higher, especially if the core were to surprise on the upside, could suggest that the Fed's exit from loose policy may not be quite as relaxed as most think.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4791 after China’s central bank stated in its latest quarterly report that inflation pressures are “controllable,” while also flagging risks to the economic growth outlook.
This report has raised expectations that the central bank may shortly announce another reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks after July’s surprise cut.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, maintaining its resilience over growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin asset tapering sooner than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 92.977 by 10:53 PM ET (2:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 110.34, with Japanese markets reopening after a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7326 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.23% to 0.6975.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.4835 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.3836.
Expectations that the Fed will begin asset tapering boosted safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc and gold. The euro fell to $1.1732, its lowest since early April 2020.
""The market is repricing the Fed's tapering. It has only begun and I expect market adjustment to continue. The market will likely test the euro's low so far this year of $1.1704 marked on Mar. 31,"" Rakuten Securities senior strategist Jun Arachi told Reuters.
A stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report, released during the previous week, saw U.S. Treasury yields climb to three-week highs and a broad rally for the U.S. currency. The report said non-farm payrolls rose by 943,000 and the unemployment rate declined to 5.4% in July.
Atlanta Fed Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Monday that he expects asset tapering to begin in the fourth quarter, but that an even earlier move could be possible should the jobs market maintain its recent pace of improvement.
In Asia Pacific, expectations of an interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand when it hands down its policy decision in the following week continued to give the New Zealand a small boost."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up on Monday to touch the highest in more than two weeks against a basket of currencies, buoyed by upbeat U.S. data, even as traders kept a close watch on the spread of COVID-19 cases in the United States.
Bitcoin hit its highest in nearly three months. It was last up 5.7% at $46,352.66, while ether was up 5.27% at $3,174.27.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was last up 0.09% at 92.937, its highest since July 23 and not far from its four-month high of 93.194.
Data Monday showed U.S. job openings jumped to a record high in June and hiring increased. That came on the heels of Friday's U.S. monthly jobs report that showed U.S. employers hired the most workers in nearly a year in July and continued to raise wages.
The dollar rose sharply following Friday's report, with the upbeat jobs news helping to support the view that the Federal Reserve may act more quickly to tighten U.S. monetary policy. Fed officials have made a jobs market recovery a condition of tighter monetary policy.
""The market is struggling to balance signs of a stronger jobs market with rising Delta concerns,"" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive in Toronto. 
""I would say the market is holding its breath on Delta and how quickly it resolves,"" he said. ""It's led to a standstill in the forex market.""
Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the United States are at a six-month high, fueled by the spread of the Delta variant. The impact of the Delta variant in the United States has added to concerns as COVID-19 cases also are rising across Asia. 
Against the dollar, the euro was down 0.2%.
Meanwhile, the dollar is up 0.6% versus the Swiss franc after rising 0.95% on Friday.
The Japanese yen was little changed versus the greenback at 110.28 per dollar.

Sharply lower oil prices weighed on the commodity-linked currencies, including the Australian dollar, which eased 0.3% to US$0.7334. The Canadian dollar fell 0.20% versus the greenback at 1.26 per dollar.
Speculators cut their net long dollar positions in the latest week, data showed on Friday, but they are still positioned for the greenback to rise.

85,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. dollar is poised to rally even more strongly than Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) had expected in the second half, the firm said, citing “historically exceptional” market and economic conditions.
The recovery from Covid-19’s economic shock has yielded stronger equity and commodity rallies and faster inflation than after previous recessions, senior foreign-exchange strategist Ben Randol wrote in a note on Monday. While share prices may now weaken, robust fiscal expansion will probably lead to tighter monetary policy, suggesting broader dollar appreciation.
“Looking forward, history suggests a 6-12-month period of equity market softness alongside higher UST yields,” Randol wrote. These are “conditions that have the potential to weigh on risk assets more generally, in turn supporting USD.”
Bank of America isn’t alone in its prediction. Speculative positioning on the dollar turned positive for the first time since May in the week ended Aug. 3, approaching a late-March peak, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. The greenback has gained against eight of its Group-of-10 peers so far this year, underperforming only the British pound and Canadian dollar.
The greenback extended its advance on Monday after U.S. data on Friday showed the biggest increase in employment in almost a year.
“As markets digest the increasingly-proximate reality of Fed policy recalibration, the potential for accompanying risk asset and commodity price ‘normalization’ could emerge as a separate driver of USD gains against cyclical FX,” Randol wrote. “This would cause USD to broadly rise against FX other than JPY and potentially CHF through end-year, conceivably sharply so.”

Investing.com -- The dollar steadied in early European trading Monday, remaining near recent highs following Friday’s strong nonfarm payrolls release as traders priced in an early tightening of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded less than 0.1% lower at 92.793, just off the two-week high of 92.927 seen earlier in the session.
USD/JPY edged lower to 110.22, EUR/USD was largely flat at 0.1% higher at 1.1761, after earlier hitting a four-month low, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3866, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7352.
Boosting the dollar was Friday’s strong U.S. jobs report, with nonfarm payrolls rising by a healthy 943,000 in July, while numbers for May and June were also revised up.
The Federal Reserve has made a recovery in the labor market a key requisite before it will start tightening monetary policy, but this strong release has increased expectations that a reduction in asset purchases could start this year and higher interest rates could follow as soon as 2022.
Last week, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida suggested that conditions for hiking interest rates might be met as soon as late 2022, while Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that two payrolls reports showing jobs growth of 800,000-1,000,000 region in August and September would lead him to vote for tapering in September.
“The 943K jobs created this month and a positive revision to last month’s number was as ‘wished for’ by the FOMC, which means that a September taper decision is 100% LIVE!,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
The coming week sees the release of the U.S. consumer price index and the producer price index, on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Richmond Fed head Thomas Barkin are set to speak later Monday.
Both Bostic and Barkin are known to lean towards tapering so their comments will be closely watched.

The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3870.
The U.S. currency got a boost from the strong U.S. jobs report that increased bets that the Fed could start asset tapering and hike interest rates earlier than expected. The report, released on Friday, said non-farm payrolls rose by 943,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in July.
""U.S. payrolls were a game-changer,"" Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne, said in a note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net long bets on the U.S. dollar were trimmed in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net long dollar position was $2.11 billion for the week ended Aug. 3, compared with a net long position of $2.99 billion for the prior week.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc, and Canadian and Australian dollars.
The latest data marked only the third week since March 2020 that speculators reported a net long position on the dollar. 
In a wider measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the greenback posted a net short of $1.92 billion, down from $2.88 billion a week earlier. 
The dollar -- which had rallied hard since late May on solid U.S. data and a shift in interest rate expectations, only to lose steam in recent sessions -- rose sharply on Friday, after a strong U.S. jobs report.
""Strong hiring could mean hawkish hints from the Fed at its late August summit of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,"" Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington, said in a note.

For investors weighing improving economic data and a potential tapering of asset purchases on the one hand and worries related to the growing spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus on the other, Friday's data may help tilt the balance, said Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton in London.
""This should definitely swing the balance back towards the former, given how it will heighten expectations for a hawkish pivot from Powell at Jackson Hole, and raise anticipation for the September FOMC,"" he said.

Investing.com – The dollar jumped Friday, underpinned by move higher in U.S. Treasury yields after a better-than-expected monthly jobs report stoked expectations the Federal Reserve will begin to tighten policy sooner rather than later. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.59% to 91.69, as U.S. bond yields gained, with the 10-yield rate trending close to 1.3%.
“[W]e continue to see the risks skewed towards earlier Federal Reserve stimulus withdrawal with a QE tapering announcement before year end and the first interest rate hikes coming next year,” ING said in a note following a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report released Friday. 
The U.S. economy created 943,000 jobs in July, above forecasts for a gain of 870,000, while  the unemployment rate fell to 5.4% from 5.9%.
Average hourly earnings rose to 4% to from 3.7%  as employers were forced to hike wages to attract new workers amid dearth in labor supply. The trend of rising wages is expected to continue, and could keep inflation higher for longer. 
If the Fed fails to act quell inflation, then it runs the risk of policy misstep. 
“The recovery in employment is getting to a place where the Fed needs to seriously consider tapering its asset purchases to avoid an unnecessary overshoot on inflation,” The economy has become more resilient through outbreaks. That ups the risk of a misstep and the need for the Fed to extinguish unwanted inflation, something it has not had to do in decades. 
The dollar has been raking up gains after bottoming in May, but there are some signs that investors are pausing their bullish bets on the greenback.
Speculators' net long positions on the dollar were cut in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose sharply on Friday, boosted by a strong U.S. jobs report toward its biggest weekly gain in seven weeks.
The report showed jobs grew more than expected in July, pushing bond yields higher on the view that the Federal Reserve may act more quickly to tighten U.S. monetary policy.
The dollar index against major currencies was up nearly 0.6% at 92.776 at 3:06 p.m. ET (1906 GMT).
Against the safe havens of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, the dollar had its biggest daily gains since June, reflecting a risk-on tone as well as the appeal of higher U.S. interest rates. 
The report on U.S. nonfarm payrolls showed jobs increased by 943,000 in July compared with the 870,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The news rekindled dollar momentum, grounded in the middle of the week by statements from Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida suggesting that conditions for hiking interest rates might be met as soon as late 2022.
Fed officials have said that improving employment is critical to when they begin to pull back further on extra support they provided for the economy during the pandemic.
Clarida's remarks lifted Treasury yields after five weeks of declines, while ""real"" yields, excluding inflation, are set to snap a six-week streak of declines. 
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched 1.3%, up from 1.18% on Monday.
The greenback rose 0.9% against the Swiss franc and 0.4% on the Japanese yen, which traded at 110.215 to the dollar.
The euro fell 0.6% to $1.1759, pressured early in the session by weaker than expected German industrial orders data. 
The British pound fell nearly 0.4% to $1.3878.
In contrast to the U.S. payroll report, in Canada a domestic employment report showed far fewer jobs added in July than expected. The greenback rose 0.4% to 1.2555 Canadian dollars. 
Analysts have cautioned it will take more evidence than one jobs report to push U.S. yields significantly higher again. Friday's yield remained nearly one-half a percentage point lower than at the end of March. 
Reactions to monthly jobs reports have changed often this year in days following release of the data, strategists at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities found when they looked at the 10-year Treasury yield. 
Markets will next be watching for comments from Fed policymakers at the symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming late this month.
Big moves across exchange rates are unlikely until Fed officials signal readiness to lead other central banks in pulling back economic support, said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at fxstreet.com.
""The Fed is pumping far more money into the U.S. economy and, by diffusion, to the rest of the world than anybody else,"" Trevisani said.
When Fed policy makers are confident in U.S. employment gains to raise interest rates, the global economy could be strong enough to bolster riskier currencies instead of the dollar. 
A recent Reuters poll of strategists showed most predicting a dollar fall over the next year.

""We're in the phase in the business cycle where growth and global trade are going to remain relatively solid, and that's going to provide some downside bias for the dollar,"" said Vasilieos Gkionakis, global head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier Group.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia in the run-up to the latest U.S. jobs report. The data could see the U.S. tighten its monetary policy earlier than Europe and Japan, where the prospect still remains distant.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.12% to 92.362 by 12:41 AM ET (4:41 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 109.84.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.7387 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.7046.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.4646.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.3920. The Bank of England (BOE) kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.10%, with other policy settings also remaining unchanged, as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday. The BOE did, however, outline a plan towards asset tapering and interest rate hikes in the years to come.
The Reserve Bank of India also handed down its policy decision earlier in the day.
U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida's comments earlier in the week, where he said conditions for an interest rate hike could be met in late 2022, led to a sharper focus on the labor market’s recovery from COVID-19 and the U.S. jobs report, due later in the day.
""It certainly feels this is a big jobs report that carries real meaning,"" both for the economy and rates, Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
Should the number exceed a million, it could send the dollar and U.S. yields sharply higher, while a number under 650,000 could rattle nerves, though perhaps not the dollar if it benefits from investors' risk-aversion, he added.
Investors also digested a mixed back of U.S. economic data released earlier in the week. The data, released on Wednesday, said the ADP non-farm employment change was at 330,000 in July, the services purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 59.9, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing employment was at 53.8 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI was at 64.1.
However, investors cheered a drop in U.S. initial jobless claims, with 385,000 claims submitted during the past week.
Although the riskier Antipodean currencies retreated as the greenback strengthened, the New Zealand dollar was poised to be the best performing G10 currency as the week ends. Expectation is also growing that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hike interest rates at its next meeting on Aug. 18.
Its Australian counterpart was stuck in a range, however. Even a record trade surplus nor a surprisingly hawkish tone from the Reserve Bank of Australia as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the week were enough to pull it out."

Investing.com – The pound jumped against the dollar Thursday, after the Bank of England left interest rates steady, but signaled its warming up to the idea of tightening monetary policy as the central bank reined in its threshold to begin the tapering of bonds purchases.
GBP/USD rose 0.30% to $1.3927.
The Bank of England kept rates unchanged at 0.1%, and its monthly bond purchases steady at £895 billion. In a sign of the appetite to tightened policy earlier than expected, however, the members of the central bank’s monetary policy committee voted 7 to 1 voted to keep asset purchases steady until its benchmark rate reaches 0.5%. The central previously said it wouldn’t reverse quantitative easing until the rate reached 1.5%.
 “Talking about the mechanics of tightening policy, that is another signal that tightening is drawing nearer,’ Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said, according to the Financial Times.
But despite the change in strategy, the bank isn’t likely to aggressively hike rates.  
“In part, the change in strategy reflects the fact that negative rates are now considered part of the tool kit for the future. But it also underscores that Bank Rate simply isn't expected to rise back to that previous threshold of 1.5% for the foreseeable future,” Daiwa Capital Markets said"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar took a breather on Thursday, a day after being given a boost from seemingly hawkish comments by a top Federal Reserve official, as the market awaited new direction from Friday's U.S. jobs report.
The dollar index against major currencies was down 0.03% to 92.249 in the afternoon in New York.
On Wednesday, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said conditions for an interest rate hike could be met in late 2022, setting the stage for a move in early 2023.
""Clarida’s comments are allowing the dollar to stay well supported into the payrolls numbers on Friday,"" said ING FX strategists Francesco Pesole and Chris Turner. 
The greenback, which gained 0.2% on Wednesday, was traded in a relatively tight range through the day, unmoved by new government reports on jobless claims and the trade deficit that came in close to estimates from economists.
It also shrugged off another up-day in U.S. stocks and movement in the U.S. Treasury market, where the yield on the 10-year note rose as much as 4 basis points and was last at 1.2152%.
""The market has been in a wait-and-see mode until we get past tomorrow's nonfarm payroll report,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at broker OANDA. 
Friday's employment report for U.S. employment in July is seen as highly uncertain but critical to Fed policymakers deciding when to begin tapering support for the economy.
""If we get an impressive read tomorrow, that would have the market firmly pricing in tapering and allow the yield curve to steepen and provide the dollar with support,"" Moya said.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 880,000 jobs in July, up from 850,000 in June. Economists have warned that the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and mixed readings from labor market indicators make estimates for July troublesome.
The British pound was up 0.3% to $1.3931 by 3:06 p.m. ET (1906 GMT) after the Bank of England kept the size of its bond-buying programme unchanged and held its benchmark interest rate at a historic low of 0.1%. 
The central bank said it would start reducing its stock of bonds when its policy rate reaches 0.5% by not reinvesting proceeds and that it would consider actively selling down holdings when the rate reaches at least 1%.
""The undertones of today’s policy statement and monetary policy report (MPR) are much more hawkish than initially expected,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX analyst at Monex Europe.
The euro was flat at $1.1835. 
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.25% to 109.75. 

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 3% to $2,810 after an initial dip when the Ethereum blockchain network activated a technical change that was to take some tokens out of circulation.
Bitcoin rose 3% to $40,987.

94,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Three days was all it took to wipe out about half the Turkish lira’s gains since June.
The decline was compounded by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s latest call for lower interest rates, about a week before the central bank’s next policy meeting. It sent the lira tumbling to as low as 8.5719 against the dollar, down more than 3% from a two-month high touched on Tuesday.
The rapid reversal underscores how fragile investor sentiment remains, where the risk of unwarranted monetary easing threatens to stoke inflation and bruise traders lured by the currency’s juicy yield. Options traders now see a 54% probability that the lira will weaken to 9.5 per dollar at the end of the year, which would eclipse the record low of 8.8008 reached in early June.
“It’s not today’s move, but that period of strength, which was the aberration,” said Tatha Ghose, a senior emerging-market economist at Commerzbank AG in London, who expects the currency to slide to 10 per dollar by year-end.
Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu has so far looked past the president’s calls for looser policy and held benchmark rates unchanged at 19% since March. While that’s among the highest rates in the developing world, it’s done little to cool inflation which is running at the fastest pace in more than two years.
Now, with Erdogan’s ratings hurt by a limping economy and the government grappling with mounting criticism over its flailing response to Turkey’s worst wildfires in decades, the pressure to cut interest rates on Aug. 12 is growing.
For its part, the central bank has promised to keep policy rates above actual and forecast inflation. Data this week showed consumer prices accelerated to 18.95% in July, just shy of the the one-week repo rate, in principle reducing the likelihood of a summer interest-rate cut sought by the president.
“I don’t think the central bank will be in a position to cut rates next week. If anything at this stage, the central bank will be looking for credibility,” said Saed Abukarsh, chief investment officer at Ark Capital Management in Dubai, who expects the lira to trade within a range of 8.20 to 8.90 against the dollar for now.
Still, for investors and savers who have seen their returns practically wiped out by rampant price growth, Erdogan’s latest interjections have raised the prospect of more political meddling in monetary policy. He fired three previous central bank governors, spurring an exodus of capital that has weighed heavily on the lira of the years.
‘Ongoing Weakness’
The central bank “has been far more disciplined than everybody feared, though it’s the inflation data that is handcuffing them,” said Edwin Gutierrez, the head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management in London, adding that it will probably relent to the president’s demands before year-end, even if not right away.
Last week, the central bank raised its year-end inflation forecast, but projected a significant drop in price growth in the final quarter that could open a window for the interest-rate cut later in the year.
The currency is down more than 12% against the dollar since December, the worst performance in emerging markets after Argentine’s peso.
“The orthodox policy move for the central bank in a period of rising inflation would be to raise rates,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “Unfortunately, this hasn’t always occurred in Turkey, with the resulting and probably expected outcome of ongoing weakness in the lira.”

TORONTO (Reuters) - Forecasts for the Canadian dollar were raised in the latest Reuters poll as analysts expect the Bank of Canada to begin interest rate hikes before the Federal Reserve, alongside a high rate of COVID-19 vaccinations, to support the domestic economy.
The median forecast of more than 30 strategists in an Aug. 2-4 Reuters poll was for the Canadian dollar to strengthen around 2.4% in three months to 1.2250 per U.S. dollar, or 81.63 U.S. cents.
The unit, nicknamed the loonie, was then expected to rise further to 1.21 in a year's time, compared with a forecast of 1.22 in July's poll.
""We look for the loonie to rise a bit over the coming year,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""The BoC will likely be beginning to prep markets for its first rate hike at about this time next year, while the Fed will be trailing behind.""
Canada's central bank last month cut its weekly net purchases of Canadian government bonds to a target of C$2 billion from C$3 billion and maintained guidance for the first rate hike to come as soon as the second half of 2022.
The Fed's latest guidance for liftoff is 2023.
The Canadian dollar has gained more than 1.5% this year, lagging only the British pound among G10 currencies. In June, the loonie notched a six-year high near 1.20.
Improvement in Canada's current account balance has added to the positive outlook for the loonie, with foreign exchange flows moving more in favor of the currency, Anderson said.
Canada posted its first quarterly current account surplus since 2008 at the start of the year as prices rose for some major exports, including oil.
Oil touched a near seven-year high around $77 a barrel in July but has since been pressured by a more uncertain outlook for demand as the Delta variant of the coronavirus spreads in some major economies, including the United States.

The variant has reached Canada but a high rate of inoculation could reduce the risk of wide-ranging economic restrictions. About 72% of Canada's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine and 60% has been fully vaccinated, a Reuters tally shows.
Canada is ""a clear leader on the vaccine front,"" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), adding this could raise Canada's growth prospects compared with the United States, boosting the Canadian dollar.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The Czech crown and the Hungarian forint will extend gains in the coming year as their central banks hike rates to curb inflation during the post-pandemic economic recovery, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Analysts expect the crown to continue firming, reaching 25.04 to the euro in the next 12 months, a 1.6% rise from Wednesday's levels, according to the median forecast in the poll.
The Czech National Bank is expected to deliver a 25 basis point rate hike to 0.75% later on Thursday after a similar increase in June.
The poll forecast Hungary's forint would rise 1.35% to 350 to the euro in the next 12 months with the central bank pledging ""firm steps"" on a monthly basis to rein in inflation ""as quickly as possible"". 
The bank raised its key base by 30 basis points in both June and July, taking it to 1.2%. Its next policy meeting is on Aug. 24.
Piotr Poplawski at ING Bank said he expected moderate gains across central and east European currencies in coming months, with the Polish Zloty a likely underperformer as interest rates in Poland are the lowest in the region and comments from the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suggest a tightening cycle will only start in the fourth quarter.
""In short CZK should be a top performer, given a relatively traditional MPC stance, HUF should be in the middle, while PLN should lag them,"" he said.
Central European economies are fast recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) data on Monday showed manufacturing activity expanded strongly in July even though supply chain problems have held back output.
The recovery has brought a jump in inflation across the region - including to an annual 5.3% in Hungary in June, the highest in nearly a decade.
""As market expectations adjust to the new hawk in the region, we remain short PLN/HUF as policy divergence should become more stark,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note to clients.
""By the time the (Polish central bank) hikes by 25 bps, as priced by the market, the policy rate in Hungary is expected to be closer to 2%,"" they added.
The Polish central bank has so far maintained a dovish stance, with Governor Adam Glapinski saying it will not rush to hike rates.

The zloty, which has underperformed its peers so far this year, is forecast to rise 2.6% to 4.43 per euro in the next 12 months, in line with the previous forecast.
Romania's leu is expected to weaken 1.3% to 4.98 per euro.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trading Thursday, after hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve prompted traders to price in an earlier tightening of monetary policy.
At 1:55 AM ET (0555 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.302, pulling away from the one month low of 91.775 seen last week.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 109.66, EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1839, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7397, boosted by Australian trade data released earlier in the day which saw exports rising 4% month-on-month in June.
The dollar has been in a state of flux over the last couple of months, first rising after the June meeting of the Federal Reserve saw several members bring forward their timetable for interest rate hikes before slipping back after Chairman Jerome Powell stated last week that interest rate increases were still in the distance.
The currency took another turn after Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, usually seen as something of a dove, said Wednesday that conditions for an interest rate hike could be met in late 2022, setting the stage for a move in early 2023. Alongside three of his colleagues, Clarida also hinted that asset tapering could begin later in 2021 or early 2022.
Muddying the waters were mixed economic data Wednesday, with a surprisingly weak ADP report on private employment contrasting with the strongest ever reading for the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing PMI.
Still, it’s the labor market that traders are focusing on, with Fed members making it clear that improvement is needed there before any moves. 
Thursday sees the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with analysts looking for a figure of 384,000, a gradual improvement from the previous week.
However, it’s Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release which is attracting the most attention. The median forecast is for 870,000 jobs, but there is a broad range of estimates given the potential impact of the spread of the delta Covid-19 variant on the labor market.
“The outcome will have a significant impact on how the U.S. dollar trades for the next few weeks leading into the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole summit,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management. “If the data is good, the U.S. dollar will soar on the prospect of a taper announcement later this month. However, if payrolls disappoints, the U.S. dollar will slide as investors push their expectations for taper to September or later.” 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3893 ahead of the latest policy-setting meeting of the Bank of England later Thursday. The central bank could move a step closer to tightening monetary policy while raising its growth and inflation forecasts. 
“We believe that the BoE will grow more optimistic and less dovish, but policy-makers as a group will be divided on immediate tapering. At least one – and likely two – policy-makers will vote for tightening. If there are more than two, we could see a sharply positive reaction in sterling,” Lien added.
USD/BRL rose marginally to 5.1700 the day after Brazil’s central bank lifted its benchmark Selic interest rate by a full percentage point to 5.25% in order to fight heightened inflation levels."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, as hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve increased bets on earlier-than-expected asset tapering and boosted the dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 92.297 by 12:33 AM ET (4:33 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.19% to 109.67, with the dollar pulling itself up from Wednesday’s low of 108.71.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.7394 Australian trade data released earlier in the day said that exports rose 4% month-on-month in June, with imports growing 1% month-on-month and the trade balance at AUD10.496 billion. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7054.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.4639 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3891.
Also giving the U.S. currency a boost was Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who said on Wednesday that the conditions for an interest rate hike could be met in late 2022, with a move following in early 2023. Alongside three of his colleagues, Clarida also hinted that asset tapering could begin later in 2021 or early 2022.
However, this is dependent on progress in the labor market’s recovery from COVID-19, which will be gauged in Friday’s U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls.
""It is reflective of a hawkish drift among the committee about the risks of more persistent inflation, and what that might mean for achieving the Fed's new inflation framework... this is all to say that the stakes for Friday's payrolls, and subsequent payrolls, are sky-high,"" NatWest Markets analyst Brian Daingerfield told Reuters.
Making predictions on the jobs report difficult is the continuous spread of COVID-19 cases globally, the resultant labor bottlenecks, and Wednesday’s U.S. economic slowdown data.
The ADP nonfarm employment change was at 330,000 in July, lower than expected. The services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 59.9, while the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing employment was at 53.8 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI was at 64.1.
Clarida’s comments led investors to price in slightly more chance of a hike between late 2022 and early 2022 and flattened the Treasury yield curve as short-term yields rose.
Should the Fed follow the timetable set by Clarida, it is set to begin asset tapering even earlier than the European Central Bank, which is still working to get inflation towards its target.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England is also moving closer towards asset tapering and could potentially reveal the timetable as it hands down its policy decision later in the day. The Reserve Bank of India will hand down its own policy decision on Friday.
However, the central bank that could beat everyone to the asset tapering post is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which is widely expected to hike rates at its next policy meeting on Aug. 18."

JOHANNESBURG/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Short-term volatility in emerging markets currencies will linger as the jury is still out on the timing of U.S. stimulus tapering and as investors support currencies with greater potential for strength, a Reuters poll found.
In an Aug. 2-4 survey, the outlook for emerging market currencies was mixed against a range-bound dollar, depending on which central bank has begun raising interest rates or has potential for hikes.
The South African rand was expected to weaken about 1% to 14.4/$ in six months while the Brazilian real was forecast to gain 2% to 5.1/$ and the Russian rouble to make 1.2% gains to 72.0/$ in the same time frame.
""On a tactical basis, recent weeks have made clear that the currencies of high-carry hikers...have been able to weather hawkish shocks from the U.S., as long as monetary policy support continues,"" noted Zach Pandl, co-head of foreign exchange strategy for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Brazil's central bank has positioned itself as a high yield choice after delivering interest rate hikes, and raised the spectre of further increases ahead.
""Overall, the combination of deep value, high carry, and continued support from a rapid hiking cycle may mean that the real can outperform its typical 'betas' during bouts of risk-off price action this summer,"" Pandl added.

When asked what would be the top driver of EMFX in the next three months, 37 of 59 respondents said monetary policy developments and 18 said the spread of new variants of the coronavirus.
South Africa's interest rate hiking cycle is expected to kick off in early 2022, a little later than other central banks like Russia, which raised rates by 100 basis points to 6.5% last month with more hikes expected.

For low yielders like the Korean won and Thai baht, gains are expected in the short-term and over 4% each in 12 months, a sign of favor for less risky currencies.
Investors turned bearish on the Chinese yuan for the first time since April as China's regulatory crackdown on private sector firms sent jitters through markets.
The yuan, which posted a second month of losses in July, was predicted to trade in a tight range in 12 months as a slowing economic recovery and worries over growing domestic COVID-19 cases hurt the tightly-controlled currency.
""The Politburo is now suggesting China will be 'setting its own agenda' on economic policy going forward, which implies that even if the U.S. moves towards tapering and rate hikes, Beijing will stick with further easing in both fiscal and monetary policy - and channeled specifically to the sectors it wants,"" said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank.
""That is likely to mean a major increase in downward pressure on CNY going forward – which may then trigger a policy response on trade from the White House, if recent history is any guide.""
The Turkish lira, which has been the worst-performing EM currency so far in 2021 after President Tayyip Erdogan's interference in monetary policy and his sacking of a hawkish governor earlier this year, is set to fall another 11% to 9.4/$ in the next 12 months.

India's rupee, which dropped to its lowest level in three months last in July, was expected to depreciate 1.3% to 75.1/$ in a year.
""We expect most EM currencies to fall against the dollar, especially those of economies which are dependent on commodity exports and/or have weak balance sheets that leave them vulnerable to higher Treasury yields,"" said Jonathan Petersen, markets economist at Capital Economics.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - After a recent spill, the dollar looks a bit rudderless, waiting for direction on U.S. monetary policy, according to foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters who predicted the currency will have ceded more ground 12 months from now.
Having fallen from a 15-week high set a fortnight ago, the dollar is still up over 2% for the year, although that gain is expected to be erased within 12 months.
""The base presumption is...fairly rangebound from here, but it entirely depends on what we see happening in terms of fiscal or monetary policy,"" said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank. ""This is where FX forecasting becomes something of a joke: you're forecasting one thing based on another thing."" 
At its July meeting, the Fed offered no clear path on when it would begin to taper its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases. Markets are looking to the annual meeting at Jackson Hole that the Fed will host later this month for any hints. 
The Aug 2-4 poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists showed expectations for the dollar to weaken against most major currencies in 12 months, a broad view they have held for over a year.
When asked how confident they were in that weaker dollar outlook, a strong majority of 39 of 62 - over 60% - said they were not confident or not at all confident. The remaining 23 said they were either confident or very confident.
Over 55% of forecasters, 36 of 63, who answered an additional question said volatility in currency markets over the next three months would increase. Twenty-three said it would stay the same and only four said it would decrease. 
Reuters poll graphic on major currency market outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/jnvwegrqlvw/FX%20August%202021%20(1).png 
The dollar has followed no particular pattern in recent months, from tracking higher U.S. Treasury yields to attracting safe-haven flows, wrong-footing speculators who had placed large bets against the currency.
While the latest positioning data showed net dollar longs rising to their highest level since early March 2020, the currency is down about 1% from last Monday.
""The dollar on the whole has been disappointing. Most people started the year expecting dollar weakness as we did. It is up a bit for the year, but not enormously higher - the market has been driven up by the sort of hard-to-price uncertainty related to COVID variants,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""The dollar strength we're seeing is largely safe-haven,"" he added, referring to its broad resilience.
Other safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, which have underperformed for the year, were up 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively, last month.

GBP/USD and USD/CHF: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/akvezgydjpr/Major%20graphics%20for%20fx%20poll.PNG 
In the meantime, Fed policymakers have been giving mixed signals on the timing of the taper, or winding down of its monetary stimulus program. 
""The Fed didn't give any indication they're going to taper recently but a few people in the Fed are saying they are,"" said Rabobank's Every. ""So, which one is the real voice? Which one is the actual Fed speaking?""
Analysts appeared split not just on the timing of the taper but what that would do to the dollar.
""As long as they (the Fed) don't see inflation priced into labor markets and elements of wage price cycles, they're going to treat it as transitory. So all of that is risk positive and dollar negative,"" said Standard Chartered's Englander.

Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, had a different view.
""We think the Fed is getting closer to announcing tapering. For example, yesterday, one of the FOMC team members called for more rapid tapering...that kind of prospect of the Fed tightening should benefit the dollar,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held gains on Wednesday after a quick recovery from an earlier fall as markets chose to focus on a suggestion from a top U.S. Federal Reserve official that the central bank may reduce support for the improving economy more quickly than widely thought.
The bullish comments on the U.S. economy, by Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, triggered a rebound in U.S. Treasury yields and turned market attention away from the release two hours earlier of an unexpectedly weak private employment report that had driven the dollar down.
The dollar swung from being down 0.3% for the day to up 0.3%on the opposing clues on whether the United States will see strong economic growth and higher interest rates or a serious drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
The ADP National Employment Report was seen as possibly foreshadowing softness in July jobs data due on Friday. But there were doubts about its value as a predictor and another report showed U.S. service industry activity jumping to a record high in July. 
The currency markets have been expecting Friday's non-farm payrolls report to be the next big catalyst for exchange rates, followed by comments expected at a symposium of central bankers at the end of this month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
In the afternoon in New York, the dollar index against major currencies was up 0.2% to 92.246.
The Japanese yen, often seen as a competing safe haven, was a big beneficiary of the dollar's initial fall on the ADP report and gained to 108.77 per dollar, but couldn't hold its break below 109. The dollar was last trading at 109.45 yen, up 0.4%.
The euro and British pound also swung against the greenback. The euro was last trading at $1.1840, off 0.2% for the day. Sterling was down 0.2% to $1.3889. 
The initial downdraft came when the ADP report showed U.S. private payrolls increased about half as much as economists had expected, likely constrained by shortages of workers and raw materials.
""It was a fairly big disappointment,"" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities.
The ADP report has a mixed record of predicting the government report, Issa said, but added, ""the miss is substantial enough that the markets may be a little bit more nervous going into Friday's report.""
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other policy makers have recently emphasized that upcoming employment reports will be critical to the board's decisions about when and how to cut back on support for the economy.
Fed policy maker Robert Kaplan told Reuters on Wednesday that more ""progress"" in the July and August jobs reports would be reason to start pulling back on bond purchases ""soon."" 
The dollar has lost value in recent weeks as declining yields made strategists question whether the U.S. economy will grow as much as they had expected in light of the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose 7% to $2,690 ahead of an upcoming change in the Ethereum blockchain network that will take some tokens out of circulation.

The lira’s best month this year may only serve to highlight the volatility that still haunts Turkish assets.
For JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s top executive in Turkey, swings in the currency remain a key hurdle to convincing investors to buy into the appeal of local securities.
Markets are also on alert for how price growth, already at a two-year high, performs in the months ahead, Mustafa Bagriacik, senior country officer for Turkey and Azerbaijan for the U.S. lender, said in an interview.
“The predictability of inflation and the currency are the two most important things to increase appetite for lira-based assets,” he said. “If you can fix those, the rest will follow.”
The lira rose 3% against the dollar in July, bolstered by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish tilt and as concerns over a premature interest-rate cut in Turkey faded. That’s the best performance across emerging markets, and a stark turnaround for a currency that tumbled to a record low earlier this year.
Still, at more than 14%, the lira’s implied volatility over the next three months remains among the world’s highest, undermining the currency’s yield appeal. It’s also deterring capital inflows, according to Bagriacik, which the economy needs to finance its current-account shortfall.
Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu has kept the policy rate unchanged at 19% since he was appointed in March, looking past President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s calls for looser policy. And it means the lira now boasts one of the highest nominal rates in the developing world.
Yet foreign investors spooked by the market rout that followed his predecessor’s ouster have pulled a net a $472 million out of the local-currency bond market since then, a sharp unwind that’s seen cumulative inflows into the securities top $1.3 billion this year.
‘Signficant Funding’
“When you look at comparable countries/regions like Russia, South Africa, MENA, they are getting significant funding from the global markets that obviously helps their growth,” Bagriacik said.
Inflation meanwhile has risen almost every month this year. Higher energy costs and the impact of a reopening economy on everything from food to apparels drove the pace of price gains to an annual 18.95% in July, nearly reaching the level of the central bank’s benchmark interest rate.
The central bank raised its year-end inflation forecast to 14.1% from 12.2% last week. Less than two years ago, annual inflation was briefly below 9%.
The bearish sentiment is also evident in the market for so-called risk reversals, where the premium investors pay for options to sell the currency over those to buy it stands at more than 6%. That’s more than double the rate on the Russian ruble, the closest runner up.
“In Turkey, inflation is something that everybody’s worried about at the moment,” Bagriacik said. “For the next couple of months, markets will be looking at the trend of inflation for the rest of the year, and most importantly for 2022 guidance.”
Other highlights from the interview are as follows:

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Wednesday, remaining near recent lows ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data which could guide monetary policy thinking at the Federal Reserve.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 91.990, just above last week’s low of 91.775, the weakest since June 28.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.10, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.3931, EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1871, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7404.
The dollar has struggled to make any headway since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week that interest rate increases were still in the distance, stating that more progress was still needed, particularly in the labor market.
With improvements in the employment numbers seen as a precondition for raising rates, traders will be watching closely the release at the ADP payrolls report, due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), for guidance.
Analysts are looking for 695,000 private sector jobs to have been added last month, marginally better than the previous month, ahead of Thursday’s initial jobless claims and then Friday's key nonfarm payrolls.
A U.S. services survey will also be watched for a guide of the state of the economic recovery, as well as a speech from Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD rose 0.6% to 0.7055 after New Zealand’s unemployment rate fell more than forecast in the second quarter, increasing the likelihood of interest rate hikes in the near future.
The jobless rate fell to 4% from a revised 4.6% in the first quarter. This, adding to the annual inflation rate surging to 3.3% in the second quarter, suggests the country’s central bank could start to raise interest rates as soon as this month.
USD/BRL rose marginally to 5.1975 ahead of the latest policy-setting meeting of Brazil’s central bank. In June, the central bank lifted its benchmark Selic interest rate by 75 basis points to 4.25%, its third consecutive hike, in order to fight inflation, which was running substantially above target. Analysts expect a full one percentage point hike in the Selic this week.

Investing.com – The dollar was down, remaining near recent lows on Wednesday morning in Asia. Better-than-expected employment data in New Zealand raised expectations for interest rate hikes, while U.S. jobs data due throughout the week could indicate the U.S. Federal Reserve’s timetable for the same.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 92.017 by 1:38 AM ET (5:38 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 109.06, with the Japanese services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for July at 47.4.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7399 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.54% to 0.7052. In New Zealand, the employment change grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021, while the unemployment rate was at a lower-than-expected 4%.
""We've flown past full employment, and the economy is becoming quite overheated,"" ANZ analysts told Reuters, who expect 25 basis point interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in August, October, November, February and May to carry New Zealand dollar rates from 0.25% currently to 1.5% by mid-2022.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.15% to 6.4605. China's private sector Caixin services PMI, released earlier in the day, was 54.9 in July, higher than the 50.3 figure from the previous month.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.3926.
In the U.S., ADP non-farm employment change for July, the Markit composite manufacturing PMI, the services PMI and the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing PMI are due later in the day. The latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is also due on Friday.
The data could help investors gauge the Fed’s timeline for both interest rate hikes and asset tapering. However, the dollar has now slipped more than 1% from a 15-week peak it hit a fortnight ago as investors question the strength and speed of the global economic recovery.
""The big dollar picture is that there is a pullback in Fed hike expectations, and we've seen the U.S. dollar head south,” with the focus now on the rates implications of jobs data, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
""We've all seen progress in the labor market, but the question is how much is good enough,"" he added. However, reaching the Fed’s target for this growth could take several consecutive months.
Safe-haven currencies have benefited from the weaker dollar as concerns about the number of COVID-19 cases globally remain. The Japanese yen has gained about 2.5% against the dollar in a month and touching its highest since late May during the previous session after falling since the start of 2021.
Another focal point for investors is the Bank of England’s policy decision, due to be handed down on Thursday. Swaps markets are already pricing an interest rate liftoff around June 2022.
""If the BOE communicates a more cautious outlook, then we could see hike bets by June 2022 pushed back, putting some pressure on sterling,"" Pepperstone research strategist at brokerage Luke Suddards told Reuters."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar steadied on Tuesday, after having lost value against the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, as questions about slowing U.S. economic growth and the COVID-19 Delta variant challenged risk appetite.
The U.S. dollar dipped below 109 yen, and for a second day gave up as much as 0.4% before recovering half of the day's loss to 109.1 yen. 
It traded against the Swiss franc as much as 0.3% lower and leveled off with a 0.1% decline for the day. The franc also gained against the euro to its greatest value in nine months.
""The Swiss franc and the yen are benefiting as rising coronavirus cases cloud the outlook for growth,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market strategist at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
But the moves to the safe haven franc and yen also came alongside reminders that currencies are sensitive to talk from central bankers about pulling back on bond purchases and eventually raising rates as their economies come out of the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Relatively hawkish comments by central bank officials in Australia and New Zealand on Tuesday led the Australian dollar and the Kiwi dollar to big gains among major currencies.
The index that measures the dollar's strength against a basket of peers was up by a hair to 92.046 at 1902 GMT after declining slightly on Monday.
Last week the dollar lost nearly 1% as U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers said they expected it would still be while before job growth allowed them to pull back on support for the economy.
Strategists have said they do not expect major moves in the dollar before Friday's U.S. jobs report and maybe not until Fed officials speak at the end of August at a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The euro was a touch lower at $1.1865, having lost momentum after hitting a one-month high of $1.1909 on Friday. The British pound gained 0.2% to $1.3915.
On Thursday the Bank of England will meet and could send hawkish signals on its policies amid optimism about the British economy.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped again early on Tuesday before coming back in the afternoon in New York to near Monday's level of 1.179%. The 10-year yield has been trending generally downward since the end of March.
Market watchers have pointed to the decline in the 10-year yield as a sign of coming disappointment in economic growth, especially with the rise of the Delta variant of COVID-19.

""What's keeping the dollar from really benefiting from the flight to safety is that Treasury yields continue to grind lower,"" Manimbo said.
In the United States, COVID-19 hospital admissions in Louisiana and Florida have hit a new peak though top U.S. health expert Anthony Fauci has ruled out another lockdown in the country.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged lower Tuesday in tight trading ranges, with traders reluctant to take strong positions ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data at the end of the week.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 92.028.
USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 109.14, near to the mid-July low of 109.07, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.3891 and EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1875.
The dollar has trended lower since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week that interest rate increases were still a long way away, falling to a low of 91.775 on Friday, the weakest since June 28.
An Institute for Supply Management report on Monday showed July U.S. manufacturing growth slowed for the second straight month, a release that played into Powell’s belief that more economic progress was needed before the central bank started tapering its huge bond-buying program.
Economic data later Tuesday centers around June factory orders, which are forecast to grow 1.0% on the month, slowing from 1.7% growth the previous month. 
But all eyes will be on Friday’s official jobs report which will provide some indications of how sustained the U.S. recovery has been in July. Economists are looking for an increase of 900,000 jobs, which would be the biggest increase for 11 months.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7399 after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised the market by keeping to its plan to taper its bond purchases even with Covid-related lockdowns in a number of cities likely to derail the country’s economic recovery.
Many traders had expected the central bank to reverse its tapering plan given the new wave of Covid-19 cases, but this move shows an underlying confidence that the economy will bounce back quickly once restrictions are removed.
USD/TRY rose 0.3% to 8.3680 ahead of the release of the latest Turkish inflation data, which could influence the interest rate decisions of the central bank.
Inflation is likely to climb to an annual 18.6% in July, up from 17.5% in June, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg, which would likely reduce the chances of an interest-rate cut in the near future.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, recording losses against the safe-haven Japanese yen. Concerns over the most recent COVID-19 outbreaks globally, as well as U.S. manufacturing data released on Monday, led investors to wind back bets on a strong economic recovery from the virus.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 92.043 by 12:14 AM ET (4:14 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.07% to 109.20, the lowest level since late May 2021.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7368 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.37% to 0.6994.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4656 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3897.
""The market is moderately risk-off with bond yields falling off a bit since European trade yesterday. There is some caution as the Delta variant of COVID-19 is spreading in many places, even in China,"" Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
The world’s second-largest economy is scrambling to curb its latest COVID-19 outbreak, which is spreading from the coast to inland cities. Other countries in the region, some of which had initial success at curbing the virus, have been struggling to contain their own outbreaks. Japan extended a state of emergency, currently covering Tokyo and Okinawa, to Osaka, Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures on Monday.
The state of emergency, effective through Aug. 31, comes as the number of daily cases in Tokyo hit a record.
In Australia, Brisbane extended a lockdown on Monday while the military began patrols in Sydney to enforce the city’s restrictive measures.
The Reserve Bank of Australia will also hand down its policy decision later in the day, in which the central bank is widely expected to reverse an earlier decision to begin asset tapering. Across the Tasman Sea, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it would begin consultations to tighten mortgage lending standards amid an inflated housing market.
The Delta variant, described as contagious as chickenpox and far more contagious than the common cold or flu by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier in the week, also contributed to rising numbers of cases in the U.S.
COVID-19 concerns overrode the progress on the U.S.’ $1 trillion infrastructure investment bill that could be ready for a final vote within the week.
Meanwhile, data released on Monday said the U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was a better-than-expected 63.4 in July, while the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing PMI was a lower-than-expected 59.5. The ISM manufacturing employment index was a better-than-expected 52.9 in July.
""From a historic perspective, a 59.5 manufacturing ISM reading is still a very robust activity reading. Nevertheless, reaction to the data release by the U.S. Treasuries market suggests the market is concerned over 'peak growth' and the potential for more slowdown ahead,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar eased slightly on Monday as markets assessed how tightly to embrace risk following dovish statements from Federal Reserve policy makers last week and mixed economic data. 
The dollar index =USD, which measures the currency against six major peers, was down less than 0.1% at 92.05 in the afternoon in New York after having been down about 0.2% on the day. 
The index last week dropped 0.9%, the dollar's worst week since early May, as it turned away from the previous week's 3-1/2-month high when traders were positioning for a speedy start of Fed tapering of support for the economy. 
""The U.S. dollar has begun August with a heavier tone as risk appetites rebuild,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in a note to clients. 
But the additional risk appetite in the dollar seemed satisfied after U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell and stocks lost momentum after a report in the morning that U.S. manufacturing activity grew in July, but at a slower pace. (Full Story) (Full Story) (Full Story) 
U.S. Treasury bond yields fell to 1.18% on Monday afternoon from 1.226% on Friday and real yields - adjusted for inflation - reached record lows US10YT=RR, US10YTIP=RR. 
The U.S. manufacturing report reinforced the idea that growth may have peaked. 
The euro was up less than 0.1% on the day at $1.187 EUR=EBS. It showed little reaction to a Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reading of July manufacturing that had been seen as a possible mover. (Full Story) 
The British pound also little changed at $1.389, ahead of a Bank of England meeting later in the week. (Full Story) 
The recent move away from the dollar hardened after dovish comments from Fed officials indicated that lower interest rates and tapering of support for the economy will probably not come as quickly as markets had begun to expect. 
In comments last Wednesday, following a meeting of Fed policy makers, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said considerations of higher interest rates were ""a ways away."" The tone was affirmed on Friday when Fed Governor Lael Brainard said Friday ""employment has some distance to go"" to improve enough for the Fed to back away from support for the economy. (Full Story) 
Currency markets seemed ready to hold off on bigger moves ahead of the U.S. July nonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday. Another possible turning point could come at the end of this month when central bankers meet for an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed officials could use the forum to shift, or affirm, their tone. 
A dollar rally ""is unlikely to resume in force until a more hawkish Fed narrative takes hold,"" Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, said in a note. He added that he is bullish on the dollar and said he expects strong economic growth into the third quarter.

NatWest analysts said ""exit strategies"" from government and central bank support programs, as well as new lockdowns, will drive currencies in the near term. Investors will be watching this week's meetings at the Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia. 

While sterling is supported by the possibility of an early end to BOE stimulus, the Australian central bank could well backtrack on its previous decision to taper stimulus, as protracted COVID-19 lockdowns weigh on growth.

Investing.com – The dollar was flat Monday after snapping its two-week win streak last, but the data continues to show traders are positioning for more upside ahead. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.1% to 92.08.  
U.S. dollar net longs climbed in in the week ended July 27, to their highest level since early March last year, according to Reuters calculations and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The bullish bets on the greenback come as investors position for a less accommodative Federal Reserve. 
“This move in the dollar’s positioning is an indication of how markets continued to increase their bullish sentiment on the greenback, thanks to a less supportive risk environment with growing doubts about the global recovery (which prompted an unwinding of reflationary trades) and to the Fed moving closer to normalising monetary policy,” ING said in a note. 
The monthly jobs data due Friday, will take on added importance and could play a role in the Fed’s thinking on tightening monetary policy. 
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week, and pledged to keep a closer eye on progress toward its threshold to start tapering monthly bond purchases at upcoming meetings.
“Following last week's FOMC meeting, the economic data will take center stage this week – namely, Friday's July employment report. As Chair Powell noted in his post-meeting press conference last week ‘substantial further progress’ is ‘some ways away’ with the labor market still having ‘some ground to cover,’”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note. 
“While Powell confirmed that he will give a speech at Jackson Hole, the tapering markers he laid out suggest that event could be too early for a clear signal from the Chair. The September FOMC meeting is thus more likely for advance warning about tapering. With regards to the official tapering announcement, the overall messaging from that meeting was consistent with our baseline expectation for the November FOMC meeting.”"

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Monday, just above a one-month low, in tight trading ranges ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data later in the week which could influence Federal Reserve policy.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.102, just above Friday’s low of 91.775, the weakest since June 28.
USD/JPY edged lower to 109.67, GBP/USD drifted higher to 1.3905, and EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1867, even with German retail sales surprising to the upside, growing 4.2% in June. .
The dollar index dropped close to 1% last week after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated, following the central bank’s July meeting, that interest rate increases were still a long way away and more economic progress was needed, particularly in terms of jobs being created, before the central bank started tapering its huge bond-buying program.
Fed board member Lael Brainard restated the central bank's focus on further labor market progress at the weekend, while Minnesota Fed President Neal Kashkari warned that the spread of the delta variant of Covid-19 could slow the economy in the second half.
This puts Friday’s July nonfarm payrolls release firmly into focus, with economists looking for an increase of 900,000 jobs, which would be the biggest increase for 11 months, after a forecast-beating 850,000 in June.
“A strong US jobs report is anticipated, and it will support speculation that at the Jackson Hole conference at the end of August, Chair Powell will provide more guidance about the pace and composition of the Fed's bond purchases,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
Also of interest will be the meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia early Tuesday, with this central bank under pressure given the Covid-19 lockdowns currently affecting much of the country.
“The lockdown in Sydney has been extended until the end of August, and the Reserve Bank of Australia will likely abort plans to reduce its bond-buying. Instead, it will likely provide more support, probably via increased bond purchases,” Chandler added.
At 3 AM ET, AUD/USD traded marginally lower at 0.7342, with the Australian dollar having been the only major currency to fall against the U.S. dollar last week.
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4645 after China’s factory activity growth slowed sharply in July, with the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index falling to 50.3, its lowest level since April 2020.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia. The greenback opened a busy week ahead, including the latest U.S. jobs report and a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy decision, just above a one-month low.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 92.078 by 12:31 AM ET (4:31 AM GMT). The index was almost unchanged from Friday when it dipped as low as 91.775 for the first time since Jun. 28.
The USD/JPY pair held steady at 109.69.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7344. The RBA will hand down its policy decision on Tuesday when it is widely expected to reverse its previous decision to begin asset tapering. A likely contributor to RBA's change of tactic would be extended lockdowns in parts of the country, with Brisbane the latest city to extend its lockdown, originally slated to end on Tuesday, to at least Sunday. Sydney is also currently under a lockdown that will be implemented for at least nine weeks until Aug. 28.
The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.6967.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4644. China’s Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was a lower-than-expected 50.3 in July. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs for the same month, released on Saturday, were 50.4 and 53.3 respectively.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3902 ahead of the Bank of England’s policy decision, due to be handed down on Thursday.
The greenback dropped 0.88% during the previous week, its worst performance since early May 2021. U.S. Federal Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that interest rate hikes were ""a ways away"" and the job market still had ""some ground to cover” before the central bank could begin asset tapering as he handed down the Fed policy decision during the previous week.
Powell’s sentiments were echoed by Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who on Friday said, ""employment has some distance to go.""
The Fed policy decision handed down the month before, in June, boosted the dollar to its highest level since April 2021 as investors bet on asset tapering to begin as early as 2021. The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations prepared by Reuters pointed to dollar net long positions rising to their highest level since early March 2020 in the week to Jul. 27.
Investors are now turning their attention to the latest U.S. job report, including non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate, due to be released on Friday.
""The U.S. payrolls will be a marquee event risk,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""If we do see the elusive one million jobs created, then calls for a September announcement for tapering the asset-purchases program will ramp up,"" buoying the dollar, whereas a print of around 703,000 or lower would push the currency lower, the note added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Friday along with other safe haven currencies as stocks fell and as upbeat U.S. economic data helped reverse some of the losses from earlier this week when dovish remarks by the Federal Reserve tanked a month-long rally in the greenback.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.32% higher at 92.181 at 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. The index was still down 0.77% for the week, on pace for its worst weekly performance since the first week of May. 
Friday's gains for the U.S. currency came as stocks fell following a glum earnings report by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), growing concerns over the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, and in the wake of a regulatory crackdown by China on its technology and education sectors.
""We're at the end of the month and August tends to be the cruelest month for the financial markets on a seasonal basis, on a 10-year basis, it's the weakest month,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management.
""So with the Delta variant as well as the uncertainties around China, investors are getting nervous and I think they're worried about a more durable correction in stocks and so you're beginning to see the dollar catch a safe haven bid,"" she said.
Japan's yen and Norway's krone, which are also seen as safehaven currencies, were up 0.26% and 1.27% respectively.
The dollar also got a lift after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Fed should start reducing its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases this fall and cut them ""fairly rapidly"" so the program ends in the first months of 2022 to pave the way for a rate increase that year if needed. 
The greenback slumped earlier this week after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said rate increases were ""a ways away"" and the job market still had ""some ground to cover."" 
""While the dollar suffered a notable setback this week, how significant it could prove may be gleaned by nonfarm payrolls next week,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
Economic data on Friday was dollar-positive, showing a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer spending in June as COVID-19 vaccinations boosted demand for travel-related services and recreation, even though part of the increase reflected higher prices, with annual inflation accelerating further above the Fed's 2% target.
The euro eased 0.26% against the greenback but near a 1-month high after data showed the euro zone economy grew more quickly than expected in the second quarter, pulling out of a pandemic-related recession, while inflation shot past the European Central Bank's 2% target in July.
Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan had recovered all of its losses from Tuesday's plunge to trade at 6.4660 per dollar. 
Sentiment was helped by China's attempt to calm frayed investor nerves, by telling foreign brokerages not to ""over-interpret"" its latest regulatory actions. 
The Australian and New Zealand dollars, seen as riskier assets, were down on the day but remained near two-week highs.

Sterling edged 0.5% lower versus the dollar ahead of a Bank of England meeting next week.
Bitcoin fell 3%, slipping well below $40,000, a level the cryptocurrency has not closed above since mid-June.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Friday, but looks set to register a negative week after a dovish Federal Reserve meeting and some disappointing growth data. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 91.998, having earlier fallen as low as 91.855 on Thursday, a one-month low. The index is currently around 1% lower on the week, its worst weekly showing since early May, and down around 0.6% for the month. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.61, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3944, just off its highest level in a month, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1877, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7379.
The U.S. central bank stated earlier this week that progress had been made towards the levels where the policymakers would agree to tapering monthly bond purchases.
However, Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that rate increases were still a long way away and more economic progress was needed before the central bank starts withdrawing its extraordinary monetary stimulus.
“Although the FOMC made more hints at the upcoming QE tapering, the impact on the risk sentiment was limited and non-negative as the message remained cautious, and QE tapering later this year has been widely expected by the markets,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The U.S. GDP release grew 6.5% annualised in the second quarter, a solid level and an improvement from the 6.3% growth recorded in the first quarter, but this was still below the 8.5% growth expected.
Investors will be keeping an eye on the second-quarter employment cost index, personal income and spending for June and the July University of Michigan consumer sentiment index later in the day for more clues over the country’s economic recovery.
That said, the dollar could receive support if rising Covid cases in the U.S. prompt a bout of risk aversion.
The New York Times reported Friday that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has described the delta variant of the coronavirus to be as contagious as chickenpox and could cause severe illness, citing an internal CDC document.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but remained near a one-month low.  The U.S. Federal Reserve maintained a dovish stance in its latest policy decision, and disappointing U.S. economic data also curbed the U.S. currency’s month-long rally.
The U.S. Dollar that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.11% to 91.970 by 12:34 AM ET (4:34 AM GMT). It fell as low as 91.855 on Thursday, a level not seen since Jun. 29, and was set to end the week off 1%, its worst weekly showing since early May 2021. The index is also down 0.5% for the month so far after its 2.8% rally the month before.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.03% to 109.50.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7389 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7003.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.4600 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 1.3948. The pound was near its highest in over a month, boosted by the dollar’s weaker tone and a fall in daily COVID-19 cases in the U.K.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments, made as the central bank handed down its policy decision on Wednesday, set the greenback on a downward trend. Powell insisted that interest rate hikes were “a ways away” and the job market still had “some ground to cover” before asset tapering could begin.
“While the Fed continued to say it was moving towards winding back its money-printing program, the Fed’s move towards this shift looks likely to be slower than previously anticipated,”  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions currency strategist Steven Dooley told CNBC.
“The Fed’s caution is seen due to a slowdown in U.S. growth, easing in inflation and worries about the COVID-19 Delta variant,” he added.
Thursday's U.S. GDP figures for the second quarter of 2021 also failed to provide the dollar with support. Although the U.S.’s GDP grew a solid 6.5% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021, it was lower than both the 8.5% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 6.3% growth recorded for the first quarter.
Further data from the U.S., including the second-quarter employment cost index, personal income and spending for June and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for July, are due later in the day.
Across the Atlantic, the euro climbed to a one-month high against the dollar, last trading at $1.1886 ahead of a slew of data. Second-quarter German, Italian and eurozone GDPs, alongside French, German, Italian and eurozone consumer price indexes for July as well as the eurozone unemployment rate, are due later in the day.
In Asia Pacific, the yuan clawed back most of its losses from Tuesday, although it remained slightly on the back foot ahead of the open of onshore markets on Friday. Sentiment was aided somewhat by Chinese attempts to calm the market by telling foreign brokerages to avoid “overinterpreting” its recent crackdown on sectors including private education."

(Reuters) - Investors turned bearish on the yuan for the first time since April as China's regulatory crackdown on private sector firms sent jitters through markets, while sentiment towards the Indian rupee improved from a fortnight ago, a Reuters poll found. 
Short positions were raised on all other Asian currencies like the Philippine peso, Malaysia's ringgit and the Thai baht as the region's dire COVID-19 situation and prospects of broad dollar strength eroded their appeal.
All 13 responses for the poll were received, however, before the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalled on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank was in no rush to start tapering its stimulus as the economy was ""some ways away"" from showing substantial progress on jobs.
Previous polls have shown investors reducing their long bets on the yuan since June but investors became firmly bearish this week after Beijing increased scrutiny over education, technology and property sectors, sparking uncertainty over future investments in the country. 
Over the week, the yuan slipped below the 6.50 per dollar mark, stocks shed more than 4%, while the Chinese 10-year government bond futures fell 0.4%.
The Indian rupee was the only outlier, as bearish bets on the currency were trimmed by more than half. 
India's stock markets have been trading at record peaks since June, drawing record inflows of US$37 billion this year from foreign investors, as per National Stock Exchange data, setting the rupee up for its fourth straight weekly gain. 
""The rupee is one of the better placed currencies in Asia given India's sharp decline in COVID-19 cases over recent weeks,"" said TD Securities analysts in a note.
Meanwhile, short bets on the low-yielding won were at their highest since May last year, as South Korea's COVID-19 woes kept investors at bay.
The country suffered its worst wave of infections in July, like other developing Asia counterparts; Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. 
All of them imposed some form of curbs to arrest the infection rate, which prompted International Monetary Fund on Tuesday to scale back growth forecasts for most economies in the region.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Thursday, falling to two-week lows after further indications that U.S. interest rate hikes are still a distant event following the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% lower at 92.157, just higher than the two-week low of 92.097 reached earlier Thursday. 
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 109.78, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3931, climbing to a one-month high, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1856 ahead of German data on inflation and unemployment, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7385.
The U.S. central bank kept interest rates steady on Wednesday at the end of its latest two-day meeting, as widely expected, while suggesting that the U.S. economy was making progress towards the levels where the Fed members would agree to tapering monthly bond purchases.
However, comments from Chairman Jerome Powell that rate increases were ""a ways away"" and that the job market still had ""some ground to cover” before the central bank begins to taper its assets weighed on the dollar.
His comments mean that investors will be keeping a close eye on the latest economic data. The weekly initial jobless claims, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), are set to show a continued decline, while the second quarter GDP release at the same time is expected to show 8.5% annualized growth, a sharp increase from the 6.4% growth seen in the previous quarter.
“We still find it likely that a tapering decision is taken in September with a formal slowdown of the purchases from December and onwards,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “We expect the Fed to be able to finalize tapering by the summer of 2022.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY edged 0.3% lower to 6.4731, with the yuan regaining a lot of the ground it lost due to the regulatory onslaught against technology companies that rattled local equity and bond markets. .
Helping the tone Thursday were reports saying that China's securities regulator called a select group of foreign and Chinese banks and institutional investors late on Wednesday to try and soothe nerves. CNBC reported that China would continue to allow companies to list in the United States.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, remaining around a two-week low. The U.S. currency was weighed down by the latest insistence from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that interest rate hikes are not forthcoming.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.17% to 92.157 by 1:04 AM ET (5:04 AM GMT), after recording its third consecutive fall during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 109.78.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7378, with an extended lockdown in Sydney set to put a dent on both the Australian economic recovery and the risker Australian dollar. The NZD/USD pair was up 0.32% to 0.6969, with New Zealand’s ANZ business confidence falling to -3.8 in July.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.26% to 6.4738. The yuan clawed back most of its losses from Tuesday, but traded slightly on the back foot ahead of the onshore markets’ open on Thursday.
Efforts to calm the market turbulence over a crackdown on sectors such as education raised investors’ confidence, with China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xingha reportedly calling executives at major investment banks on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.21% to 1.3927.
Powell’s comments came as the Fed handed down its latest policy decision on Wednesday, where he said that interest rate hikes are ""a ways away"" and that the job market still had ""some ground to cover” before the central bank begins to taper its assets.
Although the dollar rose following the Fed’s decision, it retreated to a two-week low of $1.1849 against the euro after Powell's comments. The retreat indicated that the greenback could be taking a breather from its month-long rise, with the euro now above its 20-day moving average.
""The reaction was to the Powell presser, which was seen as dovish... and improving risk sentiment should be associated with a weaker dollar "" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
He also noted the rebound in U.S.-listed China tech names and recent gains in re-opening exposed firms.
The pound has been a big mover during the past week, thanks to initial positive signs from England’s lift of most COVID-19 curbs earlier in the month. Rolling averages of daily U.K. COVID-19 cases are headed towards a downward trend, even as the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.K. continues to rise. However, experts and Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that it is currently too early to draw any conclusions.
""At the moment, the U.K.’s COVID-19 position is pretty good and I do think that's had an impact,"" said NAB's Attrill.
Investors now await German labor and inflation data to be released later in the day, including the unemployment change and rate for July as well as the consumer price index. The U.S will also release its second-quarter GDP later in the day."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar stood firm on Wednesday after being pinned down earlier, with investors holding off on placing major bets ahead of the outcome of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. 
The U.S. dollar index moved into positive territory after trading lower in Asian hours. The greenback was last up a sliver at 92.474. 
The Japanese yen, Swiss franc and the euro held onto the previous day's gains in Asian trading hours, with the safe-haven yen trading at 109.93 per dollar and the euro at $1.1812.
The dollar has enjoyed a month-long rally after a hawkish shift from the Fed in June. Markets are waiting to see whether it will provide any clues on the timing of tapering later in the day amid surging U.S. inflation. 
The Fed publishes a statement at 1800 GMT followed by a news conference from Chair Jerome Powell at 1830 GMT.
Still, foreign exchange analysts said the chances were high that the Fed would not shift policy, given its view that the recent spike in inflation will likely be transitory and worries that growing COVID-19 cases could derail the global recovery.
""We go into the meeting with positive dollar bias,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""The hurdle is quite low for the Fed to be perceived to be erring on the hawkish side, and that's my bias going in.""
Declining U.S. bond yields, fuelled by concerns about high inflation and the economic outlook, also cast a shadow over the dollar earlier. The 10-year inflation-linked bond yield hit a record low overnight. [US/]
YUAN CONTAGION?
The Chinese yuan pulled away from three-month lows hit on Tuesday, when it saw its biggest daily losses since October, after the country's stock market stabilised following a bruising couple of days.
The yuan's bounce was modest, however, and the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were both subdued as sentiment remained fragile. [AUD/] 
""The Chinese currency has seen some contagious effects,"" of the market turbulence, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts wrote in a note. ""All these point to a panic mood in the market and Beijing's new policy approach seems to be tough and long-lived.""

The Aussie was last down 0.2% at $0.7344, not far from last week's eight-month low of $0.7289.
Elsewhere, the British pound traded close to its highest in 13 days and was steady against the euro, with analysts attributing its gains to COVID-19 cases in Britain declining over the last seven days.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Wednesday, but remained below recent highs amid caution ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy decision.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.493, having earlier retreated from last week’s 3 1/2-month high of 93.194. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.87, GBP/USD was largely unchanged at 1.3876, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1810, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7360.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY edged 0.1% lower to 6.5036, with the yuan slightly rebounding after recording its worst day since October on Tuesday as a result of the turmoil in local equity markets.
The main focus Wednesday will be on the conclusion of the two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank’s unexpected hawkish turn at its previous meeting in June led to a month-long rally for the dollar, but traders are not expecting any significant changes in today’s statement, even with discussions underway over the timing of the exit from its bond-buying program.
“From the threat of the highly contagious Delta virus variant, expiring eviction moratorium and extra unemployment benefits, there are just too many uncertainties for the Fed to press the pedal on taper,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in areas where cases are surging, a reflection of the growing risks.
However, if “one of two five-letter words (Delta or Taper) make their way into the FOMC statement, we will see a big reaction in the U.S. dollar,” added Lien. “If the Fed includes concerns about the Delta variant, the U.S. dollar could extend its slide quickly. If it shrugs off those worries and officially acknowledge that taper is coming, the U.S. dollar will soar.”
The euro wasn't helped by consumer confidence releases in Germany and France that showed confidence failing to improve, while Sterling was supported by reports that the U.K. government will allow fully-vaccinated travelers from the U.S. and EU to enter England without quarantining, possibly as early as next week. In emerging Europe, meanwhile the Hungarian forint continued to push higher after Tuesday's surprisingly large key rate increase by the central bank. The 30 basis point hike to 1.20% was Hungary's second in as many months.

Investing.com – The dollar was up, but remained below its recent highs, on Wednesday morning in Asia. Ripple effects from a crackdown in China and caution ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy decision gave the safe-haven U.S. currency a boost, however.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 92.493 by 1:08 AM ET (5:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.03% to 109.80.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.7353 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6955.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.5074 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 1.3868.
The Japanese yen rose about 0.5% against the dollar during the previous session to hit a one-week high, with the Swiss franc and euro also recording small gains. The trio held onto those gains as the Asian session opened, with the euro last trading at $1.1819, which capped gains for the U.S. currency.
The Chinese yuan fell towards a three-month low against the greenback after recording its worst day since October 2021 on Tuesday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also recorded its sharpest selloff in more than a year as concerns over a recent Chinese crackdown remained firmly in place. The crackdown on tech and other lucrative sectors also saw jitters spill over into the U.S. market on Tuesday.
The riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars also fell as investor sentiment took a hit.
“The fall in Chinese markets caused a ripple effect to global sentiment and it was a risk-off session,” Westpac strategist Imre Speizer told Reuters.
U.S. real yields also declined, with the 10-year tenor falling to a fresh record low during the previous session.
The pound surprised the market by jumping through its 20-day moving average during the previous session, with reports that the U.K. is considering opening its border giving the currency a boost.
Investors continued to focus their attention on Chinese shares’ performance on Wednesday and the Fed decision, due to be handed down later in the day.
The central bank’s unexpected hawkish turn in its previous decision in June led to a month-long rally for the greenback. It now remains to be seen whether more clues on the timeline for both asset tapering and interest rate hikes will be provided in the Fed’s latest decision.
Should mounting inflationary pressures prompt the Fed to introduce both faster than expected, it would give both U.S. rates and the dollar a boost. However, another hawkish surprise is unlikely, with investors more likely on the lookout for any shifts in tone or emphasis, said Westpac’s Speizer.
“They’ve already said they’re talking about tapering and they’ll say that again. They’ve already said transitory inflation and they’ll say that again... it’ll be subtle changes in the language that causes the reaction,” he added."

Investing.com - The dollar traded marginally higher Tuesday, stabilizing below recent highs ahead of the start of the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which could provide clues of future policy action.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.703, just below last week’s 3 1/2-month high of 93.194. 
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 110.16, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3812, EUR/USD was 0.1% lower at 1.1789, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7365.
Trading ranges are likely to be small Tuesday at the start of the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding on Wednesday. There isn’t expected to be a change in policy at this meeting, but traders will be looking for any discussions about the timing of the removal of the central bank’s bond purchases as well as the members’ thinking over the current elevated inflation levels.
“An interesting early autumn is upcoming with decisive tapering decisions to be taken within the Fed and the ECB. We find that the scope for an aggressive tapering process is better in the U.S. compared to the Euro area, as the economic comeback has simply been (much) swifter in the U.S. We hence see a stronger USD on the cards,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY edged lower to 6.4798 after profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for the fourth straight month in June, climbing 20% year-on-year in June after a 36.4% increase in May.
The pair has risen around 0.4% over the last month with the yuan weighed by a Chinese regulatory crackdown as well as China reporting the most Covid cases on Monday since the end of January. 
EUR/HUF rose 0.1% to 361.53 and USD/HUF rose 0.2% to 306.58 ahead of the latest meeting of Hungary’s central bank, which is expected to result in a second interest-rate increase in as many months to combat sharply rising prices.
Most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict the base rate will be lifted by 15 basis points from the current 0.90%, but some are looking for a larger increase."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hovered below recent peaks on Tuesday, as investors turned to this week's Federal Reserve meeting for clues on the policy outlook, while cryptocurrencies pulled back sharply from an attempt to break out of a monthslong range.
The dollar held at $1.1809 per euro in Asia, finding support after a small dip on Monday.
It bought 110.18 yen and the Australian and New Zealand dollars held onto small gains made Monday. 
The greenback has been rising broadly for more than a month as markets have become wary of the Fed starting to taper its monetary support. Investors turned long dollars for the first time since March 2020 last week, positioning data shows. 
The Fed meeting is on Wednesday and the focus is on discussions around bond purchases and insight into the bank's comfort with surging inflation, with the upshot for currency markets not clear cut.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joe Capurso said a hint that tapering could soon begin would lift the dollar.
Steve Englander, head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), however, said that a steer on the Fed's thinking about a sharp but likely transitory jump in inflation will be just as important.
""We expect that Fed Chair (Jerome) Powell will convey more patience than many recent Fed speakers about bringing inflation lower, as long as domestic economic conditions still point to labour market slack,"" said Englander in a note to clients.
""A dovish lean by Powell will likely push up longer-term interest rates ... because of a rally in inflation breakevens and a reduction in market fears about slower medium-term growth.
""Paradoxically, this is likely to be dollar-negative because global uncertainty on the policy response to higher inflation would be reduced,"" said Englander.
A tick higher in inflation expectations on Monday pushed U.S. 10-year real yields to a record low of -1.123%, which also contributed to overnight softness in the dollar.
The U.S. dollar index fell 0.3% on Monday and was last steady at 92.600.
Elsewhere, concern at the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant and jitters in China's stock market kept trade cautious during Asia hours. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was steady at $0.7382 and the kiwi held around $0.7000.
Sterling was above its 20-day moving average and near a one-week high at $1.3827 as early data seemed to show an ebb in surging COVID-19 cases in Britain in spite of the removal of many social curbs last week. 
The Chinese yuan  has held up despite turmoil in equities and was steady at 6.4760. 
Bitcoin dropped sharply to $37,000 from a Monday peak above $40,000 after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) offered a qualified denial of a weekend news report that said it was preparing to accept cryptocurrencies.

""Speculation that has ensued around our specific plans for cryptocurrencies is not true,"" said a company spokesperson.
""We remain focused on exploring what this could look like for customers shopping on Amazon.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday as investor focus turned to this week's Federal Reserve meeting, while cryptocurrencies jumped to their highest levels in weeks.
The euro ticked 0.3% higher to $1.1797 ahead of Ifo's business climate index for Germany, which will be out at 0800 GMT. The yen also gained 0.4% to 110.11 yen per dollar.
Cryptocurrency bitcoin jumped 10% to over a five-week high of $39,850, while ether gained 7.35% to $2,353 after London's City A.M. newspaper cited an un-named ""insider"" on the weekend as saying that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is looking to accept bitcoin payments by year-end.
The report followed Twitter boss Jack Dorsey's comment on Friday that the digital currency is a ""big part"" of the social-media company's future.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, slipped slightly to 92.833 due to pressure from the euro and yen, but was still close to last week's 3-1/2-month high of 93.194.
It has gained nearly 4% from a recent low on May 25 as an improving U.S. economy bolstered the outlook for the Fed to start paring asset purchases as early as this year.
""We think that the Fed will have detailed tapering discussions, but without providing any concrete guidance and short of a taper warning or decision,"" CitiFX analysts Ebrahim Rahbari and Lenny Jin wrote in a note to clients. 
They added that there were risks for a slightly later announcement of a taper decision from the Fed - for example, out to the fourth quarter - given the added uncertainty associated with the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
The Fed at its last meeting on June 16 dropped a reference to the coronavirus as a drag on the economy.
""Given the policy divergence between the Fed and a staunchly dovish ECB, we see euro/dollar as broadly range-bound, but that this environment does not point to dollar strength,"" the CitiFX analysts said.
The risks from the Delta variant continue to rise globally, with U.S. top infectious disease official Anthony Fauci saying some Americans may need booster shots amid new mask mandates and a surge in new cases.
China reported its highest number of cases since the end of January, while new infections have also spiked in Japan, where Tokyo is currently hosting the Olympics.

Australia's most populous state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, reported a rise in new COVID-19 cases on Monday despite a weeks-long stay-at-home order.
Meanwhile, the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks excluding Japan fell 2% on Monday, as Chinese blue chips slumped 3.8%.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Monday, but remained at elevated levels ahead of this week’s important policy meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.885, just below the 3 1/2-month high of 93.194 seen last week. 
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 110.34, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3741, EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1778, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7348.
This week’s key event is the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding on Wednesday. There isn’t expected to be a change in policy at this meeting, but the central bank could provide more clarity over when it will start to taper its massive bond-buying program, in the light of above-trend economic growth and inflation.
“While it may not specify exactly when it is ready to taper, the tone should generally support the view that tapering should emerge in 4Q this year, with the possibility of a first hike coming in 4Q22,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
There are also a number of important U.S. data releases due this week that should illustrate the economy's strong performance. In particular, the second-quarter gross domestic product is forecast on Thursday to show annualized growth of 8.6%, a sharp jump from 6.4% in the previous quarter.
The risk to this optimism comes from the surge in U.S. Covid-19 cases. This largely occurred after the Fed’s last meeting in the middle of June, although the vaccination program appears to have broken the link between cases and hospitalizations for the vaccinated population.
The number of infections from the Delta variant continue to rise globally, with China reporting its highest number of cases since the end of January, while new infections have also spiked in Japan, where Tokyo is currently hosting the Olympics.
Numbers are also rising in Europe, but the Eurozone should still see an improvement in its second-quarter GDP data this week, with Friday’s numbers expected to show a 1.5% quarter-on-quarter expansion, as the region exits its technical recession.
However, the single currency may remain under pressure after falling against the dollar last week to the lowest since early April. The European Central Bank edged closer to taking a more dovish stance toward inflation, shifting its forward guidance such that a hike in interest rates looks unlikely until as far out as 2024.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia but remained near its strongest level since early April 2021 against the euro. Investors also await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision, due to be handed down on Wednesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 92.862 by 12:13 AM ET (4:13 AM GMT). The index was slightly below the previous week’s three-and-a-half month high of 93.194 but was up about 3.8% from its recent low on May 25. Progress in the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 also increased the likelihood that the Fed would begin asset tapering as early as 2021.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.18% to 110.34, near Friday's record of 110.58 which was the highest since Jul. 14. Japanese markets reopened after a holiday and the country released its services purchasing managers’ index earlier in the day.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.7349, with the Australian dollar dropping to an almost eight-month low of $0.72895 during the previous week as Sydney and Melbourne remain under COVID-19 lockdown.
The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.6970. Trade data released earlier in the day said that New Zealand’s trade balance fell to NZD250 million year-on-year but rose to NZD261 million month-on-month in June.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.4827 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3748.
The dollar last traded at $1.17655 per euro, which was little changed from Friday but near the previous week’s high of $1.1752, not seen since Apr. 5.
The greenback would continue to strengthen throughout the week as the Fed is widely expected to move closer to the start of asset tapering, said the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA).
“We expect the FOMC to drop ‘substantial’ from ‘substantial further progress’” in its guidance on the necessary conditions for the labor market before removing monetary support, CBA strategist Joseph Capurso said in a note.
“Removing ‘substantial’ will signal the Fed believes it will soon be appropriate to taper asset purchases,” setting up a possible announcement of a taper in September, the note added.
However, the risk to this outlook is the surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., which came after the Fed’s last meeting on Jun. 16 which did not mention COVID-19 among the threats to the economy.
The dollar posted a 0.2% gain during the previous week, with fears that the surge in COVID-19 cases globally would delay the economic recovery reducing investors’ risk appetite. However, that appetite was regained as strong U.S. earnings gave global stocks a boost.

Investing.com – The dollar ended flat Friday, but traders are warming up to the idea of that greenback's run higher is here to stay, as bets on the world's reserve currency turned positive for the first time since the pandemic began.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.06% to 92.885. Earlier this week, the greenback rose to 93.195, a nearly four-month high.  
The value of the net long dollar position was $399.69 million in the week ended July 20, the first long position since March 2020, compared with a net short of $4.06 billion the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
A patient Fed and a further recovery in the global economy - two key ingredients for the bearish thesis on the dollar – have come under pressure in the recently, helping to shift sentiment on the greenback.
“The combination of a less dovish Fed and the Delta Variant has certainly hit portfolio flows to emerging markets, which have been negative in five out of the last six weeks,” ING said in a note earlier this week. “This has certainly provided support to the dollar. It is hard to see this trend turning in the immediate future.”
The Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting is just days away, and could provide further runway for the dollar to advance.
While there aren’t many on Wall Street betting for a surprise change in monetary policy, further clues from the Fed on trimming its bond-purchases is expected to make a positive impact on the dollar.
“Assuming that the Fed continues to dangle the carrot of a September tapering and the global growth environment remains mixed at best, we suspect the dollar can retain its gains, if not edge higher,” ING added.
Further commentary on tapering could also set the stage of the rally in Treasury yields, which have steadied since dropping below 1.14% earlier this week.
“Our strategists think the July FOMC could be an important catalyst for higher yields. An upbeat assessment of the economy from the Fed and continued discussion of tapering could ring hawkish to the market, especially given the benign pace of hikes priced in,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note."

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on course on Friday for a second week of gains after a turbulent few days when currencies were buffeted by shifting risk appetite, with the market's focus now on next week's Federal Reserve meeting.
Some analysts wondered, though, whether the dollar's recent rally may be losing momentum.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was slightly higher on the day at 92.877. For the week, it is up 0.2%, after rising 0.6% previously.
But that was off a 3-1/2-month high of 93.194 hit on Wednesday, after strong Wall Street earnings helped investors regain some confidence amid earlier worries that the Delta coronavirus variant could derail the global recovery.
Risk appetite among investors remained high on Friday, with U.S. stocks rising, U.S. Treasuries selling off, most commodity currencies well-bid on the day, and the greenback off its peaks.
""The dollar looks tired especially after the rally of the last few weeks,"" said Erik Nelson, macro strategist, at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York. ""It seems to be running out of steam both from a fundamental and technical perspective.""
So far in July, the dollar has gained 0.6%, after rising 2.8% in June. 
Graphic: Dollar set for second week of gains: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkqjxgvx/dxy.png
Wells Fargo's Nelson, however, was not convinced the dollar could hold its gains in the coming weeks given the decline in U.S. Treasury yields. 
Since the beginning of July, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have lost 16 basis points, on track for their largest monthly fall since March 2020.
""You had a huge move lower in U.S. rates. I also think the Fed is going to be one of the laggards among central banks normalizing policy,"" Nelson said.
The market's next major focus is the Fed's two-day policy meeting next week. Since the previous meeting on June 16, when Fed officials dropped a reference to the coronavirus as a weight on the economy, cases have risen.
Many economists, however, still expect the meeting to advance discussions for a tapering of stimulus.
Against the safe-harbour yen, the dollar rose 0.3% to 110.53 yen.
Meanwhile, the euro was down 0.1% at $1.1763, showing little reaction to the purchasing manager surveys coming out of France, Germany and the euro zone as a whole. 
Euro zone business activity expanded at its fastest monthly pace in over two decades in July as the loosening of more COVID-19 restrictions gave a boost to services, but fears of another wave of infections hit business confidence.
The data came in the wake of the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday, in which it pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for even longer.
The Australian dollar - viewed as a proxy for risk appetite - slid 0.1% to US$0.7374, heading for a fourth straight weekly loss. With half the Australian population under lockdown, economists said the country's central bank could increase stimulus rather than decrease it at its next policy meeting.

128,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 05:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve will start scaling back asset purchases next year with an emphasis on mortgage-backed securities, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who see the central bank raising interest rates at a quicker pace through 2024 than previously thought.
Slightly more than half expect MBS tapering will happen proportionally faster than for Treasuries. Several regional Fed presidents are advocating for that approach to cool the housing market, though Chair Jerome Powell and New York Fed chief John Williams have sounded lukewarm to the suggestion.
The economists also see two quarter-point rate hikes by the end of 2023 -- matching the median projection of Fed officials published in June -- with three more increases in 2024. That’s more than than predicted in the June survey. A large majority of them continue to expect President Joe Biden will renominate Powell as chair.
The poll of 51 economists was conducted July 16-21.
The Federal Open Market Committee concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and is expected to hold rates near zero and continue monthly purchase of $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage securities. Officials have pledged to maintain bond buying until the economy shows “substantial further progress” on inflation and employment as it recovers from Covid-19.
There are no published FOMC forecasts this meeting. While the committee will discuss its tapering plans, Powell has indicated he believes it’s too early to slow stimulus.
“The Fed is far from debating when to raise rates,” Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF), said in a survey response. “Tapering may be hinted at, at Jackson Hole or the September FOMC meeting” with a “formal announcement by November, starting in early 2022.”
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“The minutes from the June meeting suggested there was split support, with “several” favoring MBS first, and “several” saying it’s not worth it. That mixed support and easier communication leads us to think they’ll go at the same time, and on even glide paths. The Fed view is these purchases aren’t meant to specifically support the housing market, so a faster taper would implicitly mean they’re walking back that view.”
-- Andrew Husby, economist
Much of the FOMC discussion will focus on when and how to taper its securities purchases, and a consensus is emerging among economists on how the plan will unfold.
Three-quarters of economists expect either an early signal at the Kansas City Fed’s Aug. 26-28 policy retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Powell is likely to speak, or at the Sept. 21-22 FOMC meeting, when the committee updates its quarterly forecasts.
That is likely to be followed by a formal announcement of tapering in December, in the view of nearly half of those surveyed, and actual reductions starting in the first quarter of 2022, according to 71% of the economists.
In the survey, 8% said the Fed will start with an MBS only tapering, while 46% said the reductions will be in equal amounts, effectively ending mortgage purchases long before Treasuries. That’s an approach suggested by Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. Another 46% say the reductions should be proportional to the buying.
The goal will be “a mechanical reduction each month -- I think they’ll go with $10 billion per month,” said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet Wealth Management. The process will be “like watching paint dry,” he said, echoing the characterization of the last time the Fed tapered bond buying by officials including then-Chair Janet Yellen.
MBS tapering has been one of the more contentious issues, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Governor Christopher Waller supporting an early focus on reducing them because of the hot housing market. Powell in congressional testimony said MBS and Treasury purchases have about the same effect on the economy, an argument also made by Williams.
More than half of the economists expect tapering to last 10 to 12 months, which would wrap it up before the end of 2022 if it starts early in the first quarter.
Some Fed officials say they want to finish tapering before raising rates and their median forecast shows them on hold through next year, though seven of 18 officials did favor a rate hike in 2022.
Hugh Johnson, chairman and founder of Hugh Johnson Advisors, said he expects Fed policy to “remain benign” until the second half of 2022” with a “shift toward restraint likely” in the first quarter of the following year.
The increased interest-rate forecasts come amid a rise in inflation with reopening causing big increases in prices for used cars, hotels and airfares, among other purchases. Consumer prices rose 5.4% in June from a year ago as measured by the consumer price index, the fastest increase since 2008.
The FOMC will keep the language in its statement this month that the inflation surge mostly reflects transitory factors, according to 96% of the economists. Those surveyed mostly agree, with 78% saying the transitory statement is accurate.
“Much of the rise in prices will likely prove transitory, although wage pressures stemming from fiscal policy will likely be more sticky,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
Still, three quarters of economists say the risks on inflation are to the upside compared to FOMC forecasts, which is the biggest concern they have in looking at economic risks.
Powell’s current term as Fed chair expires in February. Four-fifths of the economists expect Biden to keep him in the job, an overwhelming number that’s risen slightly from June.
Powell has deflected all questions on whether he’d serve four more years if asked, leaving the impression intact that he’d like to stay at the helm. He has broad support for another term among top Biden aides, though the decision is expected later this year and hasn’t yet been put in front of the president, according to people familiar with the matter.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a Democrat, is seen as the most likely alternative choice of 16% of economists surveyed.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Friday, with attention turning to next week’s Federal Reserve meeting after the European Central Bank’s dovish performance on Thursday.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.865, but still below Wednesday’s 3 1/2-month high of 93.194. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 110.28, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3754, despite retail sales rising 0.5% in July, more than expected, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7370.
Additionally, EUR/USD was flat at 1.1770, having slipped during Thursday’s session after the ECB strengthened its forward guidance on interest rates, tying them more closely to inflation, suggesting an even longer period of steady or lower policy interest rates.
“The ECB’s Staff currently projects that inflation will reach just 1.5% by the very end of its horizon, which runs until 2023,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note. “In addition, the trajectory of inflation is very modestly upward sloping … This would be consistent with policy rates remaining where they are through 2024.”
There are a slew of surveys on the manufacturing and services sectors in both Europe and the U.S. later Friday, which are expected to show a slight softening of activity, albeit from high levels, but the market's next major focus is likely to be the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.
Coronavirus cases have started to rise again in the regions of the U.S. where there has been a low vaccination pickup since the previous meeting in mid-June, but the meeting is still expected to produce some advancement in the discussions for a tapering of stimulus.
Also of interest, the Bank of Russia meets later Friday and is expected to lift its benchmark interest rate as it struggles to combat surging inflation.
The central bank has already raised rates by 125 basis points this year. But with annual inflation at a five-year high of 6.5%, way above the 4% target, a further hike of as much as 100 basis points is likely.
At 2:55 AM ET, USD/RUB traded 0.4% lower at 73.744, with the ruble remaining one of the top four emerging-markets performers this year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia and was set to end the week not far from where it started. Investors took stock at the end of a volatile week in which currencies gyrated due to ever-changing risk appetite levels.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 92.880 by 12:37 AM ET (4:37 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 110.25. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, with the Tokyo Olympics due to open later in the day.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7377 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.6978.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.4722 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.3761.
The greenback is in for a weekly gain of 0.1% but made very small moves overnight. It was, however, down from the three-and-a-half-month high of 93.194 hit on Wednesday as investors regained some of the confidence lost as the number of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant rose globally.
Investors also digested the European Central Bank (ECB)’s policy decision handed down on Thursday. The ECB pledged to maintain its dovish monetary policy, as widely expected, and the euro was 0.2% lower over the period at $1.1779 after the decision. Bank Indonesia also handed down its policy decision on Thursday.
The uptrend in the dollar index is ""showing tentative signs"" of stalling around 93.0, ""but its overall resilience regardless of the shifting risk mood and the ECB's shift to a more structurally dovish policy stance suggest retracements will likely be limited to the 91.5-92.0 zone,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
Investors now await the U.S Federal Reserve’s meeting next week.
""The U.S. is better positioned than others to withstand the spread of the delta variant thanks to its earlier strong vaccination drive,” the note added.
Back in the Asia-Pacific region, the riskier Australian dollar headed for a 0.2% fall, which would be a fourth consecutive weekly decline. Australia tightened its current lockdown in Sydney as the city reported its biggest daily rise in new COVID-19 cases in 2021 and prompted speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia could increase stimulus rather than decreasing it when it next meets.
""The balance of risks point to more weakness in the Australian dollar in the near term,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Joseph Capurso said in his own note.
Across the Tasman Sea, the record number of cases in Sydney prompted New Zealand to pause its quarantine-free travel arrangement with Australia for at least eight weeks starting later in the day, said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged higher overall in choppy trading on Thursday, moving with the ebbs and flows of risk sentiment, while the euro fell as investors digested the European Central Bank statement and comments by its president. 
The U.S. currency hit its highest level in more than three months on Wednesday.
Risk appetite was mixed, with U.S. stocks ending slightly higher on the day, but Treasuries were well-bid, which pushed yields lower. 
Despite the pullback in the dollar from 3-1/2-month peaks, it remains in demand among investors, analysts said.
""There is a lot of uncertainty whether you're looking at U.S. markets, global macro, COVID concerns, or whether you're looking at political risks,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe in London.
""I don't think this dislocation is going to clear in the short term, so I see the dollar remaining buoyant over the next few months,"" he added.
Earlier in the session, the greenback slid in the wake of higher-than-expected U.S. jobless claims data that raised concerns about the world's largest economy's recovery from the pandemic.
The euro, on the other hand, was firmer early in the day after the ECB met expectations by pledging to keep interest rates at record lows for even longer.
ECB President Christine Lagarde, in her media briefing, did not say anything to change the market's cautious outlook on the euro zone. She said a fresh wave of the coronavirus pandemic could pose a risk to the region's recovery, although she did offer a more balanced economic outlook.
The ECB's dovish pivot - which follows its recently released strategy review - at a time when many peers are mulling exiting pandemic-era stimulus is expected to keep the single currency under pressure.
In late afternoon trading, the euro was down 0.2% $1.1767, not far from a 3-1/2-month low of $1.1752 hit on Wednesday.
The dollar index, meanwhile, rose 0.1% to 92.852, as the impact of the U.S. jobless claims data faded.
Data showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 51,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 419,000 for the week ended July 17, the highest since mid-May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 350,000 applications for the latest week.
Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto, said the data risks pushing the Federal Reserve's tightening plans well into the future, putting further pressure on bond yields.
Growth-focused currencies such as the Australian dollar gained as a global risk sell-off abated further. The Aussie was last up 0.2% at US$0.7372.
Sterling firmed 0.4% to $1.3767, recovering from 5-1/2-month troughs, while in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose 0.4% to $32,287.
Bitcoin rose modestly after Business Insider reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will allow all of its wealth management clients access to cryptocurrency funds.
The dollar slipped 0.1% against the yen, another safe haven, to 110.17 yen.

Investing.com –  The euro attempted to stage a rebound on Thursday, after falling to more than three-month lows following the European Central Bank’s unchanged monetary policy and new forward guidance that many believe could keep interest rates lower for longer.
EUR/USD fell 0.16% to $1.1773 after trading as highs as $1.1831 ahead of the European Central Bank decision.
The ECB, as was largely expected, left its benchmark rate at 0% and its commitment to purchase €1.85 trillion through March 2022 unchanged.
The central bank revised its forward guidance on interest rates to reflect its strategy review earlier this month. Under the new framework, the ECB would will inflation to overshoot target its 2% target.
The ECB said the adjustment of forward guidance meant “emphasizing its commitment to sustainably maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to reach its inflation target.”
As this tweak ties the forward guidance on interest rates more closely to inflation, interest rates aren't likely to rise anytime soon. 
“[T]he ECB did indeed make a shift towards more dovishness, putting more emphasis on the possibility of inflation overshooting and by tying the forward guidance on interest rates even closer to the inflation projections,” ING said.  “With an inflation projection currently of 1.4% YoY for 2023 and the new forward guidance, interest rates will remain low for even longer.”
Others agree, estimating that the central bank’s inflation target is unlikely to be met in the short-term.
“With its revised forward guidance on key interest rates, the ECB is signalling that it is likely to maintain its very expansionary monetary policy for a very long time,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
In the press conference that followed the policy statement, ECB president Christine Lagarde was quick downplay expectations that the revised forward guidance would result in a lower for longer interest rate environment.
“I’m not saying it’s going to be longer or lower,” Lagarde said. “I think it’s a sign that we don’t want to tighten prematurely.”
The ECB policy update is expected to exacerbate the divergence between a dovish ECB and a less dovish Federal Reserve, i keeping a lid on the euro against the dollar.   
""We suggest selling EUR/USD as a way to play for upcoming USD upside risks,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. ""Increasing central bank divergence [...] a US inflation disappointment that pushes US real yields higher and breakevens lower, and the Fed moving closer towards reducing the pace of its asset purchases, all raise the prospects of USD strength in coming months."""

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely unchanged in early European trading Thursday, on the back foot as risk appetite returned to the market ahead of the latest European Central Bank policy-setting meetin
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded flat at 92.767, after pulling back from a 3 1/2-month high of 93.194 touched on Wednesday. 
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1797, climbing from Wednesday's 3-1/2-month low of 1.1752, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 110.14, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3732, recovering from the over 5-month low hit earlier in the week, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7371.
Risk appetite has returned to the foreign exchange markets, causing the safe haven dollar to backtrack a little, after fears that the rise of Covid cases would hit world growth caused a sharp selloff in equities and more risky currencies earlier in the week.
“We see the recent dip in cyclical FX as a correction rather than a more pronounced trend and look for a recovery in higher beta currencies backed by hawkish central banks later this summer,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
Attention now turns to Europe, with the European Central Bank set to reveal its latest policy decision at 7:45 AM ET (1145 GMT), with the subsequent press conference from President Christine Lagarde of particular interest after she stated earlier this week that the meeting will have “some interesting variations and changes”.
“We still expect net asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to end in March 2022, while the pace of purchases will fall already during the autumn. Nevertheless, easy monetary policy will continue for still a long time,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
The ECB isn’t the only central bank meeting Thursday. 
South Africa’s central bank will probably keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged and lower its economic-growth forecasts on Thursday with the country struggling to cope with a third wave of Covid-19 restrictions as well as deadly riots.
Additionally, Ukraine is set to leave its benchmark interest rate at 7.5%, unchanged for a second month after it lifted borrowing costs earlier this year as consumer prices began to ramp up. 
At 3 AM ET, USD/ZAR fell 0.2% to 14.5679 and USD/UAH rose 0.1% to 27.232.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia but climbed down from multi-month highs, as strong earnings boosted global stocks and increased investor risk appetite.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 92.787 by 11:41 PM ET (3:41 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.12% to 110.13, with Japanese markets closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7353, with the Australian dollar slightly up from an eight-month low hit on Wednesday. The state of Queensland closed its border with New South Wales to curb the spread of Sydney’s COVID-19 outbreak, while the National Australia Bank (NAB) Quarterly Business Confidence index, released earlier in the day, was also a lower-than-expected 17.
The NZD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.6951 and the USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.4672.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3707. The pound recovered from a five-and-a-half month low of $1.35725 hit on Tuesday, even as the number of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant continues to rise in the U.K. and confusion remains over the lifting of restrictive measures in England.
""Strong earnings have swept away Delta concerns in the U.S.,"" weighing on haven currencies, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analyst Tapas Strickland said in a note. ""The consensus is that the Delta strain does not pose an immediate risk to the recovery,"" delaying reopening by three months at the most as countries ramp up vaccination drives in response, the note added.
The euro traded at $1.1789, climbing above Wednesday’s three-and-a-half-month low ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB)’s policy decision later in the day. ECB will implement changes to their strategy for the first time and is widely expected to maintain its dovish stance, which could weaken the euro over the medium term.
""On balance, the ECB’s new inflation target suggests monetary policy will remain ultra‑accommodative for an even longer period of time,"" which will act as a headwind for the euro, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategists Kim Mundy and Carol Kong wrote in a research note.
""Indeed, we expect the ECB will be one of the last central banks under our coverage to tighten policy,” the note added.
Bank Indonesia will also hand down its policy decision later in the day.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin recorded its biggest jump since mid-June 2021, after Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood discussed its prospects at the B Word conference. Musk also added that Telsa will ""most likely"" resume accepting bitcoin for payment."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The safe-haven dollar on Wednesday pulled back from more than three-month highs as risk appetite made a comeback with stocks higher, although investors remained cautious amid inflation fears and concerns about the highly-contagious coronavirus variant.
Another safe haven, the Japanese yen, was also down against the dollar, as risk aversion eased.
The Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has caused a surge in infections worldwide, rose to the top of investor concerns along with inflation this week, prompting global stocks to drop sharply on Monday. European equity markets though picked up on Wednesday and Wall Street shares rose as well.
In afternoon New York trading, the dollar index, a measure of its value against six major currencies fell 0.2% to 92.755. On Tuesday, the index hit a more than three-month high.
Market participants though remained bullish on the dollar's outlook, at least over the next few months.
""Between yield differentials and COVID-driven safe-haven demand, the U.S. dollar has been the proverbial belle of the forex ball this week,"" said Matt Weller, global head of market research at FOREX.com and City Index.
""These themes should continue to support the dollar in the coming weeks, but a recovery in the market's risk appetite, especially if driven by additional monetary or fiscal stimulus from the U.S., would undercut the nascent trend of strength in the greenback,"" he added.
The Federal Reserve's stimulus measures or quantitative easing have restrained the dollar as it increased the currency's supply in the financial system.
""Currently, we have high inflation in the U.S. which is keeping the door open for the Fed to taper stimulus,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington, a scenario that's positive for the dollar.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.4% to 110.26.
The Australian dollar, seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, fell to its lowest since November before recovering somewhat. It was last up 0.4% at US$0.7357, while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.9% to US$0.6976.
Australia's two largest states reported sharp increases in new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, a blow to hopes that lockdown restrictions would be lifted as more than half the country's population was subject to stay-at-home orders.
The British pound, which on Tuesday hit its lowest since February, was up 0.6% at $1.3715.
Analysts pointed to a stand-off between Britain and the European Union. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would outline its approach on the Northern Ireland Protocol to Britain's parliament on Wednesday. COVID-19 cases in Britain are also surging. [nL1N2OW18W.
The euro rose 0.2% versus the dollar to $1.1797. 
Currency markets are looking ahead to the European Central Bank's (ECB) meeting on Thursday. A dovish tone is expected after ECB President Christine Lagarde foreshadowed a guidance tweak in an interview last week.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose back above $30,000, having dipped below this key level for the first time in a month on Tuesday. It last traded up 7.4% at $31,991, while ether surged more than 10% to $1,971.79.92.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher Wednesday, remaining near multi-month highs amid worries over surging Covid-19 infections ahead of the start to the latest European Central Bank policy meeting. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 93.123, not far below March’s peak of 93.439. 
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1760, around the lowest level since early April, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.89, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7299, hit by Australian July retail sales falling 1.8% on the month as the large parts of the country was locked down.
Deaths from Covid-19 in the United States have averaged 239 per day over the past week, nearly 48% higher than the previous week, said Rochelle Walensky, director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.
The vast majority of these cases are now down to the more contagious Delta variant. This was first found in India earlier this year and has since become the dominant version of the virus in the United States and many other countries.
“Global financial markets are re-pricing to a lower growth trajectory as Covid-19 case numbers rise again and fears of new lockdowns emerge,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “We suspect that this correction will once again present a buying opportunity for pro-cyclical currencies, but for the short term defensive positions should be maintained.”
Elsewhere, traders will be keeping a wary eye on the European Central Bank as it starts a two-day meeting on Wednesday, after changing its inflation goal to 2% earlier this month. President Christine Lagarde hinted at a change to the bank's guidance last week. 
“With the ECB shifting the inflation target from ‘below, but close to 2%’ to ‘2%’ with a commitment to symmetry, the new strategy can be interpreted as either a formalization of what it has been doing over the last few years anyway or a step towards more dovishness, as 2% implies a more resolute effort,” added ING.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3594, falling to levels last seen in February,. In addition to the surge in Covid-19 cases there caused by the lifting of restrictions, markets have also turned nervous about U.K. plans to break the agreement it signed with the EU over the customs treatment of Northern Ireland. The U.K. government is expected to confirm its intentions later Wednesday. On a more positive note for sterling, the country’s public sector net borrowing fell to 22.8 billion pounds ($30.95 billion) in June, 5.5 billion pounds less than a year earlier.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia but eased slightly from multi-month peaks. Recent risk aversion that gave the greenback a boost ebbed, and selling was light ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB)’s latest policy decision that kept the euro pinned down.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 93.047 by 12: 36 AM ET (4:36 AM GMT). The index, which is up 2.8% since mid-June, also seemed close to testing its peak of 93.439 touched in March 2021.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.05% to 109.89. Japanese trade data released earlier in the day said exports grew 48.6% year-on-year, a fourth consecutive month of double-digit gains, and imports grew 32.7% year-on-year in June.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.7310, with Australia’s latest retail sales figures falling 1.8% month-on-month. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.6912.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.15% to 6.4746 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3615.
Despite the pause on the way upwards, some investors remained optimistic about the U.S. currency’s prospects.
""The U.S. dollar does seem to have quite an undertow of support,"" driven mostly by expectations that the U.S. economic recovery could prompt interest rates hikes but also receiving some help from investors’ risk aversion, Westpac analyst Sean Callow told Reuters.
""The general mood on the dollar looks as though it would take a lot to derail the basic narrative of the dollar being in fairly good shape from here to the Jackson Hole conference,"" the U.S. Federal Reserve’s symposium that takes place in Wyoming in August where the central bank could announce tapering of its bond purchases.
""For the time being you'd probably just prefer to keep long dollars for the next few weeks,” said Callow.
The recent global surge in COVID-19 cases involving the Delta variant continued to drag on Asian currencies, the safe-have yen excepted, as some countries reimplemented restrictive measures.
Investors now await the European Central Bank’s policy decision, to be handed down on Thursday after President Christine Lagarde hinted at a guidance tweak during an interview in the previous week.
With the central bank announcing a new strategy that allows the bank to tolerate inflation above its 2% target and Lagarde saying policy guidance would be tweaked towards this new goal, investors widely expect a dovish tone in Thursday’s policy decision.
""No change in the ECB bias is unlikely to be enough to send the euro higher... at the same time, any ECB shift towards the dovish interpretation of the strategic review would underscore the recent downward euro/dollar trend,"" ING analysts said in a note.
Bank Indonesia will also hand down its policy decision on Thursday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar climbed to a three-month peak on Tuesday in a flight-to-safety bid, as investors remained anxious about a fast-spreading coronavirus variant that could throttle global growth.
Commodity currencies tied to risk appetite such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars struggled, with investors opting for safety or staying on the sidelines amid renewed fears about the highly contagious Delta variant, now the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide.
U.S. infections have surged, especially in areas where vaccinations have lagged.
The dollar rose as yield differentials have moved against it. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields dipped to a five-month low below 1.20% on Monday on renewed skepticism about a strong economic rebound from the pandemic. [US/]
""Shifts in relative growth rate expectations are weakening capital flows out of the U.S. and heightening the appeal of dollar-denominated investments,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""At the same time, an unwinding in speculative positions is forcing a short squeeze in currency markets - driving the dollar upward,"" he added. 
In afternoon trading, the dollar index, a measure of its value against six major currencies, rose 0.1% to 92.961, after hitting a three-month high of 93.161 earlier in the session.
Data showing U.S. housing starts rose 6.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.643 million units last month had little reaction from the FX market.
""I believe the safe-haven strengthening in the dollar is merited, considering that global progress has been anemic to what it appeared like in Q1 so now all valuations and high expectations for growth are being rightly questioned,"" said Juan Perez, FX strategist and trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.
In other currencies, the euro weakened 0.2% to $1.1780, after dipping to $1.1755, the lowest since early April ahead of a European Central Bank policy decision on Thursday.
The British pound was also among the biggest losers, with the currency declining 0.4% to $1.3607, as Boris Johnson's ""freedom day"" - ending more than a year of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in England - was marred by surging infections.
The Australian dollar dropped to its lowest since late November and was last down 0.2% at US$0.7331.
The Aussie's losses were broad-based as minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting this month were seen by some economists as a sign that the central bank may reverse a decision to taper stimulus.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin sank as low as $29,296.39, a level not seen since June 22. It was last down 3.4% at $29,779. Rival ether fell 1.5% to $1,789.32.

Investing.com - The dollar traded at multi-month highs in Europe Tuesday, continuing to benefit from its safe haven status amid concerns rising Covid-19 will hinder the global economic recovery.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.953, climbing to levels not seen since February. 
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1780, after dipping overnight to the lowest since early April, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.51, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3660, after falling to the lowest level since early February in the previous session, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7321, an almost-eight-month low.
The highly-contagious delta variant of the Covid-19 virus is now the dominant strain worldwide, and this has resulted in a jump in coronavirus cases across Asia, where vaccination programs are in their infancy, and also in parts of Europe and the United States, largely among the unvaccinated.
The average number of daily new Covid-19 cases in the United States has tripled in the past 30 days, according to an analysis of Reuters data, climbing over 30,000 on the weekend.
“Concerns that the delta mutation will slow, or even reverse, the recovery efforts appeared to be sapping risk-taking appetites,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, in a note. 
Elsewhere, USD/CNY dropped slightly to 6.4872 after China’s central bank kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged at its monthly fixing on Tuesday.
Expectations for a cut had been growing after a surprise lowering of bank reserve requirements earlier this month, prompting questions over whether that move was merely the fine-tuning of banking system liquidity or the starting of an easing cycle to combat the economic slowdown.
Thursday sees the latest policy meeting of the European Central Bank, the first at which the bank will have to discuss how to implement its new strategy. Analysts expect it to turn more dovish, despite the current surge in inflation. German producer price inflation climbed to a 40-year high, according to figures released by Destatis earlier Tuesday.
“Interesting tapering decisions are upcoming from both the Fed and the ECB. We find that the scope for an aggressive wind-down of purchases is bigger for the Fed than the ECB and hence see a stronger USD on the cards,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, with investors turning to safe-haven assets as concerns over the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks involving the Delta variant on economic recovery remain. The greenback remained near multi-month highs against its riskier Australian counterpart and the pound, alongside the Japanese yen.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 92.945 by 1:36 M ET (5:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.05% to 109.50.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.7325, as the Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its latest policy meeting earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair fell 0.53% to 0.6906.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4892. The People's Bank of China also kept its July loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged for the fifteenth straight month, with the one-year LPR at 3.85% and the five-year LPR at 4.65%.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3662.
The yen surged to 80.05 per Australian dollar during the previous session for the first time since early February 2020, and traded at 80.40 early in the Asian session. It also rallied to an almost three-month high of 149.35 against the pound overnight.
Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened to an almost eight-month high of $0.73225 against its Australian counterpart at the beginning of the trading week, and hit its highest level since early February 2021 at $1.3655 against the pound.
The yen also outpaced the dollar, rising to 109.07 against the U.S. currency on Monday for the first time since late May 2021. A slide in benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to as low as 1.1740% for the first time since mid-February 2021 also gave the Japanese currency a boost.
Investor concerns over the COVID-19 outbreaks linger, with the reimposition of restrictive measures in some countries triggering worries about the global economic recovery.
In the U.K., the lifting of most COVID-19 restrictions in England on Jul.19 was marred both by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s self-isolation after Health Minister Sajid Javid tested positive for the virus and rising numbers of daily cases in the country. The rising numbers also prompted the U.S. to warn its citizens against traveling to the U.K.
The Australian city of Sydney also remains under lockdown in an attempt to curb its own COVID-19 outbreak.
""What is likely concerning markets now is... a surge in infections occurring in developed markets with high levels of vaccination,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analyst Tapas Strickland said in a note.
""That suggests COVID-19 restrictions may need to be in place for longer,"" delaying the global recovery, the note added.
In other central bank news, the European Central Bank and Bank Indonesia will also hand down their respective policy decision on Thursday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The safe-haven U.S. dollar, yen, and Swiss franc rose on Monday as investors grew nervous about a raging coronavirus variant that could threaten the outlook for a global economic recovery.
The three currencies firmed as benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dropped to a more than five-month low of 1.176%, with risk aversion spreading across financial markets.
The greenback climbed to a more than three-month peak against a basket of major currencies, but has come off its highs as the yen and Swiss franc gained with the worsening in risk sentiment.
The U.S. dollar though remained sharply higher against risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars.
The yen, meanwhile, climbed to its highest in 1-1/2 months versus the dollar.
The Delta variant of COVID-19 is now the dominant strain worldwide, accompanied by a surge of deaths around the United States almost entirely among unvaccinated people, U.S. officials said on Friday.
""The wall of worry is being built,"" said Christopher Vecchio, senior analyst at DailyFX.com, the research unit of forex broker IG. ""Lower equities, lower yields, strength in the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar all amount to a significant risk-off impulse in markets.""
In afternoon trading, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against six major currencies, rose to its highest since April 5. It was last up 0.2% on the day at 92.868.
As a result of global uncertainty related to the coronavirus variant, U.S. interest rates markets also reduced expectations on U.S. Federal Reserve tightening in 2022 and 2023.
""Rates markets don't seem to think any Fed action is imminent, particularly as Delta variant concerns surge,"" said Vecchio.
Fed funds futures, which track short-term rate expectations, showed the chances of a quarter-point hike by the Fed in December 2022 dropped to 58% on Monday from 90% on July 13, when the consumer price index was released. The likelihood that the Fed raises rates in January 2023 fell to 70% from 100% last Tuesday.
The dollar was also firmly higher against commodity currencies. It rose more than 1.1% against the Canadian dollar to C$1.2763. The Aussie dollar dropped 1% versus the greenback to US$0.7325, while the New Zealand dollar also dropped 1.1% to US$0.6923.
The yen surged against the dollar on Monday, rising to its highest since late May. The greenback was last down 0.6% at 109.44 yen.
The Swiss franc gained as well, dragging the dollar down 0.2% to 0.9180 franc.
The pound was down 0.9% at $1.3657 after UK Health Minister Sajid Javid announced over the weekend that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was in self-isolation. That forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Finance Minister Rishi Sunak into quarantine, pushing sterling down to a three-month trough against the dollar earlier in the session. [GBP/] 
The euro was down 0.1% at $1.1794, after dropping to a three-month low of $1.1764, ahead of this week's European Central Bank meeting. 
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was testing key support of $30,000 and was last down 3.6% at $30,618.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Vietnam has pledged not to deliberately weaken its dong currency to gain an export advantage, reaching an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to refrain from ""competitive devaluation"" and make its monetary and exchange rate policies more transparent.
The agreement, announced in a joint statement by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and State Bank of Vietnam Governor Nguyen Thi Hong after a virtual meeting on Monday, follows months of U.S. pressure on Vietnam over its currency practices and ballooning U.S. trade surplus.
The Trump administration in its final weeks had declared Vietnam a currency manipulator and had threatened to impose punitive tariffs on imports from Vietnam.
Vietnam, which benefited from the shift of U.S. supply chains away from China amid a tariff war, saw its goods trade surplus with the United State jump 25% in 2020 to $69.7 billion despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Vietnam is a growing source of U.S. imports of furniture, electronics, computers and apparel.
In the joint statement, Vietnam confirmed its commitment under International Monetary Fund rules ""to avoid manipulating its exchange rate in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage and will refrain from any competitive devaluation of the Vietnamese dong.""
The Vietnamese central bank said the focus of its monetary policy framework is ""to promote macroeconomic stability and to control inflation.""
But the central bank agreed to ""improve exchange rate flexibility over time,"" allowing the dong to move in line with the development of the country's markets and economic fundamentals, and to further modernize and make more transparent its monetary policy and exchange rate framework
The Treasury said it would inform other U.S. government agencies about the agreement to address U.S. concerns. 
""I believe the State Bank of Vietnam’s attention to these issues over time not only will address Treasury’s concerns, but also will support the further development of Vietnam’s financial markets and enhance its macroeconomic and financial resilience,"" Yellen said in the statement.
The Treasury under Yellen in April removed a ""currency manipulator"" label from Vietnam that had been imposed by the Trump administration last December. But the Treasury said that Vietnam, along with Taiwan and Switzerland, had tripped its thresholds for the designation under a 2015 law.
The department at the time said it would commence ""enhanced engagement"" with Hanoi to correct the situation, which led Vietnam's foreign currency intervention and global current account surplus to exceed 2% of its GDP.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said her agency will monitor Hanoi's implementation of the agreement and would work with Vietnam ""to ensure that it addresses the acts, policies and practices related to the valuation of its currency that were found actionable in the Section 301 investigation.""
USTR's probe had found that Vietnam was taking ""unreasonable"" actions to push down the value of its currency to make its exports cheaper, but held off on imposing tariffs.

143,"<span>Jul 19, 2021 08:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Investment strategists are starting to consider a new bearish scenario: the economy has already hit its speed limit.
With the ferocious spread of Covid-19’s delta variant and central banks already talking about tighter monetary policy to bring inflation under control, there’s a growing sense of worry that financial markets have become too optimistic.
The shift in narrative was evident across assets on Monday. S&P 500 futures lost 1% and small-caps took a beating. In Europe, the main stock benchmark sank more than 2% with the most severe losses in energy, banks and travel companies. Treasuries rallied, with the 10-year yield sliding to 1.23%.
“Peak growth is starting to become a more concerning element,” Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA, said on Bloomberg Television. “This is actually one of the elements which has pushed us to reduce the allocation into risk assets in our global allocation. You have inflation, but you have also this growth element.”
In the minds of many investors, the moves represent a pullback in overextended areas of the market, like cyclicals. Others pointed to the usual volatility that comes with earnings season and thin summer trading.
Investors had earlier delighted in the prospect of a strong worldwide economic rebound fueled by easy money and vaccine rollouts. But the combination of price pressures and soaring infection rates raises the risk that growth could fall short of rosy forecasts. And with global equities teetering at all-time highs, there’s no room for error.
“While macro conditions remain overall supportive for equities, valuations, seasonal trends and positioning leave the room for price corrections and volatility spikes as the one we are seeing today,” said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali (MI:GASI) Insurance Asset Management.
Other strategists urged clients to use the weakness as a time to buy.
“I am firmly in the buy the dip camp,” said Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. “Stocks had a very strong first half supported by the earnings recovery and we expect corporate earnings to remain strong.”
For Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets and chief global strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management, there’s still a worry that growth expectations are too high. China’s regulatory crackdown on its technology sector and U.S. consumers saving more than they spend are among the key risks, he said.
Global Growth Boom May Disappoint, Morgan Stanley’s Sharma Warns
Stalling vaccination rates, especially in the U.S., are also dragging down market sentiment, wrote  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s George Saravelos. At the same time, rising prices have caused consumer demand to stall in many economies.
“This is part of broader post-Covid scarring; it is also part of bottleneck demand destruction,” he wrote. “This is the opposite of what one would expect if the environment was genuinely inflationary. It shows the global economy has a very low speed limit.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, maintaining its recent strong tone as rising Covid-19 cases threaten to derail the global economic recovery, prompting a flight to safety. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 92.828, not far removed from the recent three-month high of 92.832. 
EUR/USD was marginally lower at 1.1803, just above last week's three month low of 1.1772, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 109.97, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3754, around its lowest for more than a week, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7382, its weakest level since December.
The greenback has benefited of late from investors becoming more risk averse as rising numbers of Covid-19 cases threatened to halt the tepid global economic recovery.
The majority of the new cases had been seen in southeast Asia, but infections are now also rising in the U.S. and Europe, even as England lifts most of its social restrictions.
U.S. cases of Covid-19 were up 70% over the previous week and deaths up 26%, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday.
The global seven-day average of daily new Covid-19 cases is over half a million for the first time since May, according to Reuters data.
Also of interest this week will be Thursday’s policy meeting of the European Central Bank, especially after last week’s release of the central bank's strategic review.
“The distribution of probabilities is skewed to lower EUR/USD next week,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “No change in the ECB bias is unlikely to be enough to send the euro higher. At the same time, any ECB shift towards the dovish interpretation of the strategic review would underscore the recent downward EUR/USD trend.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4822 ahead of Tuesday’s meeting of China’s central bank, at which there is an outside chance the benchmark loan prime rate is lowered. 
The People’s Bank of China recently lowered the reserve requirements for its banks to help underpin its stuttering economic recovery, leading to speculation surrounding its prime rate.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, remaining near its highest levels in months. Investors turned to the safe-haven U.S. currency as COVID-19 cases continue to increase globally, in turn prompting concerns about the global economic recovery.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 92.707 by 12:28 AM ET (X AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 109.91.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.7386. and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.6994.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.4790 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.3760.
The riskier Australian dollar fell to its lowest level against its U.S. counterpart since 2021 as the Asia session got underway while hitting a five-month low against the safe-haven Japanese yen.
Countries such as Australia and South Korea reimposed restrictive measures to curb their latest outbreaks, while the first cases were reported in the Olympic village in Japan ahead of the start of the Tokyo Olympic Games on Jul. 23. The global seven-day average of daily new COVID-19 cases is over half a million for the first time since May 2021.
""The market is really trading on the uncertainty in the air around COVID-19,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril said on the bank's morning podcast.
""That is the dominant factor,"" he added, while adding a surprise fall in U.S consumer sentiment had also unsettled investors.
With no significant economic data due until the release of the U.S., manufacturing and services purchasing managers’ indexes on Friday, COVID-19 will likely remain a focus for investors until then.
The People’s Bank of China will set its benchmark loan prime rate on Tuesday, with an outside chance that the rate will be lowered. The European Central Bank and Bank Indonesia will also hand down their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
With England due to lift most of its COVID-19 restrictive measures on Jul. 19, or ‘Freedom Day,’ the pound was at its lowest level in more than a week. Despite hopes that were pinned on the U.K.’s COVID-19 vaccination drive, the number of cases has spiked in the preceding days.
With Health Secretary Sajid Javid testing positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are currently self-isolating after coming into contact with him.
""The Netherlands relaxed all restrictions and saw cases soar from 500 to 10,000 per day in two weeks, and the government has had to reverse course and is now waiting nervously to see what happens to hospitalizations... the UK's 'Freedom Day' today has some worried it could have a similar experience.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Friday, logging its largest weekly gain in a month, after upbeat retail sales data boosted expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.11% higher at 92.675. The index is up 0.6% for the week. 
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in June as demand for goods remained strong even as spending was shifting back to services.

A survey that showed U.S. consumer sentiment fell sharply and unexpectedly in early July to the lowest level in five months, as inflation worries dented confidence in the economic recovery, did little to dent the dollar's stronger tone.
Solid U.S. data and a shift in interest rate expectations after the Federal Reserve flagged in June sooner-than-expected hikes in 2023 have helped lift the dollar in recent weeks and made investors nervous about shorting it. 
Friday's gains for the dollar came despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterating on Thursday that rising inflation was likely to be transitory and that the U.S. central bank would continue to support the economy.
""The data was consistent with the economy making substantial strides and cements expectations of very robust second quarter growth of around 10%,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""A backdrop of rising inflation, falling unemployment and a resilient consumer makes a compelling case for the Fed to unwind stimulus,"" Manimbo said.

147,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 03:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s better-than-expected economic data in June and a stronger pickup in consumption prompted several economists to raise their growth forecasts for the rest of the year.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and ING Bank NV upgraded their projections, citing surprisingly strong activity last month and the central bank’s shift away from a policy tightening bias.
Data released Thursday showed China’s economy steadied in the second quarter with consumer spending and investment picking up. An industry breakdown of the data on Friday showed restaurants and hotels industries continued to expand at a solid pace of 17.1% last quarter, despite the fading of favorable base effects that skewed the figures in the first quarter.
There are positive signs the consumer recovery will continue, with Hui Shan, chief China economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). pointing to a drop in the household savings rate last quarter. The rise in savings up to the first quarter had held back consumption, but the decline last quarter was “encouraging,” she said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Friday.
Still, the durability of the consumer recovery depends on the broader economy, she said.
“The government’s push in driving up consumption goes way beyond just thinking about consumption coupons or income transfer,” she said. “You need to have solid, good quality jobs to increase income. And that’s where we still need a strong manufacturing sector,” she said.
The GDP data eased fears of a deeper slowdown, which had been partly fueled by the central bank’s unexpected move last week to boost bank liquidity and warnings from top officials about cyclical risks.
“The slowdown angst is overdone,” Standard Chartered economists led by Li Wei wrote in a report. “With gross domestic product growth already close to its potential level, the government has placed greater emphasis on ensuring a more balanced recovery in 2021.”
Here’s a summary of their views:
Growth risks remain in the second half of the year though, with authorities likely to keep a tight rein on the property market, local government financing vehicles and big tech companies. An uncertain outlook for global demand may also complicate the recovery.
Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) in Hong Kong, downgraded her full-year growth forecast to about 8.5% from 9%, which is still comfortably above the government’s target of more than 6%.

Investing.com - The dollar was largely flat in Europe early Friday, maintaining the week’s gains on a safe haven bid amid rising Covid-19 cases worldwide. High U.S. inflation is also lifting expectations of an early reduction in the Federal Reserve’s $120 billion in monthly bond purchases
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded flat at 92.620, edging towards gains of around 0.5% for the week which, if sustained, would mark its biggest weekly percentage gain in a month.
EUR/USD was marginally lower at 1.1808, GBP/USD slipped slightly to 1.3822, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7435, but is down 0.7% over the week.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.98 after the Bank of Japan kept its interest rates unchanged at a policy meeting, while cutting its forecast for the current fiscal year’s growth to 3.8% from April’s 4.0% forecast.
Rising Covid-19 cases, mainly in southeast Asia, but also in Europe and the U.S., have turned many traders risk averse, to the benefit of the dollar. 
In Australia, Melbourne has joined Sydney in lockdown, meaning around 40% of the country’s population are suffering from restrictions; Indonesia is now fighting a ""worst-case scenario"" epidemic, according to a senior minister; South Korea, previously a Covid success story, has been suffering from a new wave of persistent infections; while Japan has declared a state of emergency around Tokyo, meaning the upcoming Olympics will take place without spectators. Los Angeles county meanwhile has reinstated its mask mandate for indoor environments.
At the same time, although Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has tried to play down expectations of an early tightening move by the central bank, strong inflation numbers and a shift in interest rate expectations after the Fed flagged sooner-than-expected hikes in 2023 have put a floor under the greenback.
“With the Fed expected to start the QE tapering later this year and our economists’ view that the hiking cycle with start in 2H22 (with two rate hikes), the dollar downside vs the low yielding G10 FX (where central banks should remain cautious both this year and next) should be rather limited,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7014 after New Zealand’s consumer price index for the second quarter grew 3.3% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter, a decade high. 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is now widely expected to hike interest rates in August, earlier than expected.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia. However, the greenback is set for its best weekly gain in about a month as ongoing investor worries about a quicker-than-expected U.S. interest rate hike and by rising COVID-19 infections capped losses.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 92.575 by 11:45 PM ET (3:46 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 109.95. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded a two-day meeting earlier in the day, where it left its yield curve control (YCC) target unchanged at -0.1% for short-term interest rates and 0% for 10-year bond yields. BOJ also cut the current fiscal year’s growth forecast while maintaining that the economy was headed for a moderate recovery.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.7438, but with the lockdown in Australia’s biggest cities of Melbourne and Sydney weighing on the Australian dollar.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair gained 0.57% to 0.7020.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.13% to 6.4655 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 13838, with the U.K. set to lift most of its remaining COVID-19 on Jul. 19.
New Zealand’s consumer price index (CPI) for the second quarter was higher than expected, growing 3.3% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter, a decade high. The New Zealand dollar was among the biggest mover amongst majors in the morning trade after the data’s release.
Investors are now pricing an 86% chance that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will hike interest rates in August, earlier than expected, becoming the first developed-market central bank to exit from emergency policy settings should it do so.
However, a firm greenback meant that the New Zealand dollar remained within recent ranges.
""Clearly the U.S. dollar has got some power behind it, and I think that's holding back all the majors... there's an interest rate side to it, and sometimes it's a safe-haven bid... we do feel that the dollar's going to be quite strong over the next few months,"" Westpac strategist Imre Speizer told Reuters.
With Speizer adding that recent U.S. data fed into higher yields and rate-increase expectations, investors now await data on June core retail sales as well as the Michigan consumer sentiment and expectations indexes, due later in the day.
U.S. Treasuries recorded a third consecutive week of gains, with worries over surging COVID-19 outbreaks involving the Delta variant and bets on inflation being transitory pulling long-end yields lower.
The Thai baht, one of the currencies most battered by the recent COVID-19 outbreaks, was set for a fifth consecutive weekly loss as the country posted a record number of daily cases.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar advanced on Thursday, recovering much of the ground lost in the prior session after the head of the Federal Reserve told Congress he saw no need to rush the shift towards tighter post-pandemic monetary policy.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.2% higher at 92.603. The index fell as low as 92.272 earlier in the session.
The index has climbed in recent weeks as investors get more sanguine about the outlook for the greenback, driven by an increasingly upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy by the Federal Reserve, which has brought forward the time frame on when it will next raise rates.
On Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/higher-inflation-virus-risks-follow-feds-powell-congress-2021-07-14 he is confident recent price hikes are associated with the country's post-pandemic reopening and will fade, and that the Fed should stay focused on getting as many people back to work as possible.
""There are, of course, differing voices on the FOMC but the Chairman’s position seems quite clear; the taper discussion and decision will not occur until late this year,"" Shaun Osborne, Chief FX Strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
Powell faced sharp questions https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/feds-powell-heads-senate-with-renomination-policy-inflation-backdrop-2021-07-15 about inflation and banking regulation in a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, issues likely at the forefront of his possible renomination to the top Fed post.
The greenback was helped Thursday by data https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-as-expected-idUSKBN2EL1HD that showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week as the labor market steadily gains traction.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely unchanged in Europe early Thursday, stabilizing after Wednesday’s weakness following Fed chair Jerome Powell insistence that it was too soon to withdraw the central bank’s hefty monetary support for the economy.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 92.350, falling back from the high of 92.832 seen earlier this week.
USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 109.88, EUR/USD was marginally lower at 1.1832, having climbed from close to its three-month low of 1.1772, GBP/USD slipped slightly to 1.3851, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7463.
Soaring U.S. inflation, with consumer prices rising by 5.4% in June and producer prices by 7.3%, has prompted some FOMC members to suggest the time was coming for the U.S. central bank to rein in its massive bond-buying program.
However, Powell once again shrugged off the spike in U.S. inflation as only temporary, saying in testimony before Congress on Wednesday that it would be a mistake to act prematurely and that economic conditions for tapering bond buying was ""still a ways off"".
“Powell sees the next six months as critical for inflation, to see if [it] falls back like they expect,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management, in a note. “The Fed is trailing behind the New Zealand, Canadian and the U.K. central banks, and the worry is it will fall further behind on the curve and be forced to tighten more aggressively in the future.”
The Federal Reserve chairman returns to Capitol Hill later on Thursday for further testimony, and traders will be looking to see if he moderates his language over tapering at all.
Ahead of his latest appearance comes the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, the most current indication of the strength of the U.S. labor market - a key focus for the Fed given the market is still 7.5 million jobs short of its level before the pandemic erupted in early 2020. 
Still, dollar losses have been limited amid concerns over spiking Covid-19 cases, particularly in southwest Asia but also in the U.S. and the U.K., even with England set to fully reopen next week. 
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4617 after China's economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, with GDP rising 7.9% from a year earlier, missing expectations for a rise of 8.1%.
USD/CAD rose 0.2% to 1.2532 the day after the Bank of Canada dialed back its bond-buying program, saying at its policy meeting that it would cut its weekly net purchases of government bonds to a target of C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) from C$3 billion. 
USD/TRY was largely unchanged at 8.5809, after the lira strengthened overnight as Turkey’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a fourth month. It also largely ruled out a cut in the summer, warning of “possible volatility” in inflation as the economy reopens.

The NZD/USD pair was down 0.30% to 0.7011, paring some of its gains made after Wednesday’s Reserve Bank of New Zealand policy decision. The central bank’s surprise move to halt its large-scale asset-purchase program from the following week carried the New Zealand dollar through its best session in nearly five months overnight.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.4646, with the yuan easing from the one-month high hit during the previous session and last at 6.4613 per dollar in offshore trade.
Data released earlier in the day said the Chinese GDP grew 7.9% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Industrial production also grew 8.3% year-on-year in June while the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar pared recent gains on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress the U.S. economy was ""still a ways off"" from levels the central bank wanted to see before tapering its monetary support.
His comments came as a report showed U.S. producer prices rose more than expected, posting their biggest annual increase in more than 10-1/2 years. A day earlier, data showed June U.S. inflation hit its highest in more than 13 years.
The strong inflation has lifted the greenback to just shy of its three-month high, as focus sharpened on when central banks around the world will begin withdrawing pandemic-era stimulus.
That focus intensified on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it was ending bond purchases, raising expectations it could raise interest rates as soon as August. The Bank of Canada said it would cut its weekly bond purchases to C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) from C$3 billion.
But Powell, at the beginning of his two-day testimony to Congress, said the Fed is firm in its belief that current price increases are tied to the economic reopening and are transitory.
""Powell maintained the dovish message, kind of pushing back against any concerns that he would change his tune, or the more patient approach that he's been talking about, after the above expectation inflation release,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
""They are still on this path to slowly taper asset purchases before they even start to consider rate hikes, so we're still a couple of years away from that tightening based on everything that we've heard today,"" he said.
The dollar index was down 0.43% at 92.404, after rising as high as 92.832 - just below the 92.844 hit last week for the first time since April 5. Graphic: World FX rates https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E 
The greenback slipped 0.45% against the euro to $1.183, after touching its highest since April 5.
""The dip for the euro back below 1.18 yesterday was probably a little bit overdone and so this recovery today, I think, would have happened even without Powell's comments,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc.
The dollar rose almost 3% last month after the Fed's hawkish pivot forced markets to reassess when tapering and rate hikes might start. It firmed 0.6% on Tuesday after the inflation data.
The kiwi soared against the greenback after New Zealand's central bank announced it would cut short a NZ$100 billion ($70 billion) bond-buying program. It added to the gains after Powell's comments, standing 1.29% higher. 
Analysts have brought forward calls for a rate rise to as early as August, which would put New Zealand at the forefront of countries to raise interest rates.

The divergence in monetary policy outlooks pushed the Australian dollar 0.74% lower against its New Zealand counterpart to NZ$1.0636, the lowest since early June.
The Canadian dollar slid 0.04% to $1.25065, after the Bank of Canada said it would keep interest rates unchanged until economic slack is absorbed, which is expected to happen in the second half of 2022.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, handing back some of the previous session’s sharp gains after a jump in U.S. inflation raised expectations of an early move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.698, falling back from the previous session’s high of 92.832, just below the three-month peak of 92.844 reached last week.
USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 110.48, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1789, just above its three-month low of 1.1772, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7460.
U.S. consumer prices rose by 0.9% in June, the most in 13 years, with the year-on-year figure soaring 5.4% as the economic recovery gathered momentum.
“While everyone expected price pressures to increase, [this] report illustrates how significant the problem has become. Not only are prices rising sharply, but the increases are more widespread, which means prices can remain high for longer,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management, in a note.
This puts the spotlight firmly on Fed chair Jerome Powell as he testifies before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, with the market looking for any signals on the timing of a tapering of stimulus and higher interest rates. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3837 after U.K. consumer prices climbed 2.5% on the year in June, the biggest rise since August 2018 and the second month in a row that inflation has surprised to the upside.
While this will increase the pressure on the Bank of England to act, the data also showed factory gate prices rising more slowly, suggesting that the impact of the sharp commodity price rises is fading.
NZD/USD soared 1.2% to 0.7026 after New Zealand's central bank ended its NZ$100 billion bond-buying program, effectively signaling that an interest rate hike was just around the corner.
The country’s economy has been less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic than many, growing 1.6% in the first quarter, raising concerns that the stimulative monetary policies could lead to overheating.
There are more central bank meetings due Wednesday. The Bank of Canada is widely expected to announce further asset tapering, while Turkey’s central bank is likely to keep interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month given a weak currency and rising prices.
USD/CAD traded 0.1% lower at 1.249 and USD/TRY rose 0.1% to 8.6261.
Also, USD/ZAR fell 0.2% to 14.6922, with the rand bouncing slightly after falling almost 3% over the last week in the wake of the violence that erupted following the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, hitting a three-month high versus the euro and a one-week high versus the yen. Higher-than-expected inflation in the U.S. re-triggered bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten its monetary policy faster than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 92.727 by 12:03 AM ET (4:03 AM GMT).
The NZD/USD pair rose 0.99% to 0.7014, climbing over the 0.7 mark. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. In a surprise move, RBNZ also said it would halt its large-scale asset-purchase program from the following week.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7459. Australia’s Westpac consumer sentiment index, released earlier in the day, rose 1.5% in July against the previous month’s 5.2% drop, but Sydney also extended its COVID-19 lockdown by another two weeks.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.4748, ahead of the release of Chinese GDP and industrial production data on Thursday.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 110.48 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.3819.
U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years in June, with the core consumer price index (CPI) rising a higher-than-expected 0.9% month-on-month. Supply constraints and a continued rebound in the costs of travel-related services from COVID-19-depressed levels as the economic recovery progresses contributed to rising inflationary pressures.
""Another hotter-than-expected U.S. CPI print has got the market wondering whether the lift in inflation will prove to be transitory or more enduring,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analyst Tapas Strickland said in a note.
""Markets have sided on the hawkish interpretation, bringing forward rate hike expectations to late 2022,"" leading to ""broad-based gains"" for the dollar, the note added.
Investors now await Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Although Powell has repeatedly insisted that higher inflationary pressures would be temporary, his testimony will be scrutinized for any hints on when the central bank will begin asset tapering and hike interest rates.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada will update its economic forecasts at a policy announcement later in the day, where the central bank is widely expected to announce further asset tapering.
The Canadian dollar held its biggest decline in a week ahead of the announcement, largely unchanged at C$1.2500 against its U.S. counterpart but weakening toward the two-and-a-half-month low of C$1.2590 reached during the previous week.
Other central banks will also hand down their policy decisions later in the week, with the Bank of Korea’s decision due on Thursday and the Bank of Japan’s decision due a day later."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar climbed to a 5-day high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday after data showed U.S. inflation data for June coming in hotter than expected, raising the prospect that inflationary concerns are set to linger.
U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in 13 years in June https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-inflation/u-s-consumer-prices-surge-in-june-idUSL1N2OO1VQ amid supply constraints and a continued rebound in the costs of travel-related services from pandemic-depressed levels as the economic recovery gathered momentum. 
""(This was) clearly an upside surprise. It will make (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill tomorrow a much trickier exercise than it would've otherwise been given that it will put some additional pressure on the 'transitory' narrative,"" said Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton in London.
""FX reaction is as one would expect given an upside surprise, with the dollar rallying across the board in line with the sharp rise in Treasury yields,"" said Brown. 
Traders are looking forward to Powell testifying before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday for any signals on the timing of potential U.S. tapering. 
Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory, noting that he expected supply chains to normalize and adapt. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen shares that view.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.59% higher at 92.762, its highest since July 8. The index is just shy of the three-month high of 92.844 touched last week. 
The possibility of U.S. stimulus withdrawal - brought to the fore by a surprise shift in tone last month from the Fed - has boosted the dollar in recent weeks despite a renewed rise in coronavirus cases in many parts of the world.
U.S. consumer price inflation data is likely to help boost the dollar higher.
""It kind of reinforced the Fed taper story and the dollar has been consolidating for the front of the week, and I think this was the kick that it needed to renew its gains,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.
Modest strength in the price of oil, a major export for Canada, failed to stanch the Canadian currency's losses against its U.S. counterpart. The loonie was down 0.5% to a four-day low against the dollar. The Canadian central bank is due to update its economic forecasts at a policy announcement on Wednesday.
Sterling fell on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-sterling/update-1-pound-extends-fall-after-u-s-inflation-data-lifts-dollar-idUSL1N2OP17X after the Bank of England scrapped pandemic-era curbs on dividend payments by banks, but warned some asset prices look stretched.

Investing.com - The dollar is largely unchanged in early European trade Tuesday, with traders adopting a cautious stance ahead of the release of the latest U.S. inflation data which could influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded flat at 92.257, in limited volume.
USD/JPY edged higher to 110.38, EUR/USD rose to 1.1860, GBP/USD slipped to 1.3878, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7487. 
The surprise shift in tone by the Federal Reserve last month, in bringing forward expectations of the first interest rate hike to 2023, has helped the dollar in recent weeks. This change was based on the U.S. economic recovery proceeding more quickly than previously expected, including a sharp rise in consumer inflation.
These expectations have been toned down in recent days, especially as Covid-19 cases started to rise again.
The “CPI data ... will tell us whether we did indeed see the peak in inflation in May – our economists think we did, forecasting a slowdown in headline CPI from 5.0% to 4.8% in June, potentially putting a cap on Fed rate expectations for now,” said analysts at ING, in a note.   
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to give his semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday this week. He has consistently taken a dovish stance that the surge in prices would prove temporary, and he could use this platform to again rein in expectations that the central bank will move quickly to normalize monetary policy.
“The dollar, whose rally lost steam late last week, may see bullish bets continue to ease on the back of that and also as the market now appears less in a rush to unwind its reflationary trades,” ING added. 
Elsewhere, USD/CNY dropped 0.2% to 6.4652 following the release of strong Chinese export data for June. The country’s exports rose 32.2% year-on-year, a rise from 27.9% growth in May, and indicative of solid global demand. 
NZD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.6984, ahead of the latest meeting of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday.
The central bank is widely expected to leave its official cash rate at 0.25%, but traders will be looking for signals that it may begin tightening monetary policy later this year on the back of a run of strong economic data.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia as investors await U.S. inflation data for clues about the likely timeline for asset tapering and interest rate hikes. They also digested better-than-expected Chinese trade data.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 92.227 by 1:42 AM ET (5:42 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 110.43.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.23% to 0.7492 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.6991.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.13% to 6.4668. Chinese trade data released earlier in the day said that exports rose 32.2% year-on-year, imports grew 36.7% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at $51.53 billion in June.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3888, with almost all the remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England due to be released on Jul. 19 despite a climbing number of cases.
Investors now await the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) for June, with the greenback holding modest gains against sterling, the Australian and New Zealand dollars and the Japanese yen ahead of the CPI’s release later in the day. The PPI is due later in the week.
""My back-of-the-envelope playbook is that we'd need a headline year-on-year number north of 5.5% to really set this market ablaze,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters, adding it could also lift bond yields and the dollar.
""We know inflation will be transitory, it's a question of how long it takes for the year-on-year change to head back to 2%… a number below 4.5% on the headline print and we should see the dollar/yen and dollar/Swiss franc duos under pressure.""
Meanwhile, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Juckes said the reaction would be bigger if inflation falls short, leading investors to bet the U.S. Federal Reserve can maintain an easy monetary policy for longer, with the yen a clear beneficiary.
With U.S. interest rate expectations driving the U.S. currency, it has gained nearly 2% since June, after the Fed sprung a surprise hawkish tone as it handed down its latest policy decision. The Fed’s projection of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes in 2023 also cleared out huge bets on a falling dollar.
Investors are increasingly turning to longer data bonds as the global economic recovery from COVID-19 also slows down.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, which will be monitored for both his response to the inflation figures as well as hints on when the central bank will begin asset tapering.
Other officials including Fed Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, Fed Atlanta President Raphael Bostic and Fed Boston President Eric Rosengren will make appearances later in the day ahead of Powell.
Meanwhile, central banks due to hand down policy decisions throughout the week include the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday, the Bank of Korea on Thursday and the Bank of Japan on Friday."

Investing.com – The dollar inched higher Monday, but the debate on whether doom or glory awaits the greenback continues to heat up ahead of a busy week that could provide fresh clues on inflation and Federal Reserve monetary policy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.15% to 92.26.
June CPI due Tuesday is expected to show inflation grew at 0.4%, slower than the 0.7% in May.
The expected slowing of inflation in June, however, has dividend opinion on what it means for the fate of the dollar.
Some suggest easing price pressures may force traders to ease bets on the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy sooner than expected. While others believe the market could be in for a hawkish surprise from the Fed.
“In the US, CPI data tomorrow will tell us whether we did indeed see the peak in inflation in May […] potentially putting a cap on Fed rate expectations for now,” ING said in a note.  “The dollar, whose rally lost steam late last week, may see bullish bets continue to ease on the back of that and also as the market now appears less in a rush to unwind its reflationary trades.”
But some on Wall Street have cautioned against betting that this is the beginning of the end for reflation, and point out that investor expectations for the Fed policy to remain supportive for longer are likely overdone.
“[W]e do not believe that the Fed can be counted on to be as dovish as many in the market assume, given the willingness of FOMC participants to raise the dots representing the federal funds rate in line with their higher projections for inflation,” it added. “We continue to recommend a long USD view, both against G10 and EM currencies.”
The sustained period of inflation will need the supportive backdrop of a growing economy supported by an improving labor market. “In order to see sustained inflation expectations increase, we need better jobs numbers and better growth,”  George Cipolloni a portfolio manager of Penn Mutual Asset Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Monday. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, could offer further insight into the central bank’s thinking on monetary policy at time when there appears to be a lack of cohesion on when the trimming of bond purchases should get underway."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed across the board on Monday as concerns about the pandemic encouraged investors to seek a safe haven, and as they awaited more clues about the global economic recovery. 
With markets hyper-sensitive to any talk of early tapering, U.S. inflation data on Tuesday will be closely watched ahead of testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday and Thursday.
""Market caution reigned at the start of the week, weighing on risk sentiment and boosting the U.S. dollar,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
Reports from around the globe of surging infections of the Delta coronavirus variant also hurt investors' appetite for riskier assets.
Investors will look to U.S. inflation data on Tuesday and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's economic testimony on Wednesday and Thursday as they gauge expectations for the Fed to dial back on stimulus as soon as this year, Manimbo said. 
""A hotter report will likely boost Treasury yields and the dollar, and bring the Fed taper conversation back to the forefront,"" Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics, said in a note.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.1% higher at 92.264. The index remains close to a 3-month high of 92.844 touched last week.
The Australian dollar, often viewed as a liquid proxy for risk, was 0.17% lower on the day. 
Sterling fell, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to confirm plans to remove nearly all remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England from July 19, despite a surge of cases to levels unseen for months.
The pound was 0.22% lower at $1.3879.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said China would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in long-term liquidity to underpin a post-COVID economic recovery that is starting to lose momentum.
""While welcome, the move also signals that the authorities are concerned about China’s growth prospects, so it's mixed news,"" said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Holding. 
The Canadian dollar was trading about 0.1% lower at 1.2462 to the greenback, or 80.22 U.S. cents.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday with attention returning to the outlook for U.S. inflation and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy as concerns over the global economic recovery ease.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.207, after touching a three-month top of 92.844 last week when risk aversion was at its height.
USD/JPY was largely flat at 110.16, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1867, edging back from its three-month low of $1.1781 seen last week, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3893, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7474, above Friday's seven-month low of 0.7410. 
The dollar posted strong gains throughout most of last week, helped by its safe haven status amid worries that the fast-spreading delta variant of the Covid-19 virus could hamper the global economic revival. 
However, this demand largely subsided on Friday, helped by China’s decision to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio to underpin a recovery that looked like it was losing momentum.
“We are still inclined to see the current market correction as temporary and see room for a return to a positive recovery story in 3Q, which should - in our view - fuel a recovery in activity currencies,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Attention this week is set to turn back to the outlook for U.S. inflation and the speed of the Federal Reserve's future policy tightening, with Tuesday seeing the release of consumer price data and Wednesday the release of factory gate price data. Additionally, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify in front of Congress on both Wednesday and Thursday.
Any signs that inflation could be more persistent than previously thought could lift expectations the Fed may quickly rein in its very easy monetary policy, supporting the dollar.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4746, with China set to release a deluge of economic data this week, including figures on trade, retail sales and industrial output.
Last week’s sudden easing in policy last week has raised concerns that this figures will show a slowing in the country’s recovery from the pandemic.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia. Risk currencies remained above their recent lows against both the U.S. currency and the yen as investor fears of a slowdown in the global economic recovery from COVID-19 calmed down for now.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 92.148 by 11:56 PM ET (3:56 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 110.16. Data released earlier in the day said Japan’s core machinery orders grew a better-than-expected 7.8% month-on-month and 12.2% year-on-year in May. The data also said the country’s producer price index (PPI) grew 5% year-on-year and 0.6% month-on-month in June.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7476 and across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair was down 0.23% to 0.6979. New Zealand’s electronic card retail sales grew 4% year-on-year and 0.9% month-on-month, both lower than their previous figures.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.4741, with Chinese trade data, including exports, imports and the trade balance, due to be released later in the week.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3904.
Investors’ focus turned to U.S. inflation and when the country’s Federal Reserve will start tightening its monetary policy ahead of the release of the U.S. core consumer price index (CPI) for June on Tuesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also testify before the Senate Banking Committee later in the week.
""If we see strong data, the Fed could bring forward their projection for their first rate hike further from their current forecast of 2023. That would also mean they have to finish tapering earlier,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior FX strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
A recovery in risk sentiment hampered the safe-haven yen ahead of the release of the U.S. CPI as well as the PPI. Should the data indicate inflation is more persistent than previously thought, the Fed could begin asset tapering sooner than expected and boost the greenback.
However, more benign data would benefit riskier currencies as asset tapering would begin later than expected in this scenario. Risk currencies slipped earlier in the previous week as disappointing economic data from several countries led to decreased investor bets.
The latest outbreaks of COVID-19, including the Delta variant of the virus, led to renewed restrictive measures in countries including Australia and South Korea and added to an already cautious mood.
However, the selloff had subsided by Friday, and investor sentiment further improved after the People’s Bank of China cut banks' reserve requirement ratio across the board in a surprise move to bolster China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
In cryptocurrencies, moves were small with bitcoin at $34,267 and ether at $2,137."

VENICE (Reuters) - Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said technical factors were probably at play in the recent surge in bond markets and warned that markets may be underestimating the risk of inflation.
U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply last week as investors came to the view that world economic growth may have peaked and a pick-up in inflation could prove transitory.
Summers told Reuters in an interview that the recent moves may be driven by ""a variety of technical factors,"" including ""a running down of Treasury accounts and an unwinding of speculative positions"". 
Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of 20 rich countries in Venice, Summers said markets do not have a great record in predicting future price rises.
""At times when inflation has significantly accelerated in the past, such as in the 1960s, markets have lagged rather than anticipated developments,"" he said.
Yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds had shot up earlier this year on expectations that hefty fiscal stimulus, vaccine roll outs and a strong recovery from the COVID-19 shock would revive long-dormant price rises.

Summers, now a Harvard University professor, has been vocal in warning about inflation risks, writing on his website in May that ""the primary risk to the U.S. economy is overheating — and inflation"". 
He wrote that the Federal Reserve and other policymakers should recognise that ""overheating, and not excessive slack, is the predominant near-term risk for the economy"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged lower on Friday, along with the Japanese yen, as riskier currencies were favored, with the rally in U.S. Treasuries running out of steam and global stock markets steadying.
Some recent soft U.S. data, along with a surge in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world, has fueled concerns that the global economic recovery was running out of steam, leading to an eight-day streak of declines for the 10-year Treasury yield that ended on Friday.
""This week was all about the bond market and the collapse in treasury yields,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA. ""Some of that move was probably overdone.""
The rise in yields supported riskier assets and currencies, with global stock markets rising and the commodity-linked Australian and New Zealand dollars catching a bid.
The Aussie rose 0.79% to $0.74905, after earlier touching a fresh low for the year at $0.7410, and the kiwi added 0.81% to $0.7002, having plunged more than 1% in the previous session.

The greenback's decline was likely due in part to profit-taking ahead of key U.S. inflation data for June due next week, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
""Dollar bulls are just pulling some chips off the table,"" he said.
The yen, perceived as a safe-haven currency, declined as risk appetite began to recover.
""Yesterday's decline in dollar-yen is reversing together with risk appetite in equities suggesting no wider spillover effects across markets for now - the same move is seen in the U.S. 10-year yield bouncing back above 1.3%,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank. 
The yen eased 0.39% to 110.185, giving back some of its gains against the greenback from Thursday, when it had its biggest daily rise since November.
The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.61% against the U.S. dollar to $1.2453 as oil prices rose and data showed Canada added more jobs than expected in June as public health restrictions were eased in several regions of the country.
Elsewhere, the People's Bank of China said it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) - the percentage of deposits lenders must hold on to - for all banks by 50 basis points, effective from July 15, helping spur the move back into riskier assets.
""We're probably going to see some further momentum from this RRR cut and I think we'll probably see some follow-through once Asia opens on Sunday,"" said OANDA's Moya.

Looking forward, U.S. retail sales numbers for June are also due next week, along with U.S. bank earnings.
Adding to the busy week ahead, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to appear before Congress, and rate decisions by central banks in Japan, Canada and New Zealand are on tap.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Friday with the safe haven benefiting from investors becoming more risk averse on concerns of the global economic recovery as Covid-19 cases surge again.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.505, just shy of Wednesday’s three-month high at 92.844.
USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 110.06, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1827, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7419, adding to Thursday’s 0.7% decline and just above the fresh low for the year at 0.7410. 
Concerns have been growing that the fast-spreading delta variant of the Covid-19 virus could hamper a global economic revival that is already showing pockets of weakness.
These worries resulted in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falling to its lowest in nearly five months at 1.25% late Thursday, pressuring the dollar, but has since rebounded to 1.34%. It was as high as 1.54% just two weeks ago.
San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly told the Financial Times in an interview published on Friday that: “One of the biggest risks to our global growth going forward is that we prematurely declare victory on Covid.""
""If the global economy . . . can’t get . . . higher rates of vaccination, really get Covid behind [us], then that’s a headwind on U.S. growth,"" Daly added.
Japan has already declared a state of emergency for Tokyo as cases rise, meaning that the upcoming Olympic Games will go ahead largely without spectators. Southeast Asia is now suffering record rises in deaths and cases, while infections are also rising in the likes of the U.K. and the U.S.
“New outbreaks are still one of the biggest downside risks in terms of the sustained economic recovery moving forward,” Mathias Cormann, secretary-general of the OECD, said Thursday.
Evidence of the patchy nature of the economic recovery came with the weekly U.S. unemployment data on Thursday, as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week.
Additionally, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3768 after the U.K. economy grew less than expected in May, with the country’s flash GDP estimate showing an expansion of 0.8%, a slowdown from the growth of 2% the month before, which was revised down.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4881, after China’s consumer price index grew a smaller-than-expected 1.1% year-on-year in June, while contracting a bigger-than-expected 0.4% month-on-month. Meanwhile, the producer price index grew 8.8% year-on-year, remaining uncomfortably high as Beijing tries to bolster a post-coronavirus revival.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, as concerns over the global economic recovery from COVID-19 continue to mount. Safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc also gained, while riskier currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars remained near multi-month lows.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 92.453 by 11:47 PM ET (3:47 AM GMT). However, the U.S. currency dropped from a three-month high.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.15% to 109.95, with the yen holding onto gains from the previous session's 0.8% rally. However, Japan has declared a fresh state of emergency in Tokyo, three weeks before the Olympic Games are due to open in the city, as COVID-19 case numbers continue to rise.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.7420 with the Australian dollar continuing its losses after dropping 0.7% and hitting its weakest since mid-December 2021 on Thursday. The current lockdown in Sydney could be extended as the city struggles to contain its latest outbreak.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.6940.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.09% to 6.4840. Chinese data, released earlier in the day, said the consumer price index (CPI) grew a smaller-than-expected 1.1% year-on-year in June, while contracting a bigger-than-expected 0.4% month-on-month. Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) grew 8.8% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3775.
The Swiss franc held on to its gains from the previous session, when it soared more than 1%, on Friday.
Bonds rallied while global stocks plunged as concerns about the outbreaks involving the Delta variant of COVID-19 derailing economic recovery mounted. The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield fell to a nearly five-month low of 1.25% during the previous session, from the 1.5440%-high hit two weeks ago.
This in turn has put pressure on the greenback.
""There is certainly a wind of change in markets,” as concerns about inflation now shift to concerns about growth, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
""There has not been a single catalyst triggering a turn in sentiment, instead it seems that an accumulation of events,"" including the rapid spread of the Delta variant and fears that central banks could begin asset tapering earlier than expected and delay the economic recovery from COVID-19, the note added.
Data released on Thursday also said 373,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the U.S. over the past week. The higher-than-expected number was another indication that the labor market’s recovery from COVID-19 continues to be uneven."

Investing.com – The dollar is winning over some of its detractors who have been pushed off the bearish bandwagon after the Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt started the countdown on policy tightening much earlier than expected.  
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.29% to 92.37.
The dollar has racked up gains since hitting a bottom in May, but for many, this run higher would turn out to be nothing more than relief rally, and losses would soon follow in the second half of the year as the downtrend resumes.
The crux of the bearish bet centered around the Federal Reserve's ultra loose monetary policy staying intact, while the European and global economy continued to recover. Unfortunately, caught wind of the faster pace of inflation, and made a hawkish pivot that has rocked the short dollar bet. 
ING on Thursday slashed its outlook on the EUR/USD to $1.23 from $1.28, conceding that its bet on weaker dollar into the back of the year was unlikely to take shape.
""On the assumption that the Fed starts formally tightening in 3Q22, it would be no surprise to see a bearish flattening of the US yield curve – preparing for the Fed to apply the monetary brakes – from 2Q22 onwards,"" ING said in a note. ""That is when we would expect the dollar to embark on a broad rally.""
For the months, the Federal Reserve shrugged off the turn up in the pace of inflation as transitory, and said it would let it run above target for some time under its new average inflation targeting regime. But the central bank's resolve to persist with this regime change was tested when inflation hit the highest levels in years.
""What has changed is that the Fed looks less committed to Average Inflation Targeting and more towards a conventional lift-off in rates which could come as early as autumn 2022,"" ING said in a note. ""This assumes the Fed starts tapering shortly after the August Jackson Hole gathering– a tapering process that could last until spring/summer '22.""
The Fed's worries over inflation were a hot topic in their June meeting.
""Although they generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced, a substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed,"" the Fed's minutes showed."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday from a three-month high against a basket of peers, with the euro getting a boost as investors unwound bets on risky currencies and as concerns over the spread of COVID variants increased the demand for safe havens.
The greenback was weaker against the euro, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, which are generally low-interest rate, stable markets that traders short, using the proceeds to buy riskier assets, said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
But with bond yields rising and equity markets tanking, riskier positions in currency markets were sold off, benefiting the euro, as well as the yen and the franc, which are also considered safe-haven currencies.
""When you have this kind of unwind going on, you've got strength in those currencies,"" said Loh.
The euro held on to earlier gains after the European Central Bank set a new inflation target and claimed a role in fighting climate change after a strategy review, with the single currency last up 0.39% against the dollar, at 1.18365. 
The dollar was 0.71% weaker against the yen at 109.825, with the yen having earlier touched 109.535, its strongest since June 11, while the Swiss franc touched 0.9134 versus the greenback, its firmest since June 17.

The global spread of COVID variants has added to fears that there could be some disappointment in terms of economic growth in the coming months, said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities.
""While we are cautious in interpreting price action at a time of the year when liquidity is not as plentiful, we think markets are contemplating a potential growth scare as the Delta variant spreads and infections rise,"" he said. 
Riskier currencies, like the Australian and New Zealand dollars, tumbled, with the Aussie down 0.78% at $0.7426, touching its weakest level since mid-December, and the Kiwi dropping 1.08% to $0.6943.
Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week, an indication that the labor market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be choppy.
""It's an indication that if these numbers continue not to be anything stellar, or that we're not moving towards full employment, that leaves the Fed room to just take it easy and not necessarily think about a tapering timeline,"" Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Inc, said of the data.
Minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's June policy meeting released on Wednesday showed that while the economic recovery ""was generally seen as not having yet been met,"" Fed officials agreed they should be poised to act if inflation or other risks materialized.

A Reuters poll expects the Fed to announce a strategy in August or September for tapering its asset purchases. While most predict the first cut to its bond-buying program will begin early next year, about a third of respondents forecast it will happen in the final quarter of this year.

Total credit climbed $35.3 billion from the prior month after an upwardly revised $20 billion gain in April, Federal Reserve figures showed Thursday. On an annualized basis, borrowing rose 10% in May. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a $18 billion gain.
Non-revolving credit, which includes auto and school loans, increased $26.1 billion, the most on record. Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, rose $9.2 billion after declining in the previous month.
Sales of motor vehicles were robust in both April and May at the same time car prices climbed. The combination has led to increased borrowing. Credit card balances, meanwhile, also rebounded by the most since 2019 as vaccinations and a pickup in social activity spurred spending.
The figures show a greater level of consumer confidence as the economy strengthens along with employment.

Investing.com - The dollar maintained a strong tone in early European trade Thursday after the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting indicated that the world’s most influential central bank is moving towards tightening monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.720, just below Wednesday’s three-month peak of 92.844.
USD/JPY was down 0.4% at 110.19, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1797, after falling to a three-month low of 1.1781 overnight, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3769, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.5% to 0.7440.
Traders had been waiting for the release of the minutes from the Fed’s June meeting as this was the gettogether at which the central bank hinted at two rate hikes in 2023, and signaled a greater likelihood of a first raise coming as early as 2022.
While the minutes showed the policymakers generally agreed that the conditions to begin scaling back its monthly bond purchases had not yet been reached, some of the group indicated that they could be ""met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data.""
“U.S. policy-makers are growing more comfortable with the idea of reducing asset purchases, and an announcement could be made as quickly as the fourth quarter of 2021,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management.
U.S. economic data has generally pointed to a strong economic recovery, and Thursday’s focus will be on the weekly unemployment data., due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week is seen dropping by 14,000 to 350,000, to a new pandemic-era low. Additionally, continuing jobless claims by individuals qualifying for unemployment insurance are seen falling by 134,000 to 3.335 million.
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank is set to announce the outcome of a 18-month strategy review at 1100 GMT, with the central bank expected to raise its inflation goal to 2%, from “below, but close to, 2%”, as well as describing the target as symmetric. 
Also, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4786, climbing to a near one-week high after China’s State Council, the country's cabinet, said authorities would use timely cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratios to support the economy. This has been taken by the market as a strong easing signal.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s June meeting, released on Wednesday, said the central bank is moving towards tapering its asset purchases as soon as 2021.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.11% to 92.748 by 12:48 AM ET (4:48 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.1% to 110.54 as the Japanese government plans to declare another COVID-19 state of emergency in Tokyo until Aug. 22 to combat a recent surge of COVID-19 cases. It will cover the duration of the Tokyo Olympics.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.7466. Reserve Bank Australia Governor Philip Lowe said earlier in the day that the central bank has not ruled out an interest rate rise before 2024.
""The condition for an increase in the cash rate depends upon the data, not the date; it is based on inflation outcomes, not the calendar… the central scenario remains that the condition for a lift in the cash rate will not be met until 2024,"" he said.
The NZD/USD pair fell 0.39% to 0.6992.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.1% to 6.4785 ahead of China's consumer price index and producer price index, due on Friday. The Chinese State Council also hinted that the People's Bank of China could cut its reserve requirement ratio for banks.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3785.
“The committee’s standard of ‘substantial further progress’ was generally seen as not having yet been met, though participants expected progress to continue… various participants mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings,” according to the minutes.
“The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains one of the more hawkish central banks under our coverage,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Carol Kong wrote in a client note. Kong added the Fed will begin tapering talks at the policy meeting at the end of July. “We, therefore, expect the dollar to trade with an upward bias.”
Meanwhile, the dollar traded at $1.1792 per euro, just below a three-month high of $1.17815 touched overnight, as German lower-than-expected data raised doubts about Europe’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Data released on Wednesday said that German industrial production decreased 0.3% month-on-month in May, compared to a 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank (ECB) is due to hand down a  monetary policy statement later in the day. Investors expect that the central bank will shift the inflation target to 2% from “below but close to 2%” currently, and ECB President Christine Lagarde is due to speak a day later."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar was slightly higher on Wednesday after the release of the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, which showed Fed officials wrestling with the onset of inflation and financial stability concerns but included no big surprises.
Fed officials last month felt substantial further progress on the economic recovery ""was generally seen as not having yet been met,"" but agreed they must be ready to act if inflation or other risks materialize, according to the minutes of the central bank's June policy meeting.
The greenback eased a bit following the release of the minutes, then reversed course and edged higher.
""Today's minutes only serve to confirm that the Fed is going to be reducing asset purchases some time this year most likely,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of BK Asset Management. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, was up 0.135% at 92.664, consolidating near its recent 3-month high, even as U.S. bond yields fell to their lowest levels since February. 
Pressure from the lower bond yields, along with some recent soft economic reports, likely contributed to the greenback's lackluster reaction to the Fed minutes, Lien said. 
But the U.S. economy is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic in better shape than Europe and Japan, which bodes well for the greenback, she added. 
""Bottom line is, there wasn't a big reaction, but I don't think it stands in the way of an extension of the gains in the dollar,"" she said. 
One of the main drivers of foreign exchange in the second half of the year will be the divergence of central banks that begin winding down monetary stimulus, based on solid economic fundamentals, and those that do not, said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
The U.S. dollar index is currently trading more than 3% above where it was in February when U.S. yields were last this low, he said. 
""Which brings us back to anticipated U.S. economic performance and eventual withdrawal of stimulus by the Fed,"" he said. 
The euro touched a three-month low against the dollar on Wednesday after German data raised doubts about the strength of the economic recovery.
The European single currency changed hands at $1.18035, having earlier touched a three-month low of $1.17815. Against the yen, it fell to 130.535 yen, edging near its two-month low of 130.05 set on June 21.
Investor sentiment in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, fell sharply in July, though it remained at a very high level, the ZEW economic research institute reported.
Other risk-sensitive currencies took a hit after oil prices plunged as OPEC producers cancelled a meeting when major players were unable to come to an agreement to increase supply. [O/R]
The Australian dollar dipped 0.14% to $0.7484, stabilizing after a bounce on Tuesday when the Reserve Bank of Australia took a first step towards stimulus tapering.

The RBA announced a third round of its quantitative easing program, albeit at a smaller size than the previous two rounds, while retaining the April 2024 bond for its three-year yield target of 0.1%.
The Japanese yen traded little changed at 110.590 yen per dollar, still holding on to gains from its 15-month low of 111.64 touched last week.

GENEVA(Reuters) - The World Trade Organization hosts talks next week aimed at reaching a deal to cap subsidies that contribute to the overfishing of the world's seas and oceans.
Prospects for a breakthrough appear dim. WTO delegates have been negotiating for 20 years and only last December agreed on the definition of ""fish"".
The WTO's new director general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has said a deal is a top priority but she has also expressed doubts about a July conclusion.
The portion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels has plunged from 90% in 1990 to less than 66% in 2017, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation, with some regions like the Mediterranean significantly lower. 
Graphic: State of the world's fish stocks: https://graphics.reuters.com/TRADE-WTO/FISHERIES/qzjvqxoydpx/fishStocks.jpg 
Environmentalists say knocking out harmful subsidies is the single most important thing governments can do to help reverse the decline.
WTO delegates in Geneva are negotiating to try to clinch a deal ahead of the July 15 virtual ministerial meeting.
However, negotiators have already missed a 2020 deadline fixed by the United Nations, and the DG herself has expressed doubts about a July conclusion.
WHAT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM?
Governments have been subsidising their fleets for centuries for reasons ranging from food security to national pride to pressure from industry lobbies.
Since World War II, global marine catches have continued to grow, until they peaked at 86 million tonnes in 1996.
Without government intervention, smaller catches would put some fishermen out of business. But subsidies which reduce their operating costs such as for fuel mean they can continue. 
Graphic: Fishing subsidies: https://graphics.reuters.com/TRADE-WTO/FISHERIES/dgkvlralevb/fishingSubsidies.jpg 
This is creating what fisheries biologist Daniel Pauly at the University of British Colombia describes as a ""race to the bottom"", with countries that have depleted stocks in their own waters travelling further to compete for those that remain.
The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that an ambitious deal at the WTO could boost global fish biomass by 12.5% by 2050, based on a model it shared with negotiators https://www1.pewtrusts.org/nb/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/06/07/ending-harmful-subsidies-could-increase-amount-of-fish-in-the-ocean-research-shows.
However, a more recent draft showed more modest gains of less than 2%. See graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2V49JLS 
Graphic: Replenishing fish stocks: https://graphics.reuters.com/TRADE-WTO/FISHERIES/rlgpdraoopo/stocksReplenished.jpg 
WHERE IS THE CRISIS DEEPEST?
Among the biggest losers are developing countries like Senegal whose economies rely heavily on fishing but who do not have resources to develop large industrial fleets to compete with those entering their own waters.
This can deprive locals of both livelihoods and a vital source of protein. Already, falling stocks of predator fish like white groupers have forced a switch to smaller sardinella.
The environmental impact of subsidies is also being felt on the high seas, beyond nations' territorial waters.
Some activists point to the Indian Ocean as a good example, where 94% of yellowfin tuna stocks are overfished and the biggest single fleet is from the EU, according to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.
There are also concerns that hundreds of Chinese squid jiggers that come to fish near the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands each year will deplete stocks and rob other species such as tuna, fur seals and hammerhead sharks of their prey.
WHO ARE THE MAJOR SUBSIDISERS?
Global subsidies are estimated at $35.4 billion according to a 2019 study published in Marine Policy https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X19303677.
The top five subsidisers are China, the EU, the United States, South Korea and Japan, it said. However, not all subsidies are ""harmful"" and within the scope of a WTO agreement.
Without subsidies, much high-seas fishing would not be profitable, including damaging deep-sea bottom trawling, a 2018 article in Science Advances https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaat2504 said.
HOW CLOSE IS THE WTO TO A DEAL?
Countries have failed before, with talks ending in discord at the last WTO ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in 2017. But analysts warn that coming away empty-handed would be a major blow to the organisation, which has not agreed a multilateral deal in years.
In this round of talks, led by Colombia's Santiago Wills, five draft versions of the agreement have been produced.
However, in a sign that much remains to be decided, the latest draft released last week still had 84 pairs of square brackets, indicating parts of the draft that have not yet been agreed on.
Negotiators say the most vexed outstanding issue is the size of exemptions for developing countries, with countries like India pushing for big carve-outs.

Beijing continues to oppose a high-seas provision which many delegates see as problematic. Some also see proposals such as one by Washington on forced labour in May as unhelpful since they are unlikely to be agreed by all 164 members.
Many negotiators see the virtual format of the July meeting imposed by COVID measures as a handicap.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday ahead of the release of the keenly-awaited minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, with traders looking for clues on the direction of the economy and interest rates.
At 4:04 AM ET (0804 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.483.
USD/JPY was flat at 110.60, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1831, while GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3812, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7505.
The dollar received a boost Tuesday as volatility surrounding the price of oil, the Chinese clampdown on the tech sector and a weak ISM non-manufacturing reading prompted a bout of risk aversion.
However, the greenback has since given back some of those gains ahead of the release of the minutes from the Fed’s June 2021 meeting, at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT), which are widely expected to offer clues to the central’s bank’s policy outlook moving forward.
“Concerns about a slower recovery after the grim non-manufacturing ISM reading yesterday are inherently tied to Fed’s rate expectations, and some investors may start to feel the danger of a Fed that will have to go ahead with its tightening cycle in 2023 even if the economy is in a more vulnerable state than currently expected,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
“ The FOMC June minutes are therefore set to be watched closely today, with markets weighing carefully the rationale behind the hawkish shift by policymakers.”
Additionally, the May release of job openings and labor turnover, at 10 AM ET, is expected to show 9.4 million vacancies for May, a small increase on the number of vacancies in April."

The USD/JPY pair held steady at 110.61.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7491 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7015.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to 6.4714 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3798.
The euro traded at $1.1820, after hitting a three-month low of $1.1806 during the previous session. It also fell against the yen to 130.81 yen, close to a two-month low of 130.05 hit on Jun. 21.
Data released on Tuesday said that the German Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW) economic sentiment index fell sharply to 63.3, below the 75.2 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and June’s 79.8 figure.
Separate data also said that German factory orders contracted 3.7% month-on-month in May, against the 1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and April’s 1.2% growth.
Meanwhile, the ongoing production dispute among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) that caused a plunge in prices dampened sentiment for other risk-sensitive currencies.
The Australian dollar also gave up its gains from Tuesday as investors digested the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)’s policy decision handed down that day. In its first step towards asset tapering, the RBA announced a smaller, third round of its quantitative easing program and retained the April 2024 bond for its three-year yield target of 0.1%. The interest rate remained unchanged at 0.1%.
In the U.S., yields recently took a tumble after investors who had bet that the Fed would tighten its monetary policy sooner than expected thanks to rising inflation were forced to bail out of their positions.
The minutes from the Fed’s June 2021 meeting, to be released later in the day, are widely expected to offer clues to the central’s bank’s policy outlook moving forward.
However, some investors said that the clues are already there.
“Many people seem to think the Fed will drop hints on tapering in August, and will say in September that it is considered, and it will be implemented in December. But I believe the Fed could move earlier than those timelines,” Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno told Reuters.
“The important point is, the Fed did already raise their inflation forecast,” Uno added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained against a basket of peer currencies on Tuesday following the U.S. Independence Day long weekend as traders positioned themselves ahead of the release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's pivotal June meeting.
Market participants will be looking for clues as to when the Fed will begin to taper its pandemic-induced bond-buying spree amid a recovering economy, when minutes of the June meeting are published on Wednesday. 
""Investors are bracing themselves for possibly more of a hawkish spin from these minutes and that should provide some upside here for the dollar,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. 
At 3 p.m. Eastern time, the dollar index was up 0.328% at 92.550.
The greenback's move came even as U.S. Treasury yields fell after data signaled that growth in the service sector had slowed, with the benchmark 10-year note on track for its longest streak of declines in 16 months.
Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed that U.S. services industry activity moderated in June, likely restrained by labor and raw material shortages, resulting in unfinished work continuing to pile up. The ISM survey's measure of service employment fell to a reading of 49.3 in June from 55.3 in May.
That followed a mixed U.S. jobs report on Friday, which caused the dollar to retreat from a three-month high.
""Even though the developments in the U.S. economy, as far as the statistics go, are not going to prompt the Fed into any fast rate increases, you're still ahead and way ahead of what’s going on in its competitors,"" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com. 
Disappointing data out of Europe sent the euro towards a three-month low against the dollar. 
Investor sentiment in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, remains at a high level but fell sharply in July, the ZEW economic research institute reported, while data showed orders for German-made goods posted their sharpest slump in May since the first lockdown in 2020.
The data dented the euro, which was down 0.37% at $1.18235 against the greenback. It fell to an early April low of $1.1807 last week.
European Central Bank policymakers are in the middle of debating a new strategy, with many now backing the notion of letting inflation surpass 2% for a while after it lagged below that level for most of the past decade.
Sterling was down 0.34% against the dollar at $1.38005 after having hit a one-week high of $1.3888, with markets looking forward to England becoming the first major country to formally start living with the coronavirus by dropping COVID-related curbs in two weeks' time. [GBP/]
The New Zealand dollar eased 0.27% to $0.70135, erasing gains made earlier in the day as traders wagered a rate hike could come as early as November following a strikingly strong survey of business conditions. 
The Aussie slid 0.38% to $0.74965, having risen as much as 1.2% earlier after the Reserve Bank of Australia pared bond purchases and tweaked its rates outlook to open the door just a sliver for the possibility of hikes before 2024.

That decision puts the RBA in a small but growing club of central banks stepping back from massive pandemic-era stimulus.

Investing.com – The dollar inched higher Tuesday, as investors fled to safety amid weaker-than-expected services data just a day ahead of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting that could provide further clues on tapering.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, climbed by 0.14% to 92.54.
The June ISM Services PMI slipped by more than expected in June to 60.1 from 64.0 last month, and missed economists' forecasts of 63.5.  
The soft services activity stoked some worries that the rapid pace of economic expansion is in its final innings, triggering a rush to safety and benefiting the greenback.
The bid up in the dollar comes just days after the U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that the economy created more jobs than expected. A deeper look into the data, however, suggests there remains plenty of slack in the labor market amid a supply shortages that could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy later than expected.
""We expect it [Fed] to provide forward guidance in September and announce tapering at the end of 1Q22, one quarter later than consensus,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. ""There are inherent uncertainty bands around this view and given the speed of the labor market recovery I would place the risk of a sooner than later start to tapering,"" Morgan Stanley Economist Ellen Zentner said in a note.
Further insight into the Fed's thinking on monetary policy including tapering could arrive as soon as Wednesday, with release of the minutes of the central bank's meeting on July 15 to July 16.
""In the minutes, we will be looking for more details on the discussion about liftoff and tapering as well as the outlook for inflation as there was a clear shift in tone to the hawkish side coming out of this meeting,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in note.  "

Investing.com - The dollar sold off in early European trade Tuesday, continuing its post nonfarm payrolls weakness, while both the Australian and New Zealand dollars strengthened amid signs that these economies are recovering strongly. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% lower at 92.028,.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 110.81, EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.1893, while GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3893, benefiting from U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing on Monday that all Covid restrictions are expected to be lifted in England in two weeks’ time.
The dollar has been dropping since Friday’s jobs report, as although the release was upbeat, in that 850,000 jobs were added in June, it wasn’t sufficiently strong to push the Federal Reserve into tapering its asset buying anytime soon.
U.S. interest rate markets slightly softened their stance on early Fed tightening as a result of the jobs data, and that tone is likely to continue until Wednesday’s release of the minutes of the Fed’s June meeting. This was the meeting where officials brought forward their expectations of when interest rates will be raised to 2023.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD rose 0.8% at 0.7590 after the Reserve Bank of Australia announced a pared-back extension of its quantitative easing program, while stating that it expects to keep interest rates at a record low until 2024.
“The bond purchase program is playing an important role in supporting the Australian economy,” Governor Philip Lowe said. “The bank will continue to purchase bonds given that we remain some distance from the inflation and employment objectives. However, the board is responding to the stronger-than-expected economic recovery and the improved outlook by adjusting the weekly amount purchased.”
Additionally, NZD/USD rose 1.1% to 0.7099 after a survey by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research published Tuesday showed more companies expect an improved business climate, bringing forward expectations of the country’s first interest rate hike to the end of this year.
Elsewhere a sharp rise in oil prices after the group of top producers failed to come up with an agreement to increase output levels lent support to currencies linked to the price of crude, with USD/NOK down 0.4% at 8.5383 and USD/CAD down 0.3% at 1.2306.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia. The New Zealand dollar, meanwhile, rose as a strong business survey in New Zealand drove expectations for an earlier-than-expected interest rate hike.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.28% to 92.157 by 12:52 AM ET (4:52 AM GMT).
The NZD/USD pair rose 0.80% to 0.7082 and the AUD/USD pair was up 0.36% to 0.7556.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 110.84 while the USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.4635.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.25% to 1.3880, with the U.K. set to end social distancing and capacity limits at venues in England from Jul. 19.
The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) business confidence index climbed from the first quarter’s 13% contraction to 7% growth in the second quarter of 2021. The sharp improvement also prompted ASB Bank to pull forward interest rate hike expectations to November 2021.
""It is very clear that record amounts of monetary stimulus are no longer needed to support the economy and inflation risks are getting too high for comfort... we now expect the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to start lifting the official cash rate from November 2021 instead of the previous May 2022,"" ASB senior economist Jane Turner said in a note.
Should RBNZ hike rates in November as predicted, it would join Norges Bank, which out of the Group of 10, or G10, central banks is alone in forecasting a hike in 2021.
Across the Tasman Sea, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.10% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day. The RBA has previously said that it would keep rates unchanged until 2024, and the New Zealand dollar hit a one-month high against its Antipodean counterpart ahead of the decision.
Elsewhere, investors are also monitoring a sharp rise in oil prices after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) abandoned its latest meeting on Monday. The Norwegian crown was up 0.3% during the previous session, while rising prices also lent support to the Canadian dollar.
U.S. markets were closed for a holiday on Monday, with the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for June due later in the day.
Investors also await the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting, due later in the day. The minutes could determine the greenback’s near-term direction as they provide clues on the central bank’s surprise hawkish shift during that meeting that projected rate hikes starting in 2023.
""We still think it's a bit early for any material detail to be decided about tapering, but these minutes may certainly offer the beginnings of providing at least some sense of what members are thinking,"" RBC Capital Markets Asia FX strategist Alvin Tan told Reuters."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against a basket of major currencies on Monday, after hitting a speed bump when last week's mixed bag of U.S. labour data allayed investor fears about a faster end to monetary stimulus.
While the headline June job creation figure beat forecasts, unemployment ticked higher and workforce participation didn't budge - suggesting positive progress, but space for the Federal Reserve to wait before tapering asset buying or hiking rates.
Bonds rallied, stocks rose and the dollar slipped in the wake of the data - dropping most against the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars and the rates-sensitive yen.
While attempting a bounce in Asian and early European trading, by midday in London the greenback had fallen back to its lowest levels since Wednesday . 
It gained about 0.2% against the kiwi, which sat at $0.7022, traded 0.05% lower at 110.94 yen and was last flat at $1.1863 per euro.
U.S. markets are closed on Monday for the Independence Day holiday.
""Friday's NFP jobs report gave something for everyone in terms of an above-consensus NFP gain, but also an above-consensus unemployment rate,"" strategists at ING said in a note to clients. 
""U.S. interest rate markets slightly softened their stance on early Fed tightening and the dollar ended slightly softer. Today's U.S. public holiday suggests trading will be quiet today, although the Fed story will very much re-emerge on Wednesday evening when investors pore through the minutes of the pivotal June 16th FOMC (Federal Open Markets Committee) meeting.""
The dollar index was last 0.1% lower at 92.262, falling below Friday's levels. But with a 2% rise in the three weeks since the Fed surprised investors with projected hikes in 2023, analysts think the dollar has room to rise a bit further.
""Since the hawkish tilt of the Fed in June, the dollar has been increasingly sensitive to the strength of the domestic data whilst some DM and EM peers still battle COVID outbreaks,"" analysts at Maybank in Singapore said in a research note.
""As such, this dollar strength can linger a while longer and a sanguine risk climate may not be entirely detrimental for the greenback at this time.""
Elsewhere, sterling was 0.2% higher at $1.3860 and emerging market currencies in Asia made small gains to catch up with the dollar's Friday drop. [EMRG/FRX]
MINUTES 
Traders' focus this week is on minutes from the Fed's June meeting - due Wednesday - and on a meeting of Australia's central bank, both having the potential to rouse currencies from months of range trading amid uncertainty around policy outlook. 
""More information on when the FOMC could taper its asset purchases can boost U.S. interest rates and the dollar,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Joe Capurso, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
""So can further evidence that the FOMC's outlook for inflation is shifting. In particular, analysts will look for signs that the FOMC is less confident the spike in inflation will be transitory,"" he said. ""Or that the FOMC's tolerance for an inflation overshoot is waning.""
Also on the horizon this week is a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting on Tuesday, which has markets on tenterhooks because the central bank has flagged a decision on the fate of its bond purchase programme and yield target.
No change to the cash rate is likely, but economists expect the three-year yield target to stay on April 2024 bond - without being extended to the November 2024 bond line, and for the RBA to adopt a flexible approach to bond purchases.

""RBA policy has successfully contained AUD strength despite strong terms-of-trade; but with undervaluation approaching historical extremes, dovish surprises may have less impact on FX,"" BoFA Global Research analysts said in a note.
Cryptocurrencies were offered on Monday, with bitcoin below its 20-day moving average at $33,737 and ether down 4% at $2,229.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Monday, handing back some of its recent gains after Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report eased concerns about an early move by the Federal Reserve to rein in its accommodative monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.317, after falling around 0.3% on Friday from a three-month high.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 111.13, EUR/USD edged down to 1.1856, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3831, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7516, ahead of Tuesday’s Reserve Bank of Australia meeting, which could see a decision on the fate of its bond purchase program and yield target.
The dollar strengthened for large parts of last week on rising expectations of an early move by the Federal Reserve to normalize monetary policy, given surging inflation and reasonably strong U.S. employment data.
However, while Friday’s jobs report said that nonfarm payrolls grew by a higher-than-expected 850,000 in June, the unemployment rate was also higher than expected and the pace of hourly earnings growth slowed, easing concerns that the central bank would raise interest rates sooner than expected.
This report “would probably not convince the Federal Reserve to change its current policy,"" said David I. Kass, Clinical Professor of Finance with the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland.
Trading ranges are likely to be limited Monday, with the U.S. on holiday, and attention will likely turn to Wednesday’s release of the minutes of the Fed’s June meeting, when officials opened talks on tapering bond-buying and pointed to interest rate increases coming sooner than previously guided.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.4597 after a private study showed a slowing of growth in China’s services sector, with the Caixin services purchasing managers index falling to 50.3 in June, lower than May’s 55.1 figure, and a 14-month low.
USD/TRY fell 0.1% to 8.6690 ahead of the release of Turkey’s latest inflation data. This is expected, later Monday, to show inflation rose an annual 16.8% in June, up from 16.6% in the previous month, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 18 analysts. Such a result would limit the chances of a cut in interest rates at the next central bank meeting.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, hitting pause on its recent gains, after the latest U.S. jobs report eased concerns about an earlier-than-expected hike in U.S. interest rates.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.10% to 92.325 by 1:03 AM ET (5:03 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 111.15, with Japan’s services PMI for June at a higher-than-expected 48.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.7517. Data released earlier in the day in Australia said the services PMI at a slightly higher-than-forecast 56.8, while retail sales grew a better-than-expected 0.4% month-on-month in May.
The NZD/USD pair also edged down 0.11% to 0.7018.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.15% to 6.4626. Chinese data released earlier in the day said that the Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.3 in June, lower than the 55.1 figure reported for the previous month.
The GBP/USD pair was steady at1.3821.
The U.S. jobs report said that non-farm payrolls grew by a higher-than-expected 850,000 in June. However, the unemployment rate was also higher than expected at 5.9%, easing concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates sooner than expected.
""The report was mixed enough to probably keep the Fed from announcing tapering soon,"" Westpac analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
""I think the market was thinking you'd get a signal at the Jackson Hole meeting in August. This report says that that just might be a bit early,"" he added.
Investors now await the minutes from the Fed’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)'s latest meeting, to be released later in the week. The minutes will be closely scrutinized as it was at this meeting that the Fed hinted at interest rate hikes beginning in 2023 in a surprise hawkish shift in its monetary policy.
""The minutes will likely reinforce the FOMC's hawkish shift,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. dollar net shorts fell to their lowest level since late April, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The value of the net short dollar position dropped to $10.44 billion in the week ended June 29, from net shorts of $12.80 billion the previous week. U.S. dollar net short contracts slid for a second straight week.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Swiss franc, as well as the Canadian and Australian dollars.
In a broader measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the greenback posted a net short position of $10.94 billion this week, compared with net shorts of $13.04 billion the week before.
The dollar has gained ground ever since the Federal Reserve took a surprising hawkish stance at its monetary policy meeting last month. Fed forecasts have penciled in two U.S. rate increases by the end of 2023.
For the month of June, the dollar index posted its best monthly performance since November 2016.
The dollar though on Friday gave up its gains after the release of what has been considered a mixed U.S. non-farm payrolls report.
""Although our non-consensus view that the U.S. dollar would strengthen this summer has been more than matched by recent market moves, we have not yet seen enough evidence to lower our long held six-month forecast of euro/dollar at $1.17,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank in London.
The euro last traded up 0.1% at $1.1862.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin net shorts fell to 1,345 contracts in the week ended June 29, from net shorts of 1,528 the previous week.
Bitcoin's rise has stalled this year in the wake of crackdowns on the crypto sector in China, Japan, Britain, and more recently Thailand.
Since hitting an all-time high of just under $65,000 in mid-April, bitcoin has fallen about 50%. On Friday, bitcoin was down 0.9% at $33,253. For the month of June, the world's most popular cryptocurrency has fallen 5%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar dropped from three-month high earlier on Friday, weighed down by what analysts viewed as a mixed U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for June, that showed a strong headline number but with some weak components.
Volume is expected to thin out later in the session ahead of the July Fourth holiday weekend.
Despite a soft dollar on Friday, it posted the week on a positive note, with an 0.5% gain. Going into the report, the dollar traded higher on the expectation of a robust jobs number.
Data showed that U.S. nonfarm payrolls did beat expectations, increasing by 850,000 jobs last month after rising 583,000 in May. But the unemployment rate rose to 5.9% from 5.8% in May, while the closely watched average hourly earnings, a gauge of wage inflation, rose 0.3% last month, lower than the consensus forecast for a 0.4% increase.
Analysts said overall the report was strong and trended in the right direction, which should cement the case for the Federal Reserve to start tapering its asset purchases soon. That should be positive for the dollar.
In early afternoon trading, the dollar index was down 0.3% at 92.246, after earlier hitting a three-month high of 92.759.
The greenback has strengthened broadly since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) surprised markets last month by signaling it could tighten policy earlier than expected to curb inflation.
""The bigger picture is that the greenback has extended its post-FOMC rally against the other major currencies this week,"" said Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. 
""We expect it to make further headway, provided that the U.S. data continue to come in strong.""
The dollar earlier trimmed losses after data showed U.S. factory orders surged 1.7% in May after slipping 0.1% in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rebounding 1.6%. Orders increased 17.2% on a year-on-year basis.
The euro was up 0.1% on the day at $1.1851.
Against the yen, the dollar slid 0.5% to 111.04 yen, after earlier hitting a 15-month peak.
Despite the fall, TD Securities, said in a research note that the dollar is not looking at the start of a significant correction.
""Beyond the initial 'sell the fact' reaction that appears to be underway, we think the overall tone of the report remains positive. After two consecutive 'disappointments', the June data offers reassurance that the US economic rebound is on track,"" the Canadian bank said.

Investing.com - The dollar has given back some of its recent gains in early European trade Friday, but remains near multi-month peaks against its major peers ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly payrolls report.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% lower at 92.558, having climbed to a three-month high during the previous session.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 111.57, just below a new 15-month high, EUR/USD edged down to 1.1846, just above a three-month low, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3771, near a fresh two-and-a-half month low, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7469, near the lowest since December.
The dollar has been supported over the last couple of days by strong U.S. employment data, bringing into question the assumption that U.S. interest rates can stay at ultra-low levels for years.
Applications for U.S. state unemployment insurance fell last week by more than expected, according to data released Thursday, with initial jobless claims falling by 51,000 to 364,000, reaching a fresh pandemic low as the economy reopens.
This followed Wednesday’s private payrolls release, which showed U.S. companies hired 692,000 new employees in June, more than the 600,000 generally expected.
This brings into focus the official U.S. nonfarm payrolls release, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show another weighty rise of 700,000 jobs in June, an improvement from the 559,000 jobs added the previous month.
However, with both the ADP and the weekly jobless claims coming in better than expected, market chat has been suggesting a higher payrolls figure. This would likely benefit the dollar given Federal Reserve policymakers have made the labor market the cardinal factor in determining monetary policy..
“The recent FOMC meeting suggests the Fed’s trigger-finger will be a little twitchier when it comes to tapering,” said analysts at ING, in a note, “but unless the NFP figure comes in close to the one million mark, financial markets will probably be set fair for a low volatility summer.”
Elsewhere, EUR/SEK rose 0.1% to 10.171 and USD/SEK climbed 0.2% to 8.5892 after Sweden’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate and asset-purchase program unchanged on Thursday, and signaled that it's in no hurry to tighten.
“The Riksbank will be towards the back of the pack when it comes to central bank tightening,” ING added.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's dollar will strengthen over the coming year, bolstered by higher oil prices and reduced stimulus from the Bank of Canada, but gains could stop short of the currency's recent six-year high, a Reuters poll showed.
The loonie has pulled back 3.2% since last month touching its strongest level since May 2015 near 1.20 per U.S. dollar, or 83.33 U.S. cents, pressured by the Federal Reserve's surprise shift to more hawkish guidance and worries the spreading Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus could slow a global economic recovery.
Analysts say 1.20 is a key technical level for the currency.
""It may be difficult to quickly regain ground for the Canadian dollar in the very near term, with the risk of a fourth wave of the pandemic spreading,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins.
Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so the loonie is particularly sensitive to the global economic outlook.
Oil on Monday reached its highest level since October 2018 at $74.45 a barrel while some analysts expect the Bank of Canada to cut the pace of bond purchases again at its next policy decision on July 14.
In April, the BoC became the first central bank in the Group of Seven to reduce its pandemic support.
Tapering could support the loonie but the BoC does not want the currency to reach a level that reduces the competitiveness of Canada's exports, said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics.
""Under 1.20, the Bank of Canada starts getting nervous,"" Simpson said.
The median forecast of more than 40 strategists was for the Canadian dollar to strengthen 2.5% in six months to 1.21. It was then expected to pull back to 1.22 in one year, compared to a 1.21 forecast in June's poll.
A risk to the loonie's outlook is a potential reassessment by markets of the order in which central banks begin lifting interest rates from record lows.
Currently, money markets see the Bank of Canada moving ahead of the Fed, with a hike by about the middle of next year. But Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets expects the BoC to wait for the Fed to hike and to then tighten at a slower pace than the U.S. central bank.

If the BoC tightens ""faster than the Fed then that puts untoward (upward) pressure on the loonie and we think the Bank of Canada is going to be keen to avoid that,"" Rai said. He expects the currency to weaken over the coming 12 months.
Past rate hike cycles show faster liftoff by the BoC may not be sustained, particularly if the loonie overshoots.

Investing.com – The greenback continued to rise against currencies in Asia on Friday morning after the U.S. reported fewer than expected initial jobless claims and investors hold on to the possibility that rates could go up sooner than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.01% to 92.59 by 10:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT) but stayed above the 92.50 mark.
The index has been climbing since late May as investors adapt to the possibility that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than expected.
The dollar was also helped by relatively positive economic data, with US initial jobless claims falling to 364,000, below market expectations of 390,000 and the lowest number in 15 months. A key jobs report for June, including non-farm payrolls, is due later in the day and could provide more visibility into the recovery of the U.S. labor market, possibly giving the dollar some momentum.
The positive sentiment around the dollar was also impacting the Japanese yen. The USD/JPY pair was up 0.11% to 111.62. The dollar is now around its highest point against the yen since March 2020.
“Many people are now arguing (over) whether the dollar has indeed bottomed, because at some point in 2023 the Fed is suggesting that it could be raising interest rates,” Paul Mackel, global head of FX research at HSBC, said in a call quoted by Reuters. “Also, there’s some nervousness whether the dollar’s going to start to behave in a more pro-cyclical manner.”
The antipodean currencies were weakening against the dollar. The AUD/USD pair was down 0.10% to 0.7461 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.6961.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.12% to 6.4756.
The GBP/USD pair continued falling for a seventh day and was down 0.02% to 1.3765, with the pound coming under pressure from continued interest in the greenback. The pair is trading around multi-month lows.
The USD/KRW pair was also down 0.04% to 1,133.88 after the country reported Friday that consumer prices rose 2.4% year-on-year in June, below the 2.6% percent rise in May but still above 2%. During the previous week, Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the bank will start normalizing its monetary policy before the end of 2021."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Near-term bets in favour of the dollar should be increased, a majority of analysts in Reuters polls said, who however were split on the duration of the greenback's bullish trend and forecast its allure to fade in a year.
Tracking the Federal Reserve's surprisingly hawkish outlook at the June meeting, the dollar ended its two month losing streak and gained about 3% against a basket of currencies last month, marking its best monthly performance in 4-1/2 years.
What has also supported the dollar and other safe-haven assets - including Treasuries and the yen - is the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19, which is threatening the global reopening.
Still, the June 28-July 1 poll of over 70 foreign exchange analysts showed the U.S. currency would broadly weaken against most major currencies in 12-months' time, a view held for well over a year.
But in response to an additional question, about 75% of analysts, or 38 of 51, suggested long dollar bets and short other major currencies or emerging market ones in the next three months as a positioning strategy.
""We are in a dollar positive regime for the next few months, which will generate some dollar strength in the near-term. But over a longer time horizon, we expect the dollar to remain in a fairly broad-based range,"" said David Adams, head of G10 FX strategy North America at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""This summer we see an opportunity for a tradable dollar rally as real rates rise and break-even inflation rates fall. The CFTC data and our conversations with investors suggests the market is still bearish on the dollar, both in actual positioning and in sentiment.""

When asked how long the dollar's strength would last, 37 of 63 analysts said less than three months, including eleven who predicted it was already over. The remaining 26 said more than three months.
That underscores the uncertainty from the pull and push in expectations between the Fed's taper plan announcement - which separate Reuters polls forecast to come by September - and the outlook the U.S. central bank won't start scaling back its stimulus until next year.

""With equity markets at elevated levels and housing markets hot in a host of countries, we've got fertile grounds for people to worry. COVID and the Fed are the focus...the Fed is making us focus on economic data which is hard to interpret,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""The Queen in Alice in Wonderland said she sometimes believed six impossible things before breakfast and I suspect we are all going to be guilty of that this summer...The fundamental picture though, is still that FX is a battle between global economic recovery, and Fed tightening talk.""

The long-held view for a weaker dollar in the year-ahead was once again the broad consensus in the latest poll, with the euro predicted to gain 2.6% to $1.22 in a year from a 4-1/2-month low of about $1.18 on Thursday.
While that 12-month ahead consensus is lower than predicted last month, it only reflects the single currency's significant fall in June, driven by the Fed's hawkish tone on robust economic recovery expectations, supporting the dollar.
But that has already been priced-in by financial markets.

""No one is going to pay a premium for a safe-haven currency when you've got the best global growth we've seen in decades,"" said Brian Rose, senior economist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""Right now you have the worst of all worlds: the Fed is extremely loose, inflation is high and real interest rates are more negative in the U.S. than they are in other places...what you really need to turn the dollar around is the prospect of Fed raising rates.""

Investing.com – The dollar continued to add to gains Thursday, but could run out of steam on the final day of the trading week should nonfarm payrolls fall short of expectations.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.14% to 90.91.
The ""bad news is good news"" scenario will likely in play on Friday as any weakness in the jobs report will likely give the Federal Reserve reason to keep the tightening on pause for the longer, pressuring the greenback. 
""Should our economist’s projections for a positive but below-consensus nonfarm payroll read prove accurate, we expect the price action in FX to prove broadly negative for the dollar as some of the Fed’s hawkish expectations are scaled back, while the recovery story remains intact,"" Dutch bank ING said in a note.
ING is forecasting headline nonfarm payrolls to fall within the 550,00-to-600,000 range, below consensus by about 110,000.  
Norwegian Korna, Canadian dollar, or CAD and New Zealand dollar, or NZD will likely be the winners from any potential dollar weakness.
Oil exporting pairs like NOK and CAD are expected to receive an added boost from rising oil prices amid reports that OPEC+ might be opting for a slightly lower-than-expected supply increase of 400,000 barrels per day rather than 500,000 initially expected."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar hit three-month highs on Thursday but traded within narrow ranges as investors looked to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will start to reduce monetary stimulus sooner rather than later.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major counterparts, rose to 92.602 (=USD), the highest since early April. It last traded up 0.2% at 92.572.
The index in June posted its best monthly performance since November 2016, driven in part by the Federal Open Market Committee's unexpected hawkish shift at a meeting during the month. Fed forecasts released after the June FOMC meeting penciled in two interest rate hikes by the end of 2023.
Against the yen, the dollar hit a 15-month high of 111.640 yen, and was last up 0.4% at 111.560.
Increased vaccinations that have led to more robust economic activity have helped the U.S. recovery from the pandemic, prompting expectations the Fed could start exiting its ultra-easy policy. That has provided a lift for the dollar.
""The dollar got a justified boost in June based on physical activity taking place across the country because of inoculations,"" said Juan Perez, FX strategist and trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.
""The rest of the world simply is not looking that safe, that prepared to move forward,"" he added
Traders are looking to Friday's U.S. payrolls report for confirmation of the market's bullish outlook. Economists polled by Reuters expect a gain of 700,000 jobs last month, compared with 559,000 in May, and an unemployment rate of 5.7% versus 5.8% in the previous month.
""We generally think the U.S. dollar should stay firm into Friday's U.S. employment reading,"" said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of FX strategy at TD Securities in a research note.
""We wonder, however, how aggressive further gains could be from there unless the data validates expectations of a further near-term hawkish shift from the Fed.""
The greenback extended gains earlier on Thursday after data showed U.S. initial jobless claims fell more than expected last week, while layoffs plunged to a 21-year low in June.
The dollar slipped a bit though after a report showing U.S. manufacturing activity grew at just a moderate pace in June, while employment in the sector contracted for the first time in seven months, likely because of rampant shortages of raw materials and labor.

In afternoon trading, the euro was down 0.1% at $1.1843 after earlier dipping as low as $1.1837 for the first time since April 6. The euro recovered from its lows after data showed euro zone purchasing managers indexes were higher than expected.
The Aussie dollar, seen as a proxy for risk appetite, slid 0.5% to $0.7464, after earlier hitting its lowest since Dec. 21, as Australia's major centers of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Darwin are all under lockdown.

Investing.com - The dollar consolidated around multi-month highs against its major peers as traders await Friday’s key employment report for clues about future Federal Reserve policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded largely unchanged at 92.472, at a new two-month high.
This index has just posted its best month since November 2016, helped by the hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve in bringing forward its expected interest rate hikes.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 111.18, just below a new 15-month high, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1841, around the pair’s lowest level since early April, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3811, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7482, approaching last week's six-month low at 0.7478.
The dollar received a boost on Wednesday as data showed U.S. companies hired more new employees than expected in June, adding to signs that the nation’s labor market is recovering strongly.
Private payrolls increased by a greater-than-expected 692,000 jobs last month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday, above the 600,000 jobs expected.
The ADP report is a widely-watched precursor to Friday’s official U.S. nonfarm payrolls release, although the relationship between the two hasn't been as tight as usual since the pandemic began.  But it is the official labor market report that carries more weight with the Fed. 
Ahead of the big release on Friday, the Labor Department will release jobless claims numbers, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with first-time filings for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 26 seen falling to 390,000 from 411,000 in the previous period. Continuing claims are seen falling to 3.382 million from 3.39 million. 
The greenback has also been supported of late by the spread of the virulent delta strain of the Covid-19 virus, which is threatening the wider reopening narrative.
In Asia, the likes of Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have introduced new curbs to battle Covid-19 outbreaks, while in Europe the tourist season has been disrupted as Spain, Portugal and Greece restrict British travelers, given the rising number of cases in the U.K. A French government advisor, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, said on Thursday that it is already ""too late"" to stop the variant spreading in France, but said that the wave of Covid cases that he expects from Delta won't be as severe as previous ones.
Elsewhere, EUR/SEK rose 0.1% to 10.144 and USD/SEK climbed 0.1% to 8.5650 ahead of the latest meeting from Sweden’s central bank.
The Riksbank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate and  asset-purchase program unchanged, but investors will be looking for clues of its timetable leading to its first post-pandemic interest-rate hike.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar's share of currency reserves reported to the International Monetary Fund edged up to 59.5% in the first quarter of the year, from 58.9% in the previous quarter, IMF data showed on Wednesday.
The greenback remains the largest-held currency reserve by global central banks.
Global reserves, which are reported in U.S. dollars, are assets of central banks held in different currencies used primarily to support their liabilities. Central banks sometimes use reserves to help support their respective currencies.
""Given the U.S. dollar's broader gains through Q1, the rise in U.S. dollar's holdings may be more apparent than real,"" wrote Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto, in a research note after the release of the IMF data.
The dollar index gained 3.6% in the first quarter.
""Broader trends do underscore the gradual shift away from the U.S. dollar in reserve holdings,"" he added.
The peak allocation for the U.S. dollar was 72.7% in Q2 2001, according to the IMF data, and while currency diversification has developed at a gradual pace, the trend has been persistent, Osborne said.
Reserves held in U.S. dollars slipped to $6.991 trillion in the first quarter, compared with $6.996 trillion in the fourth. Reserves held in euros, meanwhile, fell 4.4% on a quarterly basis to $2.415 trillion.

The euro's share fell to 20.6% in the first three months of the year, compared with a 21.3% share in the last quarter of 2020. Its share in the fourth quarter was the highest since 2014. In 2009, the euro hit its highest share of FX reserves at 28%.
The Chinese yuan's share increased to 2.4% in the first quarter, from a share of 2.2% in the previous three months. China's share gained for five consecutive quarters, with yuan reserves rising 7% to $287 billion. The IMF started tracking the yuan's share in 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a 2-1/2-month peak on Wednesday, posting its biggest monthly rise since November 2016, supported by a surprisingly hawkish shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate outlook and concern over the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant.
The dollar has gained about 3% against a basket of currencies this month, partly in the wake of the Fed's stance at a meeting early this month. Traders are looking to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for confirmation of a shift in monetary policy.
The greenback also extended gains after data showed U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in June by 692,000 jobs. Data for May was revised lower to show 886,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 978,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 600,000.
Action Economics said the dollar has been mainly supported by the better-than-expected U.S. private payrolls data, ""which has driven dollar short covering,"" ahead of the employment report. 
The research firm also cited firmer short-term U.S. Treasury 2-year yields, up nearly 11 basis points in June, the largest increase since September 2019, as investors priced in some tightening in 2023.
""This should continue to help the U.S. dollar going forward, as expectations are for the Fed to begin tightening first,"" Action Economics said in its blog. ""In addition, U.S. economic growth is likely to handily exceed that of Europe."" 
On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department is expected to report a gain of 700,000 jobs in June, compared with 559,000 in May, and an unemployment rate of 5.7% versus 5.8% in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
""If we see the U.S. employment number come out stronger than expected, then this reinforces the narrative that the Fed may remove accommodation faster than previously expected,"" said Erik Nelson, macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York. ""That's going to be dollar-positive.""
Investors were also apprehensive about the spread of the Delta variant that has prompted some countries such as Australia, the UK, and parts of Europe to undertake or plan renewed lockdowns, causing their currencies to struggle. That has put a bid on the U.S. dollar.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.4% % to 92.441 after earlier touching 92.451, its highest since early April. 

The euro was down 0.4% against the dollar at $1.1849. Earlier, the euro dropped to a 4-1/2-month low of $1.1845. Against the yen, the dollar was 0.5% firmer at 111.09 yen. It rose to 111.12, the highest since late March last year.
Risk-sensitive and commodity-exposed currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars nursed losses against the greenback. The Aussie and New Zealand dollars were down 0.2% and 0.1% at US$0.7496 and US$0.6983 respectively.

Investing.com - The dollar maintained its recent positive tone in early European trade Wednesday, as the spreading outbreak of Covid-19 cases in Asia prompts risk aversion ahead of the release of key U.S. jobs data.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded largely unchanged at 92.080, just off the one-week high hit during the previous session.
USD/JPY was largely flat at 110.50, even though Japan's industrial output posted the biggest monthly drop in a year in May, EUR/USD was also flat at 1.1898, after falling overnight, GBP/USD rose 0.1% at 1.3841, with U.K. first-quarter GDP falling 1.6% on the quarter, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7518, after slumping around 0.7% overnight.
Risk appetite has taken a hit of late as the spread of the virulent delta strain of the Covid-19 virus through many Asian countries has caused the reimposition of restrictions.
Australian officials extended lockdown and social distancing measures to more of the country on Wednesday, with four major cities already under a hard lockdown. This added to restrictions already announced in the likes of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
“The price action in G10 FX at the start of this week has temporarily diverged from a carry-trade-like dynamic, taking the form of a risk correction, with the dollar and the yen gaining to the detriment of high-beta currencies,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Away from news about the coronavirus, there remains some uncertainty ahead of Friday’s closely watched U.S. jobs report, given the importance the Federal Reserve has placed on the recovery of the labor market.
A strengthening labor market could prompt the Fed to rein in its accommodative monetary policy earlier than expected, giving the dollar a boost, but disappointing data will leave the dollar in a vulnerable position, especially after the Fed’s hawkish tone at its last meeting.
Ahead of Friday's payroll data, the ADP nonfarm employment release is due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), with this private-sector hiring report expected to detail 600,000 new jobs, down from the previous month’s 978,000. 
Before that, Eurozone consumer prices are due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), and are expected to tick down in year-on-year terms. That may take the wind out of the sails of the ECB's more hawkish members such as Germany's Jens Weidmann, who said in a speech on Monday that ""the risks around the price outlook have shifted...upside risks to price developments being predominant."" Improved pricing conditions were also a feature of the European Commission's Eurozone business confidence survey that was released on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4564, after China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 50.9 for June, slightly higher than the 50.8 expected but lower than May’s 51 reading, falling to a four-month low. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.5 in June, below the previous month’s 55.2.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia but clung onto its recent gains. Investors digested the worsening spread of COVID-19's more virulent Delta strain while awaiting U.S. jobs data crucial to the direction of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 92.030 by 12:18 AM ET (4:18 AM GMT). It rose 0.2% to hit a one-week high during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 110.48. Data released earlier in the day in Japan said industrial production fell by a worse-than-expected 5.9% month-on-month in May.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7525 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7002.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4572. Chinese data released earlier in the day said that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was a better-than-expected 50.9 for June, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 53.5, lower than May’s reading of 55.2.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 1.3853.
""There's a bit of a bearish tilt to currencies... it’s the line you would expect on a risk-off day, and maybe it's a bit of insurance ahead of non-farm payrolls,"" Westpac analyst Sean Callow told Reuters, referring to the U.S. jobs report due on Friday.
The dollar remained near the middle of the range it has found after the Fed's hawkish tone in its latest policy decision, handed down earlier in the month, spooked markets.
The spread of the virulent Delta strain of the COVID-19 virus in several countries has also decreased investors’ risk appetite. Rising numbers of cases involving the strain in Australia have already led to renewed lockdown measures in four cities and the spike in numbers also poses a threat to the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Also on the data side, investors await the U.S. jobs report for June, including non-farm payrolls, due on Friday. The ADP nonfarm employment change will also be released later in the day, ahead of the report.
A strengthening labor market could prompt the Fed to taper assets and hike interest rates earlier than expected, giving the dollar a boost. However, weaker-than-expected data will leave the greenback in a vulnerable position.
""It's unusually hard to forecast and so the risk of a surprise is enormous... super strong could really reinforce the reaction to the (Fed) and very weak could really push back on those who bought dollars post-Fed,"" said Westpac's Callow.
Other investors sought to take a wider view of the U.S. labor market data.
""It's not just about non-farm payrolls, but about the whole labor market,"" with hourly earnings and the unemployment rate also likely to be closely watched, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
""There's also a wide dispersion in terms of estimates which suggests that either way there will be a few disappointed with a soft number as well as a really strong number,” Catril added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose to a one-week peak on Tuesday, posting its largest single daily gain in roughly two weeks, as new coronavirus outbreaks threatened to derail a global economic recovery, with the Australian and New Zealand dollars leading losses.
A decline in risk appetite benefits the U.S. dollar as a safe haven.
Fears over the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the virus are denting sentiment at a time markets are on edge after the Federal Reserve shocked traders with a hawkish tilt earlier this month.
Indonesia is grappling with record high cases, while Malaysia is set to extend a lockdown and Thailand has announced new restrictions. Spain and Portugal are imposing travel restrictions on unvaccinated British travelers, even as some states in Australia tightened movement curbs.
""Generally it's about increasing concerns over the Delta variant and it's just hurting the market somewhat,"" said Amo Sahota, director at corporate FX advisory firm Klarity FX in San Francisco.
""The market got its head turned with the severity of the some of the lockdowns in places such as Australia,"" he added. 
In afternoon trading in New York, the dollar index, a gauge of its value against six major currencies, rose 0.2% to 92.077, posting its biggest daily percentage gain since around mid-June.
The greenback's correlation with general risk appetite as seen from the global daily caseloads of COVID-19 has weakened in recent weeks as market attention has been more focused on when the Fed will exit its massive policy stimulus. But that correlation has started to strengthen since last week.
""We went from a certain and stable background in Q2 to a lot more uncertainty going forward, and markets have to price that,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe in London.
The dollar also got a boost after data showed U.S. consumer confidence increased in June to its highest level since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago. That lifted expectations for strong economic growth in the second quarter.
The euro declined 0.2% to $1.1896, edging back toward the 2-1/2-month low touched on June 18.
Investors are also looking to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls, with a new jobs forecast of 690,000 in June compared with 559,000 in May, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
""Stepped-up dollar buying is a sign of investor confidence that America's June jobs report could be one of the year's strongest,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
Elsewhere, sterling gained 0.2% to $1.3842.
The Australian dollar, seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, fell 0.7% to US$0.7510 amid concerns over renewed COVID-19 lockdowns across parts of the country.

The New Zealand dollar was also lower in sympathy, down 0.7% at US$0.6988.

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally higher in early European trade Tuesday, helped by concerns over the rise of Covid cases in Asia, but gains are minimal ahead of this week’s key payrolls release.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 91.963, just below the two-month high of 92.408 reached on June 18, shortly after the last Federal Reserve meeting.
USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 110.57, just below a nearly 13-month high of 111.11 reached last week, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1913, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3868, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7555.
The safe-haven dollar received a boost Tuesday as a number of regions in Asia struggled with the spread of the highly infectious delta variant of the Covid-19 virus.
Australia has locked down several cities, Indonesia is grappling with record-high cases, Malaysia is set to extend a lockdown and Thailand has announced new restrictions.
However, the greenback remains in a tight range ahead of a closely watched U.S. jobs report, with the Federal Reserve placing great emphasis upon the recovery of the labor market before reining in its ultra easy monetary policy.
With this in mind, Friday's payrolls data will be the market’s key focus this week, with economists expecting an increase of 675,000 jobs in June, compared with 559,000 in May.
That said, “it will probably take a jobs number closer to the one million mark to shake up the U.S. rates curve and FX markets once again,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Tuesday also sees the release of the U.S. Conference Board's consumer confidence Index for June, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), which is seen rising to 119 after declining to 117.2 in May. 
Elsewhere. NZD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7033 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said economic activity in the country was returning to pre-Covid-19 levels although it still needed support.
The RBNZ last month became one of the first central banks in advanced economies to signal a move away from the stimulatory settings adopted during the pandemic after it hinted at an interest rate hike next year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up, but remained below a two-month high, on Tuesday morning in Asia. Investors now await U.S. employment data that could determine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will withdraw its stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 91.948 by 12:54 AM ET (4:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.05% to 110.56.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7553 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7029.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.08% to 6.4604 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.12% to 1.3866.
However, the dollar continued its retreat from the high of 92.408 seen on Jun. 18, the week when the Fed surprised investors with the unexpected hawkish tone in its policy decision. Fed officials have since focused on whether upcoming data will merit asset tapering and interest rate hikes, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying during the previous week that decisions would not be based just the ""fear"" of inflation and will encourage a ""broad and inclusive"" job market recovery.
Investors now await the U.S. job report, including non-farm payrolls, for June, due on Friday. The U.S. will also release its Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence index later in the day and the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on Thursday.
The safe-haven dollar and yen benefited from increasing demand as the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spread in Asia and elsewhere. In Europe, the euro was at $1.19210, in a move back to the two-and-a-half-month low of $1.8470 hit on Jun. 18.
""The market had been positioned long of the euro on optimism regarding the vaccine catch-up trade in the region but forecasts that the Delta variant of COVID-19 could spread through Europe in the summer months could now be undermining confidence in this trade,"" Rabobank strategist Jane Foley said in a report, which also cut a one-month euro forecast from $1.2 to $1.19.
""Assuming the U.S. data remains broadly supportive, we expect the dollar to grind moderately higher against the euro through the course of the year,” the report added.
The riskier Australian dollar was mostly unchanged, after falling 0.3% at the beginning of the week, even as the cities of Sydney, Perth, Darwin and Brisbane re-entered lockdown to curb the latest spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar also steadied as Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Governor Adrian Orr delivered a speech.
""We expect the RBNZ to start tightening monetary policy more than one year before the Fed, which is a tailwind for the NZD... the RBNZ is the most hawkish central bank under our coverage,"" CBA analyst Kim Mundy said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar drifted higher on Monday in generally thin trading, with many investors on the sidelines ahead of Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which could determine the path of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
The U.S. Labor Department is expected to report a gain of 690,000 jobs in June, compared with 559,000 in May, and an unemployment rate of 5.7% versus 5.8% in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
The dollar has been on an upside trajectory since the outcome of the U.S. central bank's policy meeting earlier this month, with a majority of Fed policymakers pencilling in at least two quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases by the end of 2023. 
""The potential for an upside surprise (in the U.S. jobs data) that pulls monetary tapering and tightening expectations forward is looming ever bigger for investors,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""A number significantly above the 700,000 mark could really get the dollar freight train running, and no one wants to be tied to the tracks if that happens,"" he added.
Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank in London, said, however, that another weak U.S. employment report for June could fail to diminish talk of inflation risks in the world's largest economy as the market now understands that labor supply has been containing the jobs growth recovery.
""This could mean that the U.S. dollar recovers swiftly on any post-payrolls sell-off, and that on a risk-reward basis it may not pay to be short U.S. dollars into the (data's) release,"" she added.
Softer-than-expected inflation data last week did little to ease concerns about the Fed dialling down its monetary stimulus, as investors pared back bearish dollar bets.
Speculators decreased their net short dollar positions in the latest week, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, said in a research note that there has been ""fierce re-pricing"" of the Fed's rate expectations, which has lifted the dollar across the board. 
He added that the euro and sterling, which saw a reduction in net long positions, have carried the brunt of the Fed's rate outlook.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index was up 0.1% at 91.897.
Investors are also looking at U.S. consumer confidence data on Tuesday as well as the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index on Thursday for clues as to where interest rates are headed.
The euro was down 0.1% at $1.1923, while euro-dollar implied volatility gauges with a one-year maturity were close to their lowest since March 2020.
Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.2% at 110.57 .
The Australian dollar, seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, fell 0.35% on the day to US$0.7565, while the New Zealand dollar slid 0.4% to US$0.7042.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 0.9% at $34,388. It showed little reaction to Britain's financial regulator saying that Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, cannot conduct any regulated activity, and issuing a warning to consumers about the platform.

Investing.com – The dollar stuttered Monday following a slip last week but those betting on the revival of a bearish trend in the greenback need to think again as the Federal Reserve's dovish days are numbered,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.03% to 91.87.
The dollar has struggled to hold onto its upward momentum that was sparked by the Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt earlier this month amid a general malaise in the FX market as liquidity remains abundant.
""The hawkish Fed meeting of June 16th saw volatility rise for just two days and that move has been completely reversed. If the search for yield amidst low volatility is akin to an oil tanker, clearly changing its course will require a lot of work,"" ING said Monday.
But while the unwind of easy monetary policy faces a long road ahead, the Fed is more likely to tighten monetary policy than ease – and that could prove a tailwind for the dollar.
""[W]e disagree with the notion that there wasn't an important message for the market [from the Fed's June meeting],"" Morgan Stanley said in a recent note. ""We think the important message for the market is this: investors can no longer assume that the Fed is going to be dovish, no matter what happens to inflation.""
""This is important because much of the rationale to be short the US dollar has been based on the idea that the Fed will remain dovish, even as inflation moved higher and higher,"" it added.
The backdrop of commentary from FOMC members in the weeks that followed the June meeting showed a willingness from a growing number of Fed members to project rate hikes to curb expectations for higher inflation. ""This undercuts the primary reason to be short the USD,"" Morgan Stanley added.
The value of the net short dollar position fell to $12.80 billion in the week ended June 22, compared with a net short of $18.99 billion the previous week, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, released Friday."

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trade Monday, maintaining a firm tone after recent inflation data as the market prepares for this week’s key payrolls release.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded basically flat at 91.843, having recovered from Friday's low of 91.524.
USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 110.62, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1925, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3891, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7590.
The dollar took an initial hit on Friday following the release of the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge of inflation, the core U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index. This increased 0.5% in May, short of expectations for a 0.6% rise, which reassured some that inflation is not running out of control..
Even so, the year-on-year rise was 3.4%, the biggest jump since 1992, and failed to completely quell fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to normalize monetary policy sooner than it currently expects.
Adding support to the greenback were comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren on Friday, who suggested the central bank could consider an interest-rate hike as soon as late 2022 as the labor market reaches full employment.
With this in mind, Friday's payrolls data will be the market’s key focus this week, with economists expecting an increase of 675,000 jobs. 
That said, with concerns over mismatches of skills and opportunities in the labor market at the fore of investors’ minds, markets will also be looking at other parts of the labor market report, including wage growth and labor force participation.
“Nonfarm payrolls have disappointed over the past two months while average hourly earnings have surprised positively,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “These surprises likely reflect supply constraints pertaining to school closures as well as bonus jobless benefits often making it a better deal to stay home than to seek work.”
The week also includes and number of appearances by several Fed officials, including New York Fed President John Williams, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia although the U.S. inflation data was slightly softer than expected. Investors remained concerned about a tightening monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve should inflationary pressures continue to intensify.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 91.868 by 10:33 PM ET (2:33 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 110.69. The Bank of Japan released its summary of opinions earlier in the day, where policymakers expected that the accelerating COVID-19 vaccination will prompt economic recovery.
""A positive economic cycle is kicking off in Japan due to progress made in vaccinations,"" one of the nine board members said.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7585 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7070.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.13% to 6.4631.China will release the manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers' indexes on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3882, with Andrew G Haldane, a member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, due to speak later in the day.
The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index grew 0.5% month-on-month in May, lower than 0.6% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 0.7% figure in April. The core PEC price index surged 3.4% in the 12 months through May, the largest gain since April 1992.
Although inflation is expected to slow at the end of 2021, investors remain cautious about price pressures driven by wages due to a tight labor market.
Investors now await June's U.S. employment report, including nonfarm payrolls, due on Friday.
“Depending on the outcome of the payroll's data, the market could start pricing in more chances of a rate hike next year,"" Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, investors remained optimistic about the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19 after U.S. President Joe Biden said he didn’t plan to veto a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill if a separate Democratic spending plan doesn’t pass Congress.
“That statement understandably upset some Republicans, who do not see the two plans as linked… my comments also created the impression that I was issuing a veto threat on the very plan I had just agreed to, which was certainly not my intent,” Biden said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar ended unchanged on Friday, erasing an early drop after tamer-than-expected producer price inflation, with investors continuing to evaluate whether that the Federal Reserve will act sooner to snuff out inflation if it persists.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.5%, below economists’ expectations of an 0.6% increase. In the 12 months through May, the core PCE price index shot up 3.4%, the largest gain since April 1992.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, held steady following an upwardly revised 0.9% jump in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.4%.
“The most interesting, salient takeaway from today’s data is that we’re not seeing runaway inflation,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York. “The Fed by holding its fire is probably on the right side of the trade at this point.”
Other data showed U.S. consumer sentiment ticked up in June.
The dollar index against a basket of currencies ended unchanged on the day at 91.838, after dropping to 91.524.
Last Friday, the index rose to a two-month high after Fed policymakers on June 16 forecast two rate hikes in 2023, a faster-than-expected timetable to tighten.
This week, the greenback slipped as Fed speakers offered contrasting views on inflation pressures.
The U.S. economy could possibly reach maximum employment and inflation that would merit an interest rate increase next year, but it will be important to watch the data, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Friday.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said he expects high inflation readings will not last and many Americans will return to the labor market in the fall.
Investments that strengthen the labor force and improve economic inclusion can help boost economic growth, said Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester.
Infrastructure spending is likely to boost the U.S. economy, though probably not in the short-term.
The British pound fell 0.33% on the day to $1.3875, weakening further a day after the Bank of England made no changes to monetary policy.
The greenback was steady at 110.83 Japanese yen, after reaching a 15-month high of 111.11 on Thursday.

Data showed core consumer prices in Tokyo were unchanged in June from a year earlier.
“Japan is a total outlier when it comes to one of the most crucial data points in the market’s focus right now: inflation. It showed that Japan, unique among the major countries of the world, has no inflation,” Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss, said in a report.

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally lower in early European trade Friday, as traders warily awaited the release of key inflation data for clues over future Federal Reserve policy.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded less than 0.1% lower at 91.763, off last week’s high of 92.408 but substantially above the levels below 90 that it had fallen to in May.
USD/JPY was flat at 110.88, EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1939, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7591.
The dollar received a jolt higher last week after the Federal Reserve brought forward its median forecasts for interest rates hikes, but subsequent comments from Chairman Jerome Powell over inflation pressures still being temporary in nature have soothed market nerves over the potential for early moves by the central bank to rein in its very accommodative monetary policies.  
There appear to be two camps within the Fed, although most of the coalition seem to be sticking to Powell’s script that the surge in consumer prices will fade. For example, New York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday that he sees inflation heading back toward the 2% target next year. Cleveland President Loretta Mester and Boston's Eric Rosengren are slated to round off a full week of public appearances by Fed officials later Friday. 
Of more interest may be the release of the core personal consumption expenditures index, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), into focus. This is seen as the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, and is expected to show year-on-year gains of 3.4% in May, climbing from the 3.1% recorded the previous month. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was marginally higher at 1.3928 after weakening during the previous session as the Bank of England kept its own easy monetary policy unchanged, warning against “premature tightening” despite a marked improvement to its forecasts for the U.K. economy.
“The Bank of England's latest statement is a little more upbeat than might have been expected, but crucially offers no new clues on rate hike timing,” said analysts at ING. “We're still expecting the first rate rise in early 2023, on the assumption inflationary pressures ease through the middle of 2022.”
The BoE is set to release its Quarterly Bulletin later in the session.
Additionally, USD/MXN rose 0.2% to 19.884, rebounding from Thursday’s two-low low after Mexico’s central bank raised its interest rates for the first time since late 2018 in a surprise move.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia but remained near multi-month highs as weary investors await further inflation data to close the week. The pound, meanwhile, nursed a modest loss after the Bank of England (BOE) shied away from hiking interest rates in its latest policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 91.767 by 12:13 AM ET (4:13 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 110.84, with the yen just below a 15-month low against the dollar. Data released earlier in the day said that the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0% year-on-year in June, while the CPI Tokyo Ex Food and Energy index contracted 0.1% month-on-month in June, which was smaller than May’s 0.4% contraction.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7592 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.22% to 0.7074. Trade data from New Zealand said that exports and imports stood at a better-than-expected NZD5.87 billion and NZD5.4 billion respectively in May. The trade balance was at –NZD60 million year-on-year while the month-on-month figure was NZD469 million.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4639 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3926.
Investors are still digesting the U.S. Federal Reserve’s surprise hawkish turn as it handed down its policy decision during the previous week, although comments from Fed Chairman and other officials throughout the past week calmed market nerves about an imminent interest rate hike.
The Bank of England’s decision hinted that the central bank was in no hurry to hike interest rates, with officials warning against “premature tightening” as the decision was handed down on Thursday.
""Some in the market obviously positioned for a less dovish or a hawkish tilt,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) director of economics and markets Tapas Strickland told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the Banco de México hiked its interest rates for the first time since late 2018, with the Mexican peso climbing to a two-week high after the surprise move.
Investors also digested U.S. economic data released on Thursday, which said that the GDP rose 6.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2021. However, core durable goods orders rose a smaller-than-expected 0.3% month-on-month in May.
On the employment side, 411,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week, higher than the 380,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the 418,000 claims submitted during the previous week.
Further U.S. data on personal spending and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is due later in the day.
""The dollar can jump if inflation surprises to the upside... upside inflation surprises have been the trend in the U.S. recently,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) head of international economics Joe Capurso told Reuters."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was steady on Thursday as investors evaluated the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in stamping out high inflation if it persists, while the pound weakened after the Bank of England made no changes to its monetary policy.
Fed policymakers have been offering differing viewpoints on how long inflation is likely to stay high and when it will be appropriate to tighten monetary policy after the Fed last week surprised markets by forecasting two rate hikes in 2023.
The dollar index was little changed on the day against a basket of currencies at 91.790, holding below a two-month high of 92.408 reached on Friday after the Fed meeting.
“I do suspect we’ll have a little bit more consolidation and then some more dollar upside,” said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
“The Fed put the market on notice with regards to its inflation target and new mandate, and really just the idea that they would be completely and resolutely dovish forever … so I think there’s more room for a shakeout here,” Nelson said.
On Thursday, two Fed officials warned that inflation could rise more than policymakers expect in the near term.
Other U.S. central bank policymakers said employment needs much more improvement after job losses during the pandemic.
Data showed fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week.
New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, likely held back by shortages of some products.
The next major U.S. economic focus will be producer price data on Friday.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday embraced a bipartisan Senate deal to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building roads, bridges and highways.
Sterling slipped after the Bank of England said inflation would surpass 3% as Britain's locked-down economy reopens, but the climb further above its 2% target would only be ""temporary"" and most policymakers favored keeping stimulus full throttle.
“While the underlying tone was quite upbeat, and we do think that there was a clearer hawkish lean, it was not hawkish enough for those looking for a sharper turn after last week's FOMC meeting,” analysts at TD Securities said in a report on Thursday.
The British pound fell 0.26% to $1.3929. 

The euro gained 0.03% on the day to $1.1932. German business morale rose more than expected in June and hit its highest level since November 2018, a survey showed.
The greenback gained to 111.11 Japanese yen overnight, the strongest since March 2020, before dropping back to 110.86, down 0.09% on the day. Data showed Japan's corporate services prices rose in May at the fastest annual pace in eight months.

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally higher in early European trade Thursday, as traders digested diverse opinions from Federal Reserve policy makers over the likely timing of the withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded less than 0.1% higher at 91.838, rebounding from Wednesday’s low of 91.509, but still below the 92.408 high seen at the end of last week. 
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 110.85, EUR/USD was marginally lower at 1.1921, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was 0.1% lower at 0.7570.
The greenback received some support on Wednesday after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said the recent surge in consumer prices may well be temporary in nature, but it will take longer than currently expected to disperse. 
This differed from the view of Fed Chair Jerome Powell the previous day who had downplayed the impact of the rising inflation.
Bostic said he is now looking for growth of 7% in 2021 and inflation for the year to be 3.4%, and with this in mind he expects the Fed’s benchmark interest rate will need to increase in the latter half of next year. 
This confirms that he was one of the seven FOMC officials that predicted at last week’s Federal Reserve meeting that interest rates would need to be increased sometime next year, a move that gave the dollar a jolt higher.
The Fedspeak continues Thursday, with a further six Fed officials due to speak later, while attention will also be on the widely-watched weekly initial jobless claims data to gauge the extent of the recovery in the labor market.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped less than 0.1% to 1.3954 ahead of the latest policy-setting meeting from the Bank of England.
The central bank is not expected to alter its interest rates or its bond-buying program, but it may have to explain its thinking given consumer prices have risen above its 2% target for the first time in almost two years.
That said, “concerns about the spreading Delta variant should prevent any further hawkish repricing of the market outlook for the Bank of England,” said analysts at ING, in a note."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia as investors digested mixed signals from U.S. Federal Reserve officials regarding the timeline of stimulus measures changes.
The US Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 91.828 by 11:14 PM ET (3:14 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 111.03 and the USD/CNY pair edged up 0.13% to 6.4812.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7576. Its most populous state of New South Wales reported a double-digit increase in new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 for the third consecutive day on Thursday. The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7054.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3961, with the Bank of England handing down its policy decision later in the day.
The dollar increased after two Fed officials said that the high inflation would last longer than expected in the U.S., following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterating that the recent price increases will likely wane although they were bigger than expected, earlier in the week.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expects the interest rate will need to increase in late 2022 as he is looking for growth of 7% and inflation to be 3.4% in 2021.
“I think the economy is well on its way to recovering from COVID-19… much of the data recently has come in stronger than I expected. GDP is on a stronger trajectory, inflation has been higher and I recognize is well above our target,” he added.
Both Bostic and Fed governor Michelle Bowman said they expect that the recent price pressure will be temporary, but would still take a longer-than-expected time to ease.
Six Fed officials are due to speak later in the day, including New York Fed President John Williams, who said on Tuesday that any talks about when to change interest rates are still far off.
""The market has shifted back into price discovery mode, reflecting the Fed's recent shift and the need to fine-tune the taper lift-off date,"" Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC),  global head of foreign-exchange strategy at TD Securities, said in a note.
""Good U.S. data will be good for the USD and bad for risk markets, owing to the impact on the tapering process. Accordingly, we still like USD dip-buying into the early parts of the summer,"" the note added.
On the data front, investors now await initial jobless claims, due later in the day, and the core personal consumption expenditure price index to be released on Friday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar ended higher on Wednesday as two Federal Reserve officials said that a period of high inflation in the United States could last longer than anticipated, a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell played down rising price pressures.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said with growth surging to an estimated 7% this year and inflation well above the Fed's 2% target, he now expects interest rates will need to rise in late 2022.
Both Bostic and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman on Wednesday said that while they largely agree recent price increases will prove temporary, they also feel it may take longer than anticipated for them to fade.
The dollar jumped after the Fed surprised markets on June 16 by saying that policymakers are forecasting two interest rate hikes in 2023.
But Powell on Tuesday said that prices are rising due to a ""perfect storm"" of rising demand for goods and services and bottlenecks in supplying them as the economy reopens from the pandemic and that those price pressures should ease on their own.
“Dollar gains have faded after Mr. Powell downplayed higher inflation lasting for very long,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
That said, “if we see signs of inflation pushing further higher, I think that could go some way in stirring inflation jitters all over again and putting the focus on Fed policy,” Manimbo said.
The dollar index gained 0.06% to 91.798, but is holding below two-month highs of 92.408 reached on Friday.
The dollar weakened earlier on Wednesday and hit a session low after data showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a one-year low in May as the median price of newly built houses soared amid expensive raw materials, including framing lumber.
Other data showed that a measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June.
Producer price inflation data on Friday is this week’s U.S. economic focus, with other releases including jobless claims on Thursday and consumer spending on Friday.
The euro fell 0.11% to $1.1929.
Data on Wednesday showed that euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years in June following the easing of more lockdown measures.
The Japanese yen also fell after data showed factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in four months in June.
The dollar gained 0.29% to 110.66 yen, after earlier reaching 111.10 yen, the highest since March 2020.

Currencies correlated to the global economic cycle, including the Kiwi dollar and Norway's crown, outperformed on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, bitcoin was up around 2.78% on the day at $33,467, after dropping to as low as $28,600 on Tuesday - its lowest since January.

Investing.com – The pound climbed against the dollar Wednesday, ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy decision due Thursday, but investors aren't betting on any hawkish surprise.
GBP/USD rose 0.14% to $1.3967.
The U.K. economy continues to gather pace, and inflation - at 2.1% on an annualized basis - is running ahead of the central bank's target, but the Bank of England, or BoE, is likely to point to temporary factors boosting inflation and ongoing uncertainty in its outlook for the economy as reasons to keep monetary policy on autopilot.
""[W]e do not expect any change to current policy or guidance at the forthcoming meeting,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note Wednesday.  
""Since the BoE published forecasts following its previous MPC meeting on 6 May, economic activity appears to have improved a touch ahead of expectations […] but the central bank will underscore again that the outlook for the economy, including the relative movements in demand and supply, remains highly uncertain,"" it added.
The bank's cautious view will be helped by the ""recent pickup in new coronavirus cases - to more than four times the rate at the time of the MPC's May meeting - and delay to further economic reopening reminders of the downside risks,"" Daiwa added.
Others agree, and suggest the central bank will be keen to avoid dropping any hints that tighter monetary policy could soon be table.
""In reality, we don’t think the Bank will say anything particularly new on the timing of rate hikes at this next meeting,"" ING said. ""For now, we’re in the camp looking for the first rate hike in 1Q23.""
While a further upswing in price pressures could push inflation to 2.5% later this year, it is likely to ""die down into mid-2022 as the reopening spikes of the next few months fade,"" ING added. ""That, in turn, reduces the pressure on policymakers to exit the current level of stimulus."""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real is now at a more ""favorable"" level and is likely to strengthen much further, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Wednesday, the day the currency hit a one-year high of 4.9386 per dollar.
In an online event hosted by the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries, Guedes said a ""consistent and coherent"" policy mix will push the dollar further below 5.00 reais and help keep the long end of the interest rate curve under control. 
""The exchange rate now is much more favorable ... but the equilibrium (dollar/real) rate is possibly much lower than where it is just now,"" Guedes said.
""It (equilibrium rate) is well below the current level, which for the first time (in a year) is breaking below 5.00. I think it is going to go much lower, as everyone sees (our) consistent and coherent policies,"" he said.
The real has surged almost 20% since trading at 5.8760 in March, coinciding with the central bank beginning an interest rate-hiking cycle that now looks much more aggressive than initially planned.
The dollar fell as low as 4.9386 reais on Wednesday. A growing number of analysts have revised up their outlook for the real in recent weeks, with some expecting the dollar to fall as low as 4.50 reais in the second half of the year.
Guedes repeated the government's commitment not to break its spending cap rule limiting public spending growth to the previous year's rate of inflation, although he noted that current high levels of inflation give it a bit more leeway.

President Jair Bolsonaro is expected to announce a three-month extension to emergency cash transfers for the poor soon, perhaps as early as this week, Guedes said. 
On tax reform, Guedes said total receipts will be very strong with the economy expanding around 5%, which is now the broad 2021 growth consensus. Strong tax receipts will allow the government to cut taxes ""immediately"", he said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, stabilizing after weakness overnight following commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that again indicated the central bank will take time to tighten monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 91.865, after dropping as low as 91.672 late Tuesday.
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 110.81, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1919, after rebounding from as low as $1.18470 at the end of last week, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3931, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7545.
Powell stuck largely to his previous script when addressing lawmakers on Tuesday, acknowledging that the price increases seen in the economy recently had been bigger than expected but repeating that they will probably wane. Powell was again upbeat on the outlook for the labor market however.
""We will not raise interest rates pre-emptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances,” Powell said in a hearing before a U.S. House of Representatives panel.
Additionally, New York Fed chief John Williams, in an interview on Bloomberg TV Tuesday, said a discussion about raising interest rates is still some way off.
These comments didn’t really make the Fed’s timetable for tightening monetary policy any clearer, and disappointed some dollar bulls would had been looking for a steer towards an early move given the hawkish tone at the last Fed meeting. The only comfort for dollar bulls came from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said that the ""substantial further progress"" in the recovery, which the Fed has made a precondition for starting to tighten policy, was within reach this year.
The dollar index gained 1.9% last week, its biggest weekly rise since March 2000, but has since given up about a third of these sharp gains.
The Fedspeak continues later Wednesday, with FOMC members Michelle Bowman, Eric Rosengren and Raphael Bostic all slated to speak at events throughout the day.
Data releases Wednesday include new home sales for May and June manufacturing PMI data, but the producer price inflation numbers on Friday will be the next major economic focus.
Elsewhere, EUR/HUF rose 0.1% to 350.33 and USD/HUF rose 0.3% to 293.86 the day after the National Bank of Hungary lifted its base rate by 30 basis points to 0.9% to combat inflationary pressures, becoming the first central bank in the European Union to raise rates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Czech National Bank is expected to follow suit later Wednesday, with analysts largely expecting the central bank to lift its benchmark rate by 50 basis points as, like its neighbor, it struggles to cope with a spike in consumer prices.
EUR/CZK traded 0.1% higher at 25.504 and USD/CZK up 0.1% at 21.369.

Investing.com -- The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia after recording two days of losses. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, sought to reassure markets that the tighter monetary policy hinted at in the Fed’s latest policy decision was still some way off.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.13% to 91.873 by 1:10 PM ET (5:10 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.15% to 110.81. The Bank of Japan released the minutes from its own monetary policy meeting earlier in the day, with Japan also releasing both its manufacturing and services purchasing managers’ index for June. The manufacturing PMI stood at a lower-than-expected 51.5.

The dollar index is currently off a two-month high reached at the end of the previous week. The greenback has now given up about a third of the gains posted since the Fed sprung an unexpectedly hawkish tone in its latest policy decision.
With interest rate hikes and asset tapering now expected to begin sooner than expected, Fed officials acted to calm investor concerns.
Powell and New York Fed President John Williams both cautioned that further economic recovery is a prerequisite to any asset tapering and interest rate hikes. ""We will not raise interest rates pre-emptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation... we will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances,” Powell said on Tuesday in his testimony before the House of Representatives Select Subcommittee.
For his part, Williams echoed that the Fed will closely monitor economic data to determine the appropriate point to begin adjusting monetary policy. ""That's still quite a ways off,” he added.
Some investors were cautiously optimistic in their response to the Fed comments.
""Latest smoke signals from the Fed ... all point to September as the meeting when the Fed is, on current trends, most likely to declare that substantial further progress towards their goals has been achieved, or is being achieved,"" National Australia Bank head of foreign-exchange strategy Ray Attrill said in a note, which also forecasts tapering will likely start in early 2022.
""Their comments have seen markets row back somewhat from their largely position-driven convulsions last week,” the note added.
Investors now await the Bank of England’s policy decision, due to be handed down on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held at lower levels on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the U.S. central bank's intent to encourage a ""broad and inclusive"" recovery of the job market, and not to raise interest rates too quickly based only on the fear of coming inflation.
""We will not raise interest rates pre-emptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances,"" Powell said in a hearing before a U.S. House of Representatives panel.
The dollar had surged after the Fed on Wednesday said that policymakers are forecasting two rate hikes in 2023. That led investors to re-evaluate bets that the Fed will let inflation run at higher levels for a longer time before hiking rates.
“I didn’t think he elaborated any further on the timeline. He certainly didn't make it more urgent either,” said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.
The dollar index fell 0.20% to 91.733. It is holding below a two-month high of 92.408 reached on Friday.
The euro gained 0.19% to $1.1940 and the dollar gained 0.28% to 110.65 Japanese yen.
Fed officials have expressed differing views on when it may be appropriate to tighten monetary policy as inflation rises.
The U.S. central bank may be in a position to start reducing its extraordinary support of the U.S. economy by late this year or early next year, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said on Tuesday.
Fed officials will keep a close eye on economic data to determine when it will be appropriate to start adjusting monetary policy and any conversation about when to adjust interest rates is still far off, said New York Fed Bank President John Williams.

Investing.com – The dollar remained sluggish Tuesday as Federal Reserve Jerome Powell downplayed concerns about inflation and delivered an upbeat outlook on the labor market in testimony to U.S. lawmakers.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.21% to 91.69.
Powell didn’t give much away in testimony, largely sticking with same view he expressed during his post-Fed meeting conference last week.  
“[P]erhaps all of the overshoot in inflation comes from categories such as rising used car and trucks, airplane tickets, hotel prices that have been affected by the reopening of the economy,"" Powell said, in response to questioning from lawmakers on whether inflation is transitory. These factors ""will ultimately start to decline,” he added.
“[W]hile these effects have turned out to be larger than we expected, the incoming data are consistent with the view that these factors will wane over time,” he added.
The labor shortage, meanwhile, has been driven by temporary factors including schools that remain closed, fears over the virus, and unemployment insurance. But these factors will ultimately wane, driving up job gains in the coming weeks, Powell said.
“Labor demand is remarkably strong, and overtime we will find ourselves with low unemployment and wages going up across the spectrum,” he added.
The comments didn’t shed further light on whether the Fed is likely to taper its bond purchases sooner than later.
In recent weeks, many have speculated that early Fed tightening could spark a divergence in policy between the U.S. central bank and other central banks including the European Central Bank that could create a long runway for U.S. rates to move higher, potentially boosting the dollar.
Noting the monetary policy divergency in 2013, when the Fed starting tightening policy by announcement plans to taper bond purchases,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) believes the gap between US-Rest of World monetary policy is likely to narrow this time not widen.
“[F]oreign central banks are unlikely to be actively easing further from here and if anything are more likely to normalize,” Morgan Stanley said."
218,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the price increases seen in the economy recently are bigger than expected but reiterated that they will likely wane.“A pretty substantial part, or perhaps all of the overshoot in inflation comes from categories that are directly affected by the re-opening of the economy such as used cars and trucks,” Powell said Tuesday in response to a question before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.
But the Fed chair acknowledged the uncertainty around that view.
“I will say that these effects have been larger than we expected and they may turn out to be more persistent than we expected.”Fed officials responded last week to increasing inflation risks by pulling forward their expected timing and pace of interest-rate increases, from the current near-zero level, while also kicking off a discussion of when to taper asset purchases from their current $120 billion monthly pace at their policy meeting.
The quarterly projections showed 13 of 18 officials favored at least one rate increase by the end of 2023, versus seven in March. Eleven officials saw at least two hikes by the end of that year. In addition, seven of them saw a move as early as 2022, up from four. The projections also showed that officials’ sense of risk and uncertainty around their inflation forecasts moved higher.
U.S. central bankers say they will continue buying at a $120 billion monthly pace until the economy has made “substantial further progress” toward its employment and inflation goals.
“We have made progress, for sure, since December of last year,” New York Fed President John Williams said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Tuesday. “I still don’t think it’s close to the ‘substantial further progress’ that we set out.”Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told reporters following a virtual event hosted by the Norges Bank that she wants to see further progress, especially on labor force participation.
“I think we are going to get more clarity as we get through the summer and get to September,” Mester said. Opening schools “will help alleviate some of the supply constraints in the labor market,” as well as the expiration of expanded unemployment-insurance benefits in the same month, she added.

CLS, a major settler of trades in FX markets, said turnover was up across spot, forward and swap markets -- the latter by a notable 25% -- versus May 2020 levels.
While FX volatility remains subdued investors were busy changing their positioning on the U.S. dollar in May as they weighed up when the Federal Reserve would begin taking a more hawkish tone on monetary policy and its pandemic-driven stimulus.

Investing.com - The dollar stabilized in early European trade Tuesday, after handing back some of the previous week’s gains during the previous session, with traders awaiting testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in the wake of the central bank’s hawkish turn.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.002, bouncing after dropping 0.5% on Monday.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 110.44, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1904, after gaining 0.4% overnight, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3906, trying to hold on to its overnight bounce, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.3% at 0.7514.
The dollar had gained sharply since Wednesday’s move by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, to bring forward the median expected starting point for interest rate rises to 2023, a year earlier than previously guided, while also starting to discuss the timetable for reducing the Fed’s massive bond-buying program. 
The dollar index gained 1.9% last week, its biggest weekly rise since March 2000, and it was perhaps understandable that traders cashed in some of those gains during Monday's session.
Fed officials have already started the process of explaining their thinking, with New York Fed president John Williams taking a dovish tone Monday, saying more economic progress is needed before the central bank should begin to scale back some of its support.
However, others, including Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and his colleague in St. Louis, James Bullard, expressed views more in line with the change of overall tone at the central bank, calling for an early discussion over tapering the central bank’s ongoing bond purchases.
Now Fed Chair Jerome Powell heads to Capitol Hill to provide U.S. lawmakers in Congress with an update of the central bank’s support for the country’s economy during the pandemic. He is sure to be asked about the Fed’s new inflation concerns given his repeated insistence that the recent surge in prices would prove transitory in nature. Powell is due to start his testimony at 2 PM ET. His prepared remarks, already released late on Monday by the Fed, broadly echo what Powell said at his press conference last week.
“The hawkish turn from the Fed has many wondering whether its new strategy of 'Average Inflation Targeting' adopted last September was really just some elaborate form of forward guidance that would be dropped at the first sign of genuine concern over inflation,” said analysts at ING, in a note.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's financial regulators are cajoling companies to protect themselves against currency risks as the central bank gradually loosens its reins on the yuan, but are struggling to convince local businesses to hedge.
Senior regulators have used every public occasion to stress the importance of being ""risk-neutral"" in the foreign exchange market, and also forced commercial banks to conduct lessons on currency hedging and disseminate messages on social media.
But the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and state regulators have had limited success even as authorities step back from heavily managing the yuan and prepare to allow more money to flow in and out of mainland markets.
""Hedging not only increases cost, but also eats the fat profit generated by favourable currency moves,"" said Han Changming, general manager of a Fujian-based trading company which imports luxury vehicles including Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
The past year has vindicated that approach. The yuan had strengthened about 12% against the U.S. dollar between May 2020 and May 2021, touching its strongest level in three years, before pulling back in recent weeks.
Most importers are prepared to stomach some volatility as they bet that China's high growth trajectory and attraction as an investment destination will sustain the yuan's uptrend.
Pan Gongsheng, head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), told a financial forum this month: ""Don't bet on appreciation or depreciation in the yuan. (People who) always gamble will definitely lose.""
Several such rounds of regulatory pitches have barely paid off. The number of Chinese non-financial listed A-share firms using FX hedging tools to counter market risks rose to 592 as of early June from 519 at the end of 2020, risk-management consultancy D-Union estimated. There are about 4,400 publicly traded companies in China.
PAYMENT PROBLEMS
The coronavirus pandemic has also disincentivised exporters, as shifting and delayed payments made it difficult to hedge by booking a contract to sell the future dollar receipts. 
""A lot of exporters got hit, predominantly from the U.S... where the U.S. companies didn't pay their bills on time,"" said Gerhard Flatz, managing director of KTC Group, a manufacturer of performance outerwear, in Guangzhou.
""Can you imagine, you start hedging, you have your contracts mature and you don't have the money to basically pay back? For the exporters, it's extremely difficult to hedge when they have no assurance if the payment is really coming in.""
Several retail banking sources said the yuan's rapid rise had discouraged their corporate clients, especially exporters, from converting their export receipts immediately to yuan. 
Many also did not want to hedge - which would involve locking in a future conversion rate - preferring instead to bet that the Federal Reserve's taper from ultra-loose monetary policy will drive the dollar up and the yuan down.
The pile of dollars that domestic companies have accumulated has grown. Chinese banks had on their books more than $1 trillion of foreign exchange deposits by May, including $491.6 billion from domestic companies.
SMALLER FIRMS
Bill Deng, CEO of cross-border payment company XTransfer, said currency hedging instruments such as options and futures may also be deemed too costly and complex by smaller Chinese exporters. XTransfer provides yuan forwards, which are vanilla hedging tools, to clients, but ""even so, clients ask very basic questions, and you need constant education,"" said Deng.
A source at a major Chinese state bank, who has delivered a series of lectures to corporate clients this year, said authorities aim to stabilise profits and employment at smaller firms. Small firms, including many exporters, account for about 80% of urban employment, according to government data. 
Guan Tao, a former senior official at the foreign exchange regulator, also said recently that one-way bets on a rising yuan could hit smaller exporters, causing them to shut down and resulting in job losses.

Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank in Singapore, says regulators can raise awareness but can't compel firms to hedge. 
""I don't think regulators are afraid of something. As long as there is no systemic risk, it should be fine,"" he said.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia. The greenback hit pause as investors await testimony from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after being caught off-guard by the central bank’s latest policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 91.922 by 12 AM ET (4 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.11% to 110.42.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.7515 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.6976.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.4645.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 1.3914. Investors await a further re-opening of the U.K. economy on Jul. 19 as well as a Bank of England policy decision, to be handed down on Thursday.
The U.S. currency has climbed sharply ever since the previous week’s Fed decision, which hinted that interest rate hikes and asset tapering could come sooner than expected. It gave up some of those gains on Monday as it dipped, however.
""We've had a meaningful shift at the Fed from a longtime dovish stance to now a slightly hawkish one... we've had a bit of a positioning cleanout, the whole world was mega short the dollar and that's in good part probably been cleaned out already, and now we take a wee breath before the next move up,"" Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
Investors will now focus on the U.S. labor market, whose performance will likely influence the Fed’s next moves. They also await Powell’s testimony before a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing later in the day.
However, Powell noted sustained labor market improvement and the recent increase in inflation in written remarks ahead of his testimony.
Other Fed officials, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, also offered toned-down rhetoric. However, New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) warned it was too soon to shift policy as he expects inflation to ease from about 3% in 2021 to around 2% in 2022 and 2023.
Some investors were unsure of Williams’ prediction, however.
""The Fed is nearly always late on such things,"" with core inflation potentially higher at just under 3% by the end of 2022. ""That is not 2% inflation,” with the Fed eventually feeling the pressure to move on interest rates, RBC Capital Markets chief economist Tom Porcelli said in a note.
""In the meantime, we have no doubt with that 2% forecast as cover, Powell will attempt to play down the likelihood of a rate hike in 2022. But just as he eventually relented on taper talk, he will relent on dismissing talk about hiking rates too. Just give it more time,” the note added.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and its rivals slumped on Monday in reaction to an intensifying crackdown on trading and mining in China in addition to technical factors.
""The tides of FONGO, or fear of not getting out, are creeping in,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
""Bitcoin is also at a make-or-break point” as it tests May's low of near $30,000. ""Ethereum looks plain ugly and if crypto is an emotive asset, then one would have to be the staunchest of hodlers to be holding this and not look for some sort of hedge,"" he added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar retreated from two-month highs on Monday as investors evaluated whether a perceived hawkish tilt by the Federal Reserve last week will mark a pause in the dollar bear trend that has been in play since March 2020.
The dollar has surged since the U.S. central bank on Wednesday said that policymakers are forecasting two rate hikes in 2023. That led investors to re-evaluate bets that the U.S. central bank will let inflation run at higher levels for a longer time before hiking rates.
The greenback dropped on Monday but held above where it traded before the Fed's statement on Wednesday.
""There was a rush to clean out outstanding positions that were a little bit maybe too skewed towards dollar shorts,"" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Now, ""the market's trying to catch its breath a little bit before it really decides whether or not to extrapolate this trend towards a stronger dollar.""
The dollar had weakened on expectations that the Fed will hold rates near zero for years to come even as the economy rebounds from COVID-19 pandemic-related shutdowns.
Two regional Federal Reserve officials said on Monday that a faster withdrawal from the central bank's bond purchase program could give it more leeway in deciding when to raise interest rates.
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) also said that more progress is needed before the Fed should begin to scale back some of its economic support.
Comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be in focus on Tuesday to see if he confirms the hawkish outlook or tries to row back market expectations of faster tightening.
Powell said last week there had been initial discussions about when to pull back on the Fed's $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, a conversation that would be completed in coming months as the economy continues to heal.
The dollar index against a basket of currencies fell 0.44% on the day to 91.849. The euro gained 0.41% to $1.1917 and the greenback gained 0.03% to 110.29 Japanese yen.
The British pound gained 1.03% to $1.3933.
Some analysts say the recent market moves have been exaggerated by investors unwinding crowded trades, and that the dollar still faces weakening pressures as the global economy recovers.
""The core thesis underpinning our USD weakness view has not changed drastically,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts said on Monday in a report.
""For one, the global economic recovery is still gathering pace and broadening in scope. Moreover, while the Fed's dots sent a hawkish signal, Chair Powell continued to talk down the risks of a near-term taper. In any case the Fed still looks likely to lag many of its G10 peers in reducing accommodation,"" they said.
Producer price inflation data on Friday will also be in focus for any signals that price pressures may stay higher for longer, which could prompt sooner-than-expected Fed tightening.
""If inflation data comes in a little bit firmer than expected, or is a little bit stickier than expected, then that could portend to more aggressive timelines for the Fed to remove accommodation,"" Rai said.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin's poor recent run continued with a 8.89% drop to $32,390, as China expanded restrictions on mining to the province of Sichuan.
Cryptomining in China accounts for more than half of global bitcoin production.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday, keeping the positive tone generated last week by the Federal Reserve's hawkish turn, which saw it accelerate its timetable for raising interest rates.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 92.267, just off its highest level since April, after having gained 1.9% last week. That was its biggest weekly gain since March 2020.
USD/JPY was down 0.3% at 109.84, EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1867, just above Friday’s two-month low, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7494, just above a six-month low.
The catalyst for this move higher in the dollar was the policy members in the U.S. Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, reacting last week to the strong economic data, and especially the surge in inflation.
The majority of FOMC members expected two interest rate increases of 25 basis points in 2023, a year earlier than expected but, perhaps more importantly, seven of the 18 members felt that the first increase could come as early as next year. 
“I put us starting in late 2022,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday during a TV interview on CNBC, referring to interest rate increases by the U.S. central bank.
Additionally, Fed chief Jerome Powell indicated that the members of the Federal Open Market Committee had begun the conversation on stopping the bank’s massive bond-buying program.
This news pushed short-end yields higher, but the longer-end rates have fallen as traders played down the long-term U.S. inflation risk with a more active Federal Reserve.
At 2:55 AM ET, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yielded 1.39%, the lowest since early March this year, while the 2-year note yielded 0.27%, its highest level since March 2020.
Attention will now turn to comments from several Fed speakers this week, and an appearance by Fed Chair Jerome Powell before Congress on Tuesday in particular.
“Let’s see whether the Fed is prepared to adopt any new language on tapering. Were views to coalesce around tapering actually starting in September – not December -  the dollar could rally further,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3801, just above Friday’s two-month low, with the rapid growth of the new Covid-19 variant and the associated delay of the country’s full reopening continuing to weigh.
That said, there was some good news late Friday, as Fitch Ratings upgraded its outlook for the U.K. sovereign debt to stable from negative, saying the country’s economy has proved more resilient than it expected.
Eyes turn to Thursday’s meeting of the Bank of England, the last for Chief Economist Andy Haldane. 
While the central bank is widely expected to keep its monetary policies on hold, inflation in the U.K. rose above its 2% target in May for the first time in two years, something that Haldane could seize on given his more hawkish stance on reducing stimulus measures.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, holding near multi-month highs. Investors continue to reel from a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision that took the market by surprise during the previous week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 91.287 by 1:10 M ET (5:10 AM GMT). The index gained 1.9% during the previous week in its biggest rise since March 2020.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.32% to 109.84.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7488 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.29% to 0.6953.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.25% to 6.4689 while the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.3798.
The euro stood at $1.1872, after hitting a two-and-a-half-month low of $1.1847 on Friday.
The Fed’s latest decision, handed down during the previous week, hinted that interest rate hikes and asset tapering could begin sooner than expected. Of the 18-person Fed policy board, 13 predicted that interest rates would rise in 2023 versus six previously.
""Like many, I had expected the 61.8 Fibonacci retracement in the dollar index to hold for a bit ... and at least see some consolidation,"" Pepperstone Markets Ltd. head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
""That wasn't to be, and it seems technical resistance means very little when this type of re-positioning event plays out,” he added.
Also hitting investors’ risk appetite were comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Friday that said the Fed's shift toward a faster asset tapering was a ""natural"" response to the recent economic recovery from COVID-19 as well as inflation moving quicker than expected.
""The Fed's latest dot plot was a meaningful surprise. In a scenario where markets continue to move Fed pricing in a hawkish direction, we could envision the euro/dollar falling an additional 2% if European rates remain about unchanged,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note.
But the note also said a sustained dollar is not expected either, as other central banks will need to consider policy normalization as their economies recover from COVID-19.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) will also speak throughout the week.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China kept its loan prime rate steady at 3.85% earlier in the day and the Bank of England will hand down its own policy decision on Thursday. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will also address the European Parliament later in the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar extended its advance against a basket of currencies on Friday, building on the gains logged after the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week surprised markets by signaling it would raise interest rates and end emergency bond-buying sooner than expected.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.37% at 92.213, its highest since mid-April. That puts the index on pace for a weekly gain of nearly 2%, its best weekly jump in about 14 months.
The jolt to foreign exchanges was triggered on Wednesday by Fed forecasts showing 13 of the 18-person policy board saw rates rising in 2023, versus only six previously, with the median board member tipping two hikes in 2023.
Investors' risk appetite took another hit after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Friday that the U.S. central bank's shift this week toward a faster tightening of monetary policy was a ""natural"" response to economic growth and particularly inflation moving quicker than expected as the country reopens from the coronavirus pandemic.
""I think this is a direct echo of the 2013 taper tantrum. You are seeing a perceived shift in the Fed's reaction function driving investors into the safety of the U.S. dollar,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
With investors pricing in a sooner-than-expected tapering of extraordinary U.S. monetary stimulus, the euro and the yen have come under selling pressure over the last few trading sessions.
""Essentially, the entire world was short the dollar going into this, everyone from speculative traders to corporates to investors,"" Schamotta said.
""You are seeing a wholesale unwind here,"" he said.
The unwind of sizeable bearish bets against the dollar is expected to provide support for the greenback in coming days, investors said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management's head of currency, Arnab Nilim, who had been short the U.S. currency headed into the June Fed meeting, told Reuters he has reduced the position and expects the U.S. dollar to perform well, especially against the low-yielding currencies.

Investing.com – The dollar's sunny days are set to continue for quite a while, but the Fed's path will eventually turn murky again to bring the bears out of hiding.      
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.35% to 92.2, and looks set to notch a third-weekly gain.
“Admittedly, the current moderate USD strength may continue for quite a while,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. The positive remarks come just days after the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark rate on hold, but released projections showing rate hikes in 2023.
“After publication of the latest FOMC projections, the dollar was able to gain significantly,” [even as] the OIS market has been pricing in a first Fed rate hike in 2023 for some time,“ Commerzbank said.
But liftoff could occur even sooner, according to St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard.
“I put us starting in late 2022,” Bullard said Friday during a TV interview on CNBC. ""[M]y forecast said 3% inflation in 2021 -- core PCE inflation -- and 2.5% core PCE inflation in 2022.""
""To me, that would meet our new framework where we said we’re going to allow inflation to run above target for some time, and from there we could bring inflation down to 2% over the subsequent horizon,"" he added.
The hawkish tone from Bullard didn’t spook the bond market as the bid remained in place, but yields are expected to eventually move higher, albeit gradually, and that will add another tailwind for the greenback.
“We expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to gradually rise into the 2.25% to 2.75% range by YE 2022 from the current 1.5%,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
“The U.S. Federal Reserve’s near-zero fed funds interest rate target is unlikely to change over the coming 18 months, but at some point during this time period, our central bankers will likely start to hint that they will begin reducing (or “tapering” in Fed-speak) the amount of bonds they are buying in the open market each month from the current $120 billion,” it added.
But for those hoping this could be end of the bear market for the dollar, think again. The dollar’s fate is tied to the Fed’s policy measures and the central bank’s outlook on inflation. This outlook may need to be revised when winter comes calling as the inflationary pressures could abate.
“Only when inflationary pressures ease significantly again in the fall and winter […] should the Fed start to worry again that permanent re-inflation might not materialize after all,” Commerzbank said. “This should make Fed normalization seem less certain again and weigh on the dollar again. We expect the dollar to weaken again from then on.”"

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, continuing to benefit from Wednesday’s surprise move by the Federal Reserve in bringing forward its timetable for raising interest rates.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded less than 0.1% higher at 91.933, after earlier hitting a more than two-month high above 92. The index is on course for a weekly gain of 1.5%, its largest since September.
USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 110.06, after climbing to a 11-week high of 110.82 on Thursday, EUR/USD was largely unchanged at 1.1906, just above a two-month low, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3904, around a six-week low, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7536, near a two-month low.
The dollar is still reaping the rewards of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, taking a more hawkish stance than expected and planning for two interest rate increases of 25 basis points in 2023, a year earlier than expected.
This represented an abrupt change from the previous meeting when none of these officials were looking for hikes during that year. Additionally, Fed chief Jerome Powell indicated that the members of the Federal Open Market Committee had begun the conversation on stopping the bank’s massive bond-buying program.
These moves suggest to the market that the days of readily abundant liquidity are drawing to a close.
“ We think tapering is likely to be telegraphed at the Jackson Hole Symposium in late August, with a formal announcement coming at the September FOMC meeting, and an actual tapering of purchases taking place in Q4,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note. 
Earlier Friday, the Bank of Japan kept its key interest rates unchanged, as expected, and decided to extend by six months the September deadline for its programs to help pandemic-hit firms.
Japan's economy is struggling to rebound from the measures put in place to combat the virus, after gross domestic product fell an annualised 3.9% in the first quarter.
Core consumer prices rose 0.1% in May from a year earlier, the first year-on-year increase since March 2020 but still far removed from the central bank's 2% goal.
On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank, Turkey’s central bank and the Norges Bank all kept interest rates unchanged, with the Norwegian central bank signalling a raise in September as its economy recovers more quickly than most of its peers."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia and is set for its best week in nearly nine months. Investors also continue to recalculate their strategies after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hint of a sooner-than-expected asset tapering.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 91.888 by 1 AM ET (5 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 110.22. The Bank of Japan maintained its interest rate stable at -0.10%, as widely expected, when it handed down its own policy decision earlier in the day.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7536 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.6991.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.4472 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3908.
Investors continue to digest the implications of the Fd hinting at asset tempering and interest rate hikes earlier than expected in its policy decision handed down earlier in the week.
""The Fed sent a very crucial message, that the days of plentiful, abundant, unlimited liquidity are drawing to a close,"" Westpac head of FX strategy Richard Franulovich told Reuters.
""We can now see an end point to zero rates... and they've told us in very plain-speaking English that they've commenced the conversation on how to commence tapering. That signal has precipitated a dramatic position unwind, because dollar shorts were based on that unending liquidity tap from the Fed, and zero rates,"" he added.
The greenback soared above its 200-day moving average to hit a more than two-month high of 92.010 since the Fed decision. It is set for a 1.5% weekly gain, the largest since September 2020.
""The viciousness with which the dollar has bounced back, the impulsive nature of it, tells me that there's been a decisive shift for a lot of big, stale positions... this is a meaningful, decisive re-thinking in dollar prospects, just by the nature of the price action in the last couple of days,” said Franulovich.
Fed forecasts, also known as ‘dot plots’, showed that 13 of the 18-member policy board predicted interest rate hikes in 2023, compared with the previous six. Despite the plots being an inaccurate rates predictor, the sudden deviation caused shock waves throughout the market.
Investors also retreated from U.S. Treasuries, particularly five and 10-year tenors. However, the U.S. yield curve flattened during the previous session as some investors remained hopeful that the Fed’s more hawkish stance could avert hyperinflation.
""For us, the key takeaway... is the market's preconceived idea of a fixed timeline for tapering is the wrong way to think about it,"" RBC Capital Markets FX strategy global head Elsa Lignos told Reuters.
""Perhaps collectively we talked ourselves into the idea that the Fed is so keen to avoid a taper tantrum, that 'they'll be forced to follow the ‘market consensus’. The decision shows that is wrong… every meeting is now live for a taper discussion,"" she added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar jumped on Thursday and hit a two-month high against a basket of currencies, a day after U.S. Federal Reserve officials surprised markets by projecting a hike in interest rates and end to emergency bond-buying sooner than expected.
On Wednesday, Fed officials projected an accelerated timetable for rate increases, began talks on how to end emergency bond-buying, and said the COVID-19 pandemic was no longer a core constraint on U.S. commerce.
A majority of 11 Fed officials penciled in at least two quarter-point rate increases for 2023, adding they would keep policy supportive for now to encourage a labor market recovery.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.53% at 91.892, its highest since mid April. On Wednesday, the dollar surged nearly 1%, its largest daily percentage gain since March 2020.
""Coming into the Fed meeting we felt there was a risk of a more hawkish outcome which could drive some USD strength if it came to happen,"" said Chuck Tomes, associate portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
""Because of that, we did put some protection on in case of that happening,"" he said.
Still, Tomes said he sees the dollar rangebound to weaker over the longer term.
The Fed's new projection prompted some, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), to abandon calls to short the dollar. 
""We continue to forecast broad U.S. Dollar weakness, driven by the currency’s high valuation and a broadening global economic recovery,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Wednesday. 
""However, more hawkish Fed expectations and the ongoing tapering debate look likely to be a headwind to Dollar shorts over the near term,"" said the analysts, closing their recommendation to go long the euro against the dollar.
The Australian dollar - seen as a proxy for risk appetite - was down 0.72% at 0.75545, its lowest since April 1..
Australia also had upbeat data, with job creation beating expectations in May and unemployment diving to pre-pandemic lows.
The dollar was 0.77% higher against the Norwegian crown after Norway's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged as expected, but said an increase was likely in September and steepened its trajectory of subsequent rate rises as the economy recovers from the effects of COVID-19.
The stronger dollar sent sterling below $1.40 to a fresh 5-week low.

Elsewhere, bitcoin was trading at $37,769.48, little changed on the day.

Investing.com -- The dollar rose in early European trade Thursday, climbing to levels not seen for around two months after the Federal Reserve surprised markets with a hawkish turn, bringing forward its timetable for raising interest rates to 2023.
At 3:15 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was traded 0.2% higher at 91.418, after surging nearly 1% overnight, its biggest rise since March of last year.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 110.75, just off its recent high of 110.83, a level not seen since April 1; EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1986, after falling over 1% overnight, its biggest drop since April 2020; GBP/USD was flat at 1.3987, just above its lowest level since May 7; and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7617, recovering to a degree after earlier falling to 0.7598, the lowest since April 13.
The U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and surprised no one by maintaining the current levels of interest rates and monthly bond purchases.
However, the jolt came when new projections saw 11 of 18 central bank policy makers plan for two interest rate increases of 25 basis points in 2023, a year earlier than expected, and a sharp change from the previous meeting when none of these officials were looking for hikes during that year.
With inflation soaring and the economy recovering quickly from the stresses brought about by the pandemic, the market had been expecting the Fed to discuss a timetable for reining in its massive bond-buying program. But this hawkish turn surprised.
The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was at 1.581%, after rallying to as high as 1.5940% from as low as 1.4820% on Wednesday.
“With the world’s so-called ‘smartest market’ expecting a quicker and more aggressive liftoff in interest rates, the fallout from this Fed meeting could continue to drive all markets in the days and weeks to come,” said Matthew Weller, Global Head of Market Research at GAIN Capital.
The only major currency to withstand the dollar’s advance was the New Zealand dollar, with NZD/USD up 0.4% to 0.7076 after the country’s gross domestic product surged 1.6% in the first quarter from the previous quarter.
This was far more than the 0.5% gain expected, as a booming property market helped the economy overcome the collapsing tourism sector with the country’s borders closed.
Elsewhere, USD/BRL was largely unchanged at 5.0556 following Wednesday’s decision by Brazil’s central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to 4.25%, as previously guided, as it struggles to cope with rampant inflation.
These central bank meetings continue thick and fast, with the Swiss National Bank, the Norges Bank and Turkey's central bank meeting later Thursday to decide monetary policy.
The SNB is likely to keep its benchmark interest rate at -0.75%, the lowest level globally, with inflation not an issue, while Norway’s central bank is likely to keep its deposit rate at zero, but suggest a hike is coming as output in this Nordic country nears pre-pandemic levels. An unchanged decision is also expected in Turkey

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Long bets on most of Asia's emerging currencies were trimmed, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as investors weigh the prospect of tighter monetary settings as the U.S. recovery outperforms, while the COVID-19 situation locally is brought under control.
The 13 responses came in before the Federal Reserve's policy meeting late on Wednesday where it stunned by signalling it might raise interest rates as early as 2023, a faster pace than initially assumed.
Emerging markets in the past have not fared well with the prospect of U.S. interest rate hikes, and with the Fed opening the door to an accelerated timetable to wean off pandemic-driven monetary stimulus, it could suck funds out of riskier assets and force Asia's central banks to tighten quicker. 
For now, investors remain largely bullish on emerging currencies in Asia, with long bets on the Taiwan dollar and Indonesian rupiah slightly raised from two weeks ago. 
The central banks of both countries meet later on Thursday and are expected to leave policy rates unchanged at record lows, but may offer more commentary on their own timetable and economic outlook in light of the Fed's hawkish shift.
Taiwan's dollar has appreciated sharply since late March as the economy booms on the work-from-home trend fuelling global demand for tech. 
Bank Indonesia's governor has promised to keep rates low and liquidity in abundance until there is inflationary pressure, but also warned that local bond markets - susceptible to foreign flows - may be impacted by U.S. policy shifts.
Long bets on the rupiah were at their highest since February. 
The Fed's hawkish messaging sent the U.S. dollar to its highest level in around two months and resulted in declines across Asia's currency space on Thursday, including a more than 0.5% drop by the rupiah. 
Emerging markets ""will face material headwinds over the next several months"" and ""will likely sell off in absolute terms and will underperform their DM (developed market) peers,"" said Arthur Budaghyan, chief emerging markets strategist at BCA Research.
Broadly, long bets on China's yuan were lowered after they hit a six-month high in the last poll. It follows the central bank stepping in to warn against speculative bets on the currency after its recent rally.
ING, in a note, said the yuan's rise will slow from now on. 
Bullish bets on the Singapore dollar, South Korean won and Philippine peso were all trimmed. 
For the Indian rupee, a strong performer in May, long bets were also lowered. 
The ""significant hit to economic confidence in the second wave suggests the recovery is going to be delayed,"" analysts at ING said, adding that it will cap any significant upside in the rupee.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what market participants believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, rising to its highest level in almost two months. Investors continue to digest the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprisingly hawkish tone in its latest policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.14% to 91.332 by 1:02 AM ET (5:02 AM GMT). The index climbed nearly 1% during the previous session, its biggest gain since March 2020.
The USD/JPY pair was steady at 110.69.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.22 % to 0.7627. Australian employment data for May released earlier in the day was better than expected, with the employment change at 115,200. The unemployment rate fell to 5.1%.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair gained 0.57% to 0.7089. Data released earlier in the day said that New Zealand’s GDP grew 1.6% quarter-on-quarter and 2.4% year-on-year in the first quarter. Both figures were higher than expected.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.41% to 6.4232. Chinese economic data, released on Wednesday, said that industrial production grew a worse-than-expected 8.8% year-on-year in May while the unemployment rate was 5.2%.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 1.3997 but fell below the $1,400-mark.
The dollar hit an almost two-month high of $1.1984 against the euro on Thursday, extending its gain of about 1% from the previous session.
The Fed brought forward its projections for the first post-COVID-19 interest rate hikes into 2023 as it handed down its decision on Wednesday. An improving COIVD-19 situation, with states including California and New York re-opening, was cited for the reversal from the central bank’s previous stance that COVID-19 was weighing on the economy.
A majority 8 of 11 Fed officials forecast at least two quarter-point interest rate increases for 2023, despite pledging to maintain the current dovish policy for now to courage the ongoing recovery in the job market.
Meanwhile, inflation is expected to jump in 2021, even as price pressures are still expected to be temporary. Overall economic growth is also expected to hit 7%.
""The Fed's super hawkish pivot should reinforce the lows and offer further near-term dollar support... a double whammy of higher rates and wobbly risk sentiment would result in positioning squeeze and the start of a new narrative,"" possibly resulting in ""a 2% broad USD rally through the summer months,"" TD Securities analysts said in a note.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.5890% on Thursday, after rallying to as high as 1.5940% from as low as 1.4820% the day before.
Investors now await decisions from other central banks, including the Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank later in the day, followed by the Bank of Japan on Friday.
The strengthening dollar also hit cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin near the $38,624-mark following a 4.5% slide on Wednesday, and ether traded at $2,393."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar jumped to a near six-week high on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve brought forward its projections for the first post-pandemic interest rate hikes into 2023, citing an improved health situation and dropping a long-standing reference that the crisis was weighing on the economy.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.63% at 91.103, its highest since May 6.
A majority of 11 Fed officials penciled in at least two quarter-point interest rate increases for 2023, even as officials in their statement pledged to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery.
The projections showed the outlook for inflation jumping this year, though the price increases were still described as ""transitory."" Overall economic growth is expected to hit 7%.
""The interesting thing is that the Fed has gone beyond simply acknowledging that inflation is rising and that the U.S. economy has a lot of momentum, and it has essentially shifted to a much more hawkish stance in this set of projections,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.39% to 110.49 yen, its highest since April 6.
The dollar, which slumped through much of 2020, staged a rebound earlier this year, but that relief rally appeared to run out of steam through May as investors remained convinced that the Fed will keep interest rates lower for longer as it seeks to support the economy.
While the Fed's new language does not mean a change in policy is imminent it does provide more support for the greenback, analysts said.
""I think we're back to talking about a mild rally in the U.S. dollar and the data becoming very important over the summer period prior to Jackson Hole and September's meeting,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe.
Risk-sensitive currencies logged a sharp reversal following the Fed announcement, with the New Zealand dollar down 0.98% at $0.7049 and the Australian dollar - which is seen as a proxy for risk appetite - up 0.95% at $0.7612.

Sterling, which had strengthened against the dollar on Wednesday after data showed British inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's 2% target in May, gave up those gains to trade down 0.49%.
Meanwhile, bitcoin's recent rally appeared to run out of steam, as the world's largest cryptocurrency fell 4.34% to $38,430.03.

Ten-year yields rose five basis points to 1.54%, extending a rebound from a three-month low of 1.427% touched last week, as it touched the highest since June 8.
The projections of when central-bank officials envision lifting their benchmark overnight rate from near zero also sent the dollar surging. Bond-market gauges of inflation expectations fell.
The Fed’s quarterly projections showed 13 of 18 officials favored at least one rate increase by the end of 2023, versus seven in March. Eleven officials saw at least two hikes by the end of that year. In addition, seven of them saw a move as early as 2022, up from four.

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally lower in early European trade Wednesday, but remained near a one-month high as traders warily await the latest communications from the Federal Reserve following the recent jump in U.S. inflation.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was less than 0.1% lower at 90.468, having hit a one-month high of 90.677 on Tuesday.
USD/JPY was largely unchanged at 110.06, near its two-month high of 110.325 touched earlier this month, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.4087, above Tuesday’s one-month low of 1.4035, and EUR/USD was marginally higher at 1.2128. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7698. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its latest two-day policy meeting later Wednesday. Although the two-day meeting is expected to culminate in an unchanged decision on interest rates and monthly bond purchases, the backdrop of sharply rising inflation as the country’s economy makes a solid recovery appears to be keeping traders on edge.
“The Fed is expected to leave policy unchanged and again play down taper talk. Nonetheless, markets will be looking for hints on whether the Fed is starting to acknowledge that inflation may not be as transitory as thought,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Further evidence of these inflationary pressures, and thus raised fears of a hawkish surprise, emerged Tuesday, with data showing wholesale inflation jumped to record levels, just a week after consumer prices rose to their highest level since 2008. 
Balancing this out, to a degree, May’s retail sales data came in weaker than expected on Tuesday, pointing to softer consumer spending, the backbone of the economy, even if April’s release was revised higher.
Still, even if there are some concerns over the Fed turning hawkish, the moves in the foreign exchange market have been limited of late, suggesting many still have faith in the Fed's commitment to provide clear signaling before making a move on monetary policy. 
The Federal Open Market Committee has ""indicated it will first offer ample notice to the market before beginning the taper conversation and furthermore give ample warning before formally announcing intentions to taper, a process which itself will take quite some time,"" analysts at Stifel said, in a note.
Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter.
Ahead of the Fed's statement, at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), markets will keep an eye on the U.S. housing market, with housing starts and building permits data due for May.
Elsewhere, USD/BRL dropped marginally to 5.0426 ahead of the latest meeting of Brazil’s central bank. This is expected to result in the central bank lifting its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points, this time to 4.25%, matching its move in May, as it struggles to cope with rampant inflation.
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said last week that policymakers are ""100% committed"" to meeting the bank's inflation goals. This year's target is 3.75% with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side, and next year's is 3.50%, with the same level of leeway.
Data last week showed monthly inflation in May at a 25-year high for that month and the annual rate above 8% for the first time since 2016.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia but remained near a one month high ahead of a highly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 90.468 by 13:11 AM ET (5:11 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was steady at 110.06. The yen remained near a two-month low against the dollar touched earlier the month, with investors awaiting a Bank of Japan policy decision on Friday.
Japanese trade data for May disappointed, with exports growing 49.6% year-on-year and the trade balance contracting to JPY187.1 billion. However, imports grew a better-than-expected 27.9% year-on-year.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.7696 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.32% to 0.7142.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.4008. Chinese economic data, including industrial production and the unemployment rate, is due later in the day.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.4089. The pound hit a one-month low of $1.4035 during the previous session despite the release of better-than-expected employment data, including April's average earnings index and bonus.
However, the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 that forced U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to delay his plans to lift lockdown measures by three weeks, remains a big risk.
U.S. economic data released on Thursday said core retail sales contracted a larger-than-expected 0.7% month-on-month in May. The producer price index growing a better-than-expected 0.8% month-on-month and 6.6% year-on-year respectively in May.
Meanwhile, industrial production for May grew a better-than-expected 0.8% month-on-month but slowing down slightly to a 16.37% growth year-on-year.
The Fed is widely expected to acknowledge the first conversations about when and how fast to begin asset tempering when it hands down its policy decision later in the day.
Some investors insisted the Fed would refrain from any hints of a start in assert tempering anytime soon.
""The Fed has said they're going to be reactionary to the data... and they’ve said they want to see extended inflationary conditions before they make any commitment to tapering or hikes,""  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank Tokyo branch manager Bart Wakabayashi told Reuters.
However, the dollar could rally at any hint that the Fed will bring asset tapering forward or start discussing rate hikes sooner than expected. ""I think they’ll stick to the same tagline, and it will probably end up being a non-event,” Wakabayashi added.
Other investors added that the dollar could rise by default as other major currencies seemed to be losing momentum.
""We have to note that the dollar is strengthening now even as U.S. debt yield has dropped below 1.5%… today's currency market suggests there is strong potential pressure to lift the dollar, should there be some sort of surprises from the Fed,"" SMBC Nikko Securities chief FX strategist Makoto Noji told Reuters."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a one-month high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, aided by data showing inflation speeding up, but its gains were capped as traders awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting for hints of plans to start tapering its bond purchases.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in May, with spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to shake off COVID-19 restrictions.
But robust demand is outpacing supply, stoking inflation, with several recent readings of inflation gauges - including the producer price index released on Tuesday - signaling rising price pressures.
""The U.S. dollar kept firm as another hot reading on inflation overshadowed a chilly consumer,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
The Fed's two-day meeting was set to end on Wednesday and it is due to issue a policy statement afterward. So far Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have said rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time. 
Recent economic data has raised concerns that price pressure could force an earlier stimulus withdrawal.
""Assuming that some of the recent increase in inflation is indeed sustained, we would argue that the Fed will react to it, supporting the USD later this year,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said in note.
Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.04% higher at 90.529, after rising as high as 90.677, its highest since May 14.
The pound fell to a one-month low against the dollar on Tuesday in what analysts said was the breaking of a technical level that did not change the bullish narrative on the British currency. The British currency was last down 0.18% against the greenback.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin hovered around the $40,000 level, a day after it climbed above that mark for the first time in more than two weeks, aided by the promise of fresh investment from major backer MicroStrategy and an upbeat tweet from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk.

Musk on Sunday flagged that the carmaker could resume transactions using the token if miners can use cleaner energy to process them.

Turkey’s lira fell for a second day, continuing to shed last week’s gains after a much-anticipated meeting between the U.S. President Joe Biden and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan failed to produce a breakthrough that would ease political tensions.
The lira weakened as much as 1.1% against the dollar on Tuesday, leading declines among emerging market currencies a day after Erdogan met with President Joe Biden on the margins of a NATO summit in Brussels. The yield on 10 year bonds jumped 16 basis points to 18.20%, while the benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index was little changed.
Erdogan Says Turkish Stance on Russian S-400 Missiles Unchanged
The currency rallied more than 3% last week, notching up the best performance from an emerging market currency on optimism that the meeting between the heads of state of two NATO members could ease tensions between the countries.
However, Erdogan’s remarks that Turkey’s stance on its purchase of Russian S-400 missile systems remains unchanged dashed hopes for imminent progress.
Although the two leaders “stated that their teams would continue discussions,” no major breakthroughs were announced, a factor that led the lira to surrender some last week’s gains, Istanbul-based Seker Investment wrote in a morning note.

USD/JPY gained marginally to 110.09, just off a hit a seven-session high, GBP/USD was flat at 1.4112, and EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2127, just above a one-month low of 1.2093 it hit last week, The risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7711, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve starts its latest two-day policy meeting later Tuesday against a backdrop of sharply rising inflation as the country’s economy makes a solid recovery as it gradually reopens.
Fed officials, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, have been insistent that these inflationary pressures will be transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings will stay in place for some time to come. However, with positioning heavily loaded against the dollar, traders are wary of any shift in tone with a potential discussion about tapering its bond-buying.
“The Fed meeting is the last big event before the summer period and will likely set the market tone for the coming weeks. We expect caution will prevail and the dollar may ultimately lose some support,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Ahead of the Fed's statement and news conference on Wednesday, markets will eye U.S. retail sales and PPI data for May as well as the NY Empire State manufacturing survey later on Tuesday, as the Fed officials will be using these numbers to help guide their decisions.
Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY is up 0.1% to 8.4665, with the Turkish lira extending losses against the dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his nation’s stance remains unchanged on the S-400 missile-defence system it purchased from Russia.

Fed officials, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, have so far insisted that any inflationary pressure is temporary, and that the current dovish monetary policy will remain in place for some time to come.
However, moves remained small after recent economic data, including the consumer price index, led to mounting concerns of an earlier-than-expected stimulus withdrawal. The European Central Bank also maintained a dovish tone as it met and handed down its policy decision during the previous week.
""While Powell will tread carefully, I expect that the Fed is warming to a more open discussion about tapering, to be formally announced in the September meeting,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
""Any view that cements a formal announcement in September should be modestly dollar bullish, but the risks are symmetrical as Powell will be keen to not hurt financial conditions,"" the note added.
Investors now widely expect a tapering announcement in the next quarter, even as the U.S. job market recovery remains patchy.
On the central bank front, the Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day. The Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday, followed by the Bank of Japan on Friday.
Investors also await the U.S. producer price index, alongside retail sales and industrial production figures, which will be released later in the day.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin climbed above $41,000 for the first time in more than two weeks during the previous session. Tesla Inc.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was little changed against a basket of major currencies on Monday as traders awaited a much-anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later this week that might signal a change in the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
Currency markets settled in tight ranges with implied volatility plumbing to multi-year lows after last week's strong inflation readings and a dovish European Central Bank meeting failed to dislodge currencies from recent trading levels.
""It's all about the FOMC this week, and we'll be watching to see exactly how much taper talk has really been going on and if it has any impact on the medium term outlook,"" Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said in a note.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was about flat on the day at 90.512. Last week the index rose 0.4%, its largest weekly change in five weeks.
Muted FX moves in recent weeks crushed the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) FX Volatility Index down to 5.6 on Friday, its lowest in nearly 16 months.

Against the yen the dollar rose 0.38% to a more than one-week high of 110.09 yen.
""A modest uptick in Treasury yields has been supportive of the rate-sensitive pairing,"" said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics.
The dollar's strength against the Japanese currency may be a sign the FX market is looking for a less dovish outcome from the Fed meeting, Simpson said.
The Fed begins a scheduled two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll said a much-anticipated taper announcement will come in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market.
Recent data pointing to a surge in inflation has raised concerns that price pressure following the post-COVID-19 economic reopening could force policymakers into an earlier tapering of currency-depreciating stimulus.

Sterling was largely unmoved by Monday's news that Britain is set to delay the end of social distancing measures as the government seeks to contain a rapid rise in COVID-19 infections.

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trade Monday, with traders showing caution ahead of the latest two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was marginally lower at 90.483, after posting a gain of just over 0.5% last week.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.76, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.4112, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.2104, after touching an almost one-month low of 1.2093 in the previous session, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was 0.1% higher at 0.7711. 
The greenback saw some gains last week after the U.S. consumer price index jumped 5.0% year-on-year in May, the sharpest rise in more than a dozen years, raising fears the Federal Reserve will be forced into reining in its ultra easy monetary policies earlier than expected.
However, those gains were limited as many in the markets seem to have bought into the repeated comments by policy makers that inflation would be transitory. 
“The Fed will likely be forced into debating moderate overshooting of the inflation target but it still seems as if the market discards big directional surprises to the inflation outlook. The Fed will not be convinced of sustained pressure in June,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Still, while the central bank may not move this week, after all employment increased by 559,000 last month, less than economists expected, Fed officials may be close to giving clues on the timing for slimming its asset-purchase program.
According to a Bloomberg survey, some 40% expect the Fed to take its first step toward tapering its current $120 billion in monthly bond purchases in late August when Chair Jerome Powell hosts a policy retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Another 24% see that happening the following month.
Elsewhere, USD/RUB is rising again, up 0.4% to 72.0205, even after Russia's central bank raised its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Friday.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the board had considered an even bigger rise of 75 or 100 basis points and that another rate hike was highly probable when they next meet on July 23.
Annual consumer inflation, the central bank's main area of responsibility, accelerated to 6% in May, a level not seen since October 2016 when the key rate was at 10%.
USD/TRY traded 0.1% higher at 8.3885, following Sunday’s news that Turkey signed a new $3.6 billion swap agreement with China, increasing the limit on their existing currency arrangement to $6 billion.
The arrangement with one of Turkey’s biggest trading partners will allow the country to boost trade in local currency and avoid using dollars, supporting the central bank’s reserves.

Investing.com – The dollar jumped Friday, and is set for its first weekly gain in three weeks as the prospect of fresh clues on Federal Reserve monetary policy and weakness in the euro has restored some swagger to the world's reserve currency.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.51% to 90.54.
There are just days to go until the Federal Reserve's two day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, and recent hot inflation report is likely to get the conversation started on tapering. This is good news for the yields and the dollar.
""The discussion about a Fed exit from bond purchases in the face of rising inflationary pressures should drive the yield on ten-year Treasuries to 2%,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. ""For the dollar, we see upside potential in the short term due to the economic boom in the US.""
But the lift to the dollar will only hold out as long as inflation delivers its end of the bargain. If the pace of inflation fades, then all bullish bets on the greenback are off.
""If inflation falls again next year, and it becomes clear that the Fed is taking its time with interest rate hikes, we expect yields to fall again somewhat and the dollar to weaken again,"" Commerzbank added.
Still, Treasury yields were hovering at unchanged levels on Friday, suggesting the greenback had been given a helping hand from a demise in the euro, which makes up about half of the weighing of the dollar index.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro and sterling dipped against the dollar on Friday as investors bet interest rates would stay lower for longer in Europe and Britain while looking ahead to next week's U.S. monetary policy meeting.
The dollar index, showing its strongest weekly gain since early May, was last up 0.57% on the day at 90.5810 while the euro was down 0.63% at $1.2099, on track for its biggest weekly decline since the end of April.
A day after the European Central Bank stuck to its dovish stance, ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said that flexible fiscal rules would be needed for years as monetary policy remains constrained.
""ECB policy makers are indicating that inflation rates are way below levels that are needed to put upward pressure on rates,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
""That's cutting away at the euro's recent rally, putting some downward pressure on it. The biggest contributor to the move we've seen overnight is the (euro) weakness as opposed to idiosyncratic dollar positive forces. The dollar's winning the reverse beauty contest,"" Schamotta added.
Sterling was down 0.54% at $1.4098 as traders worried about slower-than-expected growth as the rapid spread of the Delta variant in Britain raised concerns that much of the country may not be able to fully reopen from a COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown on June 21, as previously hoped.
Currency markets had been sluggish all week in anticipation of Thursday's release of U.S. consumer prices, which rose 5% year-on-year in May.
But even with the number above expectations, there was little market reaction. Investors seemed to back the Federal Reserve's assertion that high inflation would be temporary.
Economists see the central bank announcing in August or September a strategy for reducing its massive bond-buying program, but do not expect it to start cutting monthly purchases until early next year, a Reuters poll found.
Traders were still preparing for volatility around the Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for the week ahead, according to Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets 
""If you're starting from a position where you're already short dollars, since FOMC meetings often have a lot of volatility, you might reduce your short for risk management purposes,"" Anderson said. 

Meanwhile investors left riskier currencies such as the Australian dollar, which was down 0.72% at $0.7697 after hitting its lowest level for the week while the New Zealand dollar was off 1.01% at $0.7123 after touching its lowest level since May 4.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, which recovered slightly in recent sessions, was on track for a 3% weekly gain and last up 0.3% at $36,817.94 on the day. Ether was last down 3% and set for an 11.7% weekly drop. Both are still trading significantly below their earlier peaks.

248,"<span>Jun 11, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- South Africa agreed to sell a majority stake in the country’s grounded national carrier to a local jet-leasing company and private-equity firm, ridding the government of an entity that has long been a drain on state finances.
A consortium comprised of Johannesburg-based Global Airways, which owns recently launched domestic airline Lift, and private-equity firm Harith General Partners will take a 51% shareholding in South African Airways, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Friday. The government will retain a minority stake.
The grouping named Takatso will invest as much as 3.5 billion rand ($257 million) over the next three years, Lift co-founder Gidon Novick and Harith Chief Executive Officer Tshepo Mahloele said in an interview.
“Government will have no further financial obligations to the company, outside of the existing liabilities that they will settle,” Novick said. “Route networks we are still working on, and it will be a phased rollout based on demand re-emerging post Covid.”
The sale of SAA comes about six weeks after the airline emerged from lengthy bankruptcy proceedings, having reduced its workforce by almost 80% and cut liabilities. The next challenge is to resume international flights, though South Africa remains cut off from much of the world due to pandemic travel restrictions.
“With this partnership, we believe we are closer to achieving the important objective of having a sustainable national airline,” Gordhan said. The new SAA “will be agile enough to cope with the current uncertainty, and improvement, in global travel.”
The deal represents a triumph of sorts for Gordhan, who has argued for the revival of SAA with the help of private investors while others were calling for it to be liquidated. The carrier has been the beneficiary of numerous bailouts and government debt guarantees over the years, and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni reluctantly allocated 10.5 billion rand from the state last year to help it stay afloat.
Global Airways started Lift in December last year under Novick, a former head of Comair Ltd., which operates the South African low-cost airline Kulula. Harith invests in infrastructure across Africa, and is the co-owner of Lanseria Airport north-west of Johannesburg.
While SAA is now “solvent and liquid,” business-rescue practitioners said April 30, subsidiaries including low-cost arm Mango and maintenance firm SAA Technical remain under financial strain and are in the process of being recapitalized.

Nigeria’s biggest mobile payments company is vying to become Africa’s next unicorn, and its ambitions now stretch beyond the continent.
Paga, whose backers include U.S. billionaire investor Tim Draper and former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economist Jim O’Neill, boasts 17 million unique users including tech entrepreneurs, businesses and individuals in Africa’s most populous nation.
Modeled after PayPal, it processed $2.3 billion worth of transactions in 2020 and $8 billion during the past four years, according to Tayo Oviosu, the company’s chief executive officer who founded it in 2009. Paga could reach a valuation of at least $1 billion “in the next year or two,” Oviosu said in an interview.
Tech unicorns -- startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more -- are less of a rarity in Nigeria as companies catering to a large unbanked population revolutionize the way people transfer money and pay for goods and services. A crop of firms from Flutterwave to Interswitch have achieved that status.
Oviosu, who returned to Nigeria from the U.S. more than a decade ago with a Stanford MBA and experience at companies like Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)., wouldn’t disclose the company’s current valuation.
But he’s already setting his sights outside his home country by looking to expand to Ethiopia and Mexico, where it could similarly facilitate payments for the millions who lack access to banking services. Paga’s foray into Ethiopia, Africa’s second-most populous nation, is planned for next year.
To expand Paga’s reach, the company is counting on what it considers a game-changer of a deal with  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). The agreement will provide for merchant solutions in Nigeria from this month, allowing payments by money transfer and a QR code among others.
“It has significant potential to grow our revenue,” Oviosu said.
Central to Paga’s business is a network of agents who effectively perform the functions of a bank teller.
Deployed across Nigeria, the company’s 27,000 agents are registering new customers for Paga accounts and helping them process payments or put cash into a bank deposit. Paga is also making its programming interface available to tech entrepreneurs for payments while expanding its consumer business through the partnership with Visa.
The West African nation, where 60 million people are among the unbanked, is embracing the boom in fintechs that are promoting inclusion through mobile payments. Many startups are concentrated in Yaba, a district in the commercial hub of Lagos that’s also attracted the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The technology industry is also increasingly in favor with lenders in the economy of Africa’s biggest oil producer. The government has similarly taken notice, spending more on tech infrastructure to boost innovation and create jobs.
Given Paga’s growing business footprint and the prospects for additional fundraising, Oviosu thinks becoming a unicorn is only a matter of time.
“We are focused on making it simple for people to pay, get paid, shop and sell,” he said. “I know the runway to where we are projecting to be from where we are today.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, as traders wagered that a hefty rise in U.S. consumer prices would not be enough to immediately jolt the Federal Reserve from its ultra easy monetary policy stance.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.990, marginally lower for the week.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.40, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.4179, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was marginally higher at 0.7753. 
Data released on Thursday saw the U.S. consumer price index jumping 5.0% year-on-year in May, the sharpest rise in more than a dozen years, up 0.6% on the month, while core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 3.8% year-on-year and 0.7% month-on-month in May.
The foreign exchange market had been wary of strong inflation numbers all week, and this exceeded expectations. However, the response has been muted as the CPI release included hefty contributions from short-term rises in airline ticket prices and used cars, all of which played into the Fed narrative of the surge in inflation being a temporary phenomena.
This belief in Fed thinking can clearly be seen in the bond market, as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to a three-month low of 1.44%. When investors were worried about inflation in March, the yield had spiked to almost 1.78%.
Attention now turns to next week’s meeting of the FOMC, but there are no longer any great expectations of a shift in rhetoric over the need to taper stimulus.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2188, with ECB chief Christine Lagarde’s renewed pledge to deliver faster bond buying, despite improvements in the central bank’s growth forecasts, keeping gains by the single currency in check.
“The main takeaway from the ECB is that accommodation is here to stay and, like the Fed, it wants to be data rather than forecast driven,” said Kathy Lien, an analyst at BK Asset Management.
Later Friday sees the Russian central bank meet to decide on the appropriate level for interest rates in the country following an unexpectedly high inflation release earlier in the week.
Annual consumer inflation accelerated to 6.0% in May, according to data released  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY), way above the central bank’s target of 4%, and the highest since October 2016.
Interest rates were at 10% then, but are now at 5%, prompting most economists polled to expect a hike by 50 basis points, at 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), to 5.5%.
At 2:55 AM ET, USD/RUB traded 0.7% lower at 71.8027.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia after the U.S. posted higher-than-expected inflation data in May.
The US Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 89.980 by 12:14 AM ET (4:14 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 109.40, with a new analysis saying another COVID-19 surge could come in Japan with or without the Olympics.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7755 as Australia is working on a quarantine-free travel corridor with Singapore. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7195.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.10% to 6.3865.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.4182. Investors will be monitoring the opening of the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in the U.K. on Friday.
In the U.S., data released on Thursday said that the consumer price index (CPI) jumped 5.0% year-on-year in May, above 4.7% in forecasts and 4.2% growth during the previous session. It posted the sharpest rise in over a dozen years. Its core CPI increased 3.8% year-on-year and 0.7% month-on-month in May, both above forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
However, investors are betting that price pressures are not going to force the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank to hike interest rates sooner than expected due to hefty contributions from short-term rises in airline ticket prices and used cars.
""It basically fit the Fed script, that we'd get a burst but it's going to be temporary… this report is consistent with that, it doesn't argue against it. I think the market needed something that argued against it to push the dollar higher,"" Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
Investors now await the Fed’s meeting next week, although investors are aligning with the Fed’s view that inflationary pressures are temporary and that the central bank will keep its current dovish monetary policy unchanged for a while.
It is expected that the central bank will announce a plan for reducing bond buying, but it isn't forecast to begin until 2022, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
""What we're seeing is a market that believes in the Fed…we're going to get tapering… but it's going to get done a such a snail's pace."" Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, told Reuters.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde on Thursday pledged to deliver faster bond buying as the central bank handed down its policy decision.
“A sustained rise in market rates could translate into a tightening of wider financing conditions… such a tightening would be premature and would pose a risk to the ongoing economic recovery,” Lagarde said."

Investing.com – The euro whipsawed against the dollar but ended the day flat Thursday as the European Central Bank signaled that policy would remain lower for longer, but signs of division among bank members on tapering sets up a rocky road to the September meeting.
EUR/USD fell 0.07% to $1.2171 after hitting a low of $1.2144.
The European Central Bank kept its benchmark rate steady at 0.00%, and said it expected over the ""coming quarter"" to continue purchases at a “significantly higher” pace than seen in the first months of 2021.
Heading into the decision, inflation was running high, prompting many to expect that the bank would have to go the extra mile to reassure investors that any notion of tapering would be dead on arrival.
The pickup in inflation was factored into the central bank's latest projection as it upped its forecasts for economic growth and inflation for this year and 2022, but in a sign that it believes that pressure will transitory left its 2023 forecast unchanged.
The ECB also welcomed the recovery in the market, describing the risks to the economic outlook as ""broadly balanced.""
This acknowledgement of an improving recovery didn't shift the bank's thinking on tapering. ECB Governor Christine Lagarde ""insisted that there had been no discussion whatsoever in the meeting over the pace or nature of asset purchases further ahead than the coming quarter,"" said Daiwa Capital Markets.
But behind the scenes at the central bank, not all its members appear to signing from the same page, setting up a tricky few months for the ECB governor.
""Lagarde admitted that there had been some diverging views on the Governing Council over today's decision on the near-term pace of purchases, giving a taste of the potentially acrimonious debates ahead at September's meeting,"" Daiwa added.
Beyond the tricky taper talks, however, most see the euro gaining on the dollar amid a backdrop of improving eurozone economy as vaccinations gather pace, allowing a speedier reopening

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar index was down slightly on Thursday after alternating between losses and gains earlier in the session as investors digested elevated U.S. inflation and European Central Bank commentary while eyeing the U.S. Federal Reserve's next meeting.
After adopting a wait-and-see attitude all week, sucking volatility from the market and leaving major currencies mostly range-bound, Thursday's developments appeared to add little new direction to currency markets.
Earlier in the day, the ECB raised its growth and inflation views but promised to keep ample stimulus flowing, fearing that a retreat now would accelerate a worrisome rise in borrowing costs and choke off recovery.
Then in the United States, data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly 15 months, while consumer prices increased further in May as the pandemic's easing grip on the economy continued to boost domestic demand.
While emerging market currencies such as the Turkish lira showed more pronounced reactions, dollar traders were already cautiously looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Open market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting scheduled for next week.
""The dollar's on the sidelines as it looks for the next key event risk and that's the FOMC meeting and the prospects the Fed might begin the talk of tapering, which could provide support to the dollar,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed income and currency strategy at Amundi U.S. 
Investors were closely watching U.S. consumer prices for any signs that higher prices could last longer than expected, potentially challenging the Fed's insistence that inflation pressures are transitory and that monetary stimulus should stay in place for some time yet.
While Upadhyaya sees Thursday's data supporting the U.S. central bank's stance, he said ""a lot of people fearing they could get chopped up in the price action might just want to wait"" before making big bets. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has fluctuated narrowly around the psychologically important 90 level, and was last down 0.08% at 90.0670 The euro was last down 0.05% at $1.2172.
""You have this tug between the two currencies, and it's creating a back and forth. That's why you're seeing a little bit of a cap in terms of dollar weakness and euro strength,"" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank.
""The overall trend has been a bit of dollar weakness, not just because of the robust growth in the U.S. There's been robust growth overall. A lot of economies have been recovering,"" he said. ""When you have optimism in overall global growth, typically that creates a risk on mentality that's going to favor other currencies over the dollar.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, amid cautious trading with traders looking towards key U.S. inflation data and an ECB meeting for clues of future direction. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.180, continuing to fluctuate narrowly around the psychologically-important 90 level,
EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2167, falling back from the one-week high of 1.2218 seen during the previous session, USD/JPY dropped 0.1% at 109.55, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4112, while AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7737. 
Activity within the foreign exchange market has been limited all week, leaving major currencies mostly range-bound, with traders cautiously awaiting the release of the U.S. Labor Department's consumer prices data for May. 
Last month's report showed consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April, and that called into question the Federal Reserve's guidance that current inflation pressures would be transitory and thus monetary stimulus should stay in place for some time yet. 
Another strong report would increase the pressure on the central bank to act even further, potentially driving up U.S. Treasury yields to the benefit of the dollar. 
Economists are looking for CPI to have advanced 0.4% on the month in May, an annual climb of 4.7% for the headline figure. The core figure, which excludes price rises from the volatile food and energy sectors, is seen up 0.4% on the month, 3.4% on the year.
“We are likely in for another inflation shocker,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, pointing to two main components to watch in the core inflation report, the price rises associated with used cars and rent.
“If the rent of shelter component reaches 2.5% (we find that likely over the coming months) and the used car component prints at 50% YoY, then you already have a cocktail that could bring core inflation above 4%. This is clearly above the early consensus at 3.4%. This is a risk scenario for May, but seems feasible at the latest in the June report.”
The other major event Thursday is the latest policy decision by the European Central Bank, with investors carefully watching for any clues of an imminent slowdown to its bond-buying program.
“While the Governing Council remains divided, the majority is likely to support a decision to continue buying bonds at close to the current pace, as the recovery is not yet on a solid footing,” Nordea said, in another note.
Elsewhere, USD/CAD rose 0.1% to 1.2115, after the Bank of Canada decided Wednesday to leave its key interest rate at historic lows while maintaining its current pace of bond purchases.  
This move throws the focus forward to next month’s meeting, amid growing expectations for another reduction in emergency stimulus.
The central bank was among the first from advanced economies to shift to a less expansionary policy in April, when it accelerated the timetable for a possible interest-rate increase and pared back its bond purchases.

The economy is operating within a reasonable range close to the potential output level, and prices are overall manageable, he added.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 1.4112.
Moves remained small as investors continued to take a wait-and-see approach that also removed some market volatility.
The U.S. inflation data, including May’s consumer price index, is much anticipated after the previous month’s report said that consumer prices increased by the largest margin in 12 years in April.
With forecasts prepare by Investing.com predicting a 0.4% increase, bets are now on that higher price will last longer than anticipated. This also calls the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent insistence that inflation pressure is temporary into question.
Although the greenback remained bound to a narrow range ahead of the data, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have tumbled within the past week, falling from 1.6350% on the past Friday to 1.874% earlier in the Asian session.
""It feels like the balance of risk is tilted to the upside on U.S. CPI versus the consensus, which would favor a sell-off in Treasuries, and thus higher yields and subsequently a stronger dollar... bonds seem overbought,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
On the central bank front, investors will be looking out for any signs that the ECB will start tapering its asset purchases in its policy decision. Although the central bank is widely expected to keep the status quo on its policy, any signs of tapering could impact the euro’s movement.
The single currency rose to a one-week high at $1.2218 on Wednesday before finishing little changed and remained near the $1.2178 mark as the Asian session opened.
Investors also await the Fed’s policy decision, due to be handed down the following week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was little changed and off session lows on Wednesday as investors focused on a European Central Bank meeting and the upcoming U.S. consumer price index report to help gauge the current pace of the economic recovery. 
Both are due Thursday, and investors have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, leaving major currencies mostly range-bound recently.
The U.S. Labor Department's consumer prices data has been much anticipated after last month's report showed consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April, fueling the view that higher prices could last longer than some anticipate. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the CPI advanced 0.4% in May.
Earlier, Chinese producer price data for May showed the biggest jump in a dozen years, and the country's consumer prices rose 1.3% in May - the biggest year-on-year increase in eight months - but below expectations.
With the ECB, investors will be watching for any clues of an imminent slowdown to its bond-buying program.
The Bank of Canada on Wednesday left its key interest rate unchanged as expected, and said it would maintain its current policy of quantitative easing. It also reiterated its guidance that rates would remain unchanged until at least the second half of 2022.
The Canadian dollar rose against the greenback in the wake of the announcement. In afternoon trade it was flat at 1.21 per dollar.
The dollar index was last up 0.03% at 90.14, with the euro also nearly unchanged at $1.2176.
The message that's begun to resonate with investors is that central bank policymakers are going to ""brush off high short-term prices,"" and that's led to a lower U.S. dollar, said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive in Toronto.
""The inflation numbers are going to run hotter than what they anticipate in the short term, but there's a rock-solid central bank consensus around transitory inflation,"" he said.
The dollar rose 0.1% against the yen to 109.62 yen, while sterling fell 0.3% to $1.4111.
The pound slid as Britain and the European Union failed to agree on solutions to post-Brexit trade problems in the British province of Northern Ireland, and exchanged threats in a standoff that could claim the G7 international summit.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Currency Volatility Index hit its lowest level since February 2020 on Tuesday, and slipped further on Wednesday.

While the ECB is expected to keep policy settings steady, the euro could be sensitive to changes in the bank's economic forecasts or any signal that the pace of bond buying could be reduced in months ahead.

Investors are also watching negotiations in Washington over potential infrastructure spending, which could have an effect on the pace of U.S. growth as well. On Wednesday, U.S. lawmakers said a bipartisan group of 10 senators was discussing whether it is possible to revitalize U.S. roads and bridges without raising taxes, after President Joe Biden on Tuesday rejected a separate Republican proposal.
Bitcoin recovered from a three-week low it hit on Tuesday when signs of institutional investor caution and regulatory attention drove selling. It was last up 8% at $36,114.

Investing.com -- The dollar clung to marginal gains in early European trade Wednesday, but volatility was limited with traders awaiting upcoming U.S. inflation data and an ECB meeting for clues about future central bank policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 90.093.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2178, USD/JPY was flat at 109.47, GBP/USD traded a touch higher at 1.4158, while AUD/USD was a little lower at 0.7739. 
The dollar has been on a downtrend for much of the last year, but investors are starting to get nervous that rampant inflation could force the Federal Reserve to taper back its ultra easy monetary policies earlier than previously guided. This would result in rising interest rates and a more buoyant greenback.
Earlier Wednesday, China’s factory-gate prices jumped in May to their highest level since 2008 driven by surging commodity prices, increasing 9.0% year-on-year in May, a considerable leap from the 6.8% growth during the previous month.
Consumer prices also increased for the third consecutive month, rising 1.3% year-on-year in May, up from 0.9% gains during the previous month, and the Chinese yuan rose as a result, with USD/CNY falling 0.1% to 6.3953.
This sets the scene for Thursday’s release of U.S. consumer price data, one of the last major pieces of economic data before the next Fed meeting on June 15-16.
“We see clear risks of a big positive surprise to the May inflation report as well with core inflation around or just above 4%. The market is still buying the transitory inflation narrative but for how long,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Thursday also sees the latest policy decision by the European Central Bank, with the central bank widely expected to keep in place its ultra-loose monetary policies given the region has yet to generate inflation at anything like the levels seen across the Atlantic.
That said, the euro is likely to be sensitive to changes in the bank's economic forecasts or any signal that the pace of bond buying could be reduced in months ahead.
More immediately, the Bank of Canada meets later Wednesday, with its latest policy decision due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).  
This central bank was the first from the advanced economies to point to an easing back of a very accommodative stance, when in April it accelerated the timetable for a possible interest-rate increase and pare back its bond purchases.
No major change is expected later Wednesday, but USD/CAD has dropped 0.1% to 1.2106 as the Canadian economy moves toward a full recovery.

Investing.com -- The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia with investors awaiting upcoming U.S. inflation data while digesting inflation data released by China earlier in the day.
They also await a European Central Bank (ECB) policy decision to further gauge the economic recovery from COVID-19 and central banks’ potential next steps.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 90.062 by 11:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 109.45. The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7738 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7197.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.3953. China’s consumer price index (CPI) for May, released earlier in the day, contracted 0.2% month-on-month and grew 1.3% year-on-year, both below forecasts. Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) grew by a better-than-expected 9% year-on-year.
Yuan bulls’ recent enthusiasm was also damped by the  passage of a bill in the U.S. Senate aimed at countering the economic as well as strategic challenge from China.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.4163. However, concern is growing that the rising case numbers of the COVID-19 Delta variant in the U.K. could mean a delay in the ending of lockdown measures. The measures are currently slated to end on Jun 21.
Investors continued to bet against the greenback but remained concerned about whether central banks would begin to withdraw their unprecedented stimulus measures. Also of interest is whether rising interest rates will end a 15-month dollar downtrend.
Some investors predicted that higher-than-forecast inflation in the U.S. could prompt central banks to begin tapering their asset purchases and give the dollar a boost. However, moves were small ahead of the U.S. data, including the CPI, and the ECB policy decision, both of which are due on Thursday.
""Markets need reassurance that the global economic recovery isn't under threat from either dangerous strains of COVID-19, or from the Fed being forced to change tack (on stimulus) much earlier than expected... so far, the vaccines appear to work and while distribution is uneven... it's still accelerating overall,"" Societe Generale currency strategist Kit Juckes told Reuters.
""That's cause for hope. For markets though, it means that risk assets need regular reassurance that the Fed isn't going to tighten sooner than expected. And so, we wait for Thursday's CPI data, then the following week's U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting,” he added.
The Bank of Canada will also hand down its policy decision later in the day.
However, other investors focused their attention on inflation.
""U.S. economists are expecting a 0.4% month-on-month rise in both the headline and the core inflation numbers, they're big numbers... I think the risk is they fall short of that,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joe Capurso told Reuters.
This could pull down U.S. yields and bring the dollar with them unless the figure spooked stock markets' enough to drive safe-haven flows into the dollar, he added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up slightly and currency market volatility on Tuesday hit the lowest level in more than a year, as investors sat on the sidelines waiting for clearer signals on inflation levels and central bank policies around the world.
With inflation updates expected from China, Europe and the United States this week and an impending European Central Bank meeting on Thursday to be followed by a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting next week, currency investors appeared to be treading water while the S&P 500 dipped very slightly. 
Range-bound currency markets meant a fall in volatility. The  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Currency Volatility Index hit its lowest level since February 2020.
""All the major currencies are having muted reaction right now as they wait,"" said JB Mackenzie, managing director of futures and forex at TD Ameritrade. ""We're looking at the inflation numbers to see how the economies are running. Are they very hot and, if so, does that mean there could be a reaction from central banks globally?""
Traders on Tuesday sent longer-term U.S. Treasury yields to their lowest in more than a month after a report showed small business owners less confident, and narrowing the spread of a closely watched part of the yield curve.
The dollar index was last up 0.12%, while the euro fell 0.09% against the greenback to $1.2179. 

The British pound fell 0.15% to $1.4155 and the Australian dollar eased 0.21% to $0.7739, with both stuck in ranges seen over the past couple of months.
Cryptocurrencies were more volatile on the day with Bitcoin last down 3% at $32,544 after hitting a session low of $31,025 - also its lowest level since May 19. Ether was down 7% at $2,464.47.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, but activity remains subdued ahead of this week’s key U.S. inflation release after Friday’s lackluster payrolls number.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 90.093, not far above 89.533, a 4 1/2-month low touched late last month.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2177, still above its three-week low of 1.2104 set on Friday, while USD/JPY gained 0.2% to 109.48, after Japan’s GDP contracted 1% quarter-on-quarter and 3.9% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2021. GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.4150 and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7745.
Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls release showed an increase of 559,000 jobs last month after a revised 278,000 gain in April, below the 650,000 gain expected. 
While this softer-than-expected release eased the immediate pressure on the Federal Reserve to rein in its ultra-easy monetary policies, there still remain concerns that the central bank will shortly start discussing tapering asset purchases given the high levels of inflation.
This view was reinforced by comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen over the weekend that higher interest rates, and higher inflation levels,  would be good for the economy.
With this in mind, investors are now looking to consumer price data on Thursday for fresh direction, one of the last major pieces of economic data ahead of the next Fed meeting on June 15-16.
“Remember, last month saw the dollar gently offered on a softer NFP, with the FX and Rates markets then looking through the spike in US CPI figures for April.  Will the same happen again this week? Will dollar bears survive what could be the peak headline CPI reading of the cycle, which could come in near 4.8-5.0% YoY,” asked analysts at ING, in a note.
Also on investors’ radar is Thursday’s policy decision by the European Central Bank, although the central bank is widely expected to keep in place its ultra-loose monetary policies.
Euro-area inflation is running at 2%, marginally above the ECB’s goal but a far cry from the levels seen across the Atlantic, and gross domestic product is seen growing 4.3%, only reaching its pre-crisis level next year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, but was subdued as investors continue to gauge inflationary pressures ahead of a policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.13% to 90.062 by 12:58 AM ET (4:58 AM GMT). The index was not far from 89.533, a four-and-a-half-month low touched in May.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.16% to 109.41. Japan’s GDP, released earlier in the day, contracted 1% quarter-on-quarter and 3.9% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2021.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7742. Data released earlier in the day in Australia said that the National Australia Bank (NAB) Business Confidence Index climbed to 20 in May while the NAB business survey also rose to 37. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.7215.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.3929 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 1.4158.
Investors are still digesting the U.S. employment report for May, released during the previous week. The report said that non-farm payrolls increased by 559,000 which was well short of the 650,000 number in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
""It's not that the payrolls numbers were weak. But because so much expectation had been built up in advance, the dollar suffered a bit of setback,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
The data saw U.S. bond yields stay near their recent lows that also weighed on the greenback.
Investors now await the consumer price index report, due later in the week, to gauge the Fed’s next move ahead of its policy decision to be handed down in the following week.
The Fed is now expected to unveil plans to start tapering assets later in 2021, with the actual process to start in early 2022.
The European Central Bank, whose policy decision will be handed down on Thursday, is also on investors’ radars.
In Latin America, the Mexican peso held firm at 19.832 against the dollar, near its highest level since late January 2020. The country’s midterm elections gave President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's MORENA party a reduced majority but confirmed MORENA’s spot as the strongest party in the country.
Elections had the opposite effect on the Peruvian sol, which fell to an all-time low of 3.9367 per dollar. Although socialist Pedro Castillo had a small lead over right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori as the votes from the country's presidential election are counted, the latter has yet to concede the election."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower on Monday as Treasury yields were moribund and investors looked ahead to European and U.S. central bank meetings. 
Friday's U.S. jobs data had put pressure on the dollar as investors bet that jobs growth was not strong enough to raise expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy.
That move continued on Monday, with Treasury yields remaining subdued after Friday's drop, reducing demand for the U.S. currency.
""Treasury yields edged slightly higher on the session, though remained well below levels seen before the employment report. This was the likely driver of USD weakness on Monday,"" said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics.
The dollar index was down 0.21% at 89.946 while the euro gained 0.23% to $1.2194. The dollar also fell 0.23% to 109.26 Japanese yen.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were last at 1.569%. They fell to 1.560%, from 1.628%, on Friday.
""At this point it looks like the market really wants to be short dollars. To us it suggests there's a risk chasing this move. It's a crowded position. You've already got a sizeable chunk of the market that's net short U.S. dollars so if feels like we need a shakeout of those positions,"" said Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
While Rai said there was ""some risk the dollar will rally"" he noted that investors are waiting for Federal Reserve's meeting next week. 
Market participants will also be looking at U.S. inflation data and the European Central Bank meeting, both on Thursday.
Dovish rhetoric from ECB policymakers suggests the bank is in no hurry to slow the pace of buying under the 1.85 trillion euro ($2.24 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).
Speculators decreased their net short dollar positions in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
Currency investors seemed to shrug off news that the United States, Britain and other rich nations reached a deal on Saturday to squeeze more money out of multinational companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and reduce their incentive to shift profits to low-tax offshore havens.
""It was expected they'd come to some kind of agreement,"" said CIBC's Rai, but he said investors were likely wary of making bets as ""The road is long and has lots of risks.""
The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy for risk appetite, was up 0.22% versus the U.S. dollar at 0.776.

Investing.com – The dollar has been battered, bruised and given little chance of escaping the clutches of bearish bets, but  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) believes the greenback’s fortunes are about to change as real yields could be on the up and up.  
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.21% to 89.94.
“We've seen some modest USD weakness recently and now believe the time has come to start scaling into long USD positions,” Morgan Stanley said in a recent note.
The firm isn't shy to admit that its somewhat controversial call on the dollar is not popular even among its own clients as “most investors remain bearish on the USD and are positioned accordingly.”
But real U.S. yields have remained shackled for far too long, and there isn’t much room left for further downside as the Federal Reserve is expected to taper bond purchases in early 2022 to curb inflation.
U.S. breakeven rates, market expectations for future inflation, point to inflation in the years ahead in the range of 2.4% to 2.6%. Investors will receive another update on inflation with consumer CPI slated for Thursday.
“It is difficult for real yields to head much lower, given where inflation breakevens are in the U.S. and the continued progress of the U.S. economy that we think will be keeping the Fed on track to taper asset purchases in early 2022,” Morgan Stanley added.
But others have suggested that even with raising rates, the greenback will struggle to advance as demand for the euro will continue to appreciate as the euro-area economy continues to recovery.
Yet, most of the upside in the euro from bets on a strong EU recovery appears to be priced into the single currency. The “euro failed to make any headway against the USD over the past two to three weeks despite the strong data and positive headlines from the region,” according to Morgan Stanley."

Investing.com -- The dollar traded marginally higher early in Europe Monday after the softer-than-expected payrolls release, with traders turning their attention towards this week’s inflation figures. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 90.180, remaining in a narrow range it has kept for several weeks.
EUR/USD traded less than 0.1% lower at 1.2163, but still above the three-week low of 1.2104 it had struck on Friday, while USD/JPY edged higher to 109.50. GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4140 and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was marginally lower at 0.7734.
Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls release showed an increase of 559,000 last month after a revised 278,000 gain in April, a touch below the 650,000 expected. 
While this still indicates a robust recovery in the U.S. labor market, the fact that the number missed expectations is likely to cool the pressure on the Federal Reserve to rein in its ultra-easy monetary policies, providing the central bank an excuse to defer the tapering debate a little longer.
Attention will now switch to the second component of the Fed’s dual mandate, with Thursday’s CPI release one of the last major pieces of economic data ahead of the next Fed meeting on June 15-16.
Expectations are running high that inflation will continue to press higher, with the May CPI number expected to climb to 4.7% on the year, a further leap higher from April’s 4.2% shock.
“The fate of EURUSD will depend a whole lot on how the Fed reacts to the summer of inflation as it could easily undermine the USD if the Fed allows USD real rates to plummet even further,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
The European Central Bank is also scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide whether to adjust the pace of its bond buying program, while also releasing its updated growth forecasts for 2021 and 2022.
“While the Governing Council remains divided, the majority is likely to support a decision to continue buying bonds at close to the current pace, as the recovery is not yet on a solid footing,” Nordea added.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4006, after the release of China’s May trade data. This showed Chinese imports growing at their fastest pace in a decade, boosted by the recent surge in commodity prices, but export growth was lower than expected in the same month.
Over the weekend, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that the trade relationship between the two largest economies in the world has “significant imbalance” and the Biden administration is committed to leveling it."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia. However, a softer-than-expected U.S. employment report for May put the greenback under gentle pressure as the week opens.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 90.185 by 10:54 PM ET (2:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 109.57.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7735 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.7023.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.4017. The yuan staged a comeback to again trade stronger than 6.4 per dollar and last bought 6.3880 offshore. Chinese trade data that is due later in the day could provide clues on the fundamental forces behind the yuan's recent rapid rise.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 1.4142.
Non-farm payrolls rose by 559,000 in May according to Friday’s U.S. employment report, below the 650,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but above April’s 278,000 reading.
May’s unemployment rate was at a better-than-expected 5.8%, and the data helped calm worries about an earlier-than-expected asset tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve for now.
""Friday's slightly softer-than-expected U.S. May employment numbers stand to set the tone for the weeks ahead... this provides the excuse for the (Fed) to say that substantial progress towards its goals has not been achieved and to defer the tapering debate a little longer,"" ING Bank analysts said in a note.
The worries had pushed a small increase in short bets against the dollar during the past week, even as Fed officials maintained that the economic recovery from COVID-19 still has a long way to go and that they expected to maintain their current dovish policy.
Investors’ focus is now on the consumer price index (CPI) figures due later in the week. The figures could influence the Fed’s next move as it further gauges current price pressures. A lower-than-expected figure could mean further declines for the U.S. currency.
Investors also await the European Central Bank (ECB)’s latest policy decision, due to be handed down on Thursday, with the Fed’s own June meeting scheduled for Jun. 15 to 16.
The focus will be squarely on whether the ECB will begin tapering its bond-buying program.
""Assuming dollar bears can pass through Super Thursday of U.S. CPI and the ECB policy decision unscathed, the dollar could stay gently offered into the major event risk of the month which is the FOMC decision,"" the ING note added.
""The ECB is in a bit of a catch-22... the outlook is gradually improving and the financial conditions are also still broadly conducive to the recovery,” Rabobank analysts said in their own note.
However, this is partly due to resolute dovishness from several members, setting the stage for debate inside the meeting that could deliver a small slowdown in the pace of bond buying, the note added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell on Friday after U.S. nonfarm payrolls data showed hiring increased in May as the pandemic eased, but not as much as expected, tempering expectations the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner, rather than later.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by a solid 559,000 jobs last month, helped by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates, but that was below the consensus forecast for 650,000 jobs added in May.
""This payroll number was a little disappointing,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. 
The softer-than-expected report means there is no urgency for the Fed to begin tapering its monthly purchase of $120 billion in bonds to support the economy, he said.
""Bad news about the economy is good news for an ultra-accommodative Fed, which is going to keep the dollar on the ropes,"" Moya said.
Despite May's gain, nonfarm payrolls remained 5%, or 7.6 million jobs, below their pre-crisis level, Jocelyn Paquet, an economist at the National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), said in a client note.
""There is, therefore, still a long way to go for the labor market,"" she said.
At 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), the dollar index was down 0.38% at 90.135, dropping from a three-week high earlier in the session.
Foreign exchange strategists in a Reuters poll were almost evenly split on the dollar's near-term direction following two months of broad weakness, as they await clearer signs from policymakers.
The euro was up 0.31% at $1.21650 versus the dollar.
The Australian dollar, which had dropped to its lowest since April on Thursday, jumped 1.08% to 0.77430, while the New Zealand dollar was up 0.97% at 0.72115.
""The dollar has some negative momentum here now going into next week, so I wouldn’t be surprised if some of this price action spills into Asia trading Sunday night,"" said Erik Bregar, director and head of FX strategy at the Exchange Bank of Canada.
The dollar had rallied on Thursday, notching up its biggest daily gain in a month, after weekly U.S. jobless claims fell below 400,000 for the first time since the pandemic started more than a year ago and private payrolls increased by significantly more than expected.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is likely to lean on incremental steps to slow the yuan's gains to deter speculators and help its exporters, shunning drastic measures that could undermine its goal to liberalise the currency and boost the yuan's global clout, policy sources said.
The yuan has gained almost 12% against the dollar since May 2020 as China leads other economies in its recovery from COVID-19 and the greenback weakens, though it has been driven more recently by foreign fund inflows into yuan-denominated bonds and stocks.
But it slipped more than 0.5% this week as Beijing has mounted a coordinated effort to talk down expectations of further gains. A flurry of official statements have warned against speculating on the currency and regulators have taken steps to stem its rise.[CNY/]
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has ample tools to cool one-way currency bets and fend off hot money inflows amid worries over asset bubbles, but will tread cautiously to avoid spooking investors, said the policy sources, who advise the government.
The PBOC, under reform-minded governor Yi Gang, has been trying to give market forces a greater role in steering the yuan, part of longer-term reforms to make it a more international currency, they said.
""The yuan's appreciation will test the PBOC's market-based approach, but policy tools at the PBOC's hands will be enough to cope with it,"" said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
In a statement responding to questions from Reuters, the PBOC said it will not ""use the exchange rate as a tool"", and reiterated its managed floating currency regime based on market supply and demand and with reference to a basket of currencies.
""The attitude of the PBOC on the exchange rate goal is consistent and clear, that is, no one can accurately predict the trend of the exchange rate, the uncertainty of the exchange rate is inevitable, and two-way fluctuations are normal,"" it said.
Policymakers fear rapid yuan gains could lure more speculative money into everything from property, to stocks and commodities, fuelling asset bubbles, with any sudden reversal of the inflows potentially harming the economy.
They also worry about the impact on Chinese exports, which remain strong for now but could lose steam in the second half of the year as factories in other countries recover from the pandemic.
""We cannot allow one-way yuan appreciation. Otherwise there will be a vicious cycle as more capital inflows drive appreciation, and more appreciation boosts inflows,"" Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the economic policy commission at the China Association of Policy Science, told Reuters this week.
""Eventually, this could lead to domestic inflation and asset bubbles and affect domestic monetary policy. Too much appreciation will be unfavorable for financial stability and unfavourable for exports.""
BULLISH BETS
The yuan is hovering near a three-year high against the dollar, and has recouped pretty much all its losses since the start of the Sino-U.S. trade war in early 2018. It is also near its strongest level versus a basket of trading partners since 2016.
Bullish bets on the yuan have hit a near six-month high, a Reuters poll showed this week, despite the spate of warnings from Chinese authorities.
The PBOC said in the statement that it has been fully communicating with the public on the currency issue and cautioned against any speculation.
To curb the yuan's rally, the PBOC this week directed financial institutions to hold more foreign exchange in reserve. China's foreign exchange regulator also granted fresh quotas of roughly $10 billion for outbound investment.
The PBOC is poised to take a measured approach, tightening conditions for some inflows, adjusting currency market liquidity and using its so-called window guidance to direct banks, the policy sources said.
The PBOC bank has repeatedly said it has ""exited"" from regular yuan intervention, but it continues to set a daily guidance midpoint and Chinese state banks were seen buying dollars last week.
Some policy insiders expect the yuan to rise further to 6.3 per dollar this year, from around 6.4 now, but caution that its outlook remains unclear as an expected policy shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve could spark capital outflows from China.
""The yuan could rise some more in the near term, but it could start to depreciate if the United States exits from its stimulus,"" said one of the sources.
While China's economy has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, expanding a record 18.3% in the first quarter, its recovery remains uneven. Rising raw material costs are weighing on production and stirring worries about inflation.

The government has taken steps to slow soaring commodity prices but with limited success, fuelling speculation it may have to use a firmer yuan to offset imported price rises.
But central bank officials have recently stressed that the yuan would be not used as a tool to spur exports via depreciation or offset the impact of surging global commodity prices via appreciation.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The developed world's most dovish central bank and companies keen to put cash to work overseas have combined to make Japan's yen one of the world's worst performers this year, and that weakness could linger a while.
Factors at home and abroad have conspired to drive a 6% slide in the yen against the U.S. dollar this year.
Unlike other major central banks that are starting to face inflation risks and contemplating a withdrawal of emergency pandemic stimulus, the Bank of Japan has not only been grappling with deflation but has been notably loath to publicly suggest any tapering.
Japan has also been slower than most countries in getting its population vaccinated for COVID-19 and returning to normalcy. Its economy is shrinking and the absence of foreign tourists could mean no real boost from the delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics this summer.
""I think the yen is going to be the one that really struggles as the global economy picks up,"" said Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY).
While a recovery could undermine the dollar, which traditionally moves counter to economic cycles, the yen has even stronger safe-haven credentials and is likely to underperform, he said, projecting the yen at 116 in a year's time compared with the current 110.
Indeed, as investors bet on economic recoveries in Europe and the United States, buoying global equities and bond yields as well as the dollar, the yen's status as a cheap and safe funding currency has been reinforced.
""The carry trade is very much in vogue right now, and that doesn’t bode well for yen,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager of  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank and Trust.
""I don’t know what the story would really be to strengthen the yen right now.""
In late March, as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields -- which the Japanese currency has a close, inverse relation to -- hit one-year highs above 1.77%, the yen hit a one-year low of 110.97 per dollar.
But even after U.S. yields retreated below 1.6% as the Federal Reserve pushed back against speculation for an early taper of its asset-purchase programme, the yen didn't budge much.
Some of that weakness can be explained by a sudden burst of overseas acquisitions by cash-rich Japanese companies.
Data from mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory firm Recof show there were 210 foreign acquisitions by Japanese companies during the first four months of 2021 worth 3.71 trillion yen ($33.64 billion), triple the total value a year earlier.
""Interest rates are one important factor influencing FX rates, but not the only factor,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Tokyo-based chief currency strategist Osamu Takashima. ""M&A-related flows are pushing the yen down against the dollar.""
HOW CHEAP?
The yen's divergence from U.S. yields, and its persistent weakness through April even as the dollar fell broadly, has market participants disagreeing on its outlook.
""The divergence in monetary policy can explain some degree of yen weakness, but not this level,"" said Tohru Sasaki, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s Tokyo-based head of Japan market research. Sasaki says the one-time nature of the M&A outflows combined with the yen's dislocation from fundamentals should argue for a recovery to 105 or 106 levels.
On a trade-weighted basis, the nominal yen index has lost 6.2% so far this year to a level last seen in 2018. A large part of that is on account of a surge in the Chinese yuan, which comprises a third of the basket, more than the U.S. and European currencies combined.
""The yen looks both stuck and cheap,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s global head of FX strategy, Kit Juckes, said in a research note, adding it was ""waiting only for some better news on Covid and economic reopening to spread its wings.""
Meanwhile, hedge funds and other speculators have been piling on bets against the yen. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows a steep climb to the biggest net short yen position in almost two years in late April.
For others, such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s head of Japan FX and rates strategy, Shusuke Yamada, the possibility that the Fed signals some form of monetary tightening and the continued rise in equities imply more yen weakness. Yamada reckons the yen could go as far as 115 per dollar, and end the year at 113.

""BOJ will be the laggard, and probably the biggest laggard, so I think that’s in investors' minds,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar climbed in early European trade Friday, reaching multi-week highs after a spate of strong economic data ahead of the monthly payrolls release raised the possibility of early Federal Reserve tightening.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.605, reaching a new three-week high.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2113, also a three-week low, while USD/JPY edged lower to 110.26. GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4095, sharply below the three-year high of 1.4250 reached Tuesday, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7653, after falling to its lowest since mid-April overnight.
The dollar has been under pressure for much of 2021 as traders have reacted to ultra-easy Fed policies, and the suggestions that these would stay in place for some time. However, this narrative is starting to change as the U.S. economic rebound gains in strength, throwing up the possibility of it driving policy tightening.
Thursday saw the release of some strong economic numbers - ADP private payrolls increased by 978,000 in May, way above forecasts of 650,000; weekly initial jobless claims fell below 400,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic; and the Institute for Supply Management’s services index rose to 64 last month, the highest on record, from 62.7 in April.
Even with these numbers detailing the obvious improvement in the U.S. economy, New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) still said Thursday that now is not the time for the central bank to adjust its bond-buying program, although he added that it makes sense for the policy makers to be talking through options for the future.
The next focus of the market will come later in the day when U.S. nonfarm payrolls data is published at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
“The U.S. jobs report will provide an essential temperature check, not only on the health of the U.S. economy but also on supply-led inflationary pressures,” said analysts at investment management firm Brooks Macdonald. 
The expectation, according to Investing.com, is for about 650,000 jobs to have been added in May, although that number may well have started climbing after Thursday’s releases. 
That said, traders are wary of getting too confident about a strong number after April’s figure, which came in at 266,000 versus 978,000 expected.
“Of course, while the focus will be on May’s numbers, Friday’s data release also gives the opportunity to revise that April figure,” Brooks Macdonald added.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 8.7102, with the lira weakening once more after Thursday’s surprise drop in inflation likely increased the pressure on Governor Sahap Kavcioglu to bow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s vocal desire for lower interest rates. 
Consumer prices increased an annual 16.6% in May, down from 17.1% the previous month, and below the expected acceleration to 17.3%.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, posting its biggest gains in around a month. Investors continue to focus on the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19 following positive U.S. employment data released on Thursday, as well as the possibility of a tapering of stimulus policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 90.575 by 1:08 AM ET (5:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 110.27 after data released earlier in the day said household spending increased 0.1% month-on-month and 13% year-on-year in April.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7657. Home loans in Australia increased 4.3% month-on-month, compared to 3.3% growth during the previous session, according to data released earlier in the day. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7149.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.6049.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 1.4091 as investors await the U.K.’s Construction Purchasing Managers Index in May, due later in the day.
U.S. initial jobless claims fell to 385,000 in the previous week, according to data released on Thursday. The number of claims recorded a fifth consecutive week of falls to a record low since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Investors now await May’s non-farm payrolls data, due later in the day. Forecasts by Investing.com expected growth of 650,000 jobs in May.
""Clearly traders are covering dollar shorts into the jobs data,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone, told Reuters.
""Between 250,000 to 500,000 jobs and we'll potentially see the dollar/yen pair fall 0.6% to 0.8%,"" Weston said. ""A number in line will not give us much to work with, so the moves in the market will be dictated by the broad quality of factors, revisions to the April print of 266,000, the unemployment rate, hourly earnings,” he added.
Positioning data shows investors are heavily short dollars, with the market hypersensitive to any indication of a change in direction for the greenback or interest rate hikes. That could lead to a bumpy ride for the options market.
Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 currency strategy at Natwest, told Reuters that a payrolls print around 550,000 as the ""goldilocks"" number, ""strong enough to keep the recovery going but not strong enough to pull tapering fears forward."" That could weaken the dollar broadly, offsetting Thursday's gains, he added."
271,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 12:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank will extend its phase of faster bond-buying through the summer to ensure the economic rebound after coronavirus lockdowns morphs into a sustained recovery, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The majority expects the ECB to keep purchasing about 20 billion euros ($24.4 billion) worth of debt a week until September before slowing down. Most expect the 1.85 trillion-euro pandemic program to finish in March 2022, as currently planned.
The central bank accelerated purchases in March to keep financing conditions for companies, households and governments across the euro area favorable. Ahead of their June 10 meeting, policy makers have pushed back against the idea that they’ll pull back on buying as governments ease curbs on public life.
With growing price pressures around the globe, investors are closely watching for signs that central banks are ready to moderate the flood of liquidity they unleashed during the pandemic. Inflation in the euro area accelerated to 2% last month, technically above the ECB’s goal, though most economists and officials have said it’s a temporary phenomenon that will fade before long.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“This seems to be no time for the hawks to bicker about more bond buying. Bloomberg Economics expects policy makers to opt for another three months of ‘significantly higher’ purchases through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program.”
--David Powell, Maeva Cousin. Read the full report here.
President Christine Lagarde “will stress that the negative effects of the pandemic on the economy and hence inflation are still significant,” said Joerg Angele, an economist at Bantleon Bank. “However, regarding communication, this ECB meeting will be one of the most tricky ones in the past quarters.”
One complicating factor is that bond purchases are typically lower in the summer when market liquidity thins - a trend that could send the wrong signal to investors. Another is that the economic outlook is looking brighter, making it difficult to avoid a debate about a policy shift for much longer.
“The ECB can use the fact that we are heading into the quieter summer months to justify a slightly slower pace,” said Bas van Geffen, an economist at Rabobank. “That said, it may still be a bit of a hard sell to the market, requiring e.g. dovish rhetoric on medium-term inflation, even though the short-term economic outlook is improving.”
Europe’s vaccination campaign has picked up significantly after early stumbles, allowing governments to gradually ease restrictions on restaurants, travel and other activities. Recent economic indicators have signaled that the economy is starting to turn the page on the pandemic.
Three-quarters of economists surveyed expect the new forecasts presented at the meeting to show faster growth this year. The vast majority also said inflation projections for 2021 and 2022 will be revised upward.
“Fortunately for the ECB, the meeting comes early enough to still point to doubts and risks to the economic outlook, hence justifying a stance of ‘it’s too early to withdraw any kind of stimulus,’” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING. “This stance will be very hard to maintain after the summer.”
Nearly half of the respondents expects the ECB won’t use up the full amount of the pandemic program. At the same time, one third expect an older purchase program that’s currently running at 20 billion euros a month to be expanded to provide continued support.
Another focus of the meeting is the ECB’s review of its strategy. Economists in the survey expect the results to be unveiled in September. Nearly eight out of ten said the central bank’s revised approach will include a “symmetric” inflation target, meaning policy makers will react equally to too-low and too-high results.
A majority also said policy makers will settle on a 2% inflation target -- as opposed to the current “below, but close to, 2%” -- and a closer focus on climate change.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's real will likely stay buoyant in the coming weeks but the currency's medium-term prospects are still obscured by investor worries about the pace of reforms as lawmakers focus instead on the fight against COVID-19, a Reuters poll showed.
Amid a health crisis that has cost the lives of more than 465,000 Brazilians, the real has appreciated 15.6% from near-record low levels in March, benefiting from an economic recovery and steep interest rate hikes.
However, the currency remains liable to concerns over the ability or will of politicians to tackle long-standing inefficiencies as pandemic relief and social spending become the center of debate before the 2022 presidential vote.
Brazil's lower house speaker said last week Congress was not in a position to rush through tax reforms, as that has been so long in the making that it was worth taking a few months more to get it right.
Despite improvements in Brazil's trade and investment flows, ""we see the lack of progress on structural (especially fiscal) reforms as a barrier to a more significant and lasting strengthening of the BRL,"" Santander (MC:SAN) analysts wrote in a report.
""Further reductions in the level of uncertainty regarding the Brazilian fiscal outlook would hinge on structural reforms that we believe will be increasingly hard to move in Congress, especially in a more polarized political environment.""
In an unusual result, the real is forecast to weaken rather than strengthen in one year, according to the median estimate of 20 respondents polled May 28-June 3, losing 2.7% to 5.22 per U.S. dollar from its value on Wednesday.
Reaffirming the currency's softer outlook, Itau analysts said ""for 2022, the global scenario of stimulus withdrawal, higher interest rates, and a stronger dollar tends to put pressure on the BRL and other emerging market currencies.""
Mexico's peso was expected to keep doing well compared to its Latin American neighbors. The currency would end 2021 at around 20.0 per dollar, logging its fourth year in the same range without counting last year's big drop.

""In light of the global uncertainty and given the Mexican agenda, with the mid-term elections likely to add more short-term volatility in the coming days, we suggest buying dollars in dips for trading purposes,"" Banorte analysts wrote in a report.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Emerging market strategists were cautiously optimistic that the sector's commodity-linked currency rally would continue in coming months, but a much slower pace of vaccine rollouts will keep high-yield seekers nervous, a Reuters poll found on Friday.
One-third of 45 strategists in the May 28-June 3 Reuters poll said the rally in commodity-related emerging market currencies would continue for six months while 14 said it would last up to a year.
A delicate split emerged among strategists predicting mild long or short EMFX positions in the next six months, with a slight bias to mild strength against the dollar - a sign of cautious optimism.

High-yielding currencies like South Africa's rand and the Mexican peso have ended four of the last six quarters on a stronger foot, boosted by commodity price rallies and as COVID-19 restrictions dented global trade.
The emerging markets currency index, heavily weighted towards China given the size of its economy, has more than reversed 2020 losses after economies gradually reopened.
However, low-yielders like the Thai baht are expected to buoy emerging currency markets, with the baht firming 1.3% to 30.81/$. The rouble is also expected to help EM currencies overall to keep gains, seen up 1.5% to 70/$ in 12 months.
Analysts said they prefer export-oriented Asia EM currencies like the baht, the Chinese yuan, the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars on long positional plays due to firmer bets on sustainable economic growth outlooks.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC)'s David Hauner wrote that he expects a further EMFX rally into the (northern hemisphere) summer on improving growth and still not over-crowded positioning.
""However, we will keep a keen eye on sentiment and positioning indicators to reduce exposure when significant froth appears as it did at the turn of 2020 to 2021,"" added Hauner.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts note some tactical caution in EM currencies was warranted at current levels if some of the favourable tailwinds reverse, with the U.S. 10-year (yield) rates at local lows but equity and commodity markets at local highs.
""Macro valuation metrics are still supportive of EMFX over the medium term, reflationary rate hikes are re-building the carry in EM currencies and a successful EM vaccine rollouts could be key both to a cyclical re-opening across EMs, as well as further strength in EM currencies,"" Goldman Sachs analysts added.
Still, vaccine rollouts in emerging market countries have been much slower than in developed nations where health authorities are much closer to reaching inoculation targets and allowing the further opening of economies to trade.
South Africa, which only reached its first million inoculations this week, is second from the bottom of 29 countries tracked by Fathom Consulting on Refinitiv Datastream and is 39 million jabs shy of its 60% target.
Starkly, the rand's year-to-date 8% gains leads an EM list of 20 currencies tracked by Reuters - despite much slower vaccine rollouts - followed by the Chinese yuan at around 2%. China administered 20.4 million doses on June 1 alone.
The high-yielding rand rallied to 13.50/$ on Thursday, trading at its firmest since early February 2019.

However, the poll median for the rand is for a correction of around 5% to 14.35/$ in 12 months while the median suggests the yuan will gain over half a percent to 6.35/$ in 12 months.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has a carefully managed floating exchange rate regime and in a warning to speculators this week the PBOC raised its reserve requirements for forex deposits at Chinese banks to rein in a yuan that touched a three-year high against the dollar.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar outlook is uncertain, with foreign exchange strategists in a Reuters poll almost evenly split on the greenback's near-term direction following two months of broad weakness, as they await clearer signs from policymakers.
After a strong start to the year - rising about 4% in the first quarter - the U.S. currency has lost most of those gains since the end of March, tracking the decline in Treasury yields. It was trading near a five-month trough against a basket of major currencies on Thursday.
The Federal Reserve views the recent pick-up in inflation as transitory and reiterated its accommodative policy pledge. But pent-up demand as the economy reopens from COVID-19 shutdowns has driven expectations for robust economic growth and higher price pressures.
While currency speculators increased bets against the dollar to the highest since late February - driven by the Fed's dovish stance - 33 of 63 analysts answering an additional question in the May 28-June 3 poll said the greenback's weakening trend was broadly over.
""I'm really hazy on what's going to happen for the next three months, because we could have a Fed that finally has to capitulate and deliver a firmer tapering of asset purchases message - spooking markets to a certain degree,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.
""We could get some volatility in markets, which tends to be a dollar support. I think the market view on the Fed is very, very complacent.""
The remaining 30 analysts said the weakening trend would continue, with views for the dollar to fall anywhere between 0.5% and 6.0% in the next three months.
While the consensus showed the greenback would be range-bound, staying within 1% of current levels in the next three months, a long-held weaker dollar view persisted for the 12-month outlook with most major currencies expected to outperform.
Those expectations echo findings of a Reuters poll of equity strategists, which showed most major stock market indexes would rise modestly this year but continue their ascent beyond mid-2022. The greenback tends to go in the opposite direction of risk assets.
It was also reflected in expectations for currencies, considered as safe bets in the latest poll.

The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc - which have lost 6% and 2%, respectively, so far in 2021 - were not expected to recoup those losses in a year.
Despite a strong U.S. vaccination drive and economic recovery, other developed economies are closing that gap, taking some of the sheen off dollar-denominated assets.
The euro, which has clawed back nearly all of this year's 4% losses against the dollar in the past two months, was forecast to trade around its current level of $1.22 in six months and gain about 2% in a year to $1.24.
But the margin of that expected gain was unchanged from last month, underscoring the fading effects of the so called 'catch-up' trade and the limited upside for the single currency.
""As we go into the summer season, we are clearly going to have this inflationary debate. It's still going on, but it may swing a little bit towards the Fed beginning to talk about tapering. We are more likely to see $1.18 rather than $1.25,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""This massive market consensus view about how the second half of the year is going to be a real catch-up trade for the euro worries me. I think the long euro position might just fall short,"" she added, suggesting euro hawks could be disappointed by the European Central Bank.

Still, commodity-linked currencies were predicted to outperform the dollar over the coming year.
""This ongoing commodity demand still has some legs, and the value of commodity currencies both in EM and G10 don't fully reflect the improvement in market conditions,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a three-week high on Thursday, bolstered by stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data that suggested an improving labor market and reinforced signs that the world's largest economy was on its way to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The greenback, which was already on solid footing ahead of reports on jobless claims and private payrolls, climbed to three-week peaks against the euro and two-month highs versus the yen.
U.S. private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs in May, the ADP National Employment Report showed, the biggest increase since June 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 650,000 jobs. 
At the same time, U.S. initial jobless claims dropped below 400,000 last week for the first time since the pandemic started more than a year ago.
""You have to give the U.S. dollar merit because the economy behind it seems to be coming out of the pandemic mode and now indicators are giving us signs of clear momentum,"" said Juan Perez, FX strategist and trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.
Traders also awaited U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for May, due on Friday, which could set the tone at the Federal Reserve meeting this month. The Wall Street economists' consensus forecast for U.S. non-farm payrolls was for 650,000 new U.S. jobs last month. 
""The state of the U.S. labor market remains more uncertain and volatile than usual as it emerges from the unprecedented disruption of the COVID pandemic,"" Matt Weller, global head of market research at FOREX.com and City Index, said in a research note. 
""The month-to-month fluctuations in this report are notoriously difficult to predict, so we wouldn't put too much stock into any forecasts,"" Weller added.
In afternoon trading, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.7% to 90.5040. It hit a three-week high of 90.554 and found strong support around the 89.946 mark in recent sessions after falling 2% in April and a further 1.6% in May.
The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.7% against the dollar to $1.2123 after earlier sliding to three-week low of $1.2118.
Against the yen, the dollar gained 0.6% to 110.245 yen. Earlier, the greenback advanced to two-month highs of 110.315 yen.
The Fed is also starting to unwind some of its asset purchases, which some analysts said is a likely precursor to the central bank eventually tapering its quantitative easing. 
On Thursday, the New York Fed said it would start to gradually sell its portfolio of exchange-traded funds that invest in corporate bonds on June 7, the first step in unwinding corporate bond holdings acquired during the pandemic.

In other currency news, Russia announced it would completely remove U.S. dollar assets from its National Wealth Fund (NWF), while increasing the share of the euro, Chinese yuan and gold, according to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov on Thursday. The changes are expected within a month.
The move did not have any immediate impact on currencies.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedging costs for foreign exchange swings across the world's 10 most-traded currencies have dropped in recent weeks, causing market watchers to warn of investor complacency and to encourage the buying of protection against future volatility.
Implied volatility - which measures the cost of buying options to protect against FX moves - across the 'G10' group of currencies has fallen on aggregate in recent weeks, implying that traders expect currencies to be calm in the months ahead.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s currency volatility index, which shows an average of 3-month implied volatility for the major currency pairs has fallen to its lowest since July 2020.
Meanwhile, JP Morgan's G7 currency volatility index has hit lows not seen since March 2020, when a selloff in global markets drove a dash for dollars. 
(Graphic: Sleepy FX markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlndjnvb/Pasted%20image%201622714178500.png) 
The drop in these gauges reflects a broader phenomenon across financial markets - the suppression of volatility by central banks that have eased monetary policy to unprecedented levels to cushion against the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic.
However, as vaccine rollouts allow economies to reopen and inflation expectations rise, some central banks, including the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, have begun to taper asset purchase programmes. Others such as the U.S. Federal Reserve have hinted there will be an end to such easy money, even if not yet. 
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaelyxva/Pasted%20image%201622715442522.png - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaelyxva/Pasted%20image%201622715442522.png) 
Typically, shifts in central bank policy spark increased volatility in currencies as investors price in diverging monetary policies between countries.
""Should we see some surprises in the evolution of interest rates, these are likely to also affect exchange rates - especially if the rate movements are asynchronous between jurisdictions,"" Kambiz Kazemi, CIO at Validus Risk Management, said.
Some investors advise capitalising on the current low cost of options - which they call an indicator of market complacency - as an opportunity to buy protection against future swings.
""It is concerning because when we see aggregate G10 vols below 6%, it's typically been seen as a good level to get long volatility,"" said Peter Kinsella, head of FX strategy at Swiss private bank UBP, citing the 1-month tenor on the J.P. Morgan G7 volatility index. 
""To my mind it does show that markets are somewhat complacent.""
Another indicator of low volatility is tight currency trading ranges. The spread between the annual high and low of the euro/dollar pair so far in 2021 is just above 6 cents, and - five months into the year - the narrowest of any year in the single currency's history. 

(Graphic- 2021: narrowest trading range in the euro's history - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmzkjepr/Pasted%20image%201622713925456.png) 
""In our view, the dichotomy between this multi-decade 'calm' currency price action and the fundamentals (rates, inflation expectations, commodity and equity price action) is likely to result in more volatility and changing prices in the medium to long-term,"" Kazemi said.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia as investors digested China’s Caixin services data, while awaiting key U.S. economic data for clues on the economic outlook and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.14% to 90.023 by 1:50 AM ET (5:50 AM GMT).
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12% to 6.3882. Investors continue to monitor shifts in Chinese policymakers' stance on the currency after the People’s Bank of China tightened its Banks’ forex requirements earlier this week to curb the yuan’s surge.
Data released earlier in the day said May’s Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 55.1, indicating a slower growth rate in the services sector in China.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.21% to 109.78 as services PMI fell to 46.5 in May in Japan, according to data released earlier in the day.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.7732 after data released earlier in the day said Australia’s retail sales increased 1.1% month-on-month in April. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair fell 0.28% to 0.7216.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.4152 as investors await the U.K.’s services PMI data in May, due later in the day.
Investors are betting on a falling dollar driven by the world’s ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19. However, they remained concerned that the Fed could change its current dovish monetary policy due to a strong economic rebound.
""The major pairs (are) still stuck within ranges,"" analysts at Singapore's OCBC Bank in a note. However, they added that yield differentials seem to be moving in the dollar's favor and that policymakers' tone is subtly changing.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard’s noting of risks to both sides of the central bank’s goals gave ""another signal that the Fed is slowly moving away from its excessively dovish stance... (we) retain the view that Fed expectations should be gradually built in from here, barring any key data misses this week,"" the note said. 
Remarks from Brainard earlier in the week noted risks to both sides of the Fed's goals offered ""another signal that the Fed is slowly moving away from its excessively dovish stance,"" the note added.
The Fed said on Wednesday that it plans to start gradually sell a portfolio of corporate debt purchased through an emergency lending facility that it launched in 2020, indicating the beginning of policy change.
Investors now await key U.S. economic data including initial jobless claims, due later in the day, for clues on the economic outlook. Further data include non-farm payrolls, released on Friday, which posted weaker-than-expected monthly hiring in April.
""Given last month's disappointing report, the risk is the results deliver another downside surprise and bears down on the dollar,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Carol Kong told Reuters.
Across the Atlantic, investors will focus on the European Central Bank meeting, scheduled for the following week, for clues on whether policymakers will pare back their bond-buying program."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, remaining near five-month lows, ahead of key economic data which could influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy thinking.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.025, recovering from the week’s low of 89.662, a level not seen since early January.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2196, while USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 109.77. GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4153, easing off a three-year high of 1.4250 reached Tuesday, and the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7733.
The dollar has remained broadly offered for most of 2021 as traders have reacted to ultra-easy Federal Reserve policies, and the suggestions that these would stay in place for some time, as the world recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, some traders have started to become nervous as a surprisingly strong U.S. economic rebound and growing inflation concerns pose a threat to this key assumption that interest rates stay low for a prolonged period.
The Fed’s Beige Book, released Wednesday, indicated that the pace of the U.S. recovery picked up somewhat in the past two months, sparking price pressures as businesses contended with worker scarcity and rising costs. This follows consumer prices in April accelerating at its fastest pace in more than 12 years.
Fed officials have usually been at pains to say that these inflationary pressures will be temporary in nature, but there have been some recent comments of a more hawkish nature.
On Wednesday, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that the central bank should begin discussing the time frame for paring back its bond-buying program, for example.
That said, a lot depends on the labor market, particularly after the weak April jobs report. 
U.S. private payrolls figures due later on Thursday, as well as the weekly initial claims data, are the latest numbers to offer clues on the state of the economy and a possible read on broader nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3893, with the yuan weakening as China’s services sector grew at a slower pace in May due to decreasing overseas demand and rising input costs for businesses.
Data released earlier in the day saw the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index in May falling to 55.1, below April’s 56.3 but still above the 50-mark indicating growth. 
USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 8.5976, with the lira starting to weaken once more despite the verbal efforts of central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu to prop the Turkish currency up.
Kavcioglu told investors in a conference call on Wednesday that fears of a premature interest rate cut are unjust. 
This followed the lira sinking to an all-time low against the dollar in early trading Wednesday after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had reiterated his call for lower interest rates.

(Reuters) - Bullish bets on the Chinese yuan hit a near six-month high after a rally against the U.S. dollar, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, while investors were long on most Asian currencies as nations ramped up their COVID-19 vaccination plans.
After turning bearish on several units last month, market participants were now long on Singapore dollar, the Taiwanese dollar and the South Korean won, according to a fortnightly poll of 12 respondents.
There was no respite for Malaysia's ringgit, however, as bearish views edged up, with the nation in the midst of a two-week lockdown that could weigh on its 2021 economic growth forecast.
Malaysia is seeing a surge in coronavirus infections, with the recent number of new daily cases higher than that of India on a per capita basis.
The yuan hit a three-year high against the dollar in May and enjoyed its best month in nine, prompting China's central bank to raise the FX reserve requirement ratio (FRR) for banks and warn against speculative bets on the currency.
Analysts at Mizuho bank said in a note that moderating the build-up of, and demand for, foreign currency deposits will act as a stabilizer for the yuan.
""The tighter FRR acts as a counter-cyclical stablizer for CNY, dampening appreciation pressures as well as pre-empting vulnerability to sudden outflows,"" they said.
Long bets on currencies of South Korea and Singapore were at their highest since Jan. 28 and May 6, respectively, as the countries race to inoculate their citizens against COVID-19.
The Indian rupee, Asia's best performing currency in May, saw bullish positions firm to their highest since Feb 25.
""Broadly, we expect the USD/INR uptrend to be maintained this year,"" said Radhika Rao, an economist at Singapore bank DBS.
Investors also remained short on the Thai baht. Thailand has seen the death toll from the virus rise ten-fold over two months. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar was nearly flat on Wednesday in choppy trading, after backing off of an almost five-month trough versus major peers, as traders waited for employment data later in the week to paint a clearer picture of the state of the U.S. economic recovery.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.001% at 89.907 at 2:34 p.m. ET, after trading in a range of 89.856 and 90.247.
""We're basically treading water, I think, until nonfarm payrolls,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management referring to the jobs report for May due on Friday.
The previous jobs report, for April, came in much weaker than expected, sending the dollar sharply lower. Then earlier this week, manufacturing data showed that while activity spiked due to pent-up demand amid the reopening from COVID-19 shutdowns, labor shortages actually hampered the sector's growth potential.
""It's basically showing that a huge amount of the recovery trade is baked into the cake at this point and the whole recovery curve may be a lot slower than people anticipate,"" Schlossberg said of the data.
Another weak nonfarm payroll report would put pressure on Treasury yields, which in turn would weigh on the greenback, he said.
The euro edged 0.01% lower against the dollar to $1.2215 after pulling back from near a multimonth top overnight, when it touched $1.22545.
Producer prices in the euro zone rose more than expected in April, boosted by a surge in energy costs, data showed. But the European Central Bank, which wants to keep consumer price growth close to 2% over the medium term, said that while inflation may temporarily rise above its target this year, anemic wage growth will likely keep it in check for years to come.
Sterling rose 0.15% to $1.4167, after easing off a three-year high of $1.4250 reached on Tuesday. 
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar fell 0.22% to C$1.2065 per greenback after rallying to a fresh six-year peak of C$1.2077 overnight as oil prices rose.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars dipped 0.01% and 0.24% respectively against the greenback. The Aussie was last at $0.77525, while the Kiwi was at $0.7234 against the U.S. dollar.
Investors were also eyeing the trajectory of China's recently bullish yuan. It eased 0.07% to 6.38 per dollar in offshore trading, after retreating from a three-year high of 6.3526 on Monday as policymakers took steps to cool its advance, including raising banks' FX reserve requirements.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 3.52%, at $37,983.25, while ether was up 7.37% at $2767.65 
The price of dogecoin surged 25.31% to 0.402919, according to Coindesk, following cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s announcement that it would allow trading of the meme-based digital currency on its professional platform. Dogecoin topped 72 cents on May 7 ahead of an appearance by Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and one of dogecoin's biggest boosters, on the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch comedy show.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s demand for interest-rate cuts sent a brief shockwave through the lira, with the currency hitting a new all-time low.
But among traders and analysts, the reaction was: we’ve all seen this before. After Erdogan fired his previous central bank governor in March, it was only a matter of time before he started bearing down on a path to lower rates.
“The Turkish story is well known and has been ongoing for a while now, so I get the sense that investors would not have been caught off-guard,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “There is little risk of heavy foreign fund outflows.”
In an interview with a state broadcaster late Tuesday, Erdogan said it’s “imperative” that the central bank lower interest rates, giving a vague reference to summer months as a target date.
The lira weakened as much as 3% after the move, and then stabilized, trading 1% lower at 8.63 per U.S. dollar on Wednesday. The currency has already been battered by bets that Turkey would ease policy, plunging 14% against the dollar this year, the biggest drop among emerging-market currencies.
Data from the options market also showed signs of calm. The dollar-lira’s one-month implied volatility held near the lowest level since February. Stock moves were muted as well, with the BIST 100 Index sliding just 0.3%.
The reaction was subdued because it was so well expected, said Henrik Gullberg, a London-based macro strategist at Coex Partners. “This is what markets have been waiting for,” he added.
Investors interpreted Erdogan’s decision in March to dismiss his market-friendly central bank governor as evidence of his determination to take control of monetary policy and carry out his unorthodox plan of lowering rates in the face of sky-high inflation.
However, the weak lira and faster inflation make the job even harder for Turkey’s new central bank chief, Governor Sahap Kavcioglu. It would take an extreme depreciation in the currency, likely around a 30% decline based on historical trends, for Erdogan to change his mind over rate cuts, Gullberg predicted.
“We have seen this move several times before,” said Emre Akcakmak, a portfolio adviser at East Capital in Dubai. “Investors do not want to see yet another episode of a premature rate cut, especially now when inflation is stubbornly high.”

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, climbing from a near five-month low, as traders digest the latest strong U.S. manufacturing data with regard to a potential prompt normalization of Federal Reserve monetary policy. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 89.935, after dipping as low as 89.662 on Tuesday, approaching the lowest since Jan. 7 at 89.533.
EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.2216, not far from a near five-month high of 1.2266 touched last week, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 109.67, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.4153, after easing off a three-year high of 1.4250 reached Tuesday, and USD/CAD was largely flat at 1.2067 after falling to a fresh six-year low of 1.2007 overnight.
On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of U.S. manufacturing activity rose in May as pent-up demand amid a reopening economy boosted orders. The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.2 last month from 60.7 in April, above the 60.9 forecast.
A strong reading on the whole, adding to the general impression that the U.S. economy is rebounding strongly, which could push the Federal Reserve to normalize monetary policy more quickly than current guidance would suggest.
Especially with the ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers hovering near levels last seen in July 2008, when the economy was in the throes of the Great Recession. 
“We suspect that for every inflation number the Fed will get slightly more worried about the transitory call,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “We still believe that tapering will happen later in 2021 and that the dot plot will see more dots for rate hikes in 2022.”
However, the ISM’s measure of factory employment dropped to a six-month low, something that could well hold the Fed’s hand ahead of Friday’s official jobs report for May, particularly after April's much-weaker-than-expected reading.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7748, after Australia’s economy expanded faster than forecast in the first three months of the year, as gross domestic product advanced 1.8% from the final quarter of 2020.
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3829, climbing from the three-year low of 6.3526 reached on Monday as policy makers took steps to cool its advance including raising banks' FX reserve requirements.
USD/TRY rose 1.1% to 8.6208, with the Turkish lira falling to fresh record lows after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed calls for lower interest rates, continuing to expound his unorthodox belief that lower borrowing costs will help slow inflation.
This will increase the pressure on central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu, who was recently installed after Erdogan dismissed the previous governor for tightening policy too much.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia as it edged back from near a five-month low. Investors continued to bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will change its stimulus measures sooner than expected after positive economic data was released on Tuesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.11% to 89.920 by 1:28 AM ET (5:28 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.25% to 109.72.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.09% to 0.7747 after Australia released a better-than-expected Gross Domestic Product earlier in the day. The GDP rose 1.8% quarter-on-quarter and 1.1% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2021. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7248.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.3832. Investors continue to monitor the recent bullish yuan after the People’s Bank of China tightened banks’ forex reserve requirements to curb the yuan’s appreciation. The restrictions caused the offshore yuan to retreat from its three-year high of 6.3526 hit on Monday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.4148, with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey due to speak later in the day.
""The direction of the dollar is definitely the focus,"" Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo, told Reuters, adding that “the market is split in its view.”
Some U.S. Federal Reserve officials insisted that the price pressure will be temporary, while some investors remained concerned that potential runaway inflation will eventually force the central bank to change its current dovish monetary policy earlier than expected.
""Even if inflation continues to overshoot, I think the Fed will continue to say it’s temporary, but the market won't know for sure until fall, so we’re kind of stuck in this uncertainty,"" said Kadota.
In the U.S., data released on Tuesday said the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose 61.2 in May, driven by a boosted demand amid a reopening of businesses. It’s better than the 60.9 figure in forecasts prepared by investing.com and April’s 60.7 reading. However, the data also indicated supply shortages and labor constraints.
Investors now await further U.S. data, including non-farm payrolls, due on Friday for clues on the economic outlook. Its much-weaker-than-expected reading in April led the dollar to slump 0.7% on May 7."

Investing.com – The dollar continued to trade in a narrow range Tuesday, as Federal Reserve officials continued to downplay inflation fears, suggesting accommodative monetary policy will continue as the economy remains far from its goals. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.15% to 89.86.
""While the level of inflation in my near-term outlook has moved somewhat higher, my expectation for the contour of inflation moving back towards its underlying trend in the period beyond the reopening remains broadly unchanged,” said Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard.
Data on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, rose 3.1% in the 12 months through April.
The move had a subdued effect on bond yields, which remain steady, adding to downside pressure in the dollar.
But the rapid pace of inflation is not something the Fed can afford to ignore for long, and the central bank will likely be forced to ramp up its inflation forecasts when it rolls out its updated projections at the June meeting later this month.
""[T]he magnitude of the increase has set inflation to run on a higher year-over-year path for the balance of the year … the FOMC will once again need to revise upward its 2021 forecast for core PCE at its June meeting,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Fed officials have already signaled that the Federal Reserve is preparing to begin discussion on trimming its bond purchases amid signs a stronger-than-expected recovery.
The May ISM Manufacturing Index rose to 61.2 from 60.7 in April, boosted by rising commodity costs and higher prices. That was above economists' forecast for a reading of 61.0.
Still, the Federal Reserve appears in no rush to rein in its current policy measures as unemployment remains above pre-pandemic levels.
“Today employment remains far from our goal,” Brainard added. “Jobs are down by over 8 million relative to their pre-pandemic level, and the shortfall is over 10 million jobs if we take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the past year.”
The jobs numbers for May due Friday will give traders another window into the strength of the labor market following a weak report for April.
""At present, consensus shows a rise of 653,000 payrolls in May, following a 266,000 gain the month prior, with the unemployment rate expected to decline from 6.1% to 5.9%, and average hourly earnings expected to increase 0.2% in May and 1.6% over the past 12 months,"" Stifel said in note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Tuesday against a basket of peer currencies after U.S. manufacturing data showed a stronger-than-expected pickup in activity, even as labor shortages and a lack of raw materials weighed on production. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of U.S. manufacturing activity rose in May as pent-up demand amid a reopening economy boosted orders.
The dollar initially traded lower on the report, in which ISM said manufacturing's growth potential continued to be hampered by worker absenteeism and temporary shutdowns because of shortages of parts and labor.
The report suggests that supply issues in the manufacturing sector are having an impact on the economy as a whole, said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management.
""It’s also telling us that the momentum that we saw in the beginning of the second quarter could be beginning to slow.""
The dollar index crept up 0.35% to 89.822, but was well off Friday's high of 90.447, when a measure of U.S. inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve posted its biggest annual rise since 1992.
The market bias is generally toward a softer dollar, said Vassili Serebriakov, FX and macro strategist at UBS.
""The global recovery outside of the U.S. that was lagging in the first quarter because of the slow pace of vaccinations has now picked up, particularly in places like the euro zone and the UK,"" he said of recent dollar weakness. 
Hawkish signals from the central banks of some G10 countries, including Canada, Norway and New Zealand, have also added pressure to the greenback, he said.
Britain's pound touched a three-year high of $1.425 during the Asian session, helped by remarks from a Bank of England policymaker last week pointing to a rate hike next year or sooner.
The euro ticked up 0.05% to $1.2305, following data that showed euro zone inflation surged past the European Central Bank's target in May.
""The next quarter's worth of inflation data is completely riddled with base effects and other temporary factors, so it’s very hard for markets and policymakers to strip out the signal from that noise,"" said Simon Harvey, FX analyst at Monex Europe.
Commodity-linked currencies were generally stronger versus the dollar as oil prices rose on expectations for growing fuel demand. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies - known collectively as OPEC+ - agreed on Tuesday to stick to the existing pace of gradually easing oil supply curbs, as producers balanced anticipation of a recovery in demand against a possible increase in Iranian supply.
The Canadian dollar reached a six-year high of 1.2010 per greenback, helped by the strength in oil, and data that showed Canada's economic growth in the first quarter remained robust.
The Australian dollar was up 0.45% at 0.77625.
Australia's central bank left its cash rate at record lows and reiterated its lower-for-longer policy stance, even as data showed the country's output was above its pre-pandemic level.
China's yuan was steady after authorities ordered banks to increase their foreign exchange reserve ratio, a move seen as an attempt to limit the fast appreciation of the yuan.
The offshore yuan was at 6.3817, up 0.11% on the day.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Tuesday, slipping to multi-month lows against many of its peers, as traders look to the release of closely-watched nonfarm payrolls data later in the week for clues surrounding the Federal Reserve’s policy thinking.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 89.820, falling back below 90 from as high as 90.447 on Friday, when the Fed’s favorite measure of U.S. inflation posted a sharper rise than expected.
EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.2224, not far from a near five-month high of 1.2266 touched last week, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 109.50, after climbing as high as 110.20 on Friday. 
The greenback received some support Friday when core consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, a measure closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 3.1% from a year earlier. This was above expectations of a rise of 2.9% year-on-year in April, way above the Fed’s nominal target of 2%.
However, this help was minor, despite the hot inflation reading, as government bond yields were mostly lower heading into the Memorial Day weekend.
Fed officials have repeatedly stated that they expect price pressures to be transitory and monetary stimulus to stay in place for some time, especially as the labor market, while improving, remains far below the levels of employment seen before the start of the pandemic.
Vice Chair Randal Quarles and Governor Lael Brainard will both be speaking at separate events later Tuesday, but it’s the nonfarm payrolls numbers on Friday which will attract the most attention this week, especially after the much-weaker-than-expected reading a month ago.
“Our team expects a slightly lower than consensus increase at +500k (consensus around 650k) as labor supply fails to keep pace with increasing demand,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “These kinds of lower-than-consensus numbers could be the story for the next two to four months and could continue to take the sting out of the Fed tapering debate.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.4232, after earlier rising as high as 1.4247, breaching a February peak to reach the strongest since April 2018, continuing to benefit from the U.K.’s advanced pace of vaccination which suggests a quick move towards normalisation, and potentially policy tightening.
USD/CAD fell 0.1% to 1.2050, near a six-year low, as the market also begins to expect the Bank of Canada to be one of the first western central bank’s to be tightening its monetary policies. 
AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7743, with this risk-sensitive currency gaining even as the Reserve Bank of Australia kept the cash rate and three-year yield target at 0.10% earlier Tuesday, as expected. 
The central bank said it will make a decision in July on whether to extend the yield target and undertake further quantitative easing, with a weeklong shutdown in the nation’s second-largest city, Melbourne, adding a layer of uncertainty to the outlook.
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.3731, with the Chinese yuan retreating from Monday’s three-year high of 6.3526, after banks in China were forced by the People's Bank of China to hold more foreign currencies in reserve for the first time in more than a decade in order to stem the surge in the Chinese currency.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia after China tightened its banks’ forex requirements to curb the appreciation of the yuan. Investors also await key U.S. economic data to gauge the country’s economic outlook.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.21% to 89.808 by 1:26 AM ET (5:26 AM GMT).
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.3717. Banks in China were forced by the People's Bank of China to hold more foreign currencies in reserve for the first time in more than a decade in order to stem the yuan’s surge.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 109.51.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7742 as the Reserve Bank of Australia handed down a policy decision that kept its interest rates unchanged at 0.10% earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7274.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.4236.
Investors are still digesting the previous week's Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price index that grew 3.1% year-on-year in April, above the Fed’s 2% target and the largest annual gain since 1992.
Trimmed measures of inflation, eliminating the most extreme price changes, indicated that inflation would not be an issue in the U.S.  This in turn means that investors will need to unwind some of their expectations for near-term policy tightening that will weigh on the greenback, said Joseph Capurso, a strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY).
Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles and Fed Governor Lael Brainard are due to speak later in the day.
On the data front, investors now await U.S. data, including non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate in May, due to be released on Friday.
The U.S. shows no inflation problem without considering trimmed measures of inflation, and investors don’t need to be concerned about an earlier-than-expected policy tightening, which will weigh on the dollar, Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Joseph Capurso told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the global economic recovery from Covid-19 will provide an additional headwind, according to Capurso.
""The world economy is clearly recovering, and that is going to be bad for the U.S. dollar because it’s a counter-cyclical currency…The U.S. dollar has been pretty heavy in the last few weeks, and I think it keeps trending lower,"" he told Reuters."
288,"<span>May 31, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The pound rallied to a three-year high as traders bet the U.K.’s economic recovery will gain traction with the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
Sterling gained as much as 0.3% to $1.4248, breaching a February peak to reach the strongest since April 2018. Three-fourths of the U.K. population will be covered with a two-dose vaccine in one month should the current pace of inoculations continue, according to data collected by Bloomberg News and Johns Hopkins University.

“The pound is favored because the progress of vaccination puts the U.K. closer to an economic normalization than other countries,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, chief manager for foreign-exchange margin trading at Ueda Harlow Ltd. in Tokyo. “Sterling could climb toward $1.45.”
Cable’s ascent reflects the U.K.’s relative success in containing the pandemic, with the authorities planning to fully reopen the economy on June 21. While the discovery of a highly transmissible variant of the virus originating from India poses a risk, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there is no conclusive reason to delay the easing of the lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar came under pressure on Monday and was heading for its second consecutive monthly loss against the euro and the pound, as traders assessed the impact of a surge in U.S. inflation before monthly jobs data later this week.
With London and New York markets closed for a holiday, the dollar index of major currencies fell 0.1% to 90.044 at 1350 GMT 
On Friday, data showing a key measure of U.S. inflation at a 29-year high briefly boosted the dollar to a two-week high. 
The euro was flat at $1.2195, off Friday's low of $1.2133. The British pound edged 0.1% lower at $1.4173.
In holiday-thinned trade, investors weighed the impact on U.S. assets of rising price pressures and a dovish Fed. Despite rising inflation, markets don't expect a rate hike well into the back end of 2022. 
The core PCE price index vaulted 3.1% on Friday, the largest annual gain since July 1992, due to a recovery from the pandemic and various supply disruptions. 
The market considers current inflation levels in the U.S. to be transitional. Next year's U.S. inflation will remain at 2.5%, Ulrich Leuchtmann, Commerzbank’s head of FX and commodity research wrote in a note. 
""That does not make it any easier pricing USD,"" he said. ""Until we have more clarity the dollar is likely to have found a good balance at current levels"".
Speculators increased their bets against the dollar last week with U.S. dollar short positions hitting a 2-1/2 month high.

The Chinese yuan hit a three-year high against the dollar before falling back following a chorus of warnings from Chinese officials against speculative bets on the currency.
The offshore yuan changed hands at 6.3698 per dollar after touching overnight its highest since May 2018 of 6.3553 per dollar.

In volatile cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was 2.6% higher at $36,604. Ether rose 5.8% to $2,528.
The main event of the week will be U.S. payrolls on Friday with median forecasts at 650,000 but the outcome is uncertain following April's shockingly weak 266,000 gain.

Investing.com – The dollar inched down, but traded near a two-month high against the yen, on Monday morning in Asia. Investors digested mixed economic data from China and strong inflation data from the U.S., while also expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to start tapering its asset purchases eventually.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 89.987 by 13:15 AM ET (5:!5 AM GMT).
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.3612. The offshore yuan decreased after Sheng Songcheng, former director of People’s Bank of China statistics department, said on Sunday the Chinese currency's rise will not persist.
The central bank separately added that the currency may depreciate in the future on the same day.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 109.66. Japanese data released earlier in the day said the Industrial Production for April increased by 2.5% month-on-month, surpassing March’s 1.7% but below 4.1% in forecasts prepared by investing.com. The data also said that Retail Sales also increased 12.0% year-on-year, but below 15.3% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, in April.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7728, with the Reserve Bank of Australia due to hand down its policy decision on Tuesday. The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7260.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.4196.
Both the U.S. and the U.K. markets are closed amid holidays on Monday.
Data released earlier in the day said that China’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 51.0 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 55 in May, both remaining above the 50-mark indicating growth. However, the manufacturing PMI was slightly below 51.1 in forecasts by Investing.com and April’s reading.
In the U.S., data released on Friday said the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index increased 3.1% year-on-year in April, above the 2.9% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and 1.9% during the previous session.
The index was also above the Fed’s 2% target and posted its largest annual gain since 1992 due to the country’s recovery from COVID-19 and various supply disruptions.
""If we see inflation consistently hitting above 2%, that could put upward pressure on wages. There's risk inflation trending higher than expected,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, told Reuters.
However, investors widely expect that the Fed will keep its current dovish monetary policy for a few more months, possibly until the end of 2021.
The 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 1.581%, a second month of declines following a surge earlier in 2021 due to inflation concerns.
Meanwhile, key Fed officials, including Fed vice chairman Richard Clarida, have recently said that the Fed may start tapering talks should inflation build up further.
Investors now await further U.S. economic data, including Nonfarm Payrolls and the Unemployment Rate, due on Friday, to gauge the economic recovery."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gave up gains from early on Friday as traders tidied positions ahead of month-end and a holiday weekend after seeing new economic data confirm expectations about U.S. inflation and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The dollar index of major currencies rose as much as 0.4% during the day in a sharp rebound from 4-1/2 month lows plumbed on Tuesday before it fell back to flat for the day and the week at 89.99.
Ending with little change was a break from the down trend since March that had taken 3% from the dollar's value as other major economies began to catch up with vaccination rates in the United States. At the same time, central banks in some other countries had appeared likely to move more quickly than the U.S. Federal Reserve to back away from easy money policies and let interest rates rise.
The euro was up a bare 0.05% at $1.22 on Friday afternoon, compared with a four-month high of $1.2266 earlier in the week.
The British pound was flat at $1.4199, continuing its recent struggle to stay above $1.42..
On Monday, the United States and Britain have public holidays.
The U.S. economic data had been seen as the big scheduled news of the week, but it did not move bond and stock markets much when it was released in the morning.
The data showed that consumer prices increased in April far beyond the Federal Reserve's 2% annual rate target.
The inflation readings had been widely anticipated and were not expected to have an impact on policy from the Fed, which has viewed recent price increases as adjustments for the reopening of the economy.
The next big event for the markets is the Fed's monetary policy meeting on June 15 and 16, which could provide clues to when U.S. interest rates will increase.
Fed officials could show projections for stronger economic growth. That would point toward the central bank tapering its purchases of bonds and allowing longer-term interest rates to rise, which would support the dollar, said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com.
""The Fed is trying to prepare the markets for the inevitability of tapering,"" Trevisani said.
The major currency that would most likely lose against the dollar is the Japanese yen, Trevisani said, citing trouble with Japan's recovery from the pandemic compared with Europe and Britain. 
The dollar gained against the yen early on Friday and hit a seven-week high before easing to show little change on the day. The dollar last traded around 109.77 yen after reaching as high as 110.2.
Japan has seen a rise in unemployment, falling consumer prices and government moves to extend emergency restrictions in Tokyo and other areas because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
China's onshore yuan appreciated to as few as 6.358 per dollar, a new three-year high. The dollar was last trading at 6.3616 yuan, down 0.15% for the day.
Kenneth Broux, FX strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said the fact that the yuan has been stronger than 6.40 for three days could be a turning point in Chinese policy that would be positive for the global economy.
""Nobody thought that the central bank would allow the yuan to strengthen beyond 6.40, and they have,"" Broux added.

The New Zealand dollar, which this week had jumped on the prospect of an interest rate hike by September 2022, fell as much as 1% against the greenback early in the day..
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down about 6% at $36,174 in the morning in New York, while ether was down 8% at around $2,510.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, helped by rising U.S. bond yields ahead of the release of key inflation data.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 90.120.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2180, slipping after reaching a 5 1/2-month high of 1.2266 on Tuesday, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.92, climbing to its highest levels in about seven weeks, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7731.
Helping the greenback was a report by the New York Times that President Joe Biden will announce later Friday a $6 trillion budget for 2022 to ensure investments in major infrastructure, education and healthcare projects. If this manages to get through a divided Congress, it would take federal spending to its highest levels since World War II. 
Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasurys climbed to around 1.62%, from around 1.58%, on debt supply risks to fund the spending, providing support for the dollar.
The budget proposal came as the U.S. economic recovery appears to gain momentum. On Thursday, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a post-pandemic low of 406,000, ahead of next week’s widely-watched monthly June payrolls data.
Later Friday comes the release of the Federal Reserve’s key gauge of inflation, core personal consumption expenditures, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with a high reading likely to fuel further expectations of policy tightening.
Economists expect core PCE to have jumped 2.9% year-on-year in April, way above the Fed’s nominal target of 2%, compared with a year-on-year rise of 1.8% a month earlier.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4190, retreating slightly after earlier climbing above 1.42 and hitting a three-month high. Fuelling the pound’s gains were comments by a Bank of England policy maker, who hinted at an earlier than expected rate hike by the U.K. central bank.
Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee, said late Thursday that the central bank was likely to raise rates well into next year, and an increase could come earlier if the economy rebounds more quickly than expected.
“It would probably take until the first quarter of next year to have a clear view of the post-furlough unemployment and wage dynamics, so a rise in Bank Rate could be appropriate soon after, along a slightly steeper path than in my central case,” Vlieghe said.
USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3688, falling to a three-year high overnight and raising expectations that it could hit levels last seen before its shock devaluation in 2015.
“Any signs of independent Renminbi strength could lend weight to the notion that the PBOC wants a stronger currency to insulate against imported commodity price rises. This would be bearish for the dollar,” said analysts at ING, in a note.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data. The British pound was down, but a near three-month high, as expectations that the Bank of England could hike its interest rate earlier than planned grow.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.12% to 90.065 by 1:21 AM ET (5:21 AM GMT).
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.4194.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 109.88. The dollar broke out of its tight range against the yen over the past few weeks to reach its highest levels in about seven weeks. The jump likely reflected yen selling due to MSCI's reshuffle of its standard stock index, from which nearly 30 Japanese names were dropped, according to some investors.
The yen was also hampered by investors' concerns about a delay in Japan's economic recovery as Japan seeks to extend a state of emergency covering Tokyo and other key areas by three weeks to Jun. 20.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7744 while the NZD/USD pair was down 0.27% to 0.7271.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.22% to 6.3686. The offshore Chinese yuan hit a three-year high of 6.3679 as investors expect that the People’s Bank of China will welcome a stronger currency during its continuous economic recovery from COVID-19.
Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said the central bank could possibly hike interest rates well into 2022, adding that the move could come faster than expected if the economic recovery is quicker than expected.
The pound also traded at 85.83 pence against the euro, near a five-week high of 85.615 pence. Meanwhile, the euro reached $1.2192, remaining below its five- and-half-a-month high on Tuesday as European Central Bank officials made dovish comments ahead of a policy meeting on Jun. 10.
The dollar jumped as U.S. President Joe Biden will reportedly propose a $6 trillion budget for 2022 on Friday as the country continues its economic recovery from COVID-19.
Also giving the greenback a boost was Thursday’s positive employment data. The number of initial jobless claims filed for the past week in the U.S. dropped to 406,000, a 14-month low.
""The initial claims figure we just saw was pretty good, so obviously expectations are building up for a strong reading on the monthly payrolls data due next week,"" Daiwa Securities senior currency strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Investors await the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index for April, due later in the day, amid concerns that a higher-than-expected figure could force the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy.
Although the reading is expected to be higher than Fed’s 2% target, core inflation is expected to gradually slow later in 2021, allowing the Fed to keep its current dovish monetary policy unchanged for now.
On the cryptocurrency front, bitcoin traded at $38,094, remaining relatively stable during the past 24 hours. Ether traded at $2,732."
294,"<span>May 27, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China signaled the yuan’s recent appreciation, which has taken it to a three-year high against the dollar, is too rapid with a weaker-than-expected reference rate.
The People’s Bank of China set the fixing at 6.3858 per dollar, compared with the average estimate of 6.3837 in a Bloomberg survey of traders and analysts. This follows a statement on Thursday where the central bank had warned against one-way bets and predictions.
With China’s economy rebounding from the pandemic and foreign funds piling into its equity and bond markets, the yuan this week surged past crucial levels that have held for the past three years. It has risen this year against all but six of the 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, and is Asia’s best performer.
“An orderly appreciation in the yuan is acceptable to China’s authorities, but one-way speculation will continue not to be allowed by the PBOC as before,” Gao Qi, a currency strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore, said before the fixing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar index traded in a narrow range on Thursday as the greenback held steady against the euro, lost ground to the British pound and Canadian dollar and gained on the Japanese yen.
The diverging performances in the currencies came with changes in economic outlooks for their home countries and evolving views on when, and by how much, different central banks will pull back on easy money policies to control inflation in their recoveries from the COVID-19 pandemic.
In late afternoon in New York, the dollar had gained 0.6% on the yen, and lost 0.5% to the Canadian dollar. Sterling picked up 0.5% to $1.42 and the euro was up less than 0.1% at $1.22.
The dollar index was down 0.1% for the day, holding on to most of a 0.4% gain on Wednesday.
The moves came as new U.S. economic data on Thursday showed a greater-than-expected decline in new unemployment claims and an acceleration in business spending on equipment.
Also supporting the dollar, U.S. Treasury yields rose on concerns about the coming supply of government debt after the New York Times reported that President Joe Biden will announce on Friday a $6 trillion budget for 2022. 
The yield on the 10-year note was up to 1.605 in from 1.574 on Wednesday.
The yen, trading at 109.785 to the dollar, has lost 1% in two days since the Japanese government slashed its economic outlook for the first time in three months.
The British pound rose suddenly when a Bank of England policymaker said the central bank is likely to raise interest rates well into next year but that an increase could come earlier.
""The market is reacting to a hawkish headline and that's why we saw sterling gallop,"" said Erik Bregar, head of FX strategy at Exchange Bank of Canada.
Sterling's strength helped to lift the Canadian dollar against the greenback, Bregar added. Higher oil prices helped the loonie, too.
The Bank of Canada has been quicker than other central banks to pull back support for economic growth. 
China's yuan appreciated to as much as 6.368 per dollar in offshore markets, a three-year high. Investors have been raising their bets on further strength, confident that the People's Bank of China is not displaying discomfort with the rally.
Market attention now turns to U.S. inflation data due on Friday. A jump in prices could be seen as prompting the Fed to scale back its easy money policies.

Economists expect the data to show that core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) prices jumped 2.9% year-on-year in April, compared with a year-on-year rise of 1.8% a month earlier.
Cryptocurrency bitcoin was down 1% at $38,808, and ether had lost nearly 5%.  
 
"
296,"<span>May 27, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Wondering where the dollar’s headed as the U.S. deficit keeps growing? Wall Street’s also trying to figure it out.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc sees echoes of one of the weakest periods in the greenback’s recent history. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley thinks it could actually strengthen.
A swelling U.S. current-account deficit is once again a hot debate in the currency market, with implications across asset classes. The gap is the widest since 2008 as a percentage of the economy, and it’s only growing as the U.S. outpaces much of the world in rebounding from the pandemic. The upshot is that more and more dollars are flowing into foreign hands, to either roll back into U.S. assets or be diverted elsewhere.
Experts agree on that much. Where they diverge is on the potential repercussions of the current account, the broadest gauge of trade and investment flows in the largest economy on the planet. Forecasters expect the advance goods-trade deficit, which is due Friday, to set a new record. It’s a crucial time for the world’s primary reserve currency, which has given up all of the gains it posted earlier this year.
For Goldman, the deficit is key to its bearish dollar view, as the firm’s analysts point to similarities to 2002-2007, when the dollar endured a major slump. Count Deutsche Bank in that camp, too.
On the flip side,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Eurizon SLJ Capital believe the current environment may mirror the 1980s and 1990s, when the dollar strengthened in the face of large deficits. For now, however, the U.S. currency is weakening and the bears appear to have the upper hand.
“The dollar is expensive on a broad trade-weighted basis, and non-U.S. assets are increasingly offering competitive returns,” said Zach Pandl, Goldman’s co-head of global foreign-exchange and emerging-market strategy. “Investors are likely to rotate out of long-standing U.S. fixed-income and equity markets, resulting in dollar depreciation over time.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is down 1.3% this month and is trading near the lowest levels this year. Indeed, the greenback has weakened against half of its Group-of-10 currency peers.
Pandl holds a “structurally negative” view on the dollar over the next three years. Goldman expects the current-account deficit to peak at 4.4% of gross domestic product in late 2021. That’s more than the median estimate of forecasters, who believe it will climb to 3.6% of GDP this year, up from 3.09% at the end of last year and the largest since 2008.
If Goldman’s view on the greenback is right, it would suggest that it’s only a matter of time before foreign investors seek higher-yielding international assets, which would sap the dollar’s strength and potentially usher in a longer-term structural decline that many are predicting. For emerging markets, it could also mean stronger economic growth from the U.S. currency’s inverse correlation with commodities, the boost to local equity prices and the potential deflation of dollar-denominated debt.
Foreign Money
In the U.S. fixed-income market, yields on 10-year Treasuries are around 1.58%, which is higher than most developed markets but significantly less than the 3% investors garner for Chinese and Mexican bond equivalents. And while the U.S. stock market continues to hit record highs, Goldman is forecasting lower equity returns versus non-U.S. markets over the next year -- and it expects that the shortfall will also divert flows away from the dollar.
That, however, is not a consensus view. Eurizon SLJ’s Stephen Jen, for example, thinks U.S. economic growth will drive demand for the greenback more than talk of a surging deficit and low-yield environment will hinder it. Bank of America agrees, saying deficits may weigh on the dollar in three to five years, but not now when the economy is beating global peers.
The key to that is the recovery from the pandemic. The U.S. leads major economies in inoculating its population, paving the way for businesses to reopen. Economists forecast that U.S. gross domestic product will grow 6.5% this year compared with a 5.1% average for developed economies.
“A strong U.S. economy ought to attract sufficient global capital to easily finance its large external deficit and in turn support the dollar,” Jen said. “Higher economic growth will mean more profits for U.S. companies and higher inflation, both of which suggest a stronger dollar.”
Those in Jen’s camp argue that when U.S. assets are attractive to the world, the dollar has the capacity to strengthen even as the current-account deficit widens. That’s because foreign investors need dollars to invest in American titans such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). -- all of which are listed on U.S. stock exchanges.
This isn’t unprecedented. In the 1990s, the U.S. currency advanced amid a surging deficit as the boom in technology startups drew in just about everyone. And during the 1980s, high nominal interest rates lured foreign investors as former Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker raised the target rate to as high as 20%, helping to buoy the greenback as the current-account deficit surged.
To be sure, contrarians point out that the dollar weakened when the U.S. current-account deficit widened in the mid-2000s. But Morgan Stanley says its historical analysis shows that it’s unclear whether such a relationship holds over time. In a corresponding study of 28 currencies, the relationship between exchange rates and deficits was mixed, strategist Matthew Hornbach and colleagues wrote in a report.
“Because most U.S. trade is invoiced in USD, rising imports shouldn’t generate USD weakness,” they wrote. “Rather, it will be the capital account driving the U.S. dollar, i.e., how will foreign investors respond to the inflow of dollars.”
The latest data tracking the U.S. net international investment position shows that the measure is currently the most negative on record. This indicates investments by foreigners in the U.S. are outpacing those made by Americans in overseas assets by the most yet.
Dollar Outlook
That said, the dollar bears over at Deutsche Bank think there’s a key reason for special concern about the external deficit.
“Its counterpoint is a large fiscal deficit,” which could prove persistent, especially in light of the challenges of containing it in the U.S. political system, Alan Ruskin and colleagues wrote.
Those concerns factor into the bank’s prediction that the euro will climb to 1.30 against the dollar by year-end, up from 1.22 Wednesday, and end at that level in 2022. Meanwhile, leveraged investors remain bearish on the currency after flipping to a net-long position in early May. They’ve been bearish for 10 of the last 16 months.
“A country cannot have a high current-account deficit forever,” said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G-10 FX strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). “To reduce it, you need a weaker currency to reduce imports and increase exports. At some point, this will happen.”

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials recently have amped up the tone and tempo around their exploration of a digital version of the U.S. dollar, a high-stakes undertaking for the central bank backing the world's reserve currency.
Last week Fed Chair Jerome Powell issued a rare public video to announce plans for a discussion paper on digital payments this summer, which will include the pros and cons associated with any U.S. central bank digital currency, or CBDC. 
He was followed on Monday by Governor Lael Brainard, who leads the Fed's efforts on financial stability and payment systems, laying out what risks may arise if the fast-developing digital payment space gets too fragmented. Brainard emphasized it was ""vital for the United States to be at the table in the development of cross-border standards"" given that some foreign central banks, like China's, have already started rolling out digital currencies of their own. 
Here's a look at where the Fed's efforts stand: 
FIRST, WHAT IS A CBDC?
Central bank digital currencies differ from cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are decentralized and can fluctuate wildly in value. A CBDC would give whomever holds it - be it a business, a person or a government - a direct claim on that central bank, the same as physical cash.
WHAT ARE SOME POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF A U.S. CBDC? 
As Brainard put it: ""A guiding principle for any payments innovation is that it should improve upon the existing payments system.""
To that end, a CBDC might expand access to the banking system for people who are currently locked out by high fees or other barriers. It could also be a more efficient way to distribute government payments, such as those sent to households during the pandemic and possibly more routine disbursements such as monthly Social Security checks.
And, as new forms of private money like ""stablecoins"" proliferate, a Fed-sponsored CBDC could stand as a safe alternative for consumers and businesses because the private issuers may not always be able to honor their liabilities whereas the Fed always can, Brainard said.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS?
The dollar is the world's reserve currency, giving the U.S. government privileged status as a borrower on global markets. It accounted for nearly 60% of official global foreign exchange reserves at the end of 2020, according to International Monetary Fund data. China's yuan, by contrast, accounts for just 2.25%.
Any misstep in developing and deploying a U.S. CBDC that undercuts that status could harm the country's financial standing. With more than $21 trillion in federal debt, that is a top consideration for the Fed.
The dollar is also the dominant currency for cross-border transactions, and economies around the globe could be disrupted if a digital dollar were to become unstable.
Inaction also has risks. 
As private money platforms gain popularity, Brainard warned, the payments system could become too fragmented - as it did in the 19th century when individual banks produced their own paper scrip - and introduce unwanted volatility and inefficiency.
""A predominance of private monies may introduce consumer protection and financial stability risks because of their potential volatility and the risk of run-like behavior,"" she said. 
WHERE DO THE FED'S EFFORTS STAND?
In addition to the paper Powell announced, the Fed is doing its own research and is working with international groups such as the Bank for International Settlements. 
The Boston Fed is also working on a multi-year research project with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology examining the technology that could be used for a CBDC. They expect to release the first phase of their findings, including a paper and some open source code, as early as July. 
CAN THE FED CREATE A DIGITAL DOLLAR ON ITS OWN?
No. Powell made it clear that congressional action would be required before a digital currency could be developed. Some lawmakers, including Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, have expressed interest in a digital dollar as a way to improve financial inclusion. But Congress appears a long way from acting, and no official decision has been made yet on whether there will be a digital dollar. 
ARE OTHER COUNTRIES DOING THIS?
The United States is among 75 countries researching or developing CBDCs, according to research from the Atlantic Council https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/the-rise-of-central-bank-digital-currencies. China is racing ahead and is currently piloting a digital version of the yuan, with plans to increase usage ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The Bahamas became the first central bank to officially launch a CBDC in October of 2020.
Powell says the Fed will not be rushed. ""It is far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast,"" he said last month.
COULD IT CHANGE THE BANKING SYSTEM?
That is possible, but uncertain.
Today most people and businesses deposit their cash at a commercial bank. In theory, a CBDC could mean they no longer need a bank to store their money, and some research suggests there may be a risk that many choose to pull their money out of banks, especially those seen as weak.

At the same time, Brainard said some research indicates a CBDC could lower banking costs and lead to an increase in overall deposits. 
A U.S. CBDC, she said, would need to be designed with ""safeguards"" in place to prevent the disintermediation of banks. That is especially important because of the vital role banks play in the Fed's conduct of monetary policy.

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, finding support from comments suggesting the Federal Reserve will soon have to discuss tapering its massive bond-buying program, thus tightening monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 90.065, after climbing above 90 overnight for the first time since the start of the week.
EUR/USD traded flat at 1.2191, GBP/USD fell slightly to 1.4116, near a one-week low, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7739.
Numerous Fed officials have this week sought to downplay immediate concerns that rising inflationary pressures will force the central bank to tighten monetary policy sooner than its previous guidance would suggest, to the detriment of the dollar.
However, the U.S. currency received some support late Wednesday when Randal Quarles, the Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision, stated that the central bank will need to start discussing shortly plans to reduce its bond purchases if the economy continues to show massive improvement as it emerges from the pandemic.
“If my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out,” Quarles said Wednesday, “it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.” 
Although discussing changes could still be a far way from actually implementing them, this does represent a shift in tone by a senior Fed official.
U.S. yields rose slightly overnight, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield up at 1.58%, providing support from the dollar.
There are a number of important economic data releases due later Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, first-quarter GDP and durable goods, but the focus will turn to Friday’s release of the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.
Economists expect core PCE prices to jump 2.9% year-on-year in April, compared with a year-on-year rise of 1.8% a month earlier.

Governor Lee Ju-yeol said South Korea’s central bank is preparing for an “orderly exit” from its record-low interest rate at some point as the economy recovers and financial risks mount.
Speaking after the Bank of Korea boosted its growth outlook for this year to 4% and its inflation projection to 1.8%, Lee said the central bank shouldn’t miss the timing on normalizing policy. The board still unanimously agreed to hold the key rate at 0.5% on Thursday as pandemic uncertainties linger, Lee said.
“We have eased our monetary policy to an unprecedented level, and it’s natural that we should adjust these measures as appropriate if the economic situation improves,” Lee said. “The problem is, while the economy is recovering, there are sill underlying uncertainties, so we shouldn’t be hurting the momentum.”
Lee’s step toward signaling a withdrawal of pandemic-era stimulus aligns the bank with peers in New Zealand and Canada. Still, with the coronavirus still raging across the world and most central banks pledging growth support, Lee sought to reassure investors there won’t be a premature shift in policy.
Exports and investment have led Korea’s expansion this year, lifting confidence and prompting a flurry of outlook upgrades from analysts. Economists may be bringing forward their expectations on the BOK’s likely tightening in light of the outlook upgrade.
“We think that the central bank in Korea will be one of the first ones to go, as far as rate hikes are concerned,”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economist Juliana Lee said on Bloomberg Television.
South Korea’s 10-year bond yield erased earlier gains, falling 2 basis points to 2.11% as of 12:55 p.m. Seoul time, while the won declined 0.1% to 1,117.60 per dollar
Pandemic Uncertainties
Lee also said board members discussed whether to offer signals to markets on any policy change, and said growth could top the new 4% forecast if government adds further stimulus and vaccinations speed up. In February, the BOK saw 3% growth and 1.3% inflation for this year.
Financial markets have so far been pricing in two rate increases by the BOK over the next 12 months, a more hawkish bet than economists whose median forecast is for a hike in the third quarter of 2022.
The central bank raised its growth projections for 2022 to 3%, but kept its inflation outlook unchanged at 1.4%, which is slower than this year’s forecast.
Uncertainties related to the pandemic argue against any early tightening. Korea is still finding several hundred new infection case each day and the country has yet to vaccinate a majority of its people. Employment also remains below the pre-pandemic level.
In a post-decision statement, the central bank said the recovery has strengthened on the back of trade, while consumption is also gradually emerging from its slump. The BOK reiterated its pledge to keep policy accommodative, but said it will pay “closer attention to the build-up of financial imbalances,” including ballooning household debt.
“It’s reasonable to think the new forecast brings forward the timing for policy normalization,” said Cho Yong-gu, a fixed-income strategist at Shinyoung Securities, who sees the bank hiking in the first half of next year. “That’s if jobs return to normal, vaccinations move forward as planned and inflation rises to where the BOK sees it.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, amid growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will slowly but surely move towards discussing a tighter monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 90.037 by 12:29 AM ET (4:29 AM GMT), surpassing the 90-mark.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.06% to 109.07. The yen has been boxed its tightest range against the dollar since December 2019 as it reacted to U.S. rates movements, according to RBC Capital Markets. U.S. yields rose during the previous session, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield up 1.7 basis points to 1.5808%.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7738, as Australia’s second-most populous state of Victoria entered a week-long lockdown to curb its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7289. Investors are still digesting the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s policy decision, handed down on Wednesday. The decision reinstated the central bank’s rates outlook and projected rates rising from 0.25% currently to 0.49% by September 2022 and to 1.78% by June 2024.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.3861. U.S.-China relations were on investors’ radars as U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had a “candid” first phone conversation. The phone call was one of the few top-level meetings between the two countries since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.4116.
Although the Fed has insisted that it would maintain its current dovish policy, some Fed officials have hinted in recent comments that the time to discuss a shift in policy could be approaching sooner than expected.
Fed vice chairman for supervision Randy Quarles said on Wednesday that though ""we need to remain patient"" in any policy shift, ""if my expectations about economic growth, employment and inflation over the coming months are borne out ... and especially if they come in strong ... it will become important for the (Federal Open Market Committee) to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.”
Quarles’ comments echoed comments made by Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida earlier in the week and reinforced the possibility of a policy shift for some investors.
""That's probably behind the dollar strength we're seeing at the moment... the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator will be even more closely watched,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist Kim Mundy told Reuters, referring to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge due to be published on Friday.
""The fact that we're expecting to see quite a strong jump in headline inflation might just reinforce market expectations that maybe the Fed is on track to introduce tapering later in 2021,"" she added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar turned upward against major currencies for the first time this week as U.S. yields held steady, Japan's economic outlook worsened and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised markets by hinting at a higher interest rates.
The dollar index rose as much as 0.4% and crossed above 90 on Wednesday afternoon in New York, but still remained near January lows as the market tapped the brakes on its steady slide since March.
Benchmark yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries stayed within their range from the day before and were edging up higher at 1.58% after an auction of 5-year notes.
The foreign exchange markets are wary of taking trends too far right now because key U.S. economic data is coming out on Thursday and Friday, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
Most important is Friday's release of an inflation measure watched closely by the U.S. Federal Reserve. If it is stronger than expected, yields could rise and power the dollar higher. If weaker, the Fed's low interest rate outlook could continue and the dollar's downtrend could resume.
""Caution ahead of the event risk in the latter part of the week is helping to put a tentative floor under the dollar,"" Manimbo said.
Since March the dollar index has lost more than 3% as many other economies have begun to catch up with the pace of U.S. coronavirus vaccinations and as their interest rates have shown more promise of rising. 
Against the Japanese yen on Wednesday, the dollar gained as much as 0.3% and topped 109 yen.
The Japanese government slashed its economic outlook for the first time in three months, citing new weakness in private consumption and business conditions because of coronavirus emergency measures.
The yen is likely to underperform as Japan's economic outlook worsens, according to Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
Yen weakness could offset the currency's usual appeal as a safe haven.
After the New Zealand central bank hinted at a possible interest rate hike by September of next year, the kiwi rose more than 1% against the U.S. dollar
The RBNZ is the second major central bank after the Bank of Canada to nod toward pulling back on easy money policies.
The change drove up New Zealand government 10-year yields and reminded traders to anticipate shifts in tone from other monetary authorities, despite further insistence from policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve that it is too early to discuss tightening.
""There are now several central banks that appear to be closer to a tightening cycle than the Federal Reserve, and markets are sensing that,"" said Imre Speizer, Westpac's head of New Zealand strategy.
Currencies of New Zealand, Canada and Norway are driven by expectations of central bank policy, Speizer said. 
The dollar's rise came at the expense of the euro and the Canadian dollar. The euro lost 0.5% to the dollar as euro zone yields fell on new dovish signals from the European Central Bank. At $1.2187 the euro was still up 4% since March, however.
The U.S. dollar appreciated to 1.2118 Canadian dollars from 1.2062 on Tuesday. 
China's onshore and offshore yuan strengthened to three-year highs versus the dollar. The onshore currency broke through 6.40 - a key psychological level - to trade at 6.39 .
A day earlier, major Chinese state-owned banks had bought dollars at that level in a move viewed as an attempt to cool the rally, sources said.

Cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether were up a fraction of 1% and steady after a volatile weekend.
Iran has banned the energy-intensive mining of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin for nearly four months, as the country faces major power blackouts in many cities.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, trading near its lowest levels since early January as Treasury yields weakened with Federal Reserve officials continuing to present a dovish view.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down less than 0.1% at 89.602, after falling as low as 89.533 on Tuesday, its lowest level since Jan. 7.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2260, after climbing Tuesday as high as 1.2266 for the first time since Jan. 8, as Europe's pandemic recovery picks up pace. USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 108.81, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.4169, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.6% at 0.7792.
Federal Reserve officials have been keen this week to get the message across that they see any elevated inflation pressures as temporary and thus the central bank will keep its current dovish monetary policy unchanged for now.
""I have not seen anything yet to persuade me to change my full support of our accommodative stance,"" Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in a speech on Tuesday.
""Right now, policy is in a very good place… We need to be patient,"" added San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly.
Their continued insistence that there is no real reason to back off from the ultra-easy monetary policies in the near-term is weighing on U.S. Treasury yields.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes traded last at 1.577%, near the 1.554% mark reached overnight for the first time since the early days of May.
“The dollar may therefore remain broadly offered for the time being, with commodity currencies still reaping most of the benefits thanks to a strong start to the week in the commodity segment and the broadly supportive risk environment,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Speaking of commodity currencies, NZD/USD climbed 1.2% to 0.7311 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25%, adding it would only scale back its stimulus measures after its inflation and employment targets are achieved.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.3952, breaking through the psychologically-important 6.40 boundary for the first time since mid-2018, prompting Chinese state-owned banks to buy dollars at around 6.40 yuan to try and limit the Chinese currency’s gains, according to reports.

RBNZ also said it would only scale back its stimulus measures after its inflation and employment targets are achieved.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.23% to 6.3953. The yuan strengthened as far as 6.3925 per dollar during Tuesday’s Asian session in offshore trading, surpassing the 6.40 mark for the first time since mid-2018. The move reportedly prompted Chinese state-owned banks to buy dollars at around 6.40 yuan later during that session in order to cool the rally in the onshore yuan.
""Amid conflicting reports from Chinese officials in recent days about their attitude to the currency, our read here is that 6.40 is not a hard line in the sand, and that in the context of further downward pressure on the dollar more generally, it will be ‘allowed’ to trade lower,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Ray Attrill said in a report that reiterated a forecast for 6.35 yuan per dollar by the end of June 2021.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 1.4165.

However, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Tuesday that policymakers could be ready to talk about the slowdown of asset purchases, echoing the recent minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar extended its nearly two-month slide against major peers on Tuesday as U.S. interest rates fell on U.S. Federal Reserve arguments for easy monetary policy despite current inflationary forces.
The dollar weakness came as U.S. Treasury yields fell to fresh multi-week lows and the yield curve flattened after an auction of two-year notes attracted solid demand.
Benchmark 10-year Treasuries fell as low as 1.56% on Tuesday afternoon.
Interest rates in many other countries have climbed in the past month and made their currencies more competitive against the dollar, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.
The current outlook is for that difference to continue, he added. ""The Federal Reserve seems to be behind several other central banks in adjusting and recalibrating monetary policy.""
Since the end of March the dollar has declined on the belief that low U.S. rates will drive cash abroad to capture gains now that other economies are beginning to recover more quickly from the pandemic. 
The dollar index against major currencies was off 0.2% in the afternoon in New York at 89.646. Early in the day it fell to 89.533, the lowest since Jan. 7. 
The euro climbed to January levels and was last up 0.3% on the day at $1.2253.
Early in the day, China state-owned banks were seen trying to curb a yuan rally which carried the onshore yuan to 6.4016 per dollar, the strongest since 2018.
China's major state-owned banks, four sources said, were seen buying U.S. dollars at around 6.4 yuan in the Asian afternoon in a move viewed as an effort to cool a yuan rally led by its offshore counterpart.
Strategists have said the dollar is likely be weak against many currencies until markets see stronger U.S. economic data and interest rates. Stronger data could come on Friday with new readings on U.S. core consumer prices in April and a survey of purchasing managers.
Comments from Fed officials are keeping down U.S. yields, said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC. ""That's maintaining the weaker dollar narrative."" 
Dovish comments from Fed speakers continued on Tuesday with a speech by Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who said recent inflation reports reflected only a ""burst of post-pandemic relative price level adjustments."" [nL2N2NB2JR]

Investing.com – The dollar slipped against its rivals Tuesday, but the short dollar trade is running out of steam as traders appear to be taking profit on their bearish bets.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.23% to 89.63.
""A number of warning signals on the charts however point to some possible profit taking in the short US Dollar positions and we would tighten up stops,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
The pause in the short dollar has been evident in recent positioning data showing that the traders were reining in their bearish bets on the greenback following stronger April U.S.  inflation data.
""CFTC data for the week ending 18 May 2021 showed the aggregate dollar positioning was unchanged after four weeks of consecutive increases in net-short positions,"" ING said in a note Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dovish Federal Reserve and accelerating growth abroad are weighing on the dollar, a move that could be a boon for stocks and other assets. 
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index is down 4% from its 2021 peak, making the greenback the worst performer of the world’s major currencies so far this quarter. By contrast, the euro is up 4% against the dollar, the Brazilian real has risen 6% and the Chinese yuan by about 3%. 
Net bets against the dollar in futures markets have grown for five straight weeks and stand at $15.86 billion, the highest level since early March. 
""Part of what we are seeing is the top of the first innings of global portfolio flows rebalancing away from the dollar,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management.
Several factors are weighing on the dollar. Some investors view the Federal Reserve’s insistence that it will not taper its bond-buying operations anytime soon even as inflation heats up as a double whammy that is denting the dollar’s appeal. Some quantitative easing policies are tantamount to printing dollars, while inflation erodes the currency’s buying power.

""The 800-pound gorilla in the room is that there is going to be rising concern that the Fed is behind the curve in addressing inflation,"" said Chuck Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisor Capital Management.
While the Fed has reiterated its dovish stance, some countries - including Brazil, Russia and Turkey -have hiked rates, increasing their currencies’ attractiveness to yield-seeking investors. 
In the United States, the 10-year Treasury yield has declined by about 17 basis points from its 2021 peak. 
Expectations that U.S. growth may peak while the rebound in Europe and other regions is only beginning are also hurting the dollar, investors said.
After contracting in the first quarter, the eurozone's gross domestic product is expected to accelerate later in the year and increase by 9.2% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, according to a forecast from Oxford Economics. The firm expects U.S. GDP to peak at a growth rate of 13.3% in the second quarter. 
Morgan Stanley’s Shalett believes the euro, British pound and Chinese renminbi will benefit most as the dollar weakens. 
Because of the dollar's global dominance, its fluctuations often reverberate through a wide range of assets.
Raw materials are priced in dollars and become more affordable to foreign investors when the greenback declines. The S&P/Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is down around 3% from its recent peaks on pullbacks in the prices of copper, oil, and other raw materials that have surged this year. 
A weaker dollar also tends to be a welcome development for U.S. multinationals, making it more favorable for them to change foreign earnings back into their home currency. 
Companies in the technology sector are among the most exposed to currency fluctuations, with nearly 54% of total revenues in the category coming from overseas, an analysis of Russell 1000 companies by Bespoke Investment Group showed. That is followed by the materials sector, where almost 48% of total revenues come from abroad.
Signs that inflation pressures may be forcing the Fed to soften its position on interest rates could help reverse the dollar’s decline. 
A ""number"" of Fed officials appeared ready to consider changes to monetary policy based on a continued strong economic recovery, according to minutes of the U.S. central bank's April meeting. That month's anemic job number, however, may have dimmed their view. (nL2N2N628K)
“We are concerned about a scenario of U.S. overheating, which could lead to inflation well above what the Fed would tolerate,” analysts at BoFA Global Research wrote. “This could indeed surprise markets in our view, and lead to a meaningful move of the (dollar) higher.”
A pullback in stocks could also lift the dollar, a popular destination during times of market turbulence. 
Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy and portfolio manager for Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, thinks such risks may be keeping some investors from betting on further dollar weakness. 

Nevertheless, he believes accelerating global growth will continue lifting the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars at the greenback's expense.
""The fundamentals for the dollar remain bearish,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Tuesday, with Federal Reserve officials keen to stick to the recent mantra that inflationary pressures were temporary in nature and the central bank’s ultra-easy monetary policies were here to stay.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.735, hovering above a four-month low.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2231, not far removed from last week’s three-month high of 1.2245, USD/JPY was largely flat at 108.73, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.4180, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7758.
Minutes from the April Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting last week gave the dollar a short-lived boost as they indicated that a number of policymakers wanted to discuss tapering the central bank’s bond purchases over worries that the considerable stimulus already pouring into an economy on the mend could stoke inflation.
However, a series of Fed officials--Governor Lael Brainard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis’s James Bullard--pushed back Monday against the threat that a spike in price pressures will prove lasting as the U.S. economy reopens, eager to make sure the message remained that the central bank was not going anywhere soon.
""I think there will come a time when we can talk more about changing the parameters of monetary policy, I don't think we should do it when we're still in the pandemic,"" Bullard said, and was typical of their comments.
More softish data would add weight to their views, and later Tuesday the market expects new home sales to drop nearly 5% in April from the previous month and consumer confidence to erode a little in May.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 8.3971, with the Turkish lira under pressure once more after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the deputy governor of the country’s central bank, Oguzhan Ozbas, replacing him with Semih Tumen, a labor economist and professor of economics at Ankara-based TED University.
This move comes just two months after Erdogan fired the bank’s third governor in less than two years, Naci Agbal, a move that shocked the market as he had been seen as trying to restore the central bank’s credibility. The lira has lost about 14% against the dollar since he was sacked.
USD/INR was largely flat at 72.857, with the Indian rupee outperforming, up 1.5% against the dollar in May, on signs that India’s virus crisis may be easing. 
India on Tuesday posted 196,427 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours, its lowest daily rise in infections since April 14.
USD/IDR was largely flat at 14,345 with Bank Indonesia expected to hold its policy rate steady later Tuesday at a record low of 3.5% to protect the rupiah.
The rupiah fell 1.1% last week, its largest decline since February, amid fresh signals that the U.S. Federal Reserve could start considering unwinding stimulus this year, which has pressured the emerging markets.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia as comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials eased investors’ worries about runaway inflation.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 89.743 by 12:44 AM ET (4:44 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was steady at 108.73. Japan is planning to extend its state of emergency as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country rises, with the U.S. State Department upping its travel advisory for Japan to level four.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7757. Melbourne has restricted gatherings as Australia’s second-largest city deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7225. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is due to hand down its policy decision on Wednesday, with some investors already betting that the central bank may begin to project rate rises.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4115 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 1.4179.
U.S. Federal Reserve officials, including Governor Lael Brainard, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, insisted that any inflation was transitory.
""I think there will come a time when we can talk more about changing the parameters of monetary policy, I don't think we should do it when we're still in the pandemic,"" Bullard said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Chicago Fed National Activity index, released on Monday, read a lower-than-expected 0.24 in April, easing investors’ worries about the change of the Fed’s dovish monetary policy.
""Markets appear to be coming around to the Fed narrative that a burst in inflation is only likely to be temporary,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), told Reuters.
""A temporary spike in prices should not instigate a removal of stimulatory policies from central banks,” he added.
Investors are now focused on how inflation will impact central banks’ policy decisions moving forward.
""The whole world is in a wait-and-see mode,"" Stuart Oakley, head of cash currency trading at Nomura, told Reuters.
""The next few months are going to be so pivotal for FX, purely based on when the Fed starts talking about tapering, and that is 100% down to how the data is going to pan out this month and next month,"" he said. ""The minute we get so much as a suggestion that some of that stimulus (has) moved, then everything's going to change drastically.""
Oakley has trimmed his own trading as uncertainty grows.
Investors now await further data, including the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index, due to be released on May 28.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar languished near four-month lows against major currencies on Monday as bets on a robust global economic recovery continued to support currencies seen as riskier.
The dollar index moved around the 90 mark, down 0.2% on the day, slightly above a four-month low on Friday of 89.646.
Since the end of March, the greenback, seen as a safe-haven trade, has retreated steadily with optimism about the recovery. But lately that move down seems to have slowed as traders begin to anticipate higher U.S. interest rates coming when the U.S. Federal Reserve reacts to signs of increasing inflation.
""Markets have to start pricing in a slightly more hawkish Fed going forward,"" Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman wrote on Monday morning.
Data due on Friday, including U.S. personal consumption and inflation figures, could move the markets to anticipate a more hawkish tone from the next Fed policy meeting on June 15-16. But for now, Thin said, ""the dollar is coming under some modest pressure as the week begins.""
Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield fell to 1.604% on Monday from 1.632% late on Friday.
Because the recovery is picking up globally, now strategists are trying to anticipate how quickly yields in other countries will rise compared the likely pace in the United States. 
Traders are also watching for progress on a new U.S. stimulus package, after the White House pared down its infrastructure bill to $1.7 trillion on Friday but failed to gain Senate Republican backing.
Among the currencies gaining on the dollar was the euro, up 0.3% to $1.22 The single currency has picked up around 4% on the greenback since March as Europe has moved to catch up with the United States in vaccinating its people and reviving its economy.
Cryptocurrencies fought back on Monday, retaking ground lost during a bout of weekend selling that was fueled by further signs of a Chinese crackdown on the emerging sector.
Bitcoin rebounded about 10% early in the day and then held around $38,000, recovering from a tough weekend in which it fell as much as 17% to $31,107 on Sunday.
Bitcoin is up nearly 30% for the year, but has fallen by almost half from its April record peak of $64,895. The volatility has undermined the case for its mainstream acceptance.

The catalyst for Sunday's slump was that cryptocurrency ""miners,"" who mint cryptocurrencies by using powerful computers to solve complex math puzzles, were halting Chinese operations in the face of increasing scrutiny from authorities. 
Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose 16% to $2,435, about half of its high two weeks ago.

Investing.com - The dollar edged down in early European trade Monday, trading near three-month lows as confidence that the Federal Reserve was set to start tapering its bond-buying program in the near future ebbs away.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.975, marginally above a three-month low of 89.646 set on Friday.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2184, off a three-month high of 1.2245 touched on Wednesday, USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 108.81, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.4154, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7737.
The greenback received a boost early last week after minutes from the meeting of the April Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting indicated that a number of policymakers wanted to discuss tapering bond purchase on worries that the considerable stimulus already pouring into an economy on the mend could stoke inflation.
However, traders have been gradually easing back bets on this tapering occurring promptly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell repeating his view that it is not yet time to discuss a reduction in quantitative monetary easing.
“The weakness in the dollar owes a large part to a core of the Fed unhurried about the need to withdraw stimulus and recovery stories elsewhere in the world,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
With investors preoccupied with threats of accelerating inflation, U.S. PCE (personal consumption expenditures) data, due on Friday, is seen as one of the biggest tests for markets this week.
The core PCE, excluding food and energy, is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% flexible average target. It was up 1.8% in the 12 months to March, and further rises could test the Fed’s resolve to keep up asset purchases at their current pace.
Another data release that could influence the Fed is May’s advanced trade balance, also due on Friday.
“A $92bn deficit is expected. Yes that’s $92bn. That is quite a large hole to fill when the U.S. exceptionalism of the 2018-2020 period is being challenged by the overseas recovery and U.S. real rates remain very negative,” ING added.
Adding to the pressure on the dollar has been the recovery in the euro, bolstered by rising optimism about economic reopenings in Europe from coronavirus lockdowns.
Eurozone  PMI figures, released late last week, showed a strong recovery in the region’s dominant services sector.
“After two quarters of contracting GDP, the second quarter of 2021 will likely show firm growth on the back of reopening economies and strong consumer demand,” ING said.
The EU leaders get together this week in a summit. The main point on the agenda is likely to be climate change, and this is unlikely to have much of an immediate market impact.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia but remained near its lowest level in three months. Investors remain concerned that the U.S.’ continuous economic recovery from COVID-19 could lead to a slowdown of U.S. stimulus measures earlier than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 90.017 by 12:43 AM ET (4:43 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 108.82, with Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda due to speak later in the day.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7728. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7168, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand due to hand down its interest rate decision on Wednesday.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.4333 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.4150.
The U.S Federal Reserve’s minutes from its latest meeting, released during the previous week, hinted at a scale-back of asset purchases. However, Fed chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank will not curb its asset purchases soon.
""Inflation figures have been pretty strong but retail sales may be starting to slow down. And the economic outlook hinges on fiscal policy, which is still uncertain,"" Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), told Reuters.
Several U.S. Fed officials, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, are also due to speak throughout the week.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said during the previous week that the uncertain recovery still needs emergency support from the central bank.
“We are committed to preserving favorable financing conditions. It’s far too early and it’s actually unnecessary to debate longer-term issues,” Lagarde said.
“I have repeatedly said that policymakers needed to provide the right bridge across the pandemic, well into the recovery, so we can actually deliver on our mandate.”
On the data front, the U.S. will hand down a slew of data, including CB consumer confidence on Tuesday and initial jobless claims, GDP, and pending home sales figures on Thursday.
Elsewhere in the U.S., Republicans said that a reduction in the price tag for U.S. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill, from $2.25 trillion to $1.7 trillion, was still not enough to consider a deal.
On the cryptocurrency front, bitcoin slid over 7% during the weekend after China further cracked down on the trading and mining of the largest digital token. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk also said during the previous week that the company would not accept bitcoin as payment for its cars."

Investing.com - The dollar ended the week lower Friday, though its days in the doldrums of darkness are coming to end in the short-term as the Federal Reserve prepares to begin talking about tapering.
""Taper tantrum and USD appreciation were about a year apart at the time. And in retrospect, the lesson of 2013/14 should be that the two are independent decisions that do not follow each other in a fixed time interval. This is even more true under the new Fed strategy.""
Federal Reserve officials signaled it may appropriate to start discussing a plan to rein in bond purchases at upcoming meetings, according to the minutes of the Fed's April 27-28 meeting, released Wednesday.
Others agree that the dollar is set for short-term gain, but will continue its long-term pain. 
""We expect the dollar’s mild depreciation trend to become more apparent later in the year or early in 2022, as U.S. growth slows and converges with the eurozone rate. A more synchronized post-pandemic recovery should produce more balanced global growth and recovering trade, with U.S. trade deficits large and growing. Historically, this is one where the dollar falls rather than rises, so, we anticipate that the dollar’s current trading range will give way to more sustained weakness in 2022,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Friday, boosted by encouraging U.S. manufacturing data, but remained on track for a weekly loss as traders' concerns about taper talk in U.S. Federal Reserve minutes moderated.
The dollar has given back much of the advance it made after a mention in minutes from the Fed's April monetary policy meeting of possible future discussions on paring back stimulus, raised hopes U.S. interest rate raises might come earlier than previously thought.
""Taper concerns have faded rather quickly, it would seem,"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
The U.S. currency found some support after data showed U.S. factory activity gathered speed in early May amid strong domestic demand.
The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.222% higher at 89.993. The index, which hit a four-month low earlier in the session, was on pace for a loss of 0.4% for the week.
Some strategists remain doubtful the Fed will rush to pull back from its accommodative stance.
""We continue to expect the USD to remain soft while U.S. yields remain contained,"" Osborne said.
Still, continued improvement in U.S. data, especially relative to Europe, is likely to bolster the bull case for the greenback, other analysts said.
""The latest flash PMIs reinforce our view that the economy will continue to grow at a faster pace in the U.S. than in the euro-zone in the next few years,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics.
""This feeds into our forecast that long-dated yields will rise more rapidly in the former than in the latter and that the euro will fall back against the U.S. dollar,"" Gambarini said 
A loosening of COVID-19 restrictions helped surveys of German services activity and French business activity come in better than expected in May, although they had little effect on the euro on Friday.

The British pound fell 0.2% on Friday but was on track for its third consecutive week of gains against the dollar, helped by a series of data releases reinforcing market expectations for a strong economic recovery in the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, bitcoin slid on Friday after China doubled down on its efforts to prevent speculative and financial risks by cracking down on the mining and trading of the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin traded down 11.5% to 35,952.05. Ether fell 14.3%.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower in early European trade Friday, heading for a weekly loss as concerns eased over Federal Reserve members discussing potentially tapering back bond buying.
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.737, down about 0.6% for the week so far. 
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2237, not far below the four-month high of 1.2245 it hit earlier in the week, USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 108.71, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7756.
The dollar has given back a bounce it made after a mention of possible future tapering discussions, in minutes from the Fed's April meeting, prompted fears of early rate rises.
“News from the FOMC minutes that a number of participants felt that tapering of asset purchases might be discussed at upcoming meetings could have given the dollar a big boost,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The fact that it hasn't probably owes to the fact that progress towards the Fed goals is still ongoing and that the first Fed rate hike would still be a 2023 story.”
Data released on Thursday showed that U.S. initial jobless claims fell to 444,000 over the past week, a new post-pandemic low, adding to evidence of a steady recovery in the labor market.
That said, the number of continuing claims, which are measured with a one-week time lag to initial ones, rose by over 100,000, suggesting the recovery still has some way to go.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4182, just short of multi-year highs, after British retail sales surged by 9.2% in April, when non-essential shops reopened after months of closure due to Covid restrictions, their biggest jump since a previous reopening in June.
Sterling is heading for a third consecutive weekly gain and has climbed 2.6% during May so far.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, staying near milestone lows and set to record a weekly loss. Investors’ risk appetite increased as concerns about the U.S. Federal Reserve's hint of tapering eased, and economic recovery from COVID-19 gave other currencies a boost against the greenback.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 89.725 by 13:05 PM ET (5:05 AM GMT), falling below the 90-mark.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 108.78 as April’s data released earlier in the day showed the national core consumer price index (CPI) contracted 0.1% year-on-year, better than the 0.2% contraction in forecasts prepared by investing.com, while its national CPI contracted 0.4% month-on-month, which was larger than March’s 0.2% growth.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7760 as Australia released its April’s retail sales data earlier in the day. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.7188.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01 to 6.4334.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.4185 as investors await U.K. retail sales data for April due later in the day. The U.K. will also release its composite, manufacturing and services purchasing managers’ indexes for May.
In the U.S., data released on Thursday showed that the initial jobless claims fell to 444,000 over the past week, below 450,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and 478,000 reading filed during the previous week.
Investors also seem less concerned about the Fed’s minutes from its latest meeting, released on Wednesday, which hinted at a scale-back of asset purchases.
""It has been just over 24 hours since markets got spooked by the prospect of the U.S. Fed tapering its asset purchases, but having proverbially slept on it, the mood seems less sour today,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.
""Which seems reasonable, it's not like the Fed is on the brink of wanting to actually act,” the noted added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar retreated on Thursday, hovering near a multi-month low as a risk-on rally drew investors away from the safe-haven currency, reversing Wednesday's bounce.
That bounce was prompted by the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's most recent monetary policy meeting, in which several policymakers said discussions on tapering of government bond purchases would be appropriate ""at some point"" should economic recovery continue to gather steam.
That gave a boost to the greenback, which had been sliding in recent weeks due to repeated Fed reassurances that it is too soon to tighten its accommodative policy and that current price spikes do not portend longer-term inflation.
""Most of the moves we've seen over the last 24 hours were over the Fed minutes,"" said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. ""The market totally overreacted to them and Treasury yields shot higher.""
""After some thought the market has realized the Fed is going to need months of better data before it begins to discuss the taper,"" Simpson added. ""Today, the markets took that to heart and it canceled out the moves we saw yesterday.""
A rally on Wall Street and rebounding cryptocurrencies signaled broad, risk-on sentiment which, along with weakening Treasury yields, helped the dollar erase Wednesday's advance.
The dollar index was last down 0.46% at 89.792. 
That weakness helped boost the Australian dollar which also got a lift from strong April employment data. It was up 0.56% at 77.71 cents.
The euro gained 0.37%, at $1.2219, and the dollar fell 0.38% to 108.80 Japanese yen.
Canada's robust economy and rising commodity costs have pushed the Canadian dollar to its strongest level against the dollar since 2015. The dollar was last down 0.60% against the loonie, at $1.2059.
The cryptocurrency rollercoaster was on an upswing in the wake of a steep sell-off following China's regulatory move against the digital assets.
While that sell-off reversed course with the help of bargain hunters, cryptos were last well off their session highs.

Bitcoin was most recently up 8.9% at $40,050 after plummeting to 54% below its record high, hit just over a month ago, after some of its prominent backers reiterated their support for the digital currency.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, handing back some of the gains seen after the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting revealed talk of bond tapering.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.085, after it had bounced off three-month lows on Thursday. 
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2188, having slipped 0.4% in the previous session from a three-month high of 1.2245, USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 109.12, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.4120, after trading above 1.42 earlier this week, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.3% at 0.7750.
""A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee's goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase,"" the minutes showed.
This caused something of a surprise, to the benefit of the dollar, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said right after that meeting last month that it is not time yet to begin discussing any change in policy.
However, the gains were minor, as central bank members continued to point out that there is still a long way to go until the economy makes ""sustained progress"" toward the Fed's maximum employment and inflation goals.
The minutes lifted U.S. bond yields a little, with the 10-year Treasury yield now around 1.67%, compared with 1.65% just before the release of the minutes, but this is still well below their March peaks.
Elsewhere, USD/ZAR is down 0.2% at 14.0812 ahead of the latest meeting of South Africa’s central bank. The bank is likely to leave its interest rates unchanged later Thursday, but expectations are rising that it will be forced to tighten its policies this year after inflation accelerated more than expected.
Data released Wednesday showed inflation accelerated to a 14-month high of 4.4% in April from 3.2% the previous month. With the central bank’s key interest rate at 3.5%, the country now has a negative real interest rate for the first time since February 2016.

(Reuters) - Investors turned short on several Asian currencies, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as surging coronavirus cases and deaths across the region forced countries into fresh lockdowns and threatened their recovery from last year's economic slump.
Most notably, investors turned bearish on the currencies of South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, and trimmed their long bets on China's yuan and the Philippine peso, according to a fortnightly poll of 12 respondents.
Taiwan and Singapore, hailed for their success in containing previous COVID-19 outbreaks, have recently seen a spike in cases, prompting social curbs and a race to ramp up vaccinations.
Rising infections last week forced Malaysia into a nationwide lockdown until June 7 and also led Thailand to downgrade its 2021 economic growth forecast on Monday. 
""COVID-19 is probably the dominant risk for EM/Asia for now,"" analysts at DBS bank wrote, noting worsening daily infection trends across the region.
""Without a high enough proportion of the population vaccinated, there will also always be risks of another COVID wave, even if containment measures were deemed strong.""
Short bets on South Korea's won, the Taiwanese dollar, Malaysia's ringgit, and the Thai baht were at their highest since April 8, while investors were the most bearish on Singapore's dollar since March 25.
They, however, turned bullish on the Indian rupee for the first time in more than two months. The currency has firmed slightly since March-end despite a crippling second wave of infections and record deaths.
""Near-term rupee stability ... is not a paradoxical de-coupling with COVID devastation. This is merely a tactical bet on distribution of resources, policy support and recovery hopes,"" Mizuho analysts said in a note.
Markets turned cautiously bullish on the Indonesian rupiah for the first time since late February.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.

The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia as the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed that policymakers suggested a slowdown of bond purchase due to a sign of accelerating inflation.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 90.123 by 11:53 PM ET (3:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.07% to 109.14 as April's trade data released earlier in the day exceeded expectations. Exports grew 38.0% year-on-year, imports increased 12.8% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at JPY225.3 billion.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7740. Employment data for April released earlier in the day said that the employment change decreased by 30,600 in April while the unemployment rate fell to 5.5%. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 0.7176.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.4385, with the People's Bank of China releasing the loan prime rate earlier in the day.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.4114.
In the minutes for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)'s latest meeting, released on Wednesday, several policymakers suggested that the central bank start scaling back asset purchases “at some point” if the U.S. continues its economic recovery.
Investors were caught by surprise as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials had reiterated that the Fed would stick to its current dovish policy as any rising inflation would be temporary.
“The minutes contained wording that appears to seek to start the discussion on tapering at an earlier timing than expected... if the next jobs data due on Jun. 3 is strong, markets will start bracing for the Fed making a specific mention on tapering at its next meeting in June,” Takafumi Yamawaki, head of fixed income research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), told Reuters.
Other investors agreed with Yamawaki.
“It is worth noting that the FOMC minutes predate the latest CPI and payroll/earnings numbers, so the fears of the minority on the FOMC are likely to have become a little more acute since the April meeting,” Tapas Strickland, RBA’s director of economics and markets, told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained ground on Wednesday, snapping a four-day losing streak and bouncing off a multi-month low following the release of the minutes from the Fed's most recent monetary policy meeting.
In those minutes, a number of members of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said that should the economic recovery continue to gain momentum, it would be appropriate ""at some point"" to discuss tightening its accommodative policy, giving the greenback a boost.
""The big thing from the Fed minutes is the mention of beginning of taper talks,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank in St. Louis. ""Any mention of the Fed stepping in and raising rates will have a major impact on the dollar.""
Still, the minutes were from a meeting that occurred before the release of key economic data, which showed further weakness in the labor market and price spikes driven by a supply/demand imbalance.
Since then, the Fed has repeatedly offered assurances that surging prices in the near term will not translate to long-term inflation.
""The Fed is generally singing from the same song sheet, stating that inflation will be transitory,"" Gaffney added. ""In general, they've done a good job of keeping a pretty unified front.""
The dollar also benefited from a broad risk-off sentiment, which saw the major U.S stock indexes slide and cryptocurrencies plunge.
""When we saw the big move away from bitcoin, it was an indication that investors are moving away from risk assets, and that benefits the dollar,"" Gaffney said. ""It's an indication of flight to safety."" 
Bitcoin briefly plunged to its lowest level since January in the wake of China's decision to ban financial and payment institutions from providing digital currency services, but pared its losses after some of its prominent backers reiterated their support.
Rival cryptocurrency ethereum was last down 22% at $2,623.
Gaffney believes digital currency investors should gird their loins for more of the same.
""Crypto markets were ripe for a sell-off with the run-up we’ve seen,"" he said. ""I expect to see more of the wild roller-coaster ride that we’ve seen going forward.""

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of world currencies, was last up 0.52% at 90.254. 
Meanwhile, pricing pressures were being felt elsewhere. UK inflation more than doubled in April to 1.5% from a month earlier, sparking similar concerns over longer-term inflation.
The British pound eased 0.58% against the dollar to $1.4106.
Canada also released its latest inflation data, which showed consumer prices jumping to an annual rate of 3.4%.
The greenback gained 0.64% against the Canadian dollar to $1.214, but was still hovering near its weakest level since May 2015.

The euro reversed course after touching its highest level against the dollar since the beginning of January, falling 0.5% to $1.2164.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.25% to 109.26.

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally lower in early European trade Wednesday, remaining near multi-month lows ahead of the release of the eagerly-awaited minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.683, close to the lowest since late February. 
EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2245, climbing to its highest level since early January, USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 108.95, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7792.
The minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting are due later on Wednesday, and are expected to confirm that policymakers think the U.S. economy still needs support. As such, the reining in of the central bank’s ultra-easy monetary policies will remain in the distance.
This is likely to keep the dollar on the backfoot despite last week’s gains when U.S. consumer prices posted the fastest increase in more than a decade.
“It is now as if history from the early 2000s is repeating itself; the days of the ‘Greenspan put’ when the Fed maintained a stimulative monetary policy, finding a weakness in individual economic indicators and ignoring the overall acceleration in the economy and inflation,” said Alexander Kuptsikevich at FXPro, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was largely unchanged at 1.4183, near its strongest level since late February, benefitting from the reopening of the U.K. economy as a result of a successful vaccination program.
British consumer price inflation rose to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March, official figures showed on Wednesday, ahead of the expected rise of 1.4%. There was a more notable rise in U.K. producer price inflation, with input prices rising nearly 10% on the year.
USD/CAD fell 0.1% to $1.2058, close to its weakest level since May 2015. Canadian inflation data are due later in the day, as are Eurozone numbers.
“Supported crude is pairing with accelerating vaccinations in Canada to keep pressuring on USD/CAD, which may test the key 1.2000 support in the coming days,” said ING analysts, in a note.
EUR/HUF gained 0.3% to 351.38, with the forint handing back some of Tuesday’s gains on the back of officials at Hungary’s central bank suggesting a hike in the benchmark rate could be coming in June.
“We now look for four 15bp hikes in the 1-week depo this year, with the first hike coming at the June NBH meeting,” added ING. “The proactive NBH points to near-term gains for the forint and outperformance. We expect EUR/HUF to test and break the 350 level this quarter. But forint gains won’t be permanent and we expect EUR/HUF to end the year closer to 355-360 as a lot is already priced in.”
USD/RUB fell 0.1% at 73.6173, helped by Axios reporting that the U.S. administration is set to waive previously imposed sanctions on the company overseeing construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, easing pressure on the Russian government."

Investing.com – The pound soared to a three-month high against the dollar, riding on the coattails of reopening optimism, but the end of pandemic will bring the focus back on the Brexit effects that could halt cable’s run higher, according to an FX expert.
GBP/USD rose 0.39% to $1.4188. 
“Corona euphoria is continuing, but we remain Sterling sceptical,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) FX, EM Analysts You-Na Park-Heger said in a note. But with the end of the pandemic, market attention “will increasingly focus on the (negative) Brexit effects again, […] we see little scope for further Sterling appreciation,” Heger added.
The success of the vaccine rollout, with about 55% having already received the first dose, keeps the U.K. on track to lift all Covid-19 restrictions in about one month, and has helped strengthened the recovery, particularly in the labor market.
The U.K. reported Wednesday 46,000 job gains in March, taking the total to 102,000 jobs from the trough in January, suggesting the U.K. “may finally be turning a corner with further reopening effects ahead,” Scotiabank said in a note.
The optimism over the reopening has shielded sterling from remarks from Bank of England members, who in recent days have attempted to keep investor expectations grounded.
“Not even comments by Bank of England member Gertjan Vlieghe that the economy still needed a lot of stimulus and that the BoE would add negative interest rates to its toolkit in August was able to affect Sterling,” according to Heger.
The somewhat dovish remarks from Vlieghe arrive just weeks after delivered updated economic projections, forecasting growth of 7.25% this year, the fastest pace in more than 70 years.
The BoE also cut its weekly bond purchases to £3.4 billion from £4.4 billion in order to meet its unchanged £875 billion year-end target.
But the central bank was insisted that the slowing of its weekly bond purchases should not be viewed as a taper given its £875 billion bond holding target remains intact."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. 
U.S. Treasury yields stalled as investors grew more confident that the Fed will hold off on tightening its accommodative monetary policy, despite worrisome indicators that booming demand and scarce supply are sending prices soaring.
Those price increases have stoked fears of longer-term inflation, despite the central bank's assurances that the spikes will be transitory.
""The market has come around to the Fed's expectation that inflation is set to rise over near term but will plateau and decline in the coming months,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""The perception is the Fed could lag other central banks in normalizing its policies.""
Several Fed policymakers are expected to speak this week and the U.S. central bank is due to release the minutes from its April policy meeting on Wednesday, all of which will be parsed for any signs of a shift in its economic outlook.
""As long as the Fed maintains this very dovish policy stance, that's going to leave the dollar vulnerable,"" Manimbo added. ""Having said that, the Fed signaling a change in course might not be that long in the offing if we see strong data, especially in the job market and inflation.""
The dollar index was last down 0.48% at 89.747. 
The progress of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and easing of measures to contain the pandemic have lifted higher-risk currencies that stand to benefit most from economic revival.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian exporters are adjusting their currency hedges and buying the loonie at stronger levels, in a sign market players are growing more confident that the currency's commodity-linked surge this year will stick, foreign exchange dealers say.
The Canadian dollar has climbed nearly 6% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year, the biggest gain among the Group of 10 currencies. On Tuesday, it touched its strongest level since 2015 at 1.2013, or 83.24 U.S. cents.
A stronger loonie could crimp the profit margins and reduce the competitiveness of Canada's exporters. While some are holding out for a pullback in the currency, others are positioning themselves for a further push higher on the back of soaring prices for some of the commodities that Canada produces.
""We have seen our exporters resetting their sights to more realistic levels,"" said Michael Goshko, corporate risk manager at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions.
""There's a perception that there is a lot of runway left to go,"" Goshko said. ""We have seen ex-energy commodity prices move to record highs, and that's before the Canadian economy and the global economy really begin to surge this summer.""
The Bank of Canada's commodity price index excluding energy - a category that includes metals and minerals, forestry, agriculture and fisheries - has climbed to its highest level since 1972, while the price of oil, a key Canadian export, has nearly doubled since November.
The Bank of Canada highlighted the country's improving economic fortunes last month when it projected that gross domestic product would grow 6.5% this year and offered more hawkish guidance on its outlook for interest rates.
Some economists expect Canada later this month to post a current account surplus, which would be its first since 2008.
While acknowledging that the rise in commodity prices was good news for the country, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said last week that exports could face headwinds if the loonie continued to strengthen.
""There will be boardroom discussions about what do we do if CAD keeps appreciating,"" said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco. ""I mean if USD-CAD goes to 1.15, then that's a significant pressure point ... where for some industries it just isn't worth doing the business."" (Graphic: CAD value in USD, https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-ECONOMY/CURRENCY/azgpogygbpd/chart.png) 
'ON THE RADAR'
Forward contracts are the favored hedging tool of many large exporters, including those in the energy, auto and agriculture sectors, while some companies use option structures, paying a premium for downside protection, analysts say.
Brad Schruder, managing director of corporate sales and structuring at BMO Capital Markets, said he has seen a pick-up in the last two weeks of pricing requests for Canadian dollar call options from companies that don't regularly hedge. 
""Those types of requests only come around when suddenly FX is on the radar of a C-suite executive that might have considered it an afterthought before,"" Schruder said.

The loonie has gained ground for seven straight weeks, its longest streak of weekly gains since 2016.
""The Friday that we go home and USD-CAD closes below 1.20, that's the weekend that's going to cause Canadian exporters a lot of grief,"" Schruder said.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Tuesday as comments from Federal Reserve officials pointed to the central bank holding onto its ultra-easy monetary policies for some time yet.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 89.955, falling to its lowest level since late February. 
EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2183, climbing to its highest level since Feb. 26, USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 109.08, after data showed Japan's economy contracted more than expected due to coronavirus infection, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7802.
The dollar had pushed higher last week after consumer prices jumped sharply, suggesting the Federal Reserve would feel the pressure to rein in its accommodative policies sooner than it had guided.
However, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan on Monday reiterated his view that he does not expect interest rates to rise until next year, and Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida pointed to the recent disappointing jobs report as evidence that the economy still needs help.
This boosted the growing conviction that the central bank will tolerate what it sees as a temporary acceleration in inflation for some time, to the detriment of the greenback.
Other Fed officials are due to speak throughout the week and investors will also carefully study the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due for release on Wednesday, for clues as to the Fed’s monetary policy direction for the rest of 2021.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.4% to 1.4183, climbing to its strongest since late February as investors cheer the gradual lifting of strict coronavirus restrictions.
Adding to optimism surrounding sterling, Britain's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell again to 4.8% between January and March, a period which the country spent under a tight Covid lockdown, from 4.9%.
“Cable looks comfortable above 1.4100 and barring any surprisingly hawkish comments from the Fed this week cable can test the 1.4200 area,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Additionally, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.4245, not far from last week's high which was the highest level for it in nearly three years, while EUR/HUF dropped 0.3% to 350.13 after comments from officials at Hungary’s central bank suggesting a hike in the benchmark rate could be coming in June. 
“This has surprised markets that had felt the NBH would be late to hike and this news could send EUR/HUF towards the 350 area,” ING added.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, hitting a six-year low against its Canadian counterpart and hovering close to multi-month lows against European currencies, as investors ramped up bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not hike interest rates anytime soon.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.05% to 90.097 by 12:20 AM ET (4:20 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.03% to 109.22, with Japan’s slow COVID-19 vaccination rate and dollar weakness locking the duo into a narrow range.
The yen also fell against the pound and the riskier Antipodean currencies as data released earlier in the day said that the Japanese economy contracted more than expected during the first quarter of 2021, as its GDP contracted 5.1% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.35% to 0.7791, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.47% to 0.7234.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.17% to 6.4278, with the onshore yuan close to the almost three-year high reached during the previous week.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.27% to 1.4173, its strongest level since late February 2021, as the U.K. starts to exit its strict COVID-19 lockdown.
The dollar was at $1.2167 against the euro, close to its weakest level since Feb. 26, 2021. The Canadian dollar climbed to a six-year high of C$1.2045 against its U.S. counterpart, boosted by a rise in oil prices.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Monday reiterated his view that he does not expect interest rates to rise until 2022, thus sparking a further decline in bets that inflationary pressure could force the central bank to act sooner than expected.
Other Fed officials are due to speak throughout the week and investors also await the release of the minutes from the Fed’s latest meeting, due on Wednesday.
Investors will analyze the minutes once they are released for clues as to the Fed’s monetary policy direction for the rest of 2021. However, a consensus is growing that the Fed will continue with its current dovish policy over the assumption that any acceleration in inflation is temporary, in turn keeping the dollar on a downward trend.
""The most important point is where are yields headed... yields are capped, reflecting expectations that U.S. monetary policy will remain easy... this places the dollar under downward pressure,” IG Securities senior foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters.
With investors already scaling back bets for a Fed interest rate hike in 2021, Kaplan’s comments further incentivized them to sell the dollar.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower on Monday as inflation jitters, exacerbated by record high prices paid in a regional U.S. manufacturing survey, benefited riskier currencies at the greenback's expense.
But the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was little changed as market participants sought clues regarding the Federal Reserve's tolerance for near- and medium-term inflation.
""Given that since the dollar's sell-off last week it hasn't been able to bounce much, it tells me that the driver is not the foreign currency market but the interest rate market,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Forex in New York. ""And without higher interest rates it's hard to see how the dollar gets much traction.""
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to release the minutes from its April monetary policy on Wednesday, which market participants will scrutinize for clues regarding the central bank's views on current inflation spikes.
""The Fed is still saying they're going to be very patient,"" Chandler added. ""If the U.S. doesn't offer higher interest rates, the dollar bears the burden, and that's where we are now.""
The Empire State report from the New York Federal Reserve showed a survey record high of prices paid by manufacturers in New York state as materials producers struggle to keep up with booming demand.

As economies re-open for business, resurgent demand combined with supply shortages has put commodity prices on an upward trajectory.

330,"<span>May 17, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hungary moved into pole position to implement the European Union’s first interest-rate hike since the pandemic as soaring inflation prompts policy makers to act in the bloc’s east.
The nearby Czech Republic had been the EU’s most likely first mover until Hungarian central bank Deputy Governor Barnabas Virag said Monday that surging prices will be met by tighter monetary policy as soon as next month -- sparking gains in the forint.
The bank should consider lifting its benchmark rate in June as part of a “data-driven” tightening cycle carried out in several steps, Virag told a briefing in Budapest. Even in the event of a hike, quantitative easing will continue, with the program to only be wound down gradually, he said.
“Inflation risks have unequivocally risen,” Virag said. “The central bank wishes to respond to sustained inflation risks via the benchmark rate.”
Talk of rate hikes in the EU’s east comes as the world’s major central banks say they’ll maintain loose monetary policy amid a bout of inflation they deem temporary. Virag’s comments mark a break from what had up to now been a wait-and-see approach to inflation in Hungary. Consumer prices jumped 5.1% in April -- the EU’s fastest pace and already more than the 5% peak the central bank had earlier projected.
Hungary last raised borrowing costs in September, when the one-week deposit rate was lifted to 0.75%, 15 basis-points above the benchmark. While Virag didn’t say how much the benchmark would rise this time around, he said it needs to have an “effective” impact on asset markets.
The government’s forint bond yields rose across the curve, with 10-year rates adding to their steepest loss in more than a year last week. The benchmark three-year note led declines with the yield rising 12 basis points to 1.64% on Monday.
The forint strengthened as much as 0.7% per euro to 352.64 at 10:26 a.m. in Budapest, the strongest since December.
Government debt costs have risen despite 2.1 trillion forint ($7.2 billion) of bond purchases by the central bank. Virag said weekly QE volumes could be increased from the current 60 billion forint if needed.
“Our sovereign bond purchase program is the most effective tool to stabilize the long end of the yield curve,” he said. “That’s why phasing out the program requires extraordinary caution to maintain market stability.”"

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday, with this safe haven supported by concerns over fresh Covid-19 outbreaks in some Asian countries. However, gains are small ahead of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.382. 
EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2130, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.4090, just off a two-and-a-half month high as Britain reopens its economy after a four-month lockdown. USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 109.30, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7753.
India has been hit very hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, as a new strain of the virus first found there fueled a surge in infections that has risen to more than 400,000 daily.
Although it reported a decline in new coronavirus cases on Monday, World Health Organization Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan was quoted as saying in the Hindu newspaper that “there are still many parts of the country which have not yet experienced the peak.”
Adding to this, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have both announced new restrictive measures as they try to combat new outbreaks, sparking fears the Indian strain was spreading throughout Asia and resulting in gains for the greenback.
However, these advances have been small as traders wait for Wednesday’s release of the minutes from April’s Federal Reserve meeting, particularly in the wake of the data surprise on inflation last week.
“While surging prices are a clear world-wide phenomenon and we agree that the Fed will have to hike earlier than it currently indicates (possibly in Q1 2023 rather than in 2024 as the Fed currently forecasts) an imminent tightening from the Fed seems unlikely,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
“This means that in the coming months, the prime USD drivers should be deeply negative front-end real rates and the rebounding global economy.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4396 after economic data showed China's industrial output had slowed and retail sales missed forecasts last month.
USD/HUF fell 0.2% to 291.50 and EUR/HUF dropped 0.2% to 354.03, with the forint climbing to 17-month highs after Barnabas Virag, the deputy governor of Hungary's central bank, said Monday the central bank will adjust short-term rates proactively to tackle rising inflation risks as the country’s economy fully reopens from June.
This is part of a general theme in central and eastern European central banks, as they fret about rising inflation levels and the need to protect their currencies.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia over worries triggered by fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in some Asian countries. However, investors are heavily positioning for a fall in the U.S. currency as the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks to its current dovish policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 90.373 by 1:08 ET (5:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 109.36.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.7753, with the Reserve Bank of Australia due to release the minutes from its latest meeting on Tuesday. The NZD/USD pair fell 0.52% to 0.7216.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.4384. Chinese industrial production growth slowed down to 9.8% year-on-year in April, according to data released earlier in the day.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 1.4090. However, the pound was near a two-and-a-half-month high as the U.K. reopens its economy after a four-month lockdown.
The greenback was boosted by easing commodity prices and the COVID-19 outbreaks in Singapore and Taiwan, where there were a record 206 new cases, with both countries tightening restrictive measures. Singaporean primary, secondary, junior college and Millennia Institute students shifted to full home-based learning from May 19 till the end of the school term on May 28.
However, a bounce from higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data released during the previous week faded over mounting investor expectations that the Fed will keep interest rates low.
Investors are also looking to the Fed’s minutes from its April meeting, due to be released on Wednesday, for further clues on the central bank’s next steps.
""We expect the minutes ... to reiterate that policymakers consider the pickup in inflation to be transitory,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist Kim Mundy told Reuters.
""The upshot is that we do not expect the (Fed) to consider tapering its asset purchases soon,"" she said. ""The dollar is expected to resume its downtrend this week after last week's CPI-inspired boost,” Mundy added.
Investors increased bets against the dollar during the previous week, mostly turning towards the euro and pound to a lesser extent, as Europe and the U.K. continue their path towards economic recovery.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin last traded 4.85% weaker at $44,191 after hitting its lowest since February on Sunday. Ether was 4.96% lower at $3,362.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, taking a breather after the week’s gains, as traders digest the latest inflation data and the potential impact on Federal Reserve policy.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.532, but still around 0.5% higher so far this week. 
EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2109, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.4068, and USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 109.39. Additionally, AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7744, while NZD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7192.
Thursday saw the release of factory gate price data in the U.S., with the producer price index rising 0.6% in April after surging 1.0% in March. The annual figure shot up 6.2%, the biggest year-on-year rise since the series was revamped in 2010 and followed a 4.2% jump in March. 
This strong data adds to Wednesday’s stunning jump in consumer prices, suggesting inflationary pressure is building up in the United States as vaccine rollouts prompt a reopening of an economy bursting at the seams with stimulus.
That said, Federal Reserve officials have been at pains to point out that they had expected a spike in inflation and that it would prove to be temporary, the latest being Fed Governor Christopher Waller.
“The factors putting upward pressure on inflation are temporary, and an accommodative monetary policy continues to have an important role to play in supporting the recovery,” Waller told a virtual event Thursday. “We will not overreact to temporary overshoots of inflation.”
Benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury yields failed to rise to any great degree after the PPI data, and now trade around 1.65%.
“Although we are likely to see blockbuster growth in the second half of the year, economic growth will likely slow next year, to strong but less impressive growth rates,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note. “Overall, we do not expect sustained high inflation over the coming years, but it is certainly the risk to watch.”
For today, the focus will be on U.S. retail sales for April, which should remain strong after the impressive 9.7% rise in March, as well as industrial production numbers and consumer sentiment for May."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, set to post a weekly gain. Investors are now beginning to assess the risk that U.S. inflation will rise faster and prompt central bank interest rate hikes sooner than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 90.755 by 11:23 PM ET (3:23 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.14% to 109.61.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7724 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7174.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.08% to 6.4457 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 1.4040.
Investors digested even more economic data after inflation data, including the core Consumer Price Index, was higher than expected.
U.S. producer prices released on Wednesday were also higher than expected, with the Producer Price Index growing 0.6% month-on-month and 6.2% year-on-year in April.
Further data, including those for retail sales, are due later in the day.
Meanwhile, the number of initial jobless claims for the week fell to a 14-month low of 473,000.
All the data points to a buildup of inflationary pressure in the U.S., as a strong COVID-19 vaccination program allows for the resumption of economic activity.
The data did, however, fail to budge the U.S. Federal Reserve from its current dovish monetary policy. A slew of officials from the central bank, the latest being Fed Governor Christopher Waller, reiterated that the spike in inflation will be temporary.
But the Fed’s assurance was not enough to calm some investors’ concerns.
""Inflation will remain a big theme for markets in the coming few months. The Fed says it will be transitory, but markets are asking 'what if it turns out not to be transitory,"" Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
The data also failed to spark a renewed uptick in Treasury yields with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield sliding to 1.651%. Some investors accredited the move to the market already pricing in a degree of inflation worries.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded near two-and-a-half month lows as investors continue to digest Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the company would not accept the digital currency as a method of payment due to environmental concerns.
Meanwhile, fellow cryptocurrency dogecoin moved in the opposite direction, jumping as much as 20% after Musk said that he was involved in efforts to improve the token's transaction efficiency.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held steady near week highs on Thursday after the U.S. Labor Department reported higher producer prices in April, further evidence that inflation is rising in the United States.
The producer price index rose 0.6% in April after surging 1.0% in March. In the 12 months through April, the PPI shot up 6.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since the series was revamped in 2010 and followed a 4.2% jump in March.
Thursday's report follows data on Wednesday showing consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April.
""The hotter-than-expected April U.S. PPI report did not have the impact Wednesday's huge CPI gains had on markets,"" said Ronald Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics in a report.
The dollar index was little changed on the day at 90.741.
The euro gained 0.05% to $1.2076. The greenback fell 0.26% to 109.48 Japanese yen.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday said he expects inflation to exceed the Fed's 2% target for the next two years, but said the Fed would not raise rates until it sees inflation above target for a long time, or excessively high inflation.
Getting people off the sidelines of the economy and into jobs has become a critical issue in keeping the U.S. recovery on track, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said Thursday. 
U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday that weak job growth and strong inflation in April had not changed the central bank's plan to maintain loose monetary policy.
While the surge in inflation is large enough that a full reversal in coming months does not seem likely, a single month of data is unlikely to prompt an immediate shift in the Fed's positioning, wrote Alan Ruskin, macro strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for risk appetite, was up 0.02% at $0.7726 versus the U.S. dollar, after its biggest daily drop since March on Wednesday.
Bitcoin was lower a day after plunging 17% when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk said his company would stop accepting the digital tokens as payment for its cars.

It was last down 1.47% at $48,632.
Bitcoin is still higher than where it was just before Tesla said on Feb. 8 that it had invested around $1.5 billion in bitcoin and would accept it for payment in the near future.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, with the safe haven currency supported by concerns of an earlier than expected Federal Reserve response to inflationary pressures in the wake of worryingly large jump in U.S. consumer prices.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.775, around its highest level in a week. 
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2075, after dropping around 0.6% the previous session, GBP/USD was flat at 1.4052, and USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 109.73, close to its strongest level in five weeks. AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7712, while NZD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7160, benefiting from further plans to open the New Zealand economy.
The main driver of these dollar gains has been the surge in U.S. inflation, and the concern this will force the Fed to move away from its ultra-easy monetary policies sooner than its current guidance suggests.
The consumer price index rose 4.2% in April from a year ago, according to data released on Wednesday, well above consensus forecasts for 3.6% and climbing to its highest rate since the eve of the 2008 financial crisis.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a five-week high above 1.70% overnight, increasing the appeal of dollar-denominated assets, but have since edged back down to 1.685%.
Fed speakers have been very keen to make clear that they expected a bounce in prices as last year's collapse in oil prices and a nascent economic recovery worked its way through the system, but they saw this increase as temporary.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Tuesday acknowledged the progress the U.S. economy had made, but said it’s still not time to ease back the throttle on policy. He speaks again later Thursday, and the market will be waiting to see whether the CPI number changes his tune at all.
The dollar gains in the foreign exchange markets have been relatively limited, suggesting traders are taking the Fed largely at its word, at least for now. That said, they will turn their close attention to U.S. weekly jobless claims due later on Thursday and retail sales numbers on Friday for guidance on whether the upward pressure on prices will persist.
“From an FX perspective, a higher inflation reading is unlikely to be dollar-positive as long as the Fed sticks to its view ... that the spike in prices should be temporary and there is no need to turn less accommodative,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
“With front-end rates capped and inflation jumping, the dollar is set to retain a deeply negative real rate, which should ultimately assist a bearish USD trend in the remainder of the year.”

337,"<span>May 12, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is in talks with China to expand cross-border testing of the digital yuan after the first phase proceeded smoothly, another step toward wider adoption of the currency.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority recently conducted tests with the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China, involving a bank designated by the mainland authority, as well as merchants and bank staff, the HKMA said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“We have tested the use of the related app, system connectivity and certain use cases such as cross-boundary purchases,” it said. “We are discussing and collaborating with the PBOC on the next phase of technical testing, including the feasibility of broadening and deepening the use of e-CNY for cross-boundary payments.”
How China Is Closing In on Its Own Digital Currency: QuickTake
The PBOC is well ahead of other major central banks in developing its own digital currency, seeking to replace cash and maintain control over a payments landscape that has become increasingly dominated by technology companies not regulated like banks.
China has been expanding trials in major cities like Shenzhen, with wider adoption planned for the Winter Olympics in Beijing next year. Cross-border use of the digital yuan would be an important step toward global adoption of the currency for financial transactions.
PBOC officials confirmed in April the central bank had conducted the cross-border tests with the HKMA.
The use of the digital yuan in Hong Kong could lead to a much faster and cheaper cross-border payment and clearing process, consultancy Oliver Wyman said in a report released Wednesday. It estimated that costs related to cross-border payments in the city are about $20 billion to $40 billion per year, the equivalent of as much as 11% of the city’s gross domestic product in 2020.
“If the payment infrastructure underpinning e-CNY were to roll out for cross-border payments at scale, we believe it can address a substantial portion of this cost base,” said Michael Ho, principal of financial services at Oliver Wyman and co-author of the report.
China could promote the digital yuan’s overseas use starting with the Greater Bay Area, a massive urban cluster that includes Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macau, the consultancy wrote in the report. It could also potentially use the digital yuan to settle oil contracts, given its growing influence as an oil buyer, and create an “e-CNY bubble” among countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, it said.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia as rising U.S. Treasury yields and a bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices accelerated fears about runaway inflation and lent support to the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 90.718 by 11:09 PM ET (3:09 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 109.66, rising above the 109 mark and with the dollar close to its strongest level against the yen in five weeks.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7728 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.7170.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.4535 while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.4064.
The dollar also held onto its 0.6% gain against the euro from the previous session, trading at $1.2083 earlier in the Asian session. The greenback also climbed to 0.9083 against the Swiss franc, near a one-week high.
U.S inflation data released on Wednesday said that consumer prices rose to their highest level in 12 years, with the increasing demand as the economy continues to re-open pushing against supply constraints.
The Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.9% month-on-month in April, higher than the 0.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. The CPI rose 0.8% month-on-month and 4.2% year-on-year.
""The move in the dollar was fueled by the upward surprise in consumer prices, but also because the market was caught on the short side,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) foreign exchange strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
The dollar could continue its upward trend as investors unwind their bearish bets on the currency. This would reposition it for a period of more sustained inflation as more and more countries continue their economic recovery from COVID-19.
""This market is aware of the potential for further upside surprises to inflation. This will support the dollar,” Barclay’s Kadota added.
Investors now await the producer price index and initial jobless claims data for April, both due later in the day. Further data on consumer prices, including retail sales, is due on Friday.
Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a five-week high of 1.7040% after an auction for the notes on Wednesday saw strong demand.
According to other investors, signs of a recovering labor market and increased consumer spending could lead to a buildup of inflationary pressure that could push yields and the dollar even higher.
Bitcoin continued a tumble triggered by a tweet from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. CEO Elon Musk on the cryptocurrency front. The tweet said that Tesla has suspended the use of bitcoin to pay for vehicles over environmental concerns. It also added that Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar was higher on Wednesday, though well within recent ranges, after inflation data showed a surge in consumer prices in April.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rivals, was last up 0.61% on the day to 90.760. But the move on Wednesday was relatively muted despite the big jump in April inflation - up 4.2% year over year, the fastest rise since 2008. 
Rising prices typically strengthen the dollar because the market believes the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to quell inflation. But the reaction in the currency market was fairly contained because Fed Chair Jerome Powell has pledged to keep rates anchored while also allowing inflation to run higher for a period.
""It's not a huge move. The dollar has basically been weakening since May of last year, ever since the pandemic. The move today only puts us back to where we were a few weeks ago,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives, Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Still, interest rate expectations have been pulled forward slightly - the eurodollar is now fully pricing in a Fed hike between March and June of 2023. There is an 80% chance of a hike in December 2022. 
The Labor Department report on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected as booming demand in the reopening economy pushed against supply constraints. The consumer price index jumped 0.8% last month versus the 0.2% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The Fed has argued that while inflation is rising, it is likely temporary and will dip again by the end of the year.
""A lot of this near-term inflation is the result of all sorts of strange anomalies that have been created by the pandemic,"" said Frederick. 
Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities, said that in addition to base-year effects, which Issa believes will peak in May, ""The surge in prices you see in the CPI report are also a reflection of reopening pressures. Those should be transitory in nature. The old adage of - one data point doesn't make a trend - applies here."" 

The rising dollar left the euro 0.60% weaker at $1.208. The single currency on Tuesday had hit a 2-1/2 month high. The Japanese yen was 0.87% weaker on the day at 109.58 and the British pound was down 0.60% to $1.406.
In the digital space, cryptocurrency ether (ETH=BTSP) was last down 2.72%, having backed off a record level of $4,380.64 set earlier in the day.

Investing.com - The dollar jumped Wednesday, riding the sharp upswing in U.S. bond yields following a red-hot inflation report for April that could continue as Federal Reserve members downplay growing price pressures.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, added 0.64% to 90.70.
The Labor Department said Wednesday its consumer price index  rose 0.8% in April, and 4.2% year-on-year, the fastest pace since 2008. Excluding food and energy, core CPI increased 0.9% in April.
U.S. bond yields jumped sharply higher following the report, with 10-year yields rising to nearly 1.68% its highest in two-weeks. The 10-year Treasury yields did ease slightly from highs, however, following a strong auction that showed investors demand for the note remains well supported.
As the economy continues to reopening, pricing pressure from the service side will likely add to the rapid pace of inflation.
Hotel prices rose by 7.7% month-on-month in April and airfares rose 10.2%, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
But in the wake of the hottest monthly inflation number since 2012, Federal Reserve officials continue to downplay the risk of a sustained pace of pricing pressure, arguing that some the factors behind the move higher are transitory.
""Readings on inflation on a year-over-year basis have recently increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating later this year,"" Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said Wednesday. ""I expect inflation to return to -- or perhaps run somewhat above -- our 2% longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023.""
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic echoed the Fed vice chairman's comments, insisting it was ""too soon"" to judge whether the surge in inflation is a worrying trend.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, but remains near recent lows ahead of a key U.S. inflation release. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 90.287, just above Tuesday’s low of 90.130, seen for the first time since Feb. 26. 
EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2127, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 108.83, while AUD/USD fell 0.5% to 0.7804 and NZD/USD dropped 0.6% to 0.7234, with the commodity currencies cooling off after recording recent ten-week tops.
Investors now await the latest U.S. consumer inflation data, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show a 3.6% lift in year-on-year prices, boosted by last April's low base. This would be the largest jump since September 2011.
While equity markets have started to fret about what a high inflation number could mean in terms of Federal Reserve policy going forward, currency traders seem to have been calmed by repeated promises of patience from Fed speakers as the dollar remains at low levels.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Tuesday he expects inflation could stay as high as 2.5% next year, while Fed Governor Lael Brainard said weak labour data last week shows the recovery has a long way to run.
“The periods of dollar consolidation should be short-lived and shallow, and the expected spike in U.S. CPI close to 4% YoY … should weigh on USD (as it will further depress the U.S. real rate),” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Adding to the idea of further dollar weakening, the latest CFTC data on speculative positioning provided clear indications that bearish sentiment towards the greenback is strengthening again.
“All G10 currencies except sterling saw a net increase in speculative positioning against the U.S. dollar in the week ending 4 May, a sign that USD bearish sentiment is rising again,” added ING. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.4129, after the U.K. economy contracted 1.5% in the first quarter of the year, in line with the Bank of England's latest forecast.
That said, sterling has shown strength over the last few days, helped by political risk being factored out, while the country starts a widespread reopening.
“The post Scottish election GBP rebound was fully justified and with the UK economy on the clear reopening path, more gains are ahead for the pound this quarter,” ING added.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, but remained near its lowest levels of 2021, as investors increased bets that U.S. inflation data will not change the U.S. Federal Reserve’s current dovish monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.23% to 90.332 by 11:37 PM ET (3:37 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.21% to 108.84.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.49% to 0.7802, with investors continuing to digest Australia’s big-spending budget, which was handed down on Tuesday. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.51% to 0.7237.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.15% to 6.4383. Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 1.4114, remaining above the 1.4 mark.
The dollar fell to its lowest level in two months against the euro during the previous session, as Tuesday's Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung Economic Sentiment Index read a better-than-expected 84.
Worries that higher U.S. inflation numbers could pressure the Fed to hike interest rates sooner than expected drove a selloff in rate-sensitive tech stocks earlier in the week. However, repeated assurances from Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have seemingly soothed market worries.
""As long as the equity market doesn't experience a more drastic correction, the dollar is unlikely to get a safe-haven bid,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
""We know now that the Fed is very much firmly committed to easy policy... everybody else has come out firmly saying it's not the time...and that's a dollar negative story,” he added.
Comments made by several Fed officials during the week neutralized Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan's mention of tapering support in April.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Tuesday he expects inflation could stay as high as 2.5% next year, while Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the previous week’s weak employment data, including non-farm payrolls, is an indication that the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 still has a long way to go.
""Remaining patient through the transitory surge associated with reopening will help ensure that the underlying economic momentum that will be needed to reach our goals as some current tailwinds shift to headwinds is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions,"" Brainard added.
The recent surge in commodities that drove gains in commodity-linked currencies also put pressure on the dollar. However, currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars cooled their gains just short of ten-week highs. The Canadian dollar was also just below Tuesday’s almost four-year high.
An improving outlook for global growth that is diverting investors’ cash to emerging markets, alongside a large and growing deficit in both U.S. trade and the current account sending dollars overseas, also capped gains for the greenback."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar hit a 2-1/2-month low early in the New York session, then stabilized around those levels on Tuesday afternoon, the eve of U.S. consumer price data, as investors bet that rising inflation could erode the currency's value. 
In recent years, rising inflation expectations have helped the dollar because investors assumed the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates in response to higher prices. That is no longer the case. 
A disappointing employment report last week triggered a widespread selloff in the greenback. And though surging commodity prices have raised concerns of higher inflation, markets believe the Fed will keep its commitment to low rates and hefty asset purchases. 
""People are fearful that the Fed means what they say. And what they're saying is - we're not going to raise rates, but also we're going to let inflation run,"" said Andy Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities.
Against a basket of its major rivals, the dollar dropped as low as 89.979, its lowest since Feb. 25, and was last down 0.11% at 90.138. 
""Even if we see a print above expectations tomorrow, the likelihood of a robust dollar rally is very much lessened by the fact that far fewer market participants expect the Fed to react to that number in any way,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN). 
The dollar index's dip under 90 - the first time it fallen below that level since Feb. 25 - appeared to have prompted some investors to cover short dollar positions as major currencies subsequently pulled back, said a note from Action Economics. 
Resource-oriented currencies, including the Canadian dollar, consolidated gains as a rally in commodity prices boosted their appeal. The loonie hit a 3-1/2 year high and was last 0.08% higher at C$1.209. 
""The economy is performing quite strongly, so that is supporting expectations for the Bank of Canada to hike ahead of the Fed,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments.
""Friday's (U.S.) employment data helped entrench the interest-rate differential between the two currencies, so that's lifting it. But the biggest impact by far is the rise in base metal prices.""

The euro hit a 2-1/2-month high during the session and was last up 0.21% at $1.215. 
In cryptocurrencies, ether dipped from record levels hit on Monday, but remained up 2.60% on the day to $4,057. The second-biggest digital token has rallied roughly 46% so far in May.

Investing.com - The pound held the bulk of its gains Tuesday after jumping to a 10-week high against dollar, riding a wave of post-election optimism amid fading worries over a Scottish referendum on whether to leave the U.K.
GBP/USD rose 0.19%, to $1.4146. 
""[T]here won't be a (legal) referendum on Scottish independence anytime soon,"" Action Economics said, after the Scottish National Party fell short of gaining an overall majority following the national election last week.
""It should be noted that polling suggests that most people in Scotland don't want a new referendum on independence and that only 36% think the SNP has a mandate for a referendum versus 46% who don't,"" it added.
But results of the election were not only a positive for those opposed to another Scottish referendum, as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party firmed up their support in the local elections.
With the risk of a ""Scoxit,"" in the rearview mirror, the pound will likely continue to be supported by signs of recovery as the U.K. continues to ease Covid-19 restrictions.
""The market shows its relief and the positive sentiment caused by the slow opening of the British economy and society is also supporting sterling,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.  
Traders will get a sense of the pace of the U.K. recovery on Wednesday, with the release of the first-quarter GDP data.
But with first-quarter GDP expected to fall 6.1% year-on-year and 1.6% for the quarter, this ""might provide a dampener to this optimism and to sterling though,"" Commerzbank added.
""Of course it constitutes a backward glance but it illustrates nonetheless how hard the economy was hit by the strict lockdown and that a lot of catching up is still required."""

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, but gains were capped by the strength of commodity currencies on the back of rises in the prices of oil and base metals.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.245, after dipping as low as 90.130 for the first time since Feb. 26. 
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2140, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 108.91, while GBP/USD was largely flat at 1.4116, close to its strongest since Feb. 25 as Britain reopens its economy.
Looking at the main commodity currencies, USD/CAD traded at 1.2096, close to its weakest in more than three years. AUD/USD gained 0.1% to 0.7833, near an 11-week high, while NZD/USD was quoted at 0.7269, which is near its strongest level since late February.
“The greatest takeaway from Friday's soft U.S. jobs report for the FX market was that it bought more time for the Fed to be patient in withdrawing loose policy,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This comes at a time when commodity prices continue to surge (iron ore up another 9% overnight) and the market's conviction on higher prices is growing.”
Investors now await the latest inflation data from the U.S. on Wednesday, which are expected to show a sharp rise as the prices for commodities including crude oil, copper and steel soar, as well as a series of Treasury auctions during the week. 
“Assuming these can pass without doing too much damage to the U.S. bond market, the dollar should continue its run lower through May,” ING added.
That said, many investors expect commodities demand to surge as coronavirus vaccinations allow more countries to resume normal economic activity, increasing inflationary pressures as supply constraints suggest prices could remain elevated for an extended period.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 6.4304, after China’s consumer inflation data just missed expectations, with CPI contracting 0.3% month-on-month in April but growing 0.9% year-on-year. Factory prices, on the other hand, rose at the fastest rate in three and a half years in April, with PPI growing a better-than-expected 6.8% year-on-year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, but gains were capped by expectations that already-surging commodity prices will rise further.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 90.237 by 11:53 PM ET (3:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 108.89. Data released earlier in the day in Japan said that March’s household spending grew at a better-than-expected 7.2% month-on-month. Spending grew 6.2% year-on-year, the biggest gain since September 2019 and the first growth in four months.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7833 ahead of Australia’s federal budget, due to be handed down later in the day. The NZD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7264.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.18% to 6.4270. China’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) just missed expectations, contracting 0.3% month-on-month but grew 0.9% year-on-year. The Producer Price Index (PPI) grew a better-than-expected 6.8% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.4118, passing the 1.4-mark.
Investors now await inflation data from the U.S., including core CPI, that will be released on Wednesday. The data will gauge the level of inflationary pressure and could push Treasury yields up, potentially giving the greenback a boost, according to some investors.
Prices for commodities including crude oil, copper and steel are expected to rise further, increasing concerns about runaway inflation. Treasuries and the dollar have alternated between gains and losses as investor expectations on when the U.S. Federal Reserve will start moving away from its current dovish policy vacillate.
A slew of Fed officials will also speak throughout the week, including Governor Lael Brainard later in the day. Across the Atlantic, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will speak on Wednesday.
""Right now, the easiest reflation trade is to watch commodity prices and buy commodity currencies... the markets have doubts about the Fed's benign view of inflation, but uncertainty about policy keeps some currency pairs in a tight range,"" Daiwa Securities foreign exchange strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Against other currencies, the dollar was trading at C$1.2097 against its Canadian counterpart, the greenback’s weakest level in more than three years. It was also near a two-week low against the Mexican peso.
Demand for commodities is expected to continue growing as COVID-19 vaccinations improve the economic outlook in more countries. Additionally, supply constraints for some commodities could mean inflated prices in the short term, giving commodity-linked currencies a further boost.
In cryptocurrencies, ether traded at $3,906, slightly down from its recent record high of $4,200. Bitcoin also fell slightly to $55,578."

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's sol currency on Monday posted its biggest daily gain in just over five years after opinion polls showed the gap closing between socialist front-runner Pedro Castillo and the right-wing Keiko Fujimori ahead of June 6 presidential elections.
Two new polls released Sunday and Monday showed Castillo, a little known schoolteacher from rural Peru, had lost almost his entire lead over Fujimori, a three-time contender for the presidency.
The sol closed up 2.36%, its strongest daily performance since April 2016.
Castillo's surprise appearance on the ballot had rattled many investors and miners, cautious of a sharp left turn in the world's No. 2 copper producer, which will be electing its fifth president in the past five years after a constitutional crisis last year.
The recent polls appeared to assuage some of their concerns. A survey from Peru's Company for Market Studies and Public Opinion (CPI) found Castillo's lead had shrunk to just 2.2 percentage points, compared to a 12.4 percentage point gap in the group's previous poll. The poll of 1,600 people was conducted between May 6-8, with a margin of error of 2.5%. 
Another poll, published Sunday by the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP) put the gap between the two candidates at 6.2 percentage points, versus 20 points two weeks ago. 
On Friday, the international Datum reported that the advantage was five percentage points.

Castillo, who has pledged to redraft Peru's constitution to give the state a more dominant role in the economy, has recently moved to moderate his stance in some areas to help win over centrist and center-left voters.
But Fujimori, the scion of a powerful political family whose father is an ex-president now in prison for corruption and human rights abuses, has ratcheted up her criticism of Castillo as a left-wing extremist who could jeopardize the Andean's nation's economic progress in recent years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar languished at around 2-1/2 month lows on Monday as investors bet that rising inflation would erode the currency's value as the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains its loose monetary policy. 
The five-year breakeven inflation rate - which measures expectations of inflation five years out - reached its highest since April 2011 on Monday. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate - a measure of expectations of inflation in 10 years time - rose to its highest since March 2013. 
A weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday helped persuade market participants that the Fed would keep rates low and continue purchasing assets, even if inflation rises. The United States created a little more than a quarter of the jobs that economists had forecast last month and the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher.
""I think the biggest problem for the dollar right now is what's happening to real yields, which continue to tumble. We're seeing inflation breakevens continue to push higher,"" said Daniel Katzive, head of foreign exchange strategy North America at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). ""This is creating a lot of vulnerability for the dollar.""
In recent years, rising inflation expectations have helped the dollar because investors have assumed interest rates would be raised in response to higher prices.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, was last at 90.205, up 0.06% on the day, having earlier hit its lowest since Feb. 25. 
The market this week will be focused on U.S. consumer price data reported Wednesday as well as retail sales on Friday. Wednesday's CPI data will show the state of inflation today, and while that may have some effect on the market, the higher breakeven rates seen Monday reflect broader bets that inflation will rise in the next several years.
""The Fed will let inflation run hot into 2023. I would be so shocked if the Fed hiked interest rates in 2022,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets. 
The British pound was the biggest gainer among the G10 currencies, rallying as high as $1.416, the highest since Feb. 25. It was last up 1.02% at $1.413. This was despite Scotland's leader saying that another referendum on independence is inevitable after her party's resounding election victory.

Also benefiting was the Canadian dollar, which was 0.36% stronger on the day to $1.209, the highest since September 2017. 
In cryptocurrencies, ether extended this month's record run, surging to an unprecedented $4,148.88. The second-biggest digital token has rallied 41% so far in May and was up 4.52% on Monday.

349,"<span>May 10, 2021 03:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s onshore yuan advanced to its strongest level since 2018 amid signs that the nation’s economy is pulling ahead of others.
The currency rose as much as 0.2% to 6.4403 a dollar, the strongest since June 2018, after breaching its previous year-to-date high of 6.4245 touched in January. The move came after the greenback slid on weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data on Friday.
China’s currency began a rebound in April, along with other emerging market peers, as Treasury yields decline. The yuan is the second-best performing currency in Asia this year as its economy rebounded quicker than others from the pandemic and the nation’s monetary policy starts to show signs of normalization.
“The yuan will continue to strengthen, as apart from a weaker dollar, the Chinese currency is also being supported by capital inflows and large trade surplus,” said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. “The PBOC will likely use the fixing to slow the gains but it won’t use direct intervention.”
The yuan also strengthened against a basket of its trading partners’ currencies. The CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan versus 24 peers, is close to the highest level since 2018.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Monday, continuing its weakness after falling to a two-month low on the back of Friday’s disappointing U.S.  jobs report, which pointed to the ultra-low interest rate policy staying in place for some time. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down less than 0.1% at 90.183, after dipping as low as 90.130 for the first time since Feb. 26. 
EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.2158, earlier touching the highest since Feb. 26 at 1.2177, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 108.84, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7857.
Friday’s U.S. employment report for April came in well below expectations, with nonfarm payrolls only rising by 266,000 during the month, after robust private payrolls data from the ADP and weekly initial claims numbers had lifted expectations to a one million-plus rise.
The sharply below-consensus release “likely relieved some pressure from the Fed to shift to a less dovish rhetoric. At the same time, the data-miss was not enough to severely dent the underlying recovery story, leaving the global risk sentiment broadly supported,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Attention will now switch this week to inflation data, although the mantra from Fed policymakers that the increase is due to temporary factors will carry extra weight following the jobs data.
Wednesday sees the release of consumer price index figures for April, with the CPI number seen rising 3.6% on the year, a sharp rise from March’s 2.6%, and considerably above the 2% level the Fed usually seeks to limit price rises to.
Several U.S. Federal Reserve officials, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and U.S. Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday, will also speak in the course of the week.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.7% to 1.4066, climbing to its highest level since late February, after the Scottish National Party failed to win an overall majority after Thursday’s vote for the Scottish parliament.
The SNP is pressing for another referendum on Scottish independence, but it fell one seat short of an outright majority, likely delaying any vote, even if one is granted, by years. 
The U.K. government has so far refused to grant Scotland permission to have a repeat of the 2014 referendum.
Also, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.4261, falling to its lowest level since 2018 in the wake of the U.S. payrolls release and ahead of Chinese inflation data due on Tuesday.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia but remained near a more than two-month low. Investors continue to assess the previous week’s disappointing U.S. employment report and its implications for monetary policy ahead of inflation data due later in the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 90.260 by 12:31 AM ET (4:31 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.24% to 108.87.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7845. Australian data released earlier in the day said that the National Australia Bank (NAB) Business Confidence Index rose to a better-than-expected 26 in April. However, retail sales grew 1.3% month-on-month in March, slightly below expectations.
The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7274.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.4301, ahead of Chinese inflation data due on Tuesday.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.35% to 1.4021. The pound continued above the 1.4-mark even after Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that another referendum on independence was inevitable after her Scottish National Party won a resounding victory in the previous week’s elections.
Friday’s U.S. employment report for April disappointed, with non-farm payrolls only rising by 266,000 during the month, well below the 978,000-rise in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. The unemployment rate also rose to a higher-than-expected 6.1% in April.
With expectations that the economic recovery from COVID-19 will lead to runaway inflation all but gone, investors now await inflation data, including the Core Consumer Price Index due later in the week.
Several U.S. Federal Reserve officials, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and U.S. Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday, will also speak throughout the week.
Some investors remained pessimistic as the dollar index dipped as low as 90.128 for the first time since Feb. 26.
""The dollar’s choppy downtrend can continue this week,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kim Mundy wrote in a client note.
The unexpected slow recovery in the U.S. labor market reinforces the FOMC's patient approach to monetary policy,"" while ""the improving global economic outlook is a medium-term weight on the dollar,"" the note added, predicting a break above $1.22 for the euro.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell to its lowest in more than two months on Friday after U.S. jobs data for April came in well below expectations, putting a damper on hopes that a roaring economic recovery would spur higher rates and light a fire under the greenback. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs last month after rising by 770,000 in March, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rise of 978,000 jobs.
""The number was so out of consensus, that I think the market expectation of super-high rates and a squeeze on inflation is going to go down by the wayside, and that obviously means more liquidity from the Fed,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management.
It also means U.S. interest rates will stay at ultra-low levels for quite a while and that is going to keep the pressure on the dollar, Schlossberg added.
The dollar was down 0.63% at 90.297 against a basket of major currencies, having dropped as low as 90.209, its lowest since Feb. 26, following the payrolls data.
The euro was up 0.75% against the greenback at $1.21555 and the British pound was up 0.73% at $1.3993.
""This is only one report, but this is changing many traders' thinking on how this recovery is unfolding,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at FX broker OANDA, in New York.
Elsewhere, China's exports unexpectedly accelerated in April and import growth hit a decade high, helping to push the yuan and Asian stocks higher.
China's yuan rose to a more than two-month high versus the dollar and was set for its longest weekly winning streak since September, helped by the strong trade data and softer dollar.
The MSCI emerging market currency index hit a record high of 1741.34 on Friday, lifted by gains in the Chinese yuan and the weaker greenback.
Emerging market currencies were also benefiting from the ""commodity supercycle"", said Simon Harvey, FX analyst at Monex Europe. 
Commodity-linked currencies were higher, with the exception of the Canadian dollar, which was near flat at 1.21505 to the U.S. dollar, following a worse-than-expected Canada jobs report for April due to a third wave of COVID-19 lockdowns. The loonie had surged on Thursday to its strongest in more than three years.
The Australian dollar was up 0.72% versus the U.S. dollar, at 0.7841. The Aussie has been supported by a strong rally in the prices of Australia's top export earner, iron ore.
""We expect the likes of AUD, CAD and NOK to remain well supported with the backdrop for positive optimism over global growth still quite favourable"", MUFG head of research Derek Halpenny wrote in a note, referring to the Australian and Canadian dollars and Norwegian crown.
In cryptocurrencies, ether rose 1.35% to $3,537.29, after hitting an all-time high on Thursday.
Bitcoin was up 2.98%, at $58,128.86.
Meme-based virtual currency Dogecoin, which began as a satirical critique of 2013's cryptocurrency frenzy, was up 4.49% at $0.6107, ahead of an appearance by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live this weekend. 

Musk's tweets about Dogecoin in the past have helped send the digital currency, which is up more than 14,000% this year alone, skyward.
""Post-SNL, some crypto traders could abandon short-term Dogecoin bets once it becomes clear that it is not skyrocketing to the moon or at the heavily eyed $1 level,"" said OANDA's Moya.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, under modest pressure ahead of the monthly U.S. employment report which is expected to firm up expectations of a strong economic recovery.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.905, near its lowest level this week. 
EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.2060, having gained 0.5% Thursday, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.16, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7766, while USD/CAD rose 0.2% to 1.2176, having fallen to a 3-1/2-year low of 1.2145 overnight, helped by the Bank of Canada's recent tapering of its asset purchases and its shift to more hawkish guidance. 
The greenback has traded in narrow ranges Friday, with traders focusing on the release of U.S. payrolls data, at 1230 GMT, which are expected to confirm the U.S. labor market is on a solid path towards recovery from the pandemic.
Economists polled by Investing.com earlier in the week expected, on average, 978,000 new U.S. jobs in April, after gains of 916,000 in March.
That said, expectations are likely even more elevated now after data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 500,000 last week for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began.
“The recent declines in jobless claims – as well as many surveys (NFIB's job openings at a record high) – suggest that payrolls growth is accelerating. We would thus lean towards positive surprises in coming months,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
While strong economic data could lead to more risk taking as traders’ confidence grows, it could also lead to higher Treasury yields, helping the dollar, as the market anticipates the Federal Reserve tightening its monetary policies sooner than previously expected.
However, for now, most traders seem to be prepared to take the Federal Reserve at its word that stimulus tapering will not be on the agenda any time soon.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3902, with sterling struggling to post any serious gains despite the Bank of England slowing the pace of its bond-purchasing program at its meeting Thursday.
Political uncertainty is capping any sterling gains as the Scots go to the polls, potentially triggering a battle between the Scottish National Party and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson over another independence vote.
That said, “regardless of the result, most don't expect an imminent vote on independence. Given a second referendum (if one happens) is probably years away, there's limited need for such a risk premia to be priced into sterling,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Also, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4623, just above a two-month low, after China’s trade data for April came in better than expected, with exports growing 32.3% year-on-year and imports growing 43.1% year-on-year.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, as positive U.S. economic data, and an improving outlook for the economic recovery from COVID-19, exerted pressure on the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.09% to 90.858 by 12:40 PM ET (4:40 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 109.06, with Japan’s April’s services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) coming in at a better-than-expected 49.5.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7775 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7230.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.01% to 6.4592, with the yuan near a two-month high. China also released positive data earlier in the day, with the Caixin Services PMI for April at a better-than-expected 56.3. April’s trade data was also better than expected, with exports growing 32.3% year-on-year, imports growing 43.1% year-on-year and the trade balance at $42.86 billion.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 1.3908. The U.K.’s Bank of England (BOE) kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.10% as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday. Although the central bank also slowed the pace of its trillion-dollar bond-purchasing program, the slowdown was widely expected and is not an indication that BOE will reverse stimulus measures.
However, uncertainties over the results of a Scottish election that could trigger a fresh independence capped gains for the pound.
In the U.S., the number of initial jobless claims fell to 498,000, the lowest since mid-March 2020 when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Investors now await April’s employment report, including non-farm payrolls, later in the day.
With the forecast likely to affirm the U.S.’ solid path towards recovery, runaway inflation concerns are also mounting. However, most U.S. Federal Reserve officials, Chairman Jerome Powell included, have maintained a dovish monetary policy so far and are expected to keep doing so.
""Markets are convinced that the Fed won't take action until the U.S. sees full employment. That means a positive environment for risk assets such as stocks,""  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Tokyo Branch Manager Bart Wakabayashi told Reuters.
""I often hear people say they are fine with the idea of selling the dollar. The question is becoming, what you should buy against the dollar?"" he added.
A possible answer is the Canadian dollar, which gained almost 1% during the previous session to a three-and-a-half-year high.
On the cryptocurrency front, ether hit a fresh record high of $3,610.04 and was last trading at $3,473.51. Bitcoin fetched $56,541, still within the $53,000 to $59,000 range that it has been stuck in during the past week."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real surged on Thursday to close at its highest in almost four months against the dollar, a day after the central bank struck a hawkish tone in its statement that accompanied a second aggressive hike in borrowing costs.
A clutch of major global banks published notes revising their outlook on Brazil's benchmark Selic rate, which they say is now likely to rise more quickly or more aggressively. 
The real rose around 1.5% on Thursday to 5.2776 per dollar, its strongest close since Jan. 14. Having traded as weak as 5.87 in March, the real is now down only 1.6% year-to-date.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) raised their 2021 year-end calls outright. Citi, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Rabobank kept their forecasts but now anticipate a faster pace of tightening.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it could revise its outlook next week.
The 75-basis-point rise in the Selic rate to 3.50% was flagged by policymakers and predicted by all 29 economists in a Reuters poll.
The tone of the accompanying statement was hawkish, notably that there was no firm commitment to a 'partial normalization' process and future moves ""could be adjusted to assure the achievement of the inflation target."" 
""We now think the (central bank) will have to go for a full normalization and hike rates to 6.5% in 2021 versus our earlier forecast of 5.0%,"" BNP Paribas economist Gustavo Arruda and his team wrote in a note on Thursday. 
""Taking into account the more challenging inflation environment, we now expect two hikes of 75bp in June and August and three hikes of 50bp in September, October and December,"" they said.
Economists at Morgan Stanley raised their 2021 Selic forecast to 5.50% from 5.00% and the 2022 forecast to 6.50% from 6.00%.

Mauricio Une at Rabobank maintained his forecast for a further 200 basis points of tightening this year, but now expects that to be delivered over three policy meetings instead of four.
Citi's Leonardo Porto said he will wait for more hard economic data and the policy meeting minutes for a clearer idea on how long Copom will stick with its 'partial normalization process', but ""we recognize the increasing risks of a higher interest rate.""

Investing.com – GBP/USD was little unchanged Thursday as investors continue to bet that the Bank of England will be in no rush to rein in easing monetary policy measures as inflation will likely run out of the steam next year.
The Bank of England left its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.1% on Thursday, but cut its weekly bond purchases to £3.4 billion from £4.4 billion in order to meet its unchanged £875 billion year-end target.
The tweak to its weekly bond purchases coincided with a significant rise in its outlook for the economy, which is now estimated to grow 7.25% this year, its fastest pace in more than 70 years.
The backdrop of the growing optimism on the economy, and the tapering of the weekly bond purchases, sparked some talk on whether the central bank would now move quickly to rein in monetary policy to stop the economy from overheating.
But the BoE was quick to stress that the slowing of its weekly bond purchases should not be viewed as a taper given that its £875 billion bond holding target remains intact.
Some economists agree.
""This shouldn't come as a huge surprise – the BoE expects its gilt holdings to reach £875bn by year-end and at the recent £4.4bn/week pace, they’d have reached this target months too early,"" said James Smith, Developed Markets Economist at ING.
The BOE also hiked up its inflation target, forecasting the consumer prices index to temporarily climb above its 2% target toward the year-end.
Like the Fed, the BoE believes the pace of inflation will run out of steam. This all but puts a lid on the central bank pivoting to a faster pace of the tightening.
""We doubt it [rate hike and tapering] will happen before 2023, partly because we think the inflation story will be less exciting in 2022, once some of the reopening-related price spikes have faded,"" Smith added.
Beyond monetary policy, meanwhile, politics could set the pound up for a tricky path ahead as traders await the outcome of Thursday's elections in Scotland.
If the Scottish Nationalist Party, or SNP, wins an overall majority in the elections, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has promised to demand a second referendum on independence.
If the SNP fails to secure an overall majority, it could seek a ""ruling coalition with pro-independence Green MSPs, rather than engaging with the new breakaway pro-independence Alba party of former SNP dissidents,"" Daiwa Capital Market said.
""Such a coalition would pressure the UK government to agree to a new referendum on Scottish independence, which opinion polls suggest now would find a majority in favour. In return, the UK government would likely insist that such a new plebiscite would have to wait at least until after the next UK general election, currently scheduled for 2024. A delay strategy, however, might only serve to fuel support for Scottish independence,"" it added."

New York (Reuters) -The dollar dipped on Thursday, hitting its lowest point in three days, as global market risk appetite improved and traders looked forward to the April jobs report due on Friday for direction.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 500,000 last week for the first since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago, data showed, signalling the labor market recovery entered a new phase amid a booming economy. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high, with financials and industrials rising following the jobless claims report. 
While the U.S. economy has been gaining steam on the back of massive government stimulus and an improving health situation, Federal Reserve speakers on Wednesday downplayed the risks of higher inflation. 
The U.S. dollar, which is regarded as a safehaven asset, declined against a basket of peer currencies and was last down 0.34% at 90.948.
""The outlook for the dollar by many right now that it’s going to be in the house of pain for quite some time,"" because for the most part, the markets are convinced that the Fed has Treasury yields under control, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at FX broker OANDA in New York. 
Investors were looking forward to the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday, with estimates of between 700,000 and more than 2 million jobs having been created in April.
If the number is north of 1.5 million, it could lead to a spike in Treasury yields that would provide some temporary support for the dollar, Moya said.
Elsewhere, the Bank of England said it would slow the pace of its bond-buying as it sharply increased its forecast for Britain's economic growth this year after its coronavirus slump, but it stressed it was not tightening monetary policy.
""They said they are going to reduce the weekly pace of purchases, but that's not a signal and so sterling has kind of gone up and down and done nothing at the end of the day,"" said Erik Bregar, director and head of FX strategy at the Exchange Bank of Canada.
The pound was last down 0.15% against the weaker dollar at $1.3890 .
The euro was up 0.44% versus the dollar at $1.2058, and up 0.54% against the pound, at 0.8678 pence per euro.
Investors were also paying attention to elections in Scotland that could herald a political showdown over a new independence referendum.
The Canadian dollar hit a three-and-a-half year high against the greenback, helped by oil price gains and the Bank of Canada's recent shift to more hawkish guidance.
""The Canadian dollar continues to have everything going for it fundamentally, technically, and if you look at intermarket correlations, so it’s been a tough trend to step in the way of,"" said Bregar.
In cryptocurrencies, ether, the world's second largest crypto currency after Bitcoin, hit a record high of $3,610.04.

Bitcoin declined 1.03% to $56,919.50.
The meme-based virtual currency Dogecoin soared on Wednesday to an all-time high, extending its 2021 rally to become the fourth-biggest digital coin.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is expected to give back some of its recent gains over the coming year as the Bank of Canada's more hawkish stance is offset by potential dialing back of the U.S. Federal Reserve's asset purchase program, a Reuters poll showed.
The median forecast of nearly 40 strategists in the May 3-5 poll was for the Canadian dollar to weaken 1% over the next three months to 1.24 per U.S. dollar, or 80.65 U.S. cents. It is then expected to trade at that same level in one year, compared to 1.23 seen in April's poll.
""We think a lot of good news is in the price of the CAD, so we look for a little bit of tactical softening,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York.
The loonie has climbed 3.7% since the start of the year, the biggest gain among G10 currencies. On Wednesday, it touched its strongest intraday level since February 2018 at 1.2252.
The currency has been bolstered by higher prices for commodities such as oil, one of Canada's major exports, and an improved outlook for the domestic economy as the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine gathers pace.
In addition, the Bank of Canada last month changed its guidance to show it could start raising its benchmark interest rate from a record low of 0.25% in late 2022. It also tapered its bond purchases, becoming the first major central bank to cut back on pandemic-era money-printing stimulus programs.
Analysts say the Federal Reserve could follow the BoC's lead.
""We think that the odds are increasing that the Fed will have to acknowledge the strength in the U.S. economy and hint at a taper in late summer/early fall,"" said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""This would lead to a re-pricing in U.S. interest rate expectations that would be expected to boost the USD as the timing for U.S. rate hikes is brought forward.""
The U.S. central bank's current guidance is to leave interest rates on hold until at least 2024.
Money markets expect two Bank of Canada rate hikes in 2022, as opposed to one from the Fed, reflecting the Canadian central bank's more hawkish guidance, but past tightening cycles show that faster liftoff for the BoC may not be sustained.

""Things are not moving in isolation,"" Issa said. ""At the end of the day, FX is a relative game.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, consolidating near a two-week high, ahead of a key U.S. jobs report, while traders also wait for a Bank of England policy decision.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.213, after rising as high as 91.436 in the previous session for the first time since April 19. 
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2014, near its key 1.20 pivot, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.25, consolidating after rallying as high as 109.69 on Monday, a level not seen since April 13, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7742, slipping after China halted an economic dialogue in the latest spat between the two trading partners. 
The greenback has edged higher over the past week, helped by U.S. economic data that has largely pointed to a rapid recovery from the pandemic, increasing the pressure on the Federal Reserve to move sooner than policymakers have so far suggested.
Data from the ADP Research Institute on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers in April added the most jobs in seven months. This has raised expectations ahead of the weekly initial claims data later Thursday, but more importantly the widely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday, with several forecasters predicting a one-million-plus increase in nonfarm payrolls.
So far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has argued the U.S. labor market is far short of where it needs to be to start talking of tapering asset purchases. And Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, widely seen as one of the Fed's more hawkish members, again played down the current spike in inflation in an interview on Wednesday,. telling Bloomberg that it is unlikely to last into 2022.
“Some good data in the U.S. may cast further doubt on the ability of the Fed to stick to its ultra-dovish stance and give some support to the dollar, especially against the low-yielders,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3910 with the Bank of England scheduled to meet later Thursday, and most economists expecting the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to keep rates and bond-buying targets unchanged, for now.
However, the central bank is also set to significantly upgrade its growth outlook as the country’s successful vaccination drive leads to a reasonably rapid reopening of the economy. This could help the pound as expectations grow that the bank’s next move will be to tighten monetary policy rather than provide fresh stimulus to the economy as the pandemic eases.
Also, USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 8.3252 ahead of the latest meeting of Turkey’s central bank, which is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 19% for a second meeting later Thursday.
Turkish inflation accelerated for a seventh month in April, spurred on by a weak lira and rising global energy prices, leaving little room for new central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu to maneuver given President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seeks lower borrowing costs.
Elsewhere, the Brazilian real is testing a four-month high after the country's central bank raised its key rate by 75 basis points to rein in inflation.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, remaining just below a two-week high ahead of a U.S. jobs report that could provide further clues on when the U.S. Federal Reserve will start scaling back its unprecedented stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 91.308 by 12:33 AM ET (4:33 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.16% to 109.36.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.25% to 0.7728 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7208.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.4799.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3899 ahead of the Bank of England handing down its policy decision later in the day. Some investors expect the central bank to begin tapering its bond-buying program on the back of a COVID-19 vaccination-driven economic recovery in the U.K.
Recently released, largely positive U.S. economic data has boosted the greenback from a one-month low over the past week. However, investors continue to wonder whether a rise in inflation could force the Fed to change its monetary policy earlier than predicted.
""The dollar is likely to continue to respond to the debate about whether or not the Fed’s view that inflation will be transitory is correct,"" Rabobank strategist Jane Foley said in a note.
With several forecasters predicting a one-million-plus increase in non-farm payrolls forming part of the employment record, ""the dollar may continue to find a good level of support in the near-term"" with the currency strengthening to $1.19 per euro over a one-month horizon, she added.
The euro hit the psychologically important $1.20 mark earlier in the day after dropping to $1.1986 during the previous session for the first time since Apr. 19.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has so far argued that the labor market is well short of where it needs to be in order to begin talking about tapering asset purchases, with the central bank not looking to raise its benchmark Fed funds rate through 2023.
Powell’s message was corroborated by other Fed officials, three of whom spoke on Wednesday alone. One of them, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, said although inflation will be temporarily distorted in spring 2021 as the U.S. economy works through imbalances caused by COVID-19, it will be short-lived and should not lead to a pullback in monetary policy.
The Fed’s comments follow U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comment on Tuesday that rate hikes could be necessary to stop the economy from overheating, although she issued a clarification later that day.
""Despite constant reassurances from Yellen and an array of Fed officials that the coming increase in inflation will prove 'transitory'... markets are evidently a bit more worried,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar eased off of its more than two-week high hit earlier on Wednesday as U.S. economic data came in a bit softer than expected and traders awaited a key jobs report at the end of the week. 
U.S. private payrolls rose by the most in seven months in April, ADP data showed on Wednesday, as companies boosted production to meet a surge in demand amid massive government spending and rising COVID-19 vaccinations. But the 742,000 private jobs created fell short of the 800,000 jobs expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
In the U.S. services industry, activity eased in April from a record level in March, likely due to shortages of inputs amid a burst of demand, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed. 
""That's certainly worrisome for U.S. dollar traders and holding them back from restoring long dollar positions ahead of non-farm payrolls,"" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management, said of the data. 
The median forecast for Friday's jobs report is for a rise of 978,000, but estimates stretch as high as 2.1 million.
""There is a good chance it will exceed 1 million, but as we look at some of the leading indicators for the economy, the recovery and the labor market, we are not seeing that outsized strength that everybody had anticipated and that's holding the dollar back,"" Lien said.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peer currencies, was last at 91.319 after rising as high as 91.436 earlier in the session, its highest since April 19. 
The earlier bounce was partly prompted by comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that rate hikes may be needed to stop the economy from overheating.
Yellen later downplayed their importance, but even the slightest mention of U.S. tightening has an outsized impact in markets that have become so dependent on monetary stimulus.
Three Fed officials spoke on Wednesday, with Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans saying that while he was more optimistic about U.S. economic growth than he was a few months ago, he expects monetary policy to stay super-easy for some time.
Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said inflation will be temporarily distorted this spring as the U.S. economy works through imbalances caused by the pandemic but the pressures should be short-lived and should not lead to a pullback in monetary policy.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said more progress will be needed in the job market before the Fed's conditions for reducing its extensive support will be met.
The Fed has said it will not raise its benchmark Fed funds rate through 2023, but the responsive part of the yield curve for commercial rates is out at 10 years or a little bit longer, said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXSTREET.COM.
""The Fed doesn't have to change its mind on the Fed funds rate. All it has to do is get out of the way when the credit market starts to take the 10-year back to 2%, which I think it will,"" Trevisani said. ""As long as the Treasury rates resume, they will take the dollar with them.""
The commodity-linked Canadian dollar hit a three-year high against the greenback, helped by higher crude prices and optimism over the global economic recovery.
The dollar gained 0.12% against the euro, to $1.1999, its lowest against the greenback in more than two weeks.

Trading was limited in the overnight session, with Japan and China on holiday, but the New Zealand dollar jumped 0.83% to $0.72080 on the back of stronger-than-expected jobs data. The Australian dollar ticked up 0.4% to $0.7742.

GBP/USD rose 0.19%, $1.3912.
The Bank of England is expected to hold rates steady at 0.10% and keep its monthly bond purchases steady on Thursday.
""With only one member of the MPC (the soon-to-depart Chief Economist Haldane) who might feasibly be considered a hawk, the MPC will probably not yet see the need to taper its Gilt purchases from its current pace of £4.2bn per week,"" Daiwa Capital said.
The BoE decision will also be accompanied by updated economic projections that will likely reflect the economic data that has ""largely been stronger than the MPC expected when the last projections were published in February,"" it added.
Beyond monetary policy action, the Scottish election is also likely to play a role in market direction for the pound.
Voters across Scotland will head to the polls in an election seen as a referendum on the country's independence from the U.K., dubbed ""Scoxit.""
If the Scottish Nationalist Party, or SNP, wins an overall majority in the elections, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has promised to demand a second referendum on independence.
Ahead of the vote, final opinion polls suggest the result is too close to call.

Regling, who runs the powerful European Stability Mechanism (ESM) fund with a firepower of 500 billion euros, said the EU should work harder on finishing its banking union and capital markets union to boost the euro's standing in the world.
""The economic weight of Europe will continue to shrink in the world because of our demographics, and because emerging markets like China will continue to catch up with the income levels of Europe and the United States,"" Regling said.
""That means our relative weight will shrink and therefore we should do everything to make our currency more accepted around the world.""
The euro was at the moment clearly the world's number two currency, he said, ""but if we don't watch out, the Chinese renminbi will become that"".
Regling noted that it was the Chinese government's political objective to become less dependent on the dollar. 

""There's really the risk that the Chinese renminbi might become the number two in the world, and I think our objective should be to move to a multi-polar currency system with about equal rates for dollar, euro, and renminbi,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher Wednesday, boosted by talk of higher U.S. higher interest rates while a selloff in tech stocks raised its safe haven appeal.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.4% at 91.308, pulling away from its recent two-month low of 90.422.
EUR/USD traded down 0.1% at 1.2007, heading back down to its key 1.20 pivot, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3893, as investors await the Bank of England policy decision on Thursday. USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.46, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7715.
This bounce in the dollar came in the wake of comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggesting rate hikes may be needed in the near future.
“It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat,” Yellen said at a virtual meeting Tuesday. “Even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy, it could cause some very modest increases in interest rates.”
Yellen later tried to row back on the significance of these remarks, but the mere mention of U.S. tightening spooked a market that has become so influenced by the Federal Reserve’s monetary stimulus.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped on Wall Street as investors dumped the giant tech stocks on concerns their valuations would be hit in a rising interest rates environment.
Investors are now looking to the ADP National Employment Report, due later in the day, and the April employment report, including non-farm payrolls, due on Friday. Additionally, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index is also due later Wednesday.
“The U.S. is now about to reap the growth rewards of the experimental policy mix of massive money printing and wide scaled fiscal stimulus,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “The US is likely to outperform all peers growth-wise this year, which over time usually leads to a stronger USD versus other currencies as a result of the side-effects of a stronger growth pace. “
The bank targets 1.15-1.16 in EUR/USD in the second half of the year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia as fears over U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments about hiking interest rates receded.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.31% to 91.210 by 13:03 AM ET (5:03 AM GMT).

The AUD/USD pair was up 0.35% to 0.7732. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.38% to 0.7169. The New Zealand dollar was boosted by stronger-than-expected local employment data, including the employment change that grew 0.6% quarter-on-quarter during the first quarter of 2021.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4735. The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 1.3906 as investors await the Bank of England policy decision that will be handed down on Thursday.
Trade was limited in Asia with the Japanese and Chinese markets closed for a holiday. A selloff in tech stocks overnight soured risk appetite and gave the safe-haven U.S. currency an additional boost.
A strengthening dollar pressured the euro into a $1.2012 fall and threatened to breach important chart support in the $1.1995 to 1.2000 range.
""If sustained, this could suggest today's session may be important for near-term direction, particularly if the EUR/USD pair managed to close below the key $1.20 pivot... we think we will need to see a daily close below the $1.20 mark to give more credence to observations that the dollar tends to appreciate broadly during the month of May,"" TD Securities European head of FX strategy Ned Rumpeltin told Reuters.
Rumpeltin also said that the dollar had averaged gains against each of its G10 counterparts in May over the last decade.
Yellen’s comments on Tuesday, suggesting that rising interest rates will be necessary to prevent the economy from overheating, also contributed to the dollar’s gains.
Yellen did clarify later that day that the comments were not predicting an imminent rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve, but the suggestion of a tightening monetary policy was enough to shake a market over-dependent on monetary stimulus.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also stated earlier in the week that the labor market is still far short of where it needs to be to start talking of tapering asset buying.

The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is also due later in the day.
One challenge that remains for the dollar is a U.S. trade deficit that widened to a record $74.4 billion in March.
""This is a medium-term weight on the dollar because the U.S. will become increasingly dependent on long-term foreign investments to finance the current account deficit... as a result, we believe the recent dollar downtrend has further to run,"" CBA senior economist & currency strategist Kim Mundy told Reuters."

Investing.com – The dollar climbed Tuesday, as investors mulled the potential of a sooner rather later rate hike after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said rates may need to rise to stop the economy from running too hot.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.38%, to 91.29.
""It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat,"" Yellen said Tuesday during an economic seminar presented by The Atlantic. ""Even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy, it could cause some very modest increases in interest rates.""
The move sent shockwaves throughout the market as it was only just a week ago that the Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave rates unchanged and indicated that it was in no rush to rein in loose monetary policy measures.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly batted away questions concerning inflation and the prospect of tapering bond purchases. The Fed chief has insisted that inflation pressures will prove transitory and flagged ""substantial progress"" on the economy as benchmark for the central bank to start thinking about tapering.
While the talk of the tightening monetary policy will not come as surprise to market participants ""it's who said it that matters and especially after she [Yellen dismissed inflation risk this past weekend,"" Scotia Economics said in a note. ""It’s highly unusual for a Treasury Secretary to comment on Fed policy and usually best avoided."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar extended gains on Tuesday, partially unwinding a month long decline as investors weighed chances that interest rates will be forced higher by a roaring U.S. economic recovery and awaited upcoming data and policy speeches for clues.
Tuesday's bounce nearly reversed losses sustained on Monday after a disappointing U.S. manufacturing survey report, leaving it 1% above a one-month low struck last week. 
Though April's headline survey numbers were lower than March, but the U.S. recovery remained firmly on track with price pressures rising, while the Federal Reserve appeared to be in no hurry to tighten.
Financial conditions are nowhere near the level where the Fed would consider pulling back its support, New York Fed Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on Monday, despite the economy being set to grow at the fastest rate in decades this year as it rebounds from the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists said U.S. data due for durable goods orders and non-farm payrolls will provide further evidence of the economic recovery.
""However, as the market expectations are a bit too optimistic according to our experts it might put pressure on the dollar despite principally positive results,"" they said.
The greenback advanced 0.6% versus the Antipodean currencies and 0.3% against the yen, euro and pound in trade thinned by holidays in China and Japan. 
The dollar index which measures the dollar's value against a basket of major rivals climbed 0.4% to 91.34, just shy of a near two-week high.
Elsewhere central bank meetings are in focus. The Australian dollar weakened as the country's central bank sharply upgraded forecasts for the local economy yet still predicted no tightening in its super-loose policy until at least 2024.
Sterling dipped marginally to $1.3870 ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday. Analysts reckon the bank might announce a slowdown in its bond buying programme as vaccinations have bolstered Britain's economy.

Elsewhere cryptocurrency ether powered to another record peak, this time nearing $3,500 as speculators drive white-hot crypto markets higher. It last sat at $3,313.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia as a surprise slowdown in U.S. manufacturing growth trimmed Investor bets on a booming U.S. economy giving the U.S. currency a boost.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.22% to 91.125 by 13:08 AM ET (5:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.21% to 109.28.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.7744 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.33% to 0.7174.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4735 while the GBP/USD pair was down 0.27% to 1.3872.
Japanese and Chinese markets remained closed for a holiday.
The U.S.’ Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released on Monday, was a lower-than-expected 60.7 for April. Shortages of basic materials and transport snarls contributed to the drop, which toppled the dollar from a three-week high against the yen and a two-week high on the euro.
The euro rose 0.3%, as investors digested economic data from the region. The German manufacturing PMI was 66.2 for April, while the Eurozone’s manufacturing PMI was 62.9.
Investors are now looking to further data to be released later in the week including the U.S. trade balance and the April U.S. employment report which includes non-farm payrolls.
Some investors suggested that strong figures might boost the dollar by bringing forward expectations for higher interest rates, while others argued that a strong U.S. economy would weigh on the greenback as imports gain and the trade deficit grows.
""The ISM manufacturing report did not live up to expectations but payrolls should be at least as strong as consensus expectations... the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish influential core won't have any of it, but expectations for solid U.S. data this week and likely more hawkish regional Fedspeak leave the dollar index positioned for more two-way price action,"" Westpac analysts said in a note.
Benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury yields fell 2.5 basis points overnight as the data disappointed, and as New York Fed President John Williams insisted that the economic recovery so far is ""not nearly enough"" to tighten monetary policy.
Investors also await policy decisions from Norges Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept its interest rate steady at 0.10% when it handed down its decision earlier in the day. Investors are also looking for clues on whether RBA will upgrade economic forecasts that are due on Friday. Meanwhile, the Bank of England could announce a slowdown of its bond purchases when it hands down its policy decision on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar levelled out after its recent bounce on Monday as investors made a cautious start to a week crammed with central bank meetings and big-ticket U.S. economic data, waiting for clues on the global inflation outlook and policymakers' responses.
Trade was thinned by holidays in Japan, China and Britain, which kept a lid on volatility, leaving the greenback to trade where it settled after a Friday leap. It held at $1.2040 per euro and crept to a three-week high of 109.66 yen.
The dollar index, measured against six major currencies, held at 91.210.
The index dropped 2% through April as a positive view of global recovery prospects lifted trade-exposed currencies at the dollar's expense, but bounced with upbeat U.S. consumption data on Friday. 
""We remain bearish USD linked to peak US exceptionalism, and a broadening global recovery elsewhere,"" said CitiFX analysts Ebrahim Rahbari and Calvin Tse in a note to clients.
""We attribute the USD rebound late last week in part to noise around month-end flows, but note the risk for higher US rates to change the FX trajectory. Meanwhile, BRL and CAD remain among the favourites, while JPY was held back by rising rates, and several EMs by idiosyncratic headwinds.""
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were marginally firmer on Monday, though not enough to recoup a dip suffered on Friday. [AUD/] 
The Aussie rose 0.1% $0.7718 to trade around its 20-day moving average, while the kiwi edged 0.2% higher to $0.7171, also just above its 20-day moving average. Sterling steadied at $1.3825. [GBP/]
The South Korean won hit a one-week low after North Korea vowed it would respond to what it regards as hostile U.S. policy, while pressure for a national lockdown in India pushed the rupee a little lower.

DATA DELUGE
Purchasing Managers Index figures for manufacturers were positive in Asia and Europe on Monday and those due later are expected to show growth picking up speed in the United States. However the week's major focus will be on U.S. manufacturing surveys due Wednesday and April labour market numbers on Friday.
Forecasts are that 978,000 jobs were created in the month. However analysts say the market response to a surprise either way may be hard to guess, as investors have begun to fret that strong data may prompt central bankers to taper their support.
""The risk is for a hotter number,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne.
""But will good numbers lead to a broad risk-off vibe, as traders' price in higher rate expectations, and the dollar rallies,"" he added. ""I suspect we're getting to a point where really good data could start to become bad for markets.""
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan caused a stir on Friday by calling for beginning the conversation about tapering, although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been clear that he is likely to be patient. 
Powell is due to speak later on Monday and will be followed by a raft of Fed officials this week. Central bank policy meetings are also scheduled this week in Australia, Britain and Norway.
In Australia, no policy changes are expected on Tuesday although traders will look to a speech by deputy Reserve Bank of Australia governor Guy Debelle on Thursday for insight into the bank's thinking around its bond purchases outlook.

Asset purchases are likewise the focus when the Bank of England meets on Thursday, as well as perhaps an upgrade of its economic outlook, while Norges Bank - which projects hiking rates this year - is expected to stick with its hawkish tone.

Investing.com -- The dollar was mainly flat in early trade in Europe on Monday, set for a quiet day of trading on a public holiday in the U.K., the region’s biggest forex trading hub.
The euro started the day on a positive note, after German retail sales for March turned out considerably higher than expected, up 7.7% on the month as the country briefly loosened its lockdown restrictions.  February’s data were also revised up to show a 2.7% gain instead of the 1.2% originally reported.
However, there is likely to be little momentum for the euro from the data, given that Europe’s largest economy already tightened its Covid-19 rules again in April.
By 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index was down less than 0.1% at 91.218, holding on to most of the gains it made on Friday thanks to the relative strength of the U.S. economy.
The euro was up 0.2% at $1.2041, while commodity currencies such as the Canadian and New Zealand dollars were both moderately lower after a strong bull run in recent weeks.
More timely data from the Eurozone are due later Monday in the shape of manufacturing purchasing manager indices. In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey will be published at 10 AM ET.
There was little global drama for markets to digest over the weekend. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told U.S. television that there was no inflationary impact from the government’s spending plans, as the new spending on families and on infrastructure will be spread out over years.
In emerging markets, the Indian rupee remained under pressure after the world’s sixth-largest economy posted another daily record for deaths from Covid-19. Various Indian states held elections at the weekend, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP party appears to have suffered a strong backlash against his poor handling of the crisis. The BJP fell well short of its goal of winning the state of West Bengal, home to 90 million people and the Kalkota metropolitan area.
The dollar was up 0.1% against the rupee at 74.17.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, making a cautious start to the week and the month of May. Investors will comb through a slew of central bank decisions and U.S. economic data, to be released throughout the week, for clues on the global inflation outlook and policymakers’ responses.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.07% to 91.330 by 12:29 AM ET (4:29 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.29% to 109.59.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7720. Data released earlier in the day in Australia said that April’s Australian Industry Group manufacturing index was at 61.7, higher than March’s 59.9 reading. The NZD/USD pair was up 0.22% to 0.7176.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4735 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3821.
Trading was thin in the Asian markets as the Chinese and Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
The riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars rose through April but dropped on Friday after strong U.S. consumption figures, including personal spending, boosted the greenback. Further U.S. data, including the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers index and non-farm payrolls for April, are due later in the week.
However, some investors were concerned that strong data could prompt central banks to taper asset purchases.
""The risk is for a hotter number... but will good numbers lead to a broad risk-off vibe, as traders' price in higher rate expectations, and the dollar rallies? I suspect we're getting to a point where really good data could start to become bad for markets,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan on Friday called for tapering conversations to begin directly against the Federal Reserve’s current dovish stance. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also due to speak later in the day, followed by other Fed policymakers later in the week.
Central banks in Australia, the U.K. and Norway will also hand down their policy decisions during the week.
Although the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to make no policy changes in its decision to be handed down on Tuesday, investors will look to a speech by deputy RBA governor Guy Debelle on Thursday for clues into the central bank’s bond purchases outlook.
Asset purchases will also be front and center when the Bank of England hands down its decision on Thursday. Norges Bank, which projected hiking rates in 2021, is widely expected to stick with its hawkish tone in its decision on the same day."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday, but remains near multi-week lows and was set for a fourth consecutive week of losses with the U.S. Federal Reserve retaining its dovish monetary policy even as the economy recovers. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.648, trading around levels last seen in late February.
The index is on course to end the week 0.2% lower, bringing its losses for April to 2.8%. A four-week losing streak would be the longest since the six-week slide to the end of July. In part that's because of the gains of commodity currencies, amid surging prices for both industrial and agricultural products. The dollar's biggest losses this week have been against the Canadian and New Zealand dollars.
EUR/USD traded down 0.1% at 1.2113, near the two-month high of 1.2150 set the previous session. GBP/USD was flat at 1.3942, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 108.77, just off the two-week high of 109.22 from Thursday. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7779, climbing back toward the six-week high of 0.7818 seen on Thursday.
This dollar weakness was helped by the decision of the Federal Reserve to leave its ultra easy monetary policies in place even while it acknowledged that there had been an improvement in the economic conditions, as typified by first-quarter GDP growth of 6.4%, released Thursday.
“With front-end U.S. real rates already deeply negative and set to fall further as U.S. CPI rises sharply this quarter, this is likely to be a USD negative, particularly when other parts of the world (namely Europe) are set to see an economic rebound in coming months,” said ING analysts, in a note.
Evidence of that coming rebound in Europe came with the release of the first-quarter French GDP figure earlier Friday, with output in the euro area’s second-largest economy growing 0.4% in the three months through March.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY was largely flat at 6.4706 despite China’s manufacturing activity accelerating at a slower-than-expected pace in April, with said the country’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index coming in at 51.1, lower than March’s 51.9 reading.
Staying in Asia, USD/KRW rose 0.4% to 1,111.85 after South Korea’s industrial output fell 0.8% on the month in March, shy of expectations for an increase of 0.1%.
Additionally, USD/TRY dropped 0.1% to 8.2093 after Turkey's central bank raised its year-end inflation forecast on Thursday to 12.2% from 9.4%, and its new governor said tight policy would be maintained until price pressures decline.
“While the Central Bank of Turkey sees the inflation rate peaking in April, the trajectory is relatively optimistic compared to current market expectations,” added ING."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but was set for a fourth consecutive week of losses, as the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks to its dovish monetary policy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 90.618 by 12:26 AM ET (4:26 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 108.81. Japanese data released earlier in the day said industrial production increased 2.2% month-on-month in March, while the Tokyo core Consumer Price Index contracted 0.2% year-on-year in April.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.24% to 0.7782, with Australia’s Producer Price Index rising 0.2% year-on-year, and 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, in the first quarter of 2021. The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.7253.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.4684. China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for April was 51.1, while the non-manufacturing PMI was 54.9. The Caixin manufacturing PMI for April was 51.9 and the Caixin services PMI is due in the following week.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.3951.
The dollar index (DXY) is set to end the week with a 0.2% loss, and a 2.8% loss for the month. The greenback’s losses were its Canadian counterpart’s gains, with the latter climbing to a more-than-three-year high against the U.S. dollar on Friday.
Investors are still digesting the Fed’s latest policy decision, handed down on Wednesday. Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the U.S. economy's growth, he added that there was not yet enough evidence of ""substantial further progress"" toward recovery to justify a change in policy.
Optimism that signs of economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, could force the Fed into tapering its asset purchases earlier than expected, drove DXY to a five-month high in March 2021.
""DXY may attempt a rebound in coming days as expectations turn to potentially blockbuster April payrolls next week, but gains will prove short-lived with Fed officials to underscore Powell’s resolutely dovish stance,"" Westpac strategists said in a note.
The gauge is likely to drop below 90 in the near term, from 90.6 currently, but the ""DXY's depreciation trend is likely more of an ongoing grind than a wholesale sharp setback,"" the note added.
Data released on Thursday said that the U.S. GDP rose 6.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2021 and 553,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week.
The Fed’s stance contrasts with that of its northern neighbor. The Bank of Canada has already begun tapering its asset purchases, and the commodity-linked Canadian dollar got a further boost from rising oil prices, which were at a six-week high.
The prices also boosted the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which are also linked to commodities.
In cryptocurrencies, ether was just below a record high of $2,800.89 set on Thursday, driven by media reports about the European Investment Bank's plans to launch a ""digital bond"" sale on the ethereum blockchain network."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar skidded toward a fourth straight weekly decline against a basket of major peers on Friday, as the Federal Reserve stuck to its message of ultra-low interest rates for longer.
The dollar index was on course to end the week 0.2% lower, bringing its losses for April to 2.8%. A four-week losing streak would be the longest since the six-week slide to the end of July, and the monthly loss would also be the biggest since July's 4% slump.
The Canadian dollar climbed to a more-than-three-year high of C$1.2273 per greenback on Friday, on track for a 1.7% weekly gain that would be its biggest since the start of November.
At the conclusion of the Fed's latest policy meeting on Wednesday, Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the U.S. economy's growth, but said there was not yet enough evidence of ""substantial further progress"" toward recovery to warrant a change to policy.
That growth accelerated in the first quarter, buoyed by government stimulus cheques, setting the course for what is expected to be the strongest performance this year in nearly four decades.
Signs that a strengthening economy, particularly in the labour market, might force the Fed into an earlier tapering of its asset-purchase programmed had pushed the dollar index, or DXY, to a five-month high at the end of March. 
""DXY may attempt a rebound in coming days as expectations turn to a potentially blockbuster April payrolls next week, but gains will prove short-lived with Fed officials to underscore Powell’s resolutely dovish stance,"" Westpac strategists wrote in a client note. 
The gauge is likely to drop below 90 in the near term, from 90.6 currently, but the ""DXY's depreciation trend is likely more of an ongoing grind than a wholesale sharp setback,"" they said. 
The Fed's dovishness was in marked contrast to the Bank of Canada, which has already begun to taper its asset purchases. Canada's commodity-linked loonie got additional support from a surge in oil prices to a six-week peak.
Higher commodity prices also supported the Australian dollar, which gained 0.2% to $0.77795, climbing back toward the six-week high of $0.78180 touched Thursday.
The euro has largely flat at $1.2122, near the two-month high of $1.2150 set the previous session. The shared currency is up 0.2% for the week and 3.3% for the month.
The yen saw opposite fortunes, hurt by a recovery in U.S. Treasury yields and a rally to record highs for global stocks that sapped demand for the safest assets.
Japan's currency changed hands at 108.86 per dollar, near the two-week low of 109.22 from Thursday, setting it up for a loss of about 1% for the week.
In cryptocurrencies, ether hovered just below a record high of $2,800.89 set on Thursday, after being lifted this week on media reports about the European Investment Bank's plans to launch a ""digital bond"" sale on the ethereum blockchain network.
Bigger rival bitcoin traded at $53,511.89, vacillating around that level this week after dipping as low as $47,004.20 on Sunday following a sharp retreat from the record high of $64,895.22 marked in the middle of the month.

Investing.com – GBP/USD eased from highs Thursday, but looks set for a third-straight weekly win underpinned strong recovery in the UK, but the Scottish elections next week pose a risk, analysts say.
GBP/USD rose 0.03% to $1.3937 and further advances will likely put resistance in focus, but dips will short-lived.
""[A]ttention is on key resistance, which remains 1.4018, the March high,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. ""Near term dips are expected to be shallow and an upside bias is preserved above the uptrend at 1.3707.""
The move higher in the pound has been supported by the easing of Covid-19 restrictions that has bolstered the UK's recovery. But voters across Scotland will head to the polls on May 6 that could lead to a referendum on independence that could spark a wobble in the GBP.
""If the Scottish Nationalist Party wins an overall majority in the 6 May Scottish elections, pressure for a referendum on independence will intensify, which could cause some GBP underperformance on the crosses,"" ANZ said in a note, according to FXStreet.
ANZ is forecasting GBP/USD rising to 1.46 by year-end, but large gains against the euro are likely to be hard to come by as the recovery in mainland Europe will gather pace as vaccine rollouts continue. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland for the last six years, needs to win a majority of 65 seats to bolster her call for a referendum.
Polls are pointing to pro-independence parties achieving a supermajority in Scotland's parliament.
But some see the UK Prime Minister rejecting any call from Scotland for a referendum.
""In such a scenario, Scotland would unilateral enact a referendum, which wouldn't be recognized as legal by the UK parliament in London, setting the scene for a stalemate scenario, similar to that been seen in the case of Catalonia versus Madrid,"" Action Economics said in a note."

LONDON (Reuters) - The pound, enjoying a period of calm after 4-1/2 years of Brexit-linked chaos, may suffer some turmoil if an election next week raises the chances of Scottish nationalists calling -- and winning -- a vote on independence from the United Kingdom.
Such a vote is unlikely for some time, and indeed the United Kingdom government says it will not permit one at all. But analysts reckon the chance of Scotland breaking away, while still small, is rising, and the pound will react if and when a referendum looks like a certainty.
""If a country accounting for 7.5% of the UK's GDP decides to go its own way, it matters for the market,"" Nomura foreign exchange analyst Jordan Rochester said. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to block another referendum after the last one in 2014 -- economists and analysts interviewed by Reuters mostly expect him to stick to that.
The SNP says if it wins a majority in the May 6 election for the devolved Scottish Parliament, the assembly would pass its own bill to hold a second referendum by end-2023. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) puts the chances of a successful independence bid at just 15%.
Citi, on the other hand, estimates a 35% probability of ""Scexit"" in the next 10 years -- too distant to immediately impact investor behaviour. Probabilities based on odds by online betting exchange Betfair show most punters do not expect an independence vote at least until after 2025.

Yet much depends on the size of any SNP victory on May 6. 
Should nationalists win 80-plus seats in the 129-seat parliament, a vote before 2024 becomes Citi's base case. It also warns that risks of more sterling volatility could grow in the coming months as Westminster and Holyrood tussle. 
The pound, after a strong start to 2021, has struggled to break above $1.40 this month. Implied volatility gauges -- measures of expected swings in the pound -- have dropped.
Versus the euro, sterling fell sharply in early April, erasing some gains after its strongest first quarter since 2015.

Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets, calls the elections a ""moderately important issue"", which may have caused some recent sterling weakness.
The consensus is ""there will be a second referendum at some point"" and that the Scottish government will find a way to have an advisory referendum if Johnson blocks a straightforward vote, he said.
WHAT IMPACT?
Scotland voted to remain within the UK by 55% to 45% in 2014, in a vote that was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision. 
The UK's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 has since strained ties, and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has seized on criticism over Boris Johnson's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to push for independence. In the Brexit referendum Scotland backed Remain by a 62% to 38% margin. 
Polling currently suggests around half of voters would opt for independence.
Despite Johnson's opposition, half the people polled recently by Ipsos MORI thought Scotland should be allowed another referendum on whether to leave the United Kingdom.
Pricing the timing of a referendum is only part of the puzzle for currency traders. Understanding the impact on the UK economy -- and the pound -- is another.
Sterling dived by ""ten big figures"" -- market parlance for ten cents -- against the dollar as the probability of a Scottish ""Yes"" vote surged in 2014, Citi analysts note
But ending the 300-year old union is unlikely to prove as economically damaging as Brexit or COVID-19.
Independence would lower national income between 4.3% and 6.7% in Scotland, but by just a few tenths of a percent in the rest of the UK, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research. Scotland may even suffer an exodus of companies -- NatWest for instance would move its headquarters, CEO Alison Rose said
A UK economy shorn of Scotland may even emerge stronger. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Allan Monks says declining North Sea oil revenues ""would probably leave Scotland with a larger fiscal deficit than the UK in the event of independence"".
Whether Scotland would take a share of the UK's 2 trillion pounds of public debt is another unknown.

""The reality is we won't know the economics of it for a good five years until after the event,"" UBS economist Dean Turner said. ""We had a four-year divorce from the EU. Let's just say that would be an optimistic time frame for the divorce with Scotland.""

378,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 08:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Analysts and investors say the Brazilian USD/BRL may have room to rise to its strongest level in almost a year as hopes of progress on reforms and early signs the pandemic’s new wave may be starting to ease fuel optimism.
The real has advanced 4.2% in the seven days through Wednesday, the most among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg and putting it on track for the first positive month this year.
Bulls say the rally could continue, taking the real to the 5 per dollar mark as surging commodity prices fuel a trade surplus result. The ongoing monetary tightening also supports further gains.
The currency recently breached the key 5.50 per dollar level and is now hovering around its 200-day moving average of 5.44, which has limited additional gains. Traders say a breach of that barrier would open room for an appreciation toward the 5-per dollar psychological level.
While Brazil is still one of the hardest-hit countries in the world, the daily number of Covid-19 cases and deaths has slightly decreased since reaching records in March, and ICU occupancy rates are starting to decline. The pace of vaccinations accelerated in April to an average of 765,000 per day from 470,000 in March, though it’s still short of the government’s goal of 1 million.
The relief on the pandemic front was key for the real’s rebound, said Luiz Fernando Figueiredo, the chief executive officer at Maua Capital in Sao Paulo and a former central bank director. He said the currency could appreciate to 5 per dollar if there are no negative surprises on the fiscal front.
Hopes that the government will move forward with its reform agenda after solving the budget gridlock are also fueling bullish bets. Brazil’s house speaker Arthur Lira said this week the tax and administrative reforms could be approved by the end of the year.
Signs the economic agenda is moving forward could also propel the real to strengthen to 5 per dollar, said Carlos Menezes, a portfolio manager at Gauss Capital in Sao Paulo.
Another positive driver for the currency is the outlook for rates. Brazil’s central bank is expected to deliver another 75 basis point hike next week and swap rates price in 250 basis points in additional tightening by the end of the year, which would take the benchmark rate to 6%, the highest since mid-2019.
Sergio Zanini, a partner and manager at Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Capital in Sao Paulo, sees the central bank lifting rates to 5.5% by the end of 2021, which would allow the real to strengthen to 5.10 per dollar. His view is subject to the Federal Reserve keeping a stimulative policy, which offers support to risk assets.
The more bullish forecasts are not a consensus, though. Economists in a weekly central bank survey see the real at 5.40 per dollar by the end of the year, little changed from current levels.
Trade boost
Stronger dollar inflows due to rising exports and higher commodity prices are also offering support for the currency. Brazil is headed for the highest monthly trade surplus ever, with exports exceeding imports by $8.9 billion in the first 25 days of April.
Foreign exchange inflows are positive by $9.5 billion so far this year, compared with a $13.4 billion deficit in the same period of 2020. And while the country posted a wider-than-expected current account deficit in March, the central bank said it expects a $5.7 billion surplus in April.

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged Thursday near multi-week lows after the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its very dovish monetary policy, boosting confidence in the global economic recovery.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was flat at 90.610, trading not far away from a nine-week low.
EUR/USD traded down 0.1% at 1.2119, after earlier hitting its highest level against the dollar since late February, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3962, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 108.78. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7794 and NZD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7258.
The Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to leave the policy interest rate near zero and kept a $120 billion monthly pace of asset purchases, while acknowledging that there had been an improvement in the economic conditions.
In the press conference that followed the policy statement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell continued to signal that policy will remain steady for some time, to the benefit of the global economy, with inflation risks distorted by the pandemic-related decline in prices last year.
“The inflation rate will increase markedly above 2% but the Fed considers it transitory due to bottlenecks and base-effects. The only true inflation stems from the labor market (according to the Fed), why the labor market is now the one to watch,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
That said, the Commerce Department will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP growth on Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). The economy is expected to have grown at a 6.1% annualized rate in the first three months of the year, which would be the second-fastest GDP growth pace since the third quarter of 2003 and would follow a 4.3% rate in the fourth quarter.
And that’s before the impact of the $1.8 trillion package for families and education that President Joe Biden unveiled Wednesday in his first joint speech to Congress. 
Elsewhere, USD/TRY edged higher to 8.1972, ahead of the first public policy presentation by Turkey’s new central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu.
Kavcioglu is expected to raise inflation forecasts as the recent slide in the lira, following the abrupt sacking of his predecessor, exposed the limited room to deliver the interest-rate cuts sought by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stubbornly dovish monetary policy in its latest policy decision green-lighted the global reflation trade.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 90.520 by 1:17 PM ET (5:17 AM GMT). The index wallowed near a nine-week low and continued to move further away from the rally peak of 93.439 recorded at the end of March 2021.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 108.58. The dollar also gave up much of the week’s gains against the yen after hitting a high of 109.07 on Wednesday. However, a holiday in Japan could help minimize losses during the Asian session.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.7792 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7258.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.11% to 6.4702 while the GBP/USD edged up 0.15% to 1.3954.
The dollar’s loss was the euro’s gains, with the single currency hitting its highest level against the dollar since late February 2021 while cracking major trendline resistance at $1.2114.
The Fed kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision on Wednesday as per investor expectations. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell played down speculation over a potential early tapering of asset buying, saying it was “not time yet” and that employment still had a long way towards recovery.
“The risk is the Fed is very cautious and delays taking the first steps to normalizing policy... low-interest rates amid an improving U.S. and global economy is a recipe for the dollar to continue decreasing,” CBA head of international economics Joseph Capurso told Reuters.
Despite Powell’s warning, the central bank also acknowledged that “indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.” The rosier economic outlook could keep the dollar on its downward trend as imports increased and drove the trade deficit to record highs in March 2021.
“That surge implies the U.S. current account deficit was around 4% of GDP in the first quarter, a significant weight on the USD in the medium term,” said Capurso.
Reactions to the U.S. GDP for the first quarter of 2021, when it is released on Friday, could also be more subdued. The Atlanta Fed’s “GDP Now” program forecasts GDP to expand by a whopping 7.9%, a warning sign of considerable upside risk.
The Fed’s stance markedly differs from that of its northern neighbor, the Bank of Canada. The latter has already begun to taper its asset-buying, which sent the greenback to a three-year low against its Canadian counterpart."

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higher on Wednesday as investors moved to the sidelines ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy statement and a speech by Joe Biden later in the day where the U.S. president is set to announce more stimulus plans.
Though the greenback recovered from a one-month low hit earlier this week, investors expect the U.S. central bank to maintain its policy settings and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is seen as likely to repeat his dovish message.
The dollar index rose 0.2% at 91.047, bouncing from Monday's low of 90.679, its weakest level since March 3, though investors were not convinced a recent downtrend had ended.
The greenback's gains were also bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields with benchmark yields on 10-year notes rising above 1.60% after tepid auction results. [US/] 
Investors' inflation expectations, measured by the break-even inflation rate calculated from U.S. inflation-linked bonds, rose above 2.40% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2013.
But analysts expect the Fed will remain unperturbed by the prospects of more stimulus plans and rising inflation expectations, holding the prospect of more losses for the greenback in the coming weeks.
""We still expect Powell to remain ultra-dovish and emphasise the long period ahead in which the Fed plans to maintain loose monetary policy, which will leave open the prospect of further USD weakness,"" MUFG strategists said.
The euro slipped 0.2% to $1.2070, off Monday's two-month high of $1.2117.
The dollar stood at 108.97 yen, having jumped 0.59% overnight and extending its recovery from a seven-week low of 107.48 touched last week, in tandem with rises in U.S. bond yields.
Biden is expected to roll out a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, including the largest-ever increase in levies on investment gains, to fund about $1 trillion in childcare and other social spending.

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar dropped 0.3% to $0.77415 after the country's consumer price index came in weaker than expected.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Wednesday, trying to extend its recovery from two-month lows ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.2% higher at 91.050, bouncing from Monday's low of 90.679, its lowest level since March 3.
EUR/USD traded down 0.2% at 1.2064, off Monday’s two-month high of 1.2117, GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.3873, USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 109.00, extending its recovery from a seven-week low of 107.48 touched last week, with the yen on the back foot as Japan's economic recovery is hampered by lockdowns across its most populous prefectures.
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7741 after Australia’s consumer price index data, released earlier in the day, missed forecasts, rising 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 1.1% year-on-year respectively during the first quarter of 2021
The dollar's recent decline has been largely based on the market starting to believe that the Federal Reserve will look through rises in inflation and delay future policy tightening even as the U.S. economy rapidly recovers.
With this in mind, attention now turns to the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy-setting meeting later Wednesday, and in particular the accompanying comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell given the U.S. central bank is widely expected to maintain its policy settings.
“We do not expect any major shifts to Fed communication until late Q3 as a base case, when we might see some kind of hint at a tapering of asset purchases – something we expect to start in early 2022,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note.
Analysts at Nordea agree that this meeting is too soon for the central bank to start talking about easing back on its asset purchases, but think that the discussion could start sooner than currently expected as the country’s vaccination program continues at a fierce pace.
“The risk of a tapering scenario from the Fed is still very low for this week’s meeting,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, “but could come into play already in June since [St Louis Fed President James] Bullard e.g. hinted that the Fed could be open for a discussion on the balance sheet once 75-80% of the population are vaccinated.”
Away from the Fed, President Biden's first address to a joint session of Congress, also later Wednesday, will attract attention as he is expected to roll out his tax-raising plans.
Reports about his tax-hike plan dented markets' risk appetite briefly on Friday, but there could be a bigger reaction if the plan becomes more concrete.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision and U.S. President Joe Biden’s address in front of a joint session of Congress, both due to take place later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 90.980 by 12:51 AM ET (4:51 AM GMT), after touching an eight-week low earlier in the week.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.14% to 108.83. Japan reported a better-than-expected 5.2% increase in March retail sales year-on-year earlier in the day. However, rising COVID-19 cases in the country and the Bank of Japan’s acknowledgment on Tuesday that inflation will fail to reach its key 2% target through early 2023.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.7745. Australia’s consumer price index (CPI) data released earlier in the day missed forecasts, rising 0.6% quarter-on-quarter and 1.1% year-on-year respectively during the first quarter of 2021. The NZD/USD pair was steady at 0.7207.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to .6.4863 and the GBP/USD pair was down 0.26% to 1.3876.
Although the dollar rebounded from its lowest level since Mar.3 hit on Monday, skepticism remains on whether its downward trend since late March is over.
Receding bets on whether the Fed will start laying the groundwork for a future policy tightening soon when its hands down its decision, also contributed to the U.S. currency’s decline.
Although the central bank is expected to maintain its dovish policy, some investors suggested that signs of rising inflation expectations could nudge it to abandon the stance sooner than expected. The break-even inflation rate rose above 2.40%, its highest level since 2013, on Tuesday.
""In a way, the rise in the BEI above 2% is what the Fed has been wishing for. Still, if it goes too far it could raise alarm at the Fed. The Fed will probably not be able to overlook a rise in BEI above 2.5%,"" SMBC Nikko Securities chief FX strategist Makoto Noji told Reuters.
The Federal Reserve said last year it aims to bring average inflation around 2% and to allow it to overshoot above 2%, rather than trying to cap it around 2%.
Investors are also paying attention to Biden's address, his first as president, for more details on his prosed tax hike for the wealthiest Americans to fund about $1 trillion in childcare.
""In addition to tax policies that have resurfaced as a market focus, his stance on diplomacy should attract some attention given recent tensions with China and Russia,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.

384,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Credit markets are sounding warnings for other asset classes amid India’s unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases.
Firms have defaulted on at least 57 billion rupees ($763 million) of domestic bonds this year, the most on record for a similar period. Traders expect more. They’ve pushed spreads on A rated local corporate bonds over AAA notes to a 17-year high, a grim sign for the small businesses that tend to have those weaker ratings and that form the bedrock of the $2.7 trillion economy.
That all suggests the need for further caution in the equities and government bond markets, which have held up better despite volatility. While the defaults are largely among smaller, often unlisted borrowers, they add to challenges for policy makers already grappling with one of the world’s worst bad debt ratios. On top of that, the Covid outbreak risks fanning inflation as local curbs disrupt supply chains, threatening to limit central bank options for juicing the economy.
“One can’t expect there will be good news on the economy, good news on earnings and stock prices will go up,” said Sunil Subramaniam, managing director of Sundaram Asset Management Co. “It is undoubtedly, going to be a volatile period for the market.”
In recent days, equity and government bond investors have focused on more optimistic signals as the government has refrained from broad national lockdowns. India’s S&P BSE Sensex Index rose to a three-week high Tuesday after a U.S. decision to offer vaccine support, and continued up Wednesday.
But there have been mounting concerns. Despite the recent rally, Indian stocks are lagging their Asian peers this month after outperforming for four straight quarters.
And while some long-term investors including Fidelity International and Invesco have said they are seeking opportunities to add stocks, sentiment broadly has soured among global equity funds. Foreign investors sold a net $1.2 billion of Indian shares this month through April 26, on course for the worst outflow since March 2020.
India’s central bank was able to tame yields with its announcement of a QE-like bond buying program earlier this month. That’s sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year sovereign bond down about 12 basis points in April, set for the biggest retreat in six months. The rupee has rebounded in the past few days as well, coming off its weakest against the dollar since August earlier this month.
But yields have been volatile, with traders nervous about the possibility of more government spending to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has raised the possibility of bringing forward planned borrowing.
Jitters about the supply of government notes have already resulted in underwriters being forced to rescue bond auctions and the central bank having to cancel some.
Meanwhile, concerns about the economic impact from the Covid resurgence have left the rupee down about 2.1% in April against the dollar despite the recent rally, set for the worst drop since March last year.
The corporate bond market has been flashing other red lights.
Credit-default swaps for State Bank of India -- considered a proxy for India’s default risk -- widened to a 9-month high this week, before dropping back Tuesday after the news about the U.S. vaccine assistance, CMA data show.
“Markets are getting cautious on the credit side as economic growth is seen slowing down, raising concerns distressed debt may rise,” said Vikas Goel, managing director and chief executive officer at PNB Gilts Ltd.
SBI Funds Management Pvt., India’s biggest asset manager, has said they are watchful on the financial sector as relief announced by authorities such as a debt moratorium has hidden the true picture of the stress the pandemic has exerted.
Across industries, some borrowers are finding it harder to tap the credit market. Issuance of local-currency notes graded A and below fell to a 10-year low of 1.8 billion rupees in April.

Investing.com – The dollar inched higher against its rivals led by a rise in bond yields on positive economic data as the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting got underway Tuesday.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.11% to 90.88.
U.S. bond yields awoke from their recent slumber following data showing U.S. consumer confidence jumped to pre-pandemic highs as the reopening continues to gather pace. 
The consumer confidence index rose to 121.7 in April from 109.0 in March, well above economists consensus of 113.0.
The U.S. 10-year yields were at 1.62% on the day.
Against the backdrop of positive economic data, however, the Fed is widely expected to keep its monetary policy decision unchanged.
""No change in policy is expected with policy makers likely to hold rates steady at 0.00%-0.25% and asset purchases at $120 billion per month,"" Stifel Economics said.
With little change expected on monetary policy, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference will likely garner added attention.
But the Fed chief, while acknowledging the step up in the recovery, will likely continue to suggest the economy is still a ways off from achieving its employment and inflation targets.
""We also expect the usual script from Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking of his cautious optimism on the recovery in the press conference while downplaying any talk of meaningful medium-term inflation pressures,"" ING said in a note.
""Assuming the Fed makes few, if any, substantive changes to its statement, we would expect the dollar to stay on a softening path,"" ING added.
Others agree, and suggest that dollar will likely struggle to make gains amid the ongoing global reflation trade.
The combination of Powell sticking with his previous remarks and an unchanged monetary policy decision should ""be moderately USD negative with the global reflation trade allowing other currencies to rise gradually,"" National Bank Australia said in a note."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Tuesday, but remained near multi-week lows ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy decision meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.2% higher at 90.918, after dipping to the lowest since March 3 overnight at 90.679.
EUR/USD traded down 0.1% at 1.2071, but remained close to the two-month high of 1.2117 reached Monday, GBP/USD was largely unchanged at 1.3891, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7793, after a 0.7% rally overnight that took it just shy of a five-week peak.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 108.20, continuing its rise from Friday’s seven-week low of 107.48, after the Bank of Japan held policy steady and took a more positive view on growth while cutting inflation forecasts.
Attention now turns to the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy-setting meeting, concluding on Wednesday, even if no changes to monetary policy is widely expected.
The market will still pay close attention to comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is likely to face questions over whether improving conditions warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing.
There seems to be a real conviction that the global economy is on a recovery path, even with the Covid situation in India causing anxiety, and this is weighing on the dollar. 
“Supporting this narrative should be this week's combination of US events in the form of a) strong 1Q21 US GDP on Thursday and b) Wednesday's FOMC showing a Fed continuing to let the economy run hot and only reining in accommodation once the recovery has delivered,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
June looks like being a much more significant FOMC meeting, as there will have been a number of months of likely strong economic data for the central bank to digest, and “the seven weeks between the April and June FOMC meetings is a long time to be sitting on the sidelines in defensive dollar positions when more attractive alternatives are available elsewhere,” ING added.
Also of interest Tuesday will be the auction of $62-billion of seven-year U.S. Treasurys later in the session. A seven-year debt auction in February saw very weak demand, which sparked a dramatic rise in yields, helping the dollar push higher.
However, the dollar has fallen nearly 3% since late March as U.S. Treasury yields traded in narrow ranges after retreating from a 14-month high of 1.776%, in the benchmark 10-year yield, slashing the currency's appeal.
The 10-year yield was around 1.58% on Tuesday, in quiet trade since sliding to a one-month low of 1.528% in the middle of this month, while the seven-year yield edged up to 1.27%.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.14% to 90.907 by 12:39 AM ET (4:39 AM GMT). The index was little changed at 90.859 as the Asian session opened, after falling to 90.679, its lowest level since Mar. 3, during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.15% to 108.25, with the dollar inching up 0.1% and continuing its rise from Friday’s seven-week low of 107.48. The Bank of Japan also kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.10% when it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day, in line with investor expectations.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7790, after the riskier, commodity-linked AUD rallied 0.7%, just shy of a five-week high, during the previous session. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7224.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.4863, with the offshore Chinese yuan inching down 0.1% after its rise to a seven-week high of 6.4710 per dollar on Monday.

The euro slipped 0.1% to $1.2078 but remained near the one-month high of $1.2117 hit on Monday.
Some investors remained bearish on the dollar, however.
“The dollar doesn’t seem to have the strength it had earlier this year... it had been driven by various expectations, such as massive fiscal spending and speedy vaccinations in the U.S. Most of those appear to have been priced in,” Ryobi Systems chief of financial Kyosuke Suzuki told Reuters.
Investors now await the Fed’s decision, due on Wednesday, and will pay particular attention to comments from Chairman Jerome Powell, who will likely face questions on whether the improved economic outlook warrants a withdrawal of monetary easing by the central bank.
However, some investors expect Powell to dismiss such talk, which could potentially put further downward pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.
""The reflation trade is back on... currencies outside of the dollar should be doing quite well anyway in that environment,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Gavin Friend told Reuters.
The dollar has fallen nearly 3% since late March 2021, as U.S. Treasury yields remain boxed in narrow ranges after retreating from their 14-month high of 1.7760%. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hovered near 1.58% on Tuesday."

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six peers, was little changed at 90.947 in mid-Asian session, after dipping to the lowest since March 3 overnight at 90.679.
The dollar added 0.1% to 108.18 yen, another haven currency, continuing its rise from the seven-week low of 107.48 reached Friday.
The yen showed a muted response after the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy on hold as widely expected.
Additionally, no change to policy is expected when the Federal Open Market Committee ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday. 
However, the market will pay close attention to comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is likely to face questions over whether improving conditions warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing.
Most analysts though expect him to say such talk is premature, which could put downward pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.
""The reflation trade is back on,"" Gavin Friend, a strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), said on a client podcast.
""Currencies outside of the dollar should be doing quite well anyway in that environment.""
The dollar has fallen nearly 3% since late March as U.S. Treasury yields traded in narrow ranges after retreating from a 14-month high of 1.7760%, slashing the currency's yield appeal.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was around 1.58% on Tuesday, tracking sideways since sliding to a one-month low of 1.528% in the middle of this month.
The euro slipped 0.1% to $1.2071, but remained close to the two-month high of $1.2117 reached Monday.
The commodity-linked Australian dollar, a barometer of risk appetite, eased 0.15% to $0.7789, after a 0.7% rally overnight that took it just shy of a five-week peak. 
The offshore Chinese yuan retreated 0.1% after rising to a seven-week top of 6.4710 per dollar on Monday.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded around $53,500 following a 10% surge on Monday, driven by reports that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is planning to offer a managed bitcoin fund.

That snapped a five-day losing streak that took the digital token to the cusp of $47,000, with losses accelerating amid worries about U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes.

Bitcoin was last up 6.7% at $52,452 after touching its lowest since early March on Sunday. Other major coins ethereum and XRP, which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, were up around 5% and 11% respectively.
Cryptocurrencies fell sharply on Friday on concern that U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes would curb investments in digital assets, though they later recovered some of their losses.

Bitcoin has lost over 19% from its April 14 record of almost $65,000. Still, the cryptocurrency has risen over 80% this year, fuelled by growing adoption from mainstream investors and companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro held at an eight-week high against the dollar on Monday despite a disappointing sentiment survey in Germany as expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its dovish stance at a policy meeting weighed on the greenback.
German business morale improved by less than expected in April as a third wave of COVID-19 infections and problems with supply of components in the industrial sector slowed a recovery in Europe's largest economy. 
""Both the third wave of infections and bottlenecks in intermediate products are impeding Germany's economic recovery,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
The euro gave up some of its earlier gains to stand 0.03% higher at $1.2105 at 0823 GMT, levels not seen since the beginning of March. 
On Friday, the common currency posted its biggest daily gains since early February after positive data on European services and manufacturing activity lifted sentiment.
The dollar index was down 0.13% at its lowest level since March 3.
The Fed's next meeting ends on Wednesday, and while no major policy changes are expected, investors will pay close attention to comments from Chairman Jerome Powell.
Powell is likely to face questions over whether an improving labour market and rising coronavirus vaccinations warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing, but most analysts expect him to say such talk is premature, which would put downward pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.
""The Fed has managed to convince the market that it is in no position to begin contemplating tapering, never mind raising rates, for – in their own words – 'some time',"" John Velis, a strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) wrote to clients. 
The dollar stood at 107.68 yen, close to its lowest since March 4. 
The British pound was 0.3% higher at $1.3924, adding to a 0.3% gain in the previous session.
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira weakened to as much as 8.48 versus the dollar, close to its record low of 8.58 reached in early November.
The currency, among the worst performers in emerging markets this year due to worsening relations with the United States and worries about a dovish central bank governor, was last quoted at 8.33. 
The onshore yuan edged up to 6.4873 per dollar, just shy of a six-week high.
Elsewhere, the Australian and New Zealand dollars rose toward one-month highs. 

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin reclaimed the $50,000 mark, last trading 7.6% higher at $52,862 and recouping some of its losses from last week triggered by U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes for wealthy investors.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Monday, with risk sentiment on the rise as economic data point to a global economic recovery ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.1% lower at 90.778, near levels not seen since the end of February. 
USD/JPY was 0.1% lower at 107.81, EUR/USD traded up 0.1% at 1.2100, near a two-month high, GBP/USD gained 0.3% to 1.3914, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7769.
Risk appetite has been boosted of late by strong signs of a global economic improvement, to the detriment of the safe haven dollar, with early April manufacturing activity indicators, released late last week, hitting record highs in the United States and also showing impressive improvement in Europe.
A survey from Germany's Ifo institute due later on Monday is expected to show business conditions continued to improve in Europe's largest economy.
Attention this week will be centered around the latest policy-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve, with the two-day get together scheduled to finish on Wednesday.
The European Central Bank maintained its very accommodative policies last week, with President Christine Lagarde shutting down expectations that the central bank will start to consider easing back its bond purchases any time soon.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to face questions over whether an improving labor market and rising coronavirus vaccinations warrant a withdrawal of monetary easing, but he is likely to take a very similar stance to Lagarde, shunning talk of tapering bond purchases.
“The Fed is unlikely to rock the tapering boat on Wednesday,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, but “we keep leaning towards higher USD rates, a stronger USD and negative spill-overs to risk assets during Q3. We think a decision on tapering will be taken in September and keep looking for a rate hike from the Fed already in H1-2022.”
Elsewhere, USD/TRY gained 0.9% to 8.4471, with traders keeping a wary eye on the Turkish lira to see if this pair will test its all-time high of 8.58 amid deteriorating relations with the United States, and after the new central bank chief signaled that rate hikes would harm the economy.
The lira has slipped 3.5% in the last three trading days amid reports that U.S. President Joe Biden will recognize the 1915 massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as a genocide, something that would strain the relationship between the NATO allies.
USD/RUB fell 0.3% to 74.794, as Russia de-escalates the tension on the border with Ukraine and after the country’s central bank hiked its key interest rate to 5% Friday, from 4.5%, in an attempt to stem accelerating inflation."

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - For candidate Angus Robertson, helping his Scottish National Party win a majority in May 6 elections would be a dream come true. Beyond that lies a far bigger prize - another referendum and the prospect of breaking from the United Kingdom.
He only needs to look up for inspiration in his push for independence that would end the 314-year union between Scotland and England and profoundly change the course of British history.
Around the lofty room that serves as his campaign headquarters in Edinburgh, a rallying cry to Scottish noblemen 700 years ago is written in cursive script. It is ""not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting,"" it reads, ""but for freedom.""
The prospect of independence is again in play.
Opinion polls point to a persistent, though narrowing majority in favour of leaving the UK, with Brexit in 2016 - which Scotland opposed - forefront in many voters' minds.
The SNP is also close to controlling the devolved parliament outright, and the last time that happened in 2011, Britain's then-Prime Minister David Cameron bowed to pressure and allowed a referendum in 2014 that ultimately rejected going it alone.
Robertson hopes that a majority would force Boris Johnson to do the same, and few races will be watched more closely than his own to gauge the SNP's chances and, with them, the possibility of another referendum.
The Scottish Conservatives hold the seat by just 610 votes, and the SNP needs four more seats to win a majority of 65 in the 129-seat parliament and claim the moral and political right to vote on independence.
""Edinburgh Central is a hugely important seat for the SNP to secure a majority,"" said Robertson of his symbolic constituency at the heart of Scotland's capital.
He grew up in the area that includes the Scottish parliament, an imposing castle perched on an extinct volcano and the richest parts of a city that voted emphatically against independence in 2014.
The 51-year-old, who talks about independence with the quiet intensity of someone who thinks it's a question of when, not if, recalled a time when nationalists like himself weren't even elected as local councillors.
""The fact that the SNP is in the running to win this seat is hugely symbolic of how strong the pro-independence movement has become.""
UPHILL BATTLE
Were independence to happen, the United Kingdom - already grappling with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit - would lose about a third of its landmass, a tenth of its population and a core ingredient of its identity.
Opinion polls suggest that, for the first time, a small, sustained majority of voters in Scotland favour it.
Anger over Brexit and approval of the Scottish government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic have bolstered support for independence, and demands for a second vote. That backing reached a record 58% of Scots at the end of last year.
But underlining the challenge the SNP faces, support for independence has since dropped to 51%, excluding undecided voters, following a bitter feud between SNP leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and her predecessor, Alex Salmond.
Sturgeon has faced calls to resign for her treatment of her former mentor during an investigation of sexual harassment allegations against him.
Salmond was acquitted by a court last year of 12 allegations of sexual assault and is suing the government over its handling of the complaints.
The row has cast an unflattering light on the nationalist movement, tainted by in-fighting, self-interest, and conspiracy. 
Salmond started his own pro-independence party in March. Although the party, Alba, is expected at most to pick up a handful of seats, this could split the nationalist vote and deny the SNP its crucial outright majority.
While the SNP is one of Europe's most successful political parties and is on course to win a fourth term in office, its membership is the most divided it has been in decades, according to James Mitchell, a professor of politics at Edinburgh University, who has written books on the nationalist movement. 
He said among activists there is growing frustration over Sturgeon's gradualist strategy for winning a new referendum and her centrist economic policies. 
A party that wins elections ""tends to be happy"", he said.
""But the SNP has a bigger goal and that is independence. It hasn't made much progress on that and this is feeding a sense of betrayal. That is a strong term, but that is how some people feel.""
THE FIGHT FOR EDINBURGH
In a close-fought constituency like Edinburgh Central, said Mitchell, disaffection with the SNP could divert votes to other pro-independence candidates and rob the SNP of a precious seat. 
Repeatedly besieged by English soldiers during the Middle Ages, Edinburgh has proved more resistant to independence than other parts of Scotland.
It has the highest average earnings of any city in the United Kingdom after London. Many residents work in finance and higher education, which could be threatened by independence.
About 60,000 people live in Edinburgh Central.
A railway line bisects its richer areas, with their leafy Georgian squares and shops selling artisanal coffee or pheasant, from working-class areas where Polish, African and South Asian supermarkets serve a diverse community.
Robertson was born in England to a Scottish father and German mother, and started out as a journalist with Austria's public broadcaster. He is a prominent ally of Sturgeon and a former deputy leader of the SNP.
When Reuters visited, Robertson's mail bag contained a crude reminder that Edinburgh Central is no walkover. He opened an envelope and unfolded a note scrawled with expletives. ""As I thought,"" he said.
Robertson's Conservative opponent, a relative unknown called Scott Douglas, who works in public relations for a local college, was born in England to Scottish parents.
Douglas believes independence is a distraction from reviving Scotland's post-pandemic economy.
""Most people I speak to don't see the difference between being British and Scottish,"" he told Reuters. ""You can be both.""
    Under pressure to show progress is being made towards the goal of independence, the nationalists have pledged to hold a new referendum by the end of 2023 if they win a majority in the election. As the law stands, to hold another referendum legally, Scotland needs the permission of the British parliament.
Johnson has repeatedly said he would refuse another independence vote and the next should not be held until the 2050s because the issue was settled in 2014.
This could set the stage for a showdown: the nationalists say they will pass the legislation anyway, daring the British government to challenge the decision in the courts. 
But Robertson says the UK government will eventually back down if the SNP wins a majority. 
""The danger to Boris Johnson and the UK government, by blocking the legitimate wishes of people in Scotland, is that what has been an independence movement develops into a democracy movement,"" Robertson said. ""This is understood by ministers in London.""
On Edinburgh's streets below the castle there is suspicion of both the SNP and Johnson's Conservatives.
Johnson is particularly disliked in Scotland, where his English eccentricity is seen by some as arrogance. He is unlikely to campaign for the Conservatives, in apparent recognition that his presence could do more harm than good. 
""Boris doesn't care about a guy like me,"" said Stephen McKinlay, relaxing on a bench after a day working on a building site.
McKinlay said he voted against independence in the 2014 referendum, but is now leaning the opposite way.

""There are big risks,"" he said, ""but maybe now we will be better off on our own.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia as speculation mounts that the U.S. Federal Reserve will shun talk of tapering bond purchases when it hands down its policy decision later in the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.13% to 90.718 by 13:29 AM ET (5:29 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.16% to 107.73, with the dollar close to its lowest level against the Japanese currency since Mar. 4.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.37% to 0.7773 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.34% to 0.7212.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.09% to 6.4886 while the GBP/USD pair was up 0.21% to 1.3904.
The Fed will hand down its decision, which is widely expected to keep to the status quo, on Wednesday. Investors will, however, pay close attention to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's replies to the questions he will likely face over whether an improving labor market and rising COVID-19 vaccinations could lead to a withdrawal of monetary easing.
If Powell reiterates his commitment to maintaining an easy monetary policy for an extended period, it could exert further downward pressure on the U.S. currency and Treasury yields.
""The dollar is likely to continue to trend lower in line with the gathering momentum in the world economy,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analysts said in a note.
""We expect the Fed policy meeting to be a non-event for the dollar. The U.S. economy is a long way from meeting the 'substantial further progress' threshold for the Fed to taper its asset purchases,” the note added.
Across the Atlantic, the euro climbed to a near two-month high against the greenback ahead of the release of Germany’s Ifo Business Climate Index later in the day.
The euro rose to $1.2105, adding to gains made on Friday on the back of better-than-expected manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers Indexes.
U.S. funds have recently started selling the dollar against the yen in Asian trading, another sign of expectations that lower U.S. Treasury yields will push the dollar down even lower, according to some investors.
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data also pointed to a three-week high in speculators' net bearish bets on the dollar, indicating further declines for the greenback.
An emerging markets currency of interest currently is the Turkish lira, with investors waiting to see if it will test its record low of 8.58 against the dollar as relations with the U.S. sour and Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey governor Sahap Kavcioglu’s dovish stance.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, is down 22.5% from the year's high of $64,895.22 on April 14.
Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropped/dipped 4.91 % to $2,253.41 on Saturday, losing $116.36 from its previous close. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered hefty losses on Friday amid fears that U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes will curb investment in digital assets. 

But while social media lit up with posts about the plan hurting cryptocurrencies, and individual investors complaining about losses, some traders and analysts said declines are likely to be temporary. 
There has been growing retail and institutional investor acceptance of digital currencies as a legitimate asset class. That has coincided with a surge in online trading in stocks and crypto by retail investors, stuck at home with extra cash because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Friday, sticking to narrow ranges as traders turn their attention onto next week’s Federal Reserve meeting following the conclusion of the European Central Bank get-together.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.2% lower at 91.155, remaining just above the seven-week low of 90.856 seen on Tuesday. 
USD/JPY was flat at 107.95, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7728, while EUR/USD traded up 0.1% at 1.2024, recovering after minor falls Thursday on the conclusion of the ECB meeting.
The European Central Bank maintained its very accommodative policies at its latest meeting Thursday, and President Christine Lagarde shut down expectations that the central bank will start to consider tapering its bond purchases even while predicting a robust recovery for the region in the second half of the year.
“The focus now turns to the expected improvement in Eurozone data, which should help to push the undervalued EUR/USD higher this quarter,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Some of this data is due later Friday, with French and German PMI numbers for April expected to show improving sentiment throughout the region. 
Also of interest will be the Federal Reserve meeting next week, with the U.S. central bank expected to keep its current policy largely unchanged on April 28.
Investors will be looking more for any comments about scaling back monetary easing in the future from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, although he is likely to take a leaf out of Lagarde’s playbook and warn against expecting the tapering of bond purchases anytime soon.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3858, helped by evidence of a recovery in the U.K. economy.
U.K. retail sales surged more than expected to levels higher than before the coronavirus pandemic struck, even with most shops still closed, rising 5.4% in March from the month before, double the gain of the previous month.
Britain also recorded a 28 billion-pound ($39 billion) budget deficit in March, a shortfall for 2020-21 as a whole of 303.1 billion pounds, the largest budget deficit in peacetime history. As large as this figure is, it’s still smaller than the 327.4 billion pounds predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility last month.
USD/RUB fell 1.7% to 75.352, as Russia started to pull its troops back from the Ukrainian border, reducing the apparent likelihood of a fresh invasion of its western neighbor. Russia’s central bank is also set to meet later Friday, and many analysts expect it to raise its key interest rate to try and restrain rising inflation.
Russia's consumer price index rose 5.8% in March in year-on-year terms, its highest reading in nearly five years, something that President Vladimir Putin touched on in his annual address to the nation on Wednesday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, caged into a narrow trading range as investors await a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in the following week.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.17% to 91.170 by 1:08 M ET (5:08 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.06% to 107.90.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.37% to 0.7735 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 0.7182. Although the Antipodean currencies steadied during the Asian session some investors pointed to the recent weakening in commodity prices as a downward risk for the riskier, commodities-tied pair.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.4958 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.3862.
The Fed will hand down its policy decision on Apr. 28, when it is widely expected to keep its current policy largely unchanged.
Although investors will be on the lookout for any comments about scaling back monetary easing in the future, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to repeat European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde’s warning that expectations of tapering of bond purchases as the ECB handed down its policy decision on Thursday.
If that is Powell’s message when the Fed hands down its own policy decision in the following week, it will likely put downward pressure on Treasury yields and cap the greenback’s gains.
The euro, meanwhile, fell after Lagarde shut down expectations that ECB will start to consider tapering as the economic outlook improves in the continent. France targets re-opening schools on Monday and lifting domestic travel curbs, which started earlier in the month, on May 3.
Although the improving outlook and rising COVID-19 vaccination rates continue to boost investor sentiment, investors scaled back expectations for a withdrawal of monetary easing policies after Lagarde reiterated that the talk of phasing out emergency bond purchases is premature.
“Powell has to reiterate the continuation of easy monetary policy just like Lagarde... as a result, the dollar is likely to fall against the yen, but the larger trend for the dollar is still mixed. The dollar can still rise against commodity currencies if commodity prices start falling again,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
On the data front, Germany will release April’s manufacturing and service Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) later in the day. The U.S. will also release its April manufacturing and service PMIs later in the day alongside figures for new home sales in March.
Although positive data could contribute to investor sentiment, the dollar and the euro are unlikely to make big moves as investors continue to wait on the sidelines ahead of the Fed decision."

Investing.com – The euro slipped against the dollar Thursday as the European Central Bank indicated it was in no rush to taper its emergency bond purchases despite optimism over a strong recovery.
EUR/USD fell 0.26% to $1.200.
The European Central Bank, as widely expected, left its benchmark rate at 0.00% and said it would stick with plans to accelerate emergency bond purchases until March 2022 in a bid to keep bond yields steady.   
""[T]he Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the current quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year,"" the ECB said in a monetary policy statement.
President of the bank Christine Lagarde was also quick to downplay any notion the central bank would look at tapering bond purchases, saying it was ""simply premature,"" and adding that any changes to the program would be ""data-dependent.""
The dovish stance from the ECB comes even as the central bank expressed optimism over the recovery as the bloc gets its vaccine rollout back on track.
""Looking ahead, progress with vaccination campaigns and the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021,"" Lagarde said.
Following the meeting, analysts talked up the prospect of further climb in the euro on expectations that most of the bad news has been priced in.
""The EUR/USD uptrend which started this month should remain in place,"" ING said. ""Plenty of bad news has now been priced into the euro, the currency has been trading with a persistent risk premium over the past few months and despite the recent rise, EUR/USD still screens cheap based on our short-term financial fair value model (by around 1.5%)."""

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Thursday, remaining near to multi-week lows, with the euro in focus as the European Central Bank meets.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.1% lower at 91.013, just above the seven-week low of 90.856 seen on Tuesday. 
USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 107.84, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3940, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7755, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2043, after touching a seven-week high of 1.2079 earlier in the week.
Investors have also turned away from the greenback as U.S. Treasury yields reversed their climbs in March 2021, and an auction of 20-year Treasuries drew strong demand on Wednesday, which also helped to cap yields.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was last seen around 1.53%, around the lowest it has been since mid-March, a sharp move lower from the 14-month high at 1.7760% reached at the end of last month.
Still, most attention Thursday will be on the European Central Bank, as it hands down its latest policy decision later in the day. The central bank is widely expected to maintain its current policy, but any positive comments from the central bank about the economic outlook or hints of tapering bond purchases are widely expected to boost the euro, especially after it said at its last meeting that it would step up net asset purchases to curtail the rise in bond yields.
“With the euro below its multi-quarter average and the European Central Bank already announcing front-loaded purchases in March, the April ECB meeting should have a muted impact on the single currency,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “Instead, the focus will be on improving eurozone data in coming months, and with EUR/USD still trading cheap, further upside lies ahead.”  
Elsewhere, USD/CAD fell 0.1% at 1.2480, continuing Wednesday’s selloff after the Bank of Canada tapered the pace of weekly bond buying to C$3 billion per week from C$4 billion, becoming the first G-10 central bank to rein in its bond buying program.
""The outlook has improved for both the global and Canadian economies. Activity has proven more resilient than expected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines is progressing,"" the BoC said in a statement.
USD/TRY rose 1.5% to 8.3075, with the lira continuing to weaken amid questions of the extent of foreign-currency reserves the central bank used in an attempt to prop up the domestic currency over the last couple of years, a period when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak was treasury and finance minister."

The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3928.
Investors are looking to the European Central Bank (EBC) policy decision, which will be handed down later in the day. Any positive comments from the central bank about the economic outlook or hints of tapering bond purchases are widely expected to boost the euro. The single currency was trading at $1.2043, not far from a record level set on Mar. 3.
The ECB is widely expected to maintain its current policy when it meets later in the day, but some investors anticipate that the meeting will indicate whether ECB will slow down bond-buying from June onwards. De Nederlandsche Bank president Klaas Knot has already said tapering is possible, and the euro could resume its rise against the dollar.
Monetary policy remains a focus as the Bank of Canada signaled that it could start raising interest rates in late 2022 after cutting the pace of bond purchases, becoming the first Group of Seven central bank to move towards withdrawing unprecedented stimulus. The Canadian dollar climbed to a six-week high on Wednesday, and last traded at 1.2500 against its U.S. counterpart.
The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars also traded near one-month highs against the dollar, as improving economic outlooks in the Antipodean countries make their central banks more likely to follow the Reserve Bank of Canada’s footsteps.
Investors have also turned away from the greenback as U.S. Treasury yields reversed their climbs in March 2021, but some retained a more positive outlook in the long term over a strong U.S. economy and an improving COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
An auction of 20-year Treasuries drew strong demand on Wednesday, which helped the fixed income market regain its footing and capped yields.
“We’ve confirmed that demand for Treasuries is healthy, which means there is no upward pressure on yields... in this environment, the dollar will test the downside against the yen. The euro is different because there are signs that people inside the ECB are more optimistic about the economy, which raises questions about tapering,” IG Securities senior foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters."
400,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China is considering a plan that would see the central bank assume more than 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) of assets from China Huarong Asset Management Co., helping the state-owned company clean up its balance sheet and refocus on its core business of managing distressed debt, people familiar with the matter said.
Under a proposal that’s still being finalized and could change, a unit of the People’s Bank of China would assume assets from some of Huarong’s unprofitable operations, the people said, asking not to identified as the discussions are private. Further details on how the arrangement would work couldn’t immediately be learned.
Separately, China Huarong International Holdings Ltd., the offshore unit that issues or guarantees most of Huarong’s dollar bonds, is in the process of transferring distressed assets worth tens of billions of yuan into a separate offshore entity called China Huarong Overseas Investment Holding Co., one of the people said. The move is aimed at improving the financial health of China Huarong International, the group’s main link to overseas funding, the person said.
Bloomberg has previously reported that Huarong proposed an overhaul plan to Chinese regulators that would involve offloading its money-losing, non-core businesses.
If the PBOC proposal comes to fruition, it would mark a significant show of government support for a company that has faced intense investor scrutiny after missing a deadline to report earnings at the end of March. Speculation about a looming debt restructuring sent Huarong’s dollar bonds to record lows last week, stoking fears of market contagion and prompting some investors to reconsider assumptions about implicit government guarantees that have underpinned China’s credit market for decades. Huarong’s bonds have swung wildly in recent days amid conflicting signals about the company’s fate.
While the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said last week that Huarong was operating normally and had ample liquidity, authorities have remained quiet about whether the government will offer any financial support. It’s unclear whether Chinese regulators have given Huarong any specific guidance related to its offshore bonds.
The PBOC said it couldn’t immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg on Wednesday. The CBIRC and Huarong didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
“The news suggests that the central government is examining options to provide bail-out solutions to Huarong,” said Dan Wang, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. “The potential involvement of the PBOC, which is experienced in handling distressed financial institutions, also gives the market more hope that the Huarong saga will be dealt with in an orderly way that is less likely to incur losses for offshore bondholders.”
The company’s 4.5% perpetual bond gained 6.4 cents on the dollar to 79.8 cents on Wednesday, while its 3.75% dollar bond due in 2022 climbed 5 cents to 87.7 cents.
With nearly 1.6 trillion yuan of liabilities and a vast web of connections with other financial institutions, Huarong is among China’s most systemically important companies outside the nation’s state-owned banks. It’s also majority-owned by China’s finance ministry, making it a closely watched barometer of the government’s willingness to backstop debt of troubled state-owned enterprises.
Policy makers have been trying to dial back support for unprofitable SOEs to reduce moral hazard in recent years, but they’ve yet to allow a default by a company controlled by the central government. While Chinese SOEs reneged on a record 79.5 billion yuan of local bonds in 2020, most of the defaulters were linked to regional governments and none were considered as systemically important as Huarong.
Worries about the company’s fate have been most acute among offshore bondholders, in part because most of Huarong’s dollar debt contains a form of credit protection called a keepwell agreement that has yet to be fully tested in court. It’s unclear whether Huarong would be compelled to make good on more than $20 billion in dollar bonds if its offshore units -- especially China Huarong International -- were unable to repay.
Huarong and China’s three other main bad-debt managers have nearly $50 billion in outstanding dollar bonds, or about 8% of China’s overseas investment-grade credit market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Huarong is the third largest Chinese financial issuer in international markets, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
The plan being discussed for Huarong has some similarities with the one enacted for troubled Chinese lender Bank of Jinzhou Co. in 2020. Two state-run entities, including one backed by the PBOC, injected 12.1 billion yuan of capital into the bank and assumed 150 billion of its distressed assets. The support package was widely viewed as an attempt to minimize ripple effects on the financial system, after authorities jolted markets in 2019 by seizing control of Baoshang Bank Co. and forcing some corporate creditors to take haircuts.
Among the other Huarong measures under consideration by regulators is the transfer of the Chinese government’s stake from the finance ministry to a unit of the nation’s sovereign wealth fund that has more experience resolving debt risks, a person familiar with the matter said in mid-April. Regulators have held several meetings to discuss Huarong’s fate, people familiar have said.
The PBOC plan is the latest development in a saga that has enthralled China watchers since 2018, when Huarong’s then-chairman Lai Xiaomin was accused of bribery in one of the country’s biggest-ever financial scandals. Under Lai, who was executed earlier this year, Huarong moved far beyond its original mandate of helping banks dispose of bad debt. The company raised billions of dollars from offshore bondholders and expanded into everything from trust companies to securities trading and illiquid investments.
Despite Huarong’s history of mismanagement, some market observers have said the costs of allowing the company to suffer a major default probably outweigh the benefits.
“We see little for the government to gain in letting such a major crisis happen in an effort to eliminate moral hazard in SOEs,”  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts including Eric Ollom wrote in a recent research report. “A financial crisis would likely result in a return to substantial monetary stimulus to counter any financial instability. The more likely policy outcome seems to be to remind investors of these risks but keep the fallout well contained.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Wednesday, retreating once more near to seven-week lows as lower bond yields reduced its attractiveness.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.1% lower at 91.175, after slumping as low as 90.856 on Tuesday for the first time since March 3. 
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 108.03, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3935, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7713, while EUR/USD traded at 1.2031, after touching a seven-week high of 1.2079 overnight.
The dollar had received some respite on Tuesday as flare ups in coronavirus infections, primarily in India, soured the outlook for a quick global recovery, but sentiment remains weak with Treasury yields falling, reducing the currency’s yield appeal.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was last seen around 1.56%, not far from its lowest since mid-March, as it continued to consolidate following its retreat from the 14-month high at 1.78% reached at the end of last month.
The market appears to have had second thoughts about an early tightening of U.S. monetary policy.
“As we move towards a more synchronized global recovery in the second half of the year (i.e., the eurozone economy should eventually catch up) and the Fed presiding over a further decline in U.S. front-end real rates, we look for a further USD decline,” said analysts at ING, in a note.”
Eyes will turn to the European Central Bank’s policy-setting meeting on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan next week.
ECB President Christine Lagarde is likely to be pressed on her thoughts about the central bank’s bond purchasing program, which has been stepped up recently to prevent a rise in borrowing costs from derailing the recovery, after Dutch central bank head Klaas Knot called the acceleration temporary.
“Despite the EUR/USD rebound this month, the pair still screens undervalued by around 1.5% based on our short-term financial fair value model. This suggests limited constraints for further EUR/USD rises in coming days and weeks,” ING added.
Elsewhere, USD/INR rose 0.1% to 75.44, climbing to levels last seen in early July last year as India battles with a second wave of the Covid-19 virus.
India, the world's second most populous country, is reporting the world's highest number of new daily cases and approaching a peak of about 297,000 cases in one day that the United States hit in January."

TOKYO (Reuters) -The dollar languished on Wednesday, hovering just above a seven-week low with subdued U.S. bond yields reducing the currency's yield appeal.
The safe-haven greenback got some respite from a pullback in world stocks from record highs as flare ups in coronavirus infections from India to Canada soured the outlook for a quick global recovery.
The safety bid also bolstered the yen, which climbed to a fresh seven-week peak of 107.88 per dollar on Wednesday.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, was at 91.254 in Asia after slumping as low as 90.856 on Tuesday for the first time since March 3. It has declined 2.1% so far this month.
The index ""has broken down through a key short-term support level at 91.30 and can see further downside to the low 90s,"" with the euro rising to around $1.22, Westpac strategists wrote in a client note.
""We were looking for the (index) to top in Q3, when second derivative U.S. rebound measures crest and Europe gets her vax act together, but the early indications are that vaccinations across Europe are picking up pace already,"" Westpac said.
The single currency traded at $1.20275, after touching a seven-week high of $1.2079 overnight.
The European Central Bank decides policy on Thursday, with the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan following next week.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was around 1.56%, not far from its lowest since mid-March, as it continued to consolidate following its retreat from the 14-month high at 1.7760% reached at the end of last month.
""Now that U.S. Treasury yields have started coming off, people are unwinding yen short positions,"" said Tohru Sasaki, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s head of Japan market research. 
The yen could strengthen to 105 per dollar in the near term, he said. Japan's currency was as weak as 110.97 for the first time in a year at the end of last month.
Declines in U.S. yields and the dollar in April have come as evidence mounted that the Fed would be slower in tightening monetary policy than it had appeared to the market, analysts said.
Some encouragement for the euro came from the announcement that the European Union has secured an additional 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
Elsewhere though, pandemic developments triggered investor caution.
India reported 1,761 deaths from COVID-19, its highest daily toll, while Canada and the United States extended a land-border closure for non-essential travellers.
Asian equities tracked declines on Wall Street, where travel stocks weighed on sentiment.
Oil fell, dragging commodity-linked currencies lower overnight.
The Canadian dollar traded at C$1.26110 to the greenback in Asia, following its biggest plunge in nearly two months on Tuesday. The Bank of Canada is due to announce a policy decision later Wednesday.
The Australian dollar, a barometer for risk appetite, weakened 0.2% to $0.77057 after sliding 0.4% overnight.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded around $55,500, consolidating following its dip to as low as $51,541.16 on Sunday. It set a record high at $64,895.22 on April 14.

403,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BOAO, China (Reuters) - China should not rush to use the digital yuan for cross-border payments due to regulatory obstacles and foreign concerns about it's global impact, Zhou Xiaochuan, the country's former central bank governor, said at the Boao Forum on Wednesday.
China is one of the frontrunners in the global race to launch central bank digital currencies to modernise financial systems, ward off the threat from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and speed up domestic and international payments. 
The digital yuan, which will be mainly for domestic retailing payments, is likely to be used for cross-border payments but it faces complex issues such as restrictions on money laundering and terrorist and gambling funding, Zhou said.
Cross-border payments via digital yuan were not easy, he said. ""We cannot rush it.""
The digital yuan would depend on the Chinese currency's global status being determined by China's economy, currency stability and convertibility, said Zhou, who was until 2018 was China's key architect and driver of its global yuan ambitions.
Zhou shrugged off foreign concerns that the digital yuan could pose a threat to the existing global financial system. Some in the United States have expressed concerns over China's bid to topple the dollar as the dominant global currency.
""In reality, it won't be that serious,"" Zhou said.
The yuan still trails behind the dollar in terms of convertibility and free use, Zhou said.
On Sunday, central bank vice governor Li Bo told the same forum that China will expand digital yuan experiments to more cities, but there is no specific timetable for its official rollout.

Li also said the yuan internationalisation will be a natural process, and China's goal is not to replace the U.S. dollar or other global currencies.

Investing.com – The dollar inched up on Wednesday morning in Asia but remained near multi-week lows as subdued U.S. bond yields also diminished the U.S. currency’s yield appeal.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 91.40 at 12:37 AM ET (4:37 AM GMT) but was at a seven-week low.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 108.09.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 0.7711 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 0.7168.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.4493 while the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3920.
The dollar did get some support, however, as global shares pulled back from record highs as COVID-19 numbers continue to soar globally and put paid to expectations of a quick economic recovery.
The dollar index ""has broken down through a key short-term support level at 91.30 and can see further downside to the low 90s,"" with the euro rising to around $1.22, Westpac analysts in a note.
""We were looking for the [index] to top in the third quarter when second derivative U.S. rebound measures crest and Europe gets her vax act together, but the early indications are that vaccinations across Europe are picking up pace already,"" the note added.
The euro traded at $1.2039, after climbing to a seven-week high of $1.2079 during the previous session. The European Union’s procurement of an additional 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) and  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) also lent support to the single currency.
The European Central Bank is also due to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
Investors’ flight to safety also boosted the yen, another safe-haven currency, and the Japanese currency climbed to a seven-week high against the dollar.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hovered around the 1.56% mark and near its lowest level since mid-March 2021, continuing its consolidation following its retreat from a 14-month high at the end of March. Mounting evidence that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be slower in tightening monetary policy than it had appeared to the market have led to declines in U.S. yields and the dollar in April, according to some investors.
Meanwhile, surging COVID-19 numbers globally also triggered investor caution. India reported 1,761 deaths from COVID-19, a record daily toll, and there were more than 142.5 million COVID-19 cases as of Apr. 21, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Inflows into cryptocurrency funds and products hit $4.9 billion as of April 16, with the pace of increase slowing a bit in the first two weeks of the month after hitting record levels in the first quarter, data from digital currency manager Coinshares showed on Tuesday.
Inflows in the first two weeks of April hit about $400 million to $4.9 billion, or about 9% higher than an all-time high of $4.5 billion in the first three months of the year.
The pace of inflows had already moderated in the first quarter, after a 240% surge in the fourth.
That said, inflows in the second week of April totaled $233 million, the largest since early March, Coinshares said.
Bitcoin's rise also slowed in the first two weeks of the month, growing just 5.7%, although it hit a record just under $65,000 during that period. After touching that all-time peak last week, bitcoin has plunged nearly 18% in six days. Bitcoin last traded up 0.8% at $56,161. 
""There were ... signs of excessive exuberance in the market, and a correction looked imminent,"" said Pankaj Balani, chief executive officer of Delta Exchange, a crypto derivatives trading platform.
Inflows last week were more spread out to include other digital assets outside of bitcoin and ethereum.
Bitcoin still saw the largest inflows of $108 million, with ethereum snagging $65 million. But investors poured money into other digital tokens, including bitcoin cash, Polkadot, Binance, and Tezos, Coinshares data showed.
Crypto assets under management (AUM) have also surged to a peak of $64.2 billion, the data showed. In the first quarter, the sector's AUM was $59 billion. Last year, assets under management for the sector hit $37.6 billion.
Grayscale is still the largest digital currency manager, with $49.5 billion in assets as of the second week of April, while CoinShares, the second biggest and the largest European digital asset manager, oversees about $5.7 billion in assets.

XRP has been the most popular digital asset in recent weeks with weekly inflows of $33 million, nearly doubling its assets under management to $83 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - Dogecoin prices hit an all-time on Tuesday, with a market capitalisation above $50 billion, after social media fans used hashtags to fuel a rally in the meme-based cryptocurrency.
An 8,000% price surge this year has seen Dogecoin, which was launched as a satirical critique of 2013's cryptocurrency frenzy, overtake more widely-used cryptocurrencies like Tether to become the fifth-largest coin. 
While Dogecoin, whose logo features a Shiba Inu dog at the centre of the meme, a represents only a fraction of bitcoin's $1 trillion value, it can be traded on crypto exchanges and more popular mainstream trading apps.
""The Doge rally represents an interesting convergence,"" said Diana Biggs, CEO of crypto start-up Valour, after Dogecoin's price soared by more than five-fold in the last week to a record $0.42, according to CoinMarketCap.
""A meme coin created as a joke for early crypto adopters whose community found that kind of thing to be fun, with now a new generation of retail investors for whom memes are a native language,"" Biggs added. 
Dogecoin fans used the hashtags #DogeDay and #DogeDay420 to post memes, messages and videos on Twitter, Reddit and TikTok, referring to the informal April 20 holiday to celebrate cannabis which is marked by smoke-ins and street parties.
""GIMME THAT DOGECOIN LAMBO!!! #DogeDay"" one tweeted, referring to the Lamborghini car popular in crypto culture.
ONLINE TRADING 
Dogecoin's rise has come amid a surge in online trading of stocks and crypto by retail investors, stuck at home with extra cash because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has not coincided with a growth in usage of the coin for payments or in commerce.
The same trend has spurred a boom in usage of online trading apps like Robinhood, and also fuelled the social-media driven rally in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock that pitted retail investors against hedge funds earlier this year. 
""It's an extension of the same phenomenon that has led Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock to be valued well beyond fundamentals and more recently to the GME (GameStop) short squeeze,"" said Ajit Tripathi, head of institutional business at decentralised finance startup Aave.
Like other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin's price is heavily influenced by social media users including Tesla chief Elon Musk, whose tweets on the cryptocurrency in February sent its price soaring over 60%.

""If this goes as planned and everybody including Mr Musk go ahead and just pour money into Doge on April 20th all at once Doge will reach prices that originally were not even conceptual,"" a TikTok user said in a video promoting the coin.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Tuesday, trading near a six-week low, with the euro, in particular, benefitting from progress for the region's vaccination programme.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.1% lower at 90.925, having earlier fallen as low as 90.858, the weakest since March 3.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 108.30, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3990, after posting a fresh one-month high at $1.4009, helped by better than expected unemployment data. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.6% to 0.7800, hitting a new one-month high as the Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its latest policy meeting earlier in the day.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2052, after climbing as high as $1.2072 for the first time since March 3.
The euro suffered against the greenback in the early months of this year as the European Union was slow in the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, suffering a third wave of cases as a result. However, the region is catching up, helped by the announcement that the EU has secured an additional 100 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.
“The good news is that lockdowns imposed last month do seem to have stabilized/reversed the rise in case numbers in many continental European countries. And vaccination rates do seem to be improving,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The dollar had already been losing traction as U.S. bond yields have slumped from the 14-month peak touched last month, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.60%, reducing the greenback's yield attraction.
This followed repeated assurances from Fed policymakers that near-term price pressures will be transitory, and can be 'looked through'.
Attention will soon turn to Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank, although few fireworks are expected.
“We do not expect to see any major market reactions to this week’s ECB meeting, but if we have to take a stance, we see risks tilted towards a slightly hawkish market reaction,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, “as [ECB President Christine] Lagarde may struggle to defend the changed pace of purchases as being that significant in light of the recent numbers.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.4960, after the People’s Bank of China kept its loan prime rate steady at 3.85% earlier in the day, as widely expected.
China’s economy is on track to return to trend growth after its V-shaped recovery from the coronavirus slump ended with a record pace of expansion last quarter, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 1.529% during the week. Although it climbed up to 1.605% by Monday, it is below its March 2021 peak of 1.776%, when investors speculated the U.S. Federal Reserve could alter its dovish policy.
""One of the probably most important developments in macro markets over the last month has been a stability in U.S. rate. That also opens up room for dollar weakness against a broad set of currencies,"" said Goldman's Pandl.

The moves are the reverse of what was happening in the first three months of the year, when the dollar gained against the very same major currencies as yields rose on U.S. Treasuries and offered higher returns on the greenback.
At that time, bond investors bet that massive fiscal stimulus in the United States would spur faster inflation, leading to an earlier exit from the Federal Reserve's monetary easing programme.
But repeated assurances from Fed policymakers this month that near-term price pressures will be transitory seem to have soothed markets.
""I think that people are quite comfortable ... that the dollar is likely to be weaker structurally for longer,"" said Andrew Gillan, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.
""And I don't think we've seen enough evidence yet of that changing, even with a little bit of recent strength.""
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 1.529% last week. Though it ticked up to 1.615% on Tuesday, it stood well below its March peak of 1.776%.
""One of the probably most important developments in macro markets over the last month has been a stability in U.S. rates,"" said Goldman's Pandl.
""That also opens up room for dollar weakness against a broad set of currencies.""
The Australian dollar rose as high as $0.7800 for the first time in a month after Reserve Bank of Australia policymakers said in minutes of their meeting this month that the country's economic recovery has surpassed all expectations, with an ""above-trend"" expansion likely this year and next.
The offshore Chinese yuan firmed to as strong as 6.4885 per dollar, also a one-month high.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin slipped to around $55,000, on track for a fifth straight day of losses.
It sank as low as $51,541.16 on Sunday, after hitting a record high of $64,895.22 just days earlier.
Despite the retreat, the digital token has still almost doubled in value so far this year, after more than quadrupling in 2020.
""The recent drop in price for BTC definitely damaged the technical picture: The old resistance level around $60,000 should have held up and catch the decline, but it did not,"" Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at Stockcharts.com, said by email.
However, the ""long-term trend for BTC -- and crypto in general -- seems unharmed.""

410,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"The Reserve Bank of Australia said its policy settings were helping hold down the currency, while surging property prices meant it needed to monitor trends in home borrowing, according to minutes of its April meeting.
(Bloomberg) -- Easy policy “continued to support the economy by keeping financing costs very low, contributing to a lower exchange rate than otherwise,” the central bank said Tuesday in the minutes. “Members agreed that it would be important to watch carefully for increased risk-taking by lenders.”
Australia’s V-shaped recovery is reflected in the labor market, with hiring surging and unemployment falling even as the labor force swelled to a record last month. The economy faces a challenging few months ahead with the expiry of the government’s vast JobKeeper wage subsidy program, forcing firms and households to stand alone.
“While the overall recovery in the labor market was expected to pause in the period ahead, this was expected to be only temporary,” the RBA said. “It was likely that the full effect of the end of the JobKeeper program would become apparent over several months.”
Australia's jobless rate dropped to 5.6% in March as employment soared by more than 70,000, according to data released last week, after policy makers held their meeting.
The central bank said in the minutes that A$95 billion had been drawn from its lending facility that provides cheap funding to banks and a further A$95 billion was available until the end of June. The board said it would consider extending the facility if “there were a marked deterioration in funding and credit conditions.” There are no such signs currently, the bank said.
The RBA is currently tapping a second A$100 billion tranche of quantitative easing to help hold down the currency. Beyond this, the bank said it would undertake further bond purchases “if doing so assisted with progress towards the goals of full employment and inflation.”
It reiterated that a decision on whether to roll over yield curve control to the November 2024 three-year bond from the current April 2024 maturity would be made later in the year. Its decision would be guided by “the flow of economic data and the outlook for inflation and employment.”
Australia's hot housing market is likely to be increasingly central in RBA discussions, with house prices rising in March at the fastest pace since 1988.
“Given the environment of rising house prices and low interest rates, the bank would be monitoring trends in housing borrowing and the maintenance of lending standards carefully,” it said.
Yet Australians, like counterparts in much of the developed world, have solid financial buffers as people saved government cash payments during the height of the pandemic. The rapid recovery in the labor market is helping households meet their financial commitments.
The RBA noted survey data suggested income and savings increased for most household income groups, “with most of the additional saving undertaken by higher-income households.”
The RBA also provided some observations on the economy's performance in the first quarter:
In a cross-country reference discussion, the RBA noted that despite Australia's rapid recovery in employment, wages growth had slowed to a greater extent “and had been more subdued than in other countries.” A key reason is Australia's labor market adjusted by reducing hours and restraining wages, whereas countries like the U.S. adjusted through a decline in employment.
The upshot is that the central bank's goal of wages growth sustainably above 3% to return inflation to target remains a high hurdle.
The RBA also noted in the minutes that the board would have a broader discussion on the implications of climate change for financial stability in coming months.

Investing.com – The dollar fell sharply against its rivals Monday as analysts declared the recovery in the greenback over, but stopped short of ruling out a ""second wave"" of strength on worries the Federal Reserve could raise rates sooner than expected.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.50% to 91.08.
""The short-term recovery of the dollar is over for now … [but] we cannot rule out the possibility of a 'second wave' of USD recovery,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The bank suggested there was a risk the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected that would justify an ""expensive"" dollar. ""The Fed could once again (as it did in 2015 to 2019) pursue a monetary policy in the medium term that is so qualitatively different from that of the ECB that an ""expensive"" dollar would be justified.
In the event of a second coming of dollar strength, the move will be short-lived as inflation is unlikely to trend materially above target and prompt aggressive Fed action. ""The assumption of rapid Fed rate hikes is ultimately based on the assumption that U.S. inflation will not only pick up in the short term due to (partly Corona-related) special effects, but will sustainably firm up to levels above the Fed target. We do not share this view of the market,"" Commerzbank added.
The dollar made a poor start to the week, compounding its losses from last week, following a slip in U.S. bond yields.
U.S. bond yields gave up some of their gains Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yields at 1.59%, down from 1.61% at the highs of the day.
Still, the latest positioning data showed bullish bets on the greenback hit their highest level for the year so far.
Net longs speculative bets on the dollar were at the highest level year-to-date, according to a CFTC positioning report for the week ended on April 13."

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely flat in early European trading Monday, remaining near a one-month low, with Treasury yields hovering near the lowest levels in five weeks. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was marginally lower at 91.523, not far from last week’s low of 91.484, a level not seen since March 18.
USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 108.53, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1968, near the highest since March 4, GBP/USD was up 0.2% at 1.3857, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7741.
The 10-year Treasury yield last traded at 1.55%, a sharp fall from the high of just short of 1.78% seen at the end of last month, reducing the appeal of dollar-denominated assets as an investment.
“One of the biggest perceived risks to the 2021 recovery story playing out in financial markets is that of a bond tantrum – or a disorderly rise in U.S. yields,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “It has thus been surprising … to see the large decline in U.S. yields, despite above consensus U.S. CPI and retail sales.”
The Federal Reserve has been persistent in communicating with the market that it will look through rises in inflation, considering them temporary, keeping the central bank’s ultra easy monetary policies in place for some time.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller continued the theme on Friday, saying the U.S. economy ""is ready to rip"" as vaccinations continue and activity picks up, but a rise in inflation is likely to be transitory.
“We are tempted to say that DXY [the Dollar Index] made an important corrective high at 93.44 at the end of March – and is now heading for a retest of the year’s lows at 89.21,” ING added.
The European Central Bank meets virtually later this week, and little new is expected with policy makers keen to avoid rocking the market given weaning financial markets off emergency stimulus is likely to be a fraught task.
“April has so far been a good month for EUR/USD – despite Europe still struggling with third Covid waves. It seems investors are being very forward-looking and using the recent inflection higher in European vaccination rates to draw confidence in a European recovery later in the quarter,” ING said. 
Elsewhere, USD/RUB rose 0.5% to 76.192, with the U.S. warning of “consequences” if jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies, deepening the conflict over the dissident who has already survived an alleged assassination attempt.
The U.S. ordered a raft of new sanctions against Russia on Thursday, including restrictions on buying new sovereign debt, in response to allegations that Moscow was behind a hack on SolarWinds and interfered with last year’s U.S. election.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The dollar was pinned near a one-month low to major peers on Monday, with Treasury yields hovering near the lowest in five weeks, after the U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated its view that any spike in inflation was likely to be temporary.
The safe-haven greenback was also held down by improved risk sentiment amid a rally in global stocks to record highs.
Bitcoin nursed losses from Sunday, when it plunged by as much as 14% to $51,541. It last traded around $57,020.
The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six rivals, was at 91.623, not far from the low of 91.484 marked last week, a level not seen since March 18.
The greenback bought 108.655 yen, near the lowest since March 24. 
The euro changed hands at $1.1958, near the highest since March 4.
""The fixed-income market will dominate my world this week,"" with the risk currently skewed to further U.S. yield declines, pressuring the dollar, Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Markets Ltd, a foreign exchange broker based in Melbourne, wrote in a client note.
Wall Street's gains amid low volatility ""should keep USD rallies contained and attract further USD sellers,"" he wrote.
Benchmark 10-year yields could fall to as low as 1.47%, from around 1.57% currently, according to Weston.
Key technical points are 91.30, the March 18 low, for the dollar index, and $1.2000 for the euro, which could trigger a run to $1.22, he said.
The 10-year Treasury yield sank to as low as 1.5280% last week, from a more-than-one-year high of 1.7760% at the end of last month, reducing the dollar's appeal.
The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday, extending a rally in global stocks. MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks held on Monday near Friday's all-time peak.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on CNBC on Friday that the U.S. economy ""is ready to rip"" as vaccinations continue and activity picks up, but a rise in inflation is likely to be transitory, echoing comments from other Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell over the past week.
Dollar net short positioning fell in the latest week to the lowest level since June 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, Masafumi Yamamoto, sees the current quarter as a period of consolidation in U.S. yields and the dollar, with the benchmark Treasury yield potentially dropping below 1.5% and the dollar weakening below 108 yen.
The outline of President Joe Biden's infrastructure spending plan has already been priced in, and there will be limited progress in negotiations in the near term, Yamamoto said. 
But the uptrend in U.S. yields and the dollar will resume in the third quarter, when Congress is likely to approve the plan, the U.S. vaccine rollout will be far along and market speculation about a tapering of Fed stimulus will be mounting, he said.
Bitcoin on Monday remained well below the record high of $64,895.22 reached on April 14 following its weekend plunge. 
Data website CoinMarketCap cited a blackout in China's Xinjiang region, which reportedly powers a lot of bitcoin mining, for Sunday's selloff.
Analysts at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) cited ""speculation in several online reports"" that the U.S. Treasury may crack down on money laundering within digital currencies for the sharp move lower. 
The bitcoin rout also followed a decision on Friday by Turkey's central bank to ban the use of cryptocurrencies for purchases.
Despite recent weakness, the world's most popular cryptocurrency remains up 97% in 2021, after more than quadrupling last year.
Mizuho's Yamamoto also pointed to regulatory concerns as the likely trigger for the weekend selloff, but doesn't expect those jitters to scupper the rally longer term.
""I would say the bigger trend for bitcoin has been the increased use by big financial institutions and corporates like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),"" he said. ""I think a new record high is reachable in the coming weeks.""

Improved risk sentiment amid a rally in global shares to record highs also capped gains for the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.11% to 91.648 by 12:30 AM ET (4:30 AM GMT), hovering near the low of 91.484 hit during the previous week in a level not seen since Mar. 18.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 108.66.
The AUD/USD pair was inched up 0.01% to 0.7734, with the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing the minutes from its latest meeting on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7140.

Bitcoin was last trading down 10% at $53,991 as of 1320 GMT, a whopping $12,000 below record highs set on Wednesday. Smaller rival Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, dropped 10% to $2,101.

Luke Sully, CEO at digital asset treasury specialist Ledgermatic, said in an email that people ""may have sold on the news of the power outage in China and not the impact it actually had on the network"". 
""The power outage does expose a fundamental weakness; that although the Bitcoin network is decentralized the mining of it is not,"" Sully added. 
Some widely-followed blockchain analysts on Twitter pointed to a sharp drop in ""hash rate"" due to the outage.
Hash rate refers to the volatility index that measures the processing capacity of the entire Bitcoin network, and it determines the power required by miners to produce new Bitcoins.
""Typically shocks to hash rate do not cause price drops. A hash rate reduction slows transactions, which ironically makes it harder to move coins to exchanges for sale. The recent price drop is well within the bounds of typical volatility, it is noise not signal,"" said Edan Yago, co-founder at Bitcoin-based decentralised finance protocol Sovryn. 
The retreat in Bitcoin also comes after Turkey's central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies for purchases on Friday.
Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said cryptocurrencies had been ripe for a pullback.
""The market has become overly aggressive and bullish on everything,"" said Edward Moya. ""It could have been any bearish headline that could have triggered this reaction."" 

Many cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, setting the stage for price swings at unpredictable hours. Historically, retail and day traders have driven the moves.
Despite the sudden selloff, bitcoin is still up 89% so far in 2021, driven by its mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment, accompanied by the rush of retail cash into stocks, exchange-traded funds and other risky assets.

There are many issues with using a digital currency across national borders, according to former People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. International use could affect monetary policy independence, and it’s important it isn’t used for crime, he said Sunday on a panel at the Boao Forum in China.
China’s central bank is currently testing the use of a ‘digital yuan’ in various pilot programs across the country. There’s no timeline for rolling this out nationwide, but the PBOC intends to increase the scope of its tests, Deputy Governor Li Bo said on the same panel.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia on Friday asked 10 U.S. diplomats to leave the country in retaliation for Washington's expulsion of the same number of Russian diplomats over alleged malign activity and suggested the U.S. ambassador return home for consultations.
The measures, part of a broader retaliatory package, were approved by President Vladimir Putin, as a response to an array of U.S. government sanctions imposed on Moscow a day earlier, including curbs to its sovereign debt market.
Though Moscow responded swiftly and with measures designed to hurt U.S. interests and shrink its diplomatic footprint, it left the door open for dialogue and did not kill off the idea, proposed by President Joe Biden, of a Putin-Biden summit. 
""Now is the time for the United States to demonstrate good sense and to turn its back on a confrontational course,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. 
""Otherwise an array of painful decisions for the American side will be implemented.""
It said it had options to hurt the United States economically and to shrink its diplomatic corps in Russia to just 300 people, but was holding fire for now.
Russia-U.S. ties slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after Biden said he thought Putin was a ""killer"" and Moscow recalled its ambassador to Washington for consultations. The envoy has still not returned almost a month later.
The Russian foreign ministry said John Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, should return home for consultations too. 
Washington said its own sanctions were payback for Russia interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions. 
Russia denies all the U.S. allegations.
The Russian response on Friday was ""escalatory and regrettable,"" a State Department representative said by email.
""It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States."" 
RETALIATION
Moscow's response was mostly tit-for-tat.
It expelled 10 U.S. diplomats and banned eight high-ranking current and former U.S. officials from entering Russia for their contribution to what it called Washington's ""anti-Russian course"".
Those banned included FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
Others to face an entry ban were Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal, Director of the Domestic Policy Council Susan Rice, John Bolton, the former U.S. National Security Advisor, and ex-CIA head Robert James Woolsey.
The Russian foreign ministry said it would also end the activity in Russia of U.S. funds and NGOs which it believes interfere in the country's internal affairs, while Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, spoke of potential ""painful"" measures aimed at U.S. business in Russia.
Other measures were designed to make it harder for the U.S. embassy to staff itself. 
Biden, after imposing sanctions on Moscow, had called for a de-escalation in tensions and had said it was vital the White House and Kremlin kept communication lines open.
He has also proposed that he and Putin meet for a summit. 
""(Putin) has repeatedly said we're ready to develop dialogue as much as our counterparts are ready to do so. In this sense it is probably positive that the views of the two heads of state coincide,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters before the Russian counter sanctions were unveiled. 
""Their views categorically do not coincide when it comes to creating mutually beneficial relations and taking each other's interests into account,"" Peskov added, however.
The foreign ministry said Biden's Putin summit proposal had been initially well received, but was now being studied in the context of unfolding events.
""We would like to avoid a further escalation with the United States. We are ready for calm and professional dialogue,"" the ministry said.
""However the reality is that we hear one thing from Washington and in practice we see something completely different. There should be no doubt - not a single sanctions 'wave' will remain unpunished.""

The Kremlin says Putin has yet to decide whether he will take part in a U.S.-led climate summit next week. 
It has also said it would be hard to quickly organise a Putin-Biden summit.

Investing.com – The dollar looks set to post a second-straight weekly decline Friday, shrugging off a wave positive data earlier this week, and will continue to do so as most of the good news has already been priced in, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.01% to 91.55.
Data earlier this week including retail sales and initial jobless claims surprised to the upside, but that drew little support to the dollar. The humdrum reaction suggests ""the positive effect of Biden’s economic stimulus package and good vaccination progress in the US is largely priced in,"" Commerzbank said. ""Strong U.S. data can no longer support the U.S. dollar.""
With most of the strong data and positive vaccine news now priced in, the greenback will struggle to make gains in the short-term.
The immediate horizon, meanwhile, doesn't offer up much reason for optimism for dollar bulls. A helping hand from the the Federal Reserve is still aways off as Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was ""highly unlikely"" to raise rates before 2022.
""We've said we expect to keep rates where they are until meet three-part test,"" Powell said Wednesday at a virtual event organized by the Economic Club of Washington. The three part test includes maximum employment, inflation reaching 2%, and on track to run moderately above 2% for some time.    
Biden’s new infrastructure plan, aimed at long-term economic momentum, however, could provide the ammo needed for the dollar to rediscover its form, but progress on the legislative measure is unlikely until the summer.
""The infrastructure plan is contentious, and if it were to pass Congress, would only become more concrete in the summer,  […] for now, the plans are too abstract to support the dollar on a sustainable basis,"" Commerzbank added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday said Vietnam, Switzerland and Taiwan tripped its thresholds for possible currency manipulation under a 2015 U.S. trade law, but refrained from formally branding them as manipulators under a separate law. 
In the first semi-annual foreign exchange report issued by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Treasury said it will commence ""enhanced engagement"" with Taiwan and continue such talks with Vietnam and Switzerland after the Trump administration labeled the latter two as manipulators in December.
Treasury said Taiwan, Vietnam and Switzerland exceeded its 2015 currency thresholds during 2020 - a more than $20 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP.
Despite this finding, Treasury said there is insufficient evidence under an earlier 1988 law to conclude that Vietnam, Switzerland, or Taiwan are manipulating their exchange rates to gain a trade advantage or prevent balance of payments adjustments.
""For calendar year 2020, we have not made a finding regarding the manipulation designation,"" a Treasury official told reporters, adding: ""We don't view this as a mixed message.""
A Treasury official said it was possible for countries to meet the tests under the ""mechanical"" 2015 law and not be manipulating their currency to boost exports. 
He said the report's findings take into account the massive trade and capital flow distortions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policy choices governments took to respond to it.
Without the pandemic, the ""results would have likely been quite a bit different,"" including for the three economies that hit the engagement triggers, the official added.
Treasury's report also said the COVID-19 crisis was likely to continue to affect current account positions over the next year as recoveries accelerated in some economies and lagged in others, adding that these changes were cause for concern.
ACTION PLANS
The enhanced engagement includes formal talks to urge Vietnam, Switzerland and Taiwan to develop plans with specific actions to address underlying causes of currency undervaluation and external imbalances, Treasury said in a statement.
The talks also will help Treasury determine the reasons for the three trading partners to make substantial currency market interventions.
For Taiwan, Treasury said it would initiate enhanced engagement in line with the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. It expects those talks to help determine if Taiwan manipulated its currency under the 1988 law.
Switzerland rejected Treasury's assessment and denied that it engaged in any form of currency manipulation.
An official with Taiwan's central bank said the U.S. decision showed that there was continued good communication between Taipei and Washington on the issue and that U.S. authorities understood Taiwan's ""special situation."" 
No immediate reaction was available from Vietnam.
MEXICO, IRELAND MONITORED
Treasury said no other major U.S. trading partner met the relevant 1988 or 2015 legislative criteria for currency manipulation or enhanced analysis during the review period.
Treasury urged China to improve transparency regarding its foreign exchange intervention activities, the policy objectives of its exchange rate management regime, the relationship between the central bank and foreign exchange activities of the state-owned banks, and its activities in the offshore yuan market.
Treasury said it found that 11 economies warrant placement on Treasury’s ""Monitoring List"" of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices: China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Ireland, Italy, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Mexico. All except Ireland and Mexico were included in the December 2020 report to Congress.
Reaction in the foreign exchange market was muted, with the Swiss franc modestly stronger and the Mexican peso only slightly weaker.
Analysts said the report may take some pressure off Vietnam and Switzerland and would not deter the Swiss National Bank's ultra-expansive monetary policy.

""This strikes me as a political decision, not a rules-based decision,"" said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY), adding that the Treasury appeared to be trying to determine the intent of foreign exchange policies.
""It sounds like the administration is trying not to offend allies here ... those allies that are going to be most important in containing China,"" Wizman said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its worst back-to-back weekly drop this year amid an extended retreat in Treasury yields as investors increasingly bought into the Federal Reserve's insistence of keeping an accommodative policy stance for a while longer.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dipped to a one-month low of 1.528% overnight, moving further away from over a one-year high of 1.776% reached at the end of last month, even in the face of Thursday's stronger-than-expected retail sales and employment data.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on the same day that the U.S. economy is still far from making ""substantial progress"" toward the central bank's goals of 2% inflation and full employment, the bar the Fed has set for beginning to consider reducing its support for the economy.
That echoed Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments in several speeches over the past week that policymakers will look through near-term rises in prices amid ongoing slack in the labour market.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, dipped to an almost one-month low of 91.487 on Thursday before steadying to 91.654 in the European session.
It's set for a 0.5% decline for the week, extending the 0.9% slide from the previous week.
The gauge, also known as the DXY, had surged with Treasury yields to an almost-five-month high at 93.439 on the final day of March, on bets that massive fiscal spending coupled with continued monetary easing will spur faster U.S. economic growth and higher inflation, particularly compared to places like Europe.
But bond and foreign-exchange markets now seem willing to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt that inflation pressure will be transitory and monetary stimulus will remain in place for years to come.
""One of the biggest perceived risks to the 2021 recovery story playing out in financial markets is a bond tantrum – or a disorderly rise in U.S. yields,"" ING's global head of markets and regional head of research for UK and CEE, Chris Turner said.
""Thus, it has been surprising this week to see the large decline in U.S. yields, despite above consensus U.S. CPI and retail sales.""
Retail sales increased 9.8% last month, beating economists' expectations for a 5.9% rise, while first-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to the lowest level in more than a year, separate reports showed Thursday.
The dollar traded at 108.94 yen, heading for a 0.8% loss for the week, following a 0.9% decline the previous week. (Graphic: Dollar set for second weekly loss, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyynyovg/dxy.png) 
""We are tempted to say that DXY made an important corrective high at 93.44 at the end of March – and is now heading for a retest of the year’s lows at 89.21,"" Turner said. 
The euro changed hands at $1.1977, set for a 0.5% weekly advance, adding to the previous period's 1.3% surge.
Some analysts also pointed to Wall Street's strong gains, with the S&P 500 and Dow both posting record highs, as weighing on the traditionally safe-haven dollar amid increased risk appetite.
""From a cross-asset perspective, we are seeing a theme in markets, which seems similar to last year in the sense of falling real US yields, rising commodities, declining vol, strengthening equities and general dollar weakness,"" said Mikael Olai Milhøj, chief analyst at Danske Bank. 
Highly anticipated economic data from China on Friday ultimately had little effect on currencies, even as the world's second largest economy posted record 18.3% growth in the first quarter year-on-year.
The Chinese yuan slipped 0.1% to 6.5230 per dollar in the offshore market.

In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin stood around $61,583, below the record high of $64,895 reached on Wednesday, when cryptocurrency platform Coinbase made its debut in Nasdaq in a direct listing.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union insisted on Friday that Britain not change trading rules in Northern Ireland on its own and said it would continue legal action against unilateral British action in the province for as long as necessary.
European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic hosted UK negotiator David Frost for talks on Thursday evening and said that only agreements by joint bodies established by the Brexit divorce deal could provide stability in Northern Ireland.
The British-ruled province is in the EU single market for goods to ensure an open border with EU member Ireland and so requires checks on goods coming from other parts of the United Kingdom. 
Britain in March unilaterally extended a grace period on certain checks to minimise supply disruption, a move Brussels said breached the Brexit divorce deal known as the Withdrawal Agreement and the specific protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.
Sefcovic said in a statement on Friday there was no space for unilateral action. He said both sides had to agreed how to comply fully with the protocol, including ""clear end-points, deadlines, milestones and the means to measure progress"".
Frost said the British government was committed to working through joint bodies and that all solutions had to respect the Good Friday peace agreement ""in all its dimensions"" and to ensure minimal disruption to everyday lives in Northern Ireland.
Both agreed that Thursday's discussion took place in a constructive atmosphere, that talks needed to intensify and that they would jointly engage with business groups, civil society and others in Northern Ireland. 
Frost said that some ""positive momentum"" had been established. 

""But a number of difficult issues remained and it was important to continue to discuss them,"" the British government said in a statement.

Investing.com -- The dollar was a touch higher in early trading in Europe, still supported by strong retail sales and labor market data on Thursday, but still on course to end the week lower, due to falling Treasury yields that are making other currencies relatively more attractive.
Various reports suggest that large institutional participants such as global macro hedge funds have closed out short positions on U.S. Treasuries this week, having been convinced that the Federal Reserve won’t be rushed into tightening monetary policy by a spike in inflation rates over the next few months. That spike is as good as guaranteed, due to the collapse of oil prices in spring 2020, which is creating a huge base effect on year-on-year rates.
The euro has been a beneficiary as the yield differential has narrowed – not least because the decline in Treasury yields has gone hand-in-hand with signs of a strong U.S. rebound that will support Europe’s export-sensitive economy.
Base effects were also in evidence in a 63% year-on-year rise in European car sales in March.
Earlier, the Chinese yuan was left largely unmoved by first-quarter gross domestic product data showing that the economy grew slightly less than expected. Quarter-on-quarter growth slowed to 0.6% from 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The dollar rose 0.1% against the offshore yuan to 6.5310 but is still down 0.4% on the week.
The news also weakened the Aussie and New Zealand dollars slightly, but these, too, have also made solid gains against the greenback this week.
Later Friday, the U.S. Treasury is due to release its latest report on currency manipulation. The report is expected to be used as an opportunity to signal an end to the previous administration’s policy of talking the currency down in order to narrow the U.S. trade deficit.
In this context, various reports have suggested that China will not be listed as a currency manipulator, but Taiwan – whose foreign exchange reserves have risen sharply in the last year to stop an undue appreciation of the TWD – will be.
The Russian ruble too is ending the week on a strong note. It rose 0.5% against the dollar to 75.91 after the fresh round of U.S. sanctions turned out less punishing than feared. Although U.S. investors will be barred from buying Russian sovereign debt in the primary market, they will still be allowed to use the secondary market.
The opposite is true for the Turkish lira, which is under pressure again after the new central bank governor decided to drop his predecessor’s pledge to keep interest rates high for an extended period of time to bring inflation down. The dollar rose 1.0% against the lira to 8.0872."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but was set to end the week with its worst back-to-back weekly drop in 2021. Treasury yields continued their retreat from more-than-one-year highs as investors increasingly bought into the U.S. Federal Reserve's pledge of continued monetary support.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 91.713 by 12:59 AM ET (4:59 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 108.81.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 0.7738 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7162.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12% to 6.5296. Chinese economic data released earlier in the day said that the GDP for the first quarter grew 18.3% and 0.6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter respectively in March. Although both figures were lower than forecasted, economic growth soared on a yearly basis while slowing down on a quarterly basis.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 1.3767.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to a one-month low of 1.528% during the previous session, from as high as 1.776% at the end of March 2020, even after Thursday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims data.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly also said on Thursday that the U.S. economy is still far from making ""substantial progress"" toward the central bank's goals of 2% inflation and full employment when it will begin to consider reducing its support for the economy.
Investor bets that massive fiscal spending in addition to continued monetary easing will spur faster U.S. economic growth and runaway inflation drove the dollar index, alongside Treasury yields, to an almost five-month high on the final day of March. However, investors now seem more willing to accept the Fed’s assurance that inflation pressure will be transitory and monetary stimulus will remain in place for years to come.
The dollar is ""still struggling to find its feet in April, even though the U.S. macro outperformance narrative could not be more propitious,"" Westpac strategists said in a note.
""The DXY is trading like it's topping out now, sooner than (we) expected,” the note added.
The Russian rouble tumbled during the previous session, losing 2% to the dollar and hitting a more than five-month low versus the euro in volatile trade. The U.S. slapped sanctions against Russia on Thursday after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized the move to punish Moscow’s alleged interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied the allegations, however.

Investing.com – The dollar was flat against its rivals Thursday, shrugging off falling U.S. bond yields on upbeat economic data, though strength in the euro will put a nail in the greenback's resilience, experts say.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.08% to 91.60, after hitting a low of 91.49.
""The combo of stimulus checks, good weather and the reopening propelled retail sales 9.8% m/m in March. This is second largest monthly gain on record, eclipsed only by last May's 18.3% increase,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
The labor market backdrop, meanwhile, appears to be improving following last week's better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report.
U.S. jobless claims fell to 576,000 last week from 769,000 the prior week, a much larger decline the 700,000 expected.
A recovery in the euro has also weighed on the greenback – a trend which some expect to continue as Europe ramps-up its vaccination process.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Taiwan and Thailand risk joining Vietnam and Switzerland in running afoul of U.S. currency manipulation triggers in Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's first foreign exchange report, expected this week, but whether she applies that label is unclear.
The Biden administration has sought to engage more constructively with trading partners and allies, and currency experts say that Yellen could veer from the aggressive approach applied by the Trump administration in the currency report, taking into account the trade and capital flow distortions of the coronavirus pandemic and reviewing the structure of the report.
""I think the Yellen Treasury would be inclined to take a more flexible approach,"" said Matthew Goodman, a former U.S. Treasury official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He added, however, that Yellen's hands are ""tied somewhat"" by the criteria applied to deciding whether a trading partner manipulates its currency. 
Yellen also has challenges in softening Washington's position, facing pressure from labor unions and Democrats in Congress to maintain a tough stance on currency manipulation. 
Trading partners are labeled manipulators if they meet specific criteria - a more than $20 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP - which led the Trump Administration to label Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators in December.
U.S. law requires the Treasury to seek negotiations with manipulators to bring them back below the thresholds, with specified remedies including denying them access to U.S. government procurement contracts and development finance. 
The report is expected to signal how strictly Yellen interprets the criteria, or whether she reverses tightening moves by her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, who reduced the current account threshold to 2% of GDP from 3%, ensnaring more countries.
Mnuchin designated https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-currency/u-s-designates-china-as-currency-manipulator-for-first-time-in-decades-idUSKCN1UV2BK China a currency manipulator in August 2019 at the height of U.S.-China trade tensions, even though Beijing met just one of the criteria. The label was dropped https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-treasury-drops-china-currency-manipulator-label-ahead-of-trade-deal-signing-idUSKBN1ZC2FV five months later when the two countries reached a trade deal, drawing broad criticism that the Trump administration had politicized the report.
Foreign exchange analysts say that Taiwan, with a current account surplus of 14% in 2020, a record $30 billion trade surplus with the United States and net foreign exchange purchases of nearly 6% of GDP, is firmly in Treasury's crosshairs during this cycle, even though the Taiwan dollar remains near 23-year highs.
Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore are in similar straits, analysts say. BBH analyst Win Thin also sees Malaysia and South Korea at risk. 
Although the Swiss National Bank appears to have sold off a tiny portion of its nearly $1 trillion foreign currency pile to show goodwill to the U.S. Treasury, ""that won't be enough to get off the list,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Maxime Botteron.
The Treasury declined to comment on the contents of the forthcoming currency report, as did the SNB.
For Vietnam, the designation has bigger consequences, as the U.S. Trade Representative's office has an active investigation on Hanoi's currency practices that could lead to U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam.
A number of countries are expected to remain or appear on the ""monitoring list,"" BBH's Thin says, among them China, Germany, Japan, Italy, India, Singapore, Ireland and Mexico.
HAWKISH PLEDGE
Yellen told U.S. senators at her January confirmation hearing she would fight for market-determined exchange rates.
But she has currency hawks in Congress - both Democrats and Republicans - watching over her shoulder. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, plans to introduce legislation on Thursday that would make it easier for the Commerce Department to treat currency manipulation as unfair subsidies in trade cases. 
""When other countries engage in unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation, Ohio workers pay the price,"" Brown said in a statement to Reuters.
Taiwan's case is more complicated by geopolitical pressures, including heightened military tensions with China, and the island's position as a major exporter of semiconductors that are needed to help ease a supply shortage for U.S. manufacturers.
Mark Sobel, another former Treasury official, said the latter is among complex issues that do not fit with a mechanical application of the currency manipulator criteria. 

""Treasury has to... inject more nuance into its thinking, not only about the countries, but also about the implications of U.S. policy for these countries,"" said Sobel, now with the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum think tank.

426,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will cut its 2021 state borrowing plan more than expected and will offer only new OFZ treasury bonds from June 14, the date after which U.S. banks will be barred from buying rouble-denominated Russian state debt, the finance ministry said.
The United States imposed a broad array of anti-Russian sanctions, including on purchases of Russian debt, to punish Moscow for alleged interference in U.S. elections, cyber-hacking and other ""malign"" acts.
Commenting on the U.S. move, which battered the rouble and OFZ bonds, the finance ministry said on Thursday it decided to cut this year's borrowing plan by 875 billion roubles ($11.45 billion) and would be flexible over OFZ bond placement plans.
The ministry had earlier considered cutting the 2021 borrowing plan from 3.7 trillion roubles by up to 700 billion roubles.
In order to avoid the risk of forced selling of its state bonds by foreign investors, the finance ministry said it would offer only new OFZ series after June 14 and would stop offering top-up OFZ series that were registered before that date.
The central bank said it was ready to use the tools it has to preserve financial stability if needed.
The bank is due to consider whether to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on April 23.

427,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the first monetary policy meeting under its newly appointed governor.
The Monetary Policy Committee left its key rate at 19% Thursday, in line with the forecasts of most analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The two dissenters, HSBC Bank PLC and Capital Economics Ltd, predicted the meeting would deliver a reduction of 50 and 200 basis points, respectively.
The lira extended gains after the decision and was trading 0.7% higher at 8.0252 per dollar at 2:01 p.m. in Istanbul.
Installed after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan abruptly fired his predecessor following a bigger-than-expected rate increase, Sahap Kavcioglu was under pressure to reduce rates but has so far signaled he would not rush to loosen the stance he inherited.
In a written interview with Bloomberg after his appointment last month, Kavcioglu said markets shouldn’t view a rate cut at the April 15 Monetary Policy Committee meeting as a given, easing some concerns among investors.
“Kavcioglu’s initial communication to markets has done enough to alleviate apprehensions,” said Ehsan Khoman, Head of Emerging Market Research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at MUFG Bank in Dubai. Turkey “does not have the policy room to lower rates this year given the elevated inflation outlook” but Kavcioglu’s dovish views suggest the central bank will eventually take a more accommodative stance, he said before the meeting.
Turkey raised its benchmark by 200 basis points on March 18, at Naci Agbal’s final rate-setting meeting as governor, elevating the key rate adjusted for inflation to one of the world’s highest. A professor of banking, Kavcioglu was among the critics of that move, saying it could damage economic growth.
Last week, Erdogan said the government was determined to both reduce inflation and cut interest rates to single digits, prompting a slide in the lira. The currency has weakened more than 10% against the dollar since the unexpected appointment of Kavcioglu. Foreign investors sold a net $1.2 billion in Turkish equities and a net $1.25 billion in government bonds and the benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index slid 7.6% during the same period.
Inflation accelerated to an annual 16.2% through March, up from 15.6% the previous month because of a global oil rally and weaker currency, leaving the new central bank chief little room to enact the interest-rate cuts that would mollify Erdogan, who holds the unorthodox view that high interest rates cause inflation.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar sank to a four-week low against other major currencies on Thursday as Treasury yields pulled back from last month's surge, with investors increasingly convinced the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for some time.
The Russian rouble sank more than 1% to 76.65 per dollar on reports the U.S. will announce sanctions on Russia as soon as Thursday for alleged election interference and malicious cyber activity.
The dollar index, which tracks the it against six other currencies, dipped to its lowest since March 18 at 91.535 in the European session before recovering to be basically flat at 91.590. 
The euro rose as high as a four-week top of $1.1990, matching the highest level since March 4, before trading little changed at $1.19735. 
The dollar changed hands at 108.87 yen, after hitting a three-week low of 108.755 on Wednesday.
""Following the muted USD reaction to the March inflation numbers earlier in the week, it seems that the positive U.S. inflation and growth stories are now largely priced into USD,"" said ING's chief EMEA FX and IR strategist Petr Krpata. 
""Hence, the positive impact on USD may be limited and with U.S. Treasury yields well behaved, the solid U.S. data may support G10 pro-cyclical FX today.""
Ten-year U.S. bond yields eased to 1.6165% in European trade, down from a 14-month peak of 1.776% reached in late March, reducing the dollar's yield attraction.
Repeated assurances from Fed officials that they will keep interest rates low have helped stabilise U.S. bonds, especially at the short end of the market.
Meanwhile, stocks have marched higher, with the S&P 500 setting records this week.
""Risk sentiment is improving,"" dragging on bond yields and the dollar, said Osamu Takashima, chief currency strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan.
""I believe the dollar weakening trend could continue,"" with a move toward 108 yen and $1.205 per euro in the near term, he said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that in time the U.S. central bank would reduce its monthly bond purchases before it committed to an interest rate increase, a scenario many investors had regarded as a given.
A weaker U.S. dollar also saw commodity currencies supported. The Australian dollar rose as high as $0.7754 on Thursday for the first time since March 23, following a 1% rally the day before that saw it break out of its tight trading band over the past few weeks.
The New Zealand dollar also rose to a three-week high of $0.7174.
""When economic data is strong and the Fed is not turning hawkish, we could see risk-sensitive currencies gaining against both the dollar and the yen,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura Securities.

429,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 04:09AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Russian bonds sank the most since March last year and the ruble tumbled as the U.S. prepared to unveil sanctions on Russian sovereign debt, the so-called “nuclear option” that has dimmed investor appetite for the market for years.
The yield on OFZ bonds due in 10 years jumped 27 basis points, the most since the peak of the pandemic-driven market turmoil over a year ago. The ruble dropped the most since December.
Planned measures include barring U.S. financial institutions from trading new debt issued by the Russian central bank, Finance Ministry and sovereign wealth fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person familiar with the package of sanctions expected to be announced this week said the precise timing of the bond measures wasn’t clear.
“It is OFZ- and ruble-negative in the near-term,”  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV economist Dmitry Dolgin said from Moscow. “The market has been speculating on the likelihood of that for a couple of years, and since mid-2020 the perceived risk of sanctions went up, and the ruble’s discount to its emerging-market and commodity-producing peers doubled.”
Once seen as too big a risk for markets, the bond sanctions are becoming a reality after Russia’s troop buildup on the border with Ukraine sent tensions with the West spiraling. Penalties focusing on Russian individuals and entities could be announced as early as Thursday and come in retaliation for alleged Kremlin misconduct including the SolarWinds hack and efforts to disrupt the U.S. election.
Analysts at  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co. downgraded the ruble and Russian bonds last week, citing the escalating tensions and the risk that U.S. investors might close long positions on OFZs. The Finance Ministry has had to rely on state-run banks to meet demand at its latest debt auctions, and VTB Bank PJSC bought more than 70% of the local notes on offer in sales on Wednesday.
Russian officials say bond sanctions wouldn’t cause much damage to Russia’s financial markets because local banks and non-U.S. investors would step in to replace those forced to sell. A move to ban U.S. banks from buying new issues of Russian Eurobonds in 2019 did little to dent the Kremlin’s access to foreign funding.
“Fundamentally, OFZ sanctions are not a threat to financial stability as the local banks have the capacity to absorb the Minfin placement volumes,” Dolgin said. “But it would affect prices through reduced demand, because in successful years, non-residents bought out two-thirds of the placement volumes.",,,,,

Although some investors remained concerned that the Fed could change its tune later in 2021 should inflation readings climb much higher than expected, they seem to be taking the central bank at its word for now.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed will reduce its monthly bond purchases before committing to an interest rate increase in his speech at the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday. However, many investors already take this scenario for granted.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a one-month low on Wednesday as strong demand at a U.S. bond auction fuelled a widespread drop in Treasury yields, reducing the interest rate advantage the greenback held over other major currencies.
In early London trading, the dollar edged 0.1% lower versus a basket of its rivals to 91.75, its lowest level since March. 19. 
After peaking at a 4-1/2 month high of 93.43 at the end of March, the greenback has since declined nearly 2% as Treasury yields eased.
While rate differentials between U.S. and German benchmark 10-year yields have narrowed slightly to 193 bps from more than 200 bps at the start of the month, they remain considerably higher than 150 bps seen at the start of the year. 
The dollar's decline was further fuelled by a pick up in inflationary pressures which showed U.S. consumer prices rose by the most in more than 8-1/2 years in March at 2.6%. 
Higher inflation failed to translate into expectations of an acceleration in policy tightening. December 2022 futures contracts are signalling a slower rise in implied interest rates, reflecting the Fed's resolve to keep policy on hold.
""The Fed’s continued commitment to loose monetary policy remains a key assumption behind our view that it is still too premature to expect a sustained US dollar rally at the current juncture,"" MUFG strategists said.
The dollar was particularly vulnerable against the yen and the euro, with the single currency threatening to rise above the psychologically important level of $1.20 for the first time since early March.
Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar rose 0.4% to $0.7086 after the country's central bank held its official interest rate and asset purchase programme steady, as expected.
The Singapore dollar rose 0.25% to S$1.3376 after the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) left its exchange-rate policy settings unchanged.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Wednesday, pushed down to three-week lows by falling bond yields after the rise in U.S. inflation in March wasn’t deemed sufficient to change Federal Reserve thinking. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 91.683, falling to its lowest level since March 22.
USD/JPY fell 0.2% at 108.83, touching its lowest level in three weeks, EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.1967, hitting its highest level since mid-March, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3791, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7676.
The U.S. consumer price index jumped 0.6% in March versus the previous month, the largest gain since August 2012, and rose 2.6% from a year earlier, both 0.1 percentage points above market expectations.
While these figures were above consensus expectations, there were some in the market that expected a sharper rise in inflation given the extent of pent up demand on the back of hefty fiscal stimulus and a successful vaccination program.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note dipped to 1.620%, a far cry from the 1.78% level seen at the end of March.
Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly stated that the central bank will treat any near-term price pressures as transitory, and this CPI release is not seen pressuring them to start tapering the ultra-easy monetary policies that have helped the U.S. economy start to recover from the pandemic.
“We also do not expect the pickup in production and international trade costs – evident in the upside surprises in PPI inflation last week – to have a meaningful impact on the CPI, with such costs representing a relatively small input to consumer prices,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note. 
“As such, the outlook for inflation remains a broadly benign one, and we expect the Fed to therefore fully look through this bounce in inflation.”
Elsewhere, NZD/USD rose 0.7% to 0.7101, benefiting from the weaker greenback tone even as New Zealand's central bank held its official interest rate and asset purchase programme steady, widely as expected.
USD/RUB fell 0.4% to 75.63 after U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to tackle a raft of disputes, attempting to reduce tensions following a Russian military build-up on Ukraine's border.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia to a near three-week low against the euro and the yen, thanks to a larger-than-expected rise in the U.S. consumer price gauge.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 91.735 by 12:51 AM ET (4:51 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 108.90.
The AUD/USD pair up 0.38% to 0.7667. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.58% to 0.7092 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand left interest rates unchanged at 0.25% in its decision handed down earlier today.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.5400 and the GBP/USD pair was up 0.22% to 1.3778.
The U.S. core consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month-on-month in March, against the 0.2% growth in forecasts and February’s 0.1% growth, data released on Tuesday said. The CPI grew 0.6% month-on-month, its largest gain since August 2012.
The rise was not a surprise to some investors, however.
""Inflation has been expected to accelerate in the April-June quarter. Although the latest reading was a bit stronger than expected, it wasn't out of the blue,"" Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has said that it will look through temporary increases in inflation, with investors expecting that the central bank will allow inflation to run higher than previously thought before it raises rates.
Philadelphia Fed Bank President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday it is unlikely that inflation will run out of control in 2021, however. Investors now await further comment from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at an Economic Club of Washington event and the release of the Fed’s Beige Book, both taking place later today.
Still, investors remain wary that the U.S. economy will accelerate further, thanks to the fast pace of COVID-19 vaccination rollouts which has allowed economic activities to resume.
""Eventually there will be another large-scale fiscal stimulus, which should support the dollar,"" Mizuho's Yamamoto added.
U.S. bond yields dipped on Tuesday after an auction for 30-year bonds attracted solid demand, thus tapering down inflation worries.
The Russian rouble rose around 2% during the previous session after U.S. President Joe Biden appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to reduce Russia-Ukraine tensions during a phone call.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday as oil rose and the greenback broadly declined, with the loonie rebounding from an earlier six-day low.
The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies after data showed inflation making strong gains in March, though the rise was not expected to alter the Federal Reserve's commitment to keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels for years to come.
""It is more about greenback weakness as opposed to loonie strength,"" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
The S&P 500 closed at another record high as investors shook off concerns about the halt in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine rollout, while the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, was supported by strong Chinese import data.
U.S. crude prices settled up 0.8% at $60.18 a barrel.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2529 to the greenback, or 79.81 U.S. cents, having touched its weakest intraday level since last Wednesday at 1.2628.
Canada said it was talking to Johnson & Johnson about reports that its vaccine might cause rare blood clots, while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a surge in dangerous virus variants could threaten progress made so far.
Ottawa ran a budget deficit estimated at 17.5% of GDP in 2020-21 to support the economy during the coronavirus crisis. It is due next Monday to table its budget for the current fiscal year, which began this month.

Canadian government bond yields eased across the curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year fell about half a basis point to 1.504%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Tuesday, helped by a pick-up in U.S. Treasury yields, while riskier currencies dipped, as markets waited for inflation data in the United States.
The dollar has fallen in April so far, after surging in the first three months of 2021 on expectations that a combination of monetary stimulus and government spending would cause inflation to spike.
U.S. CPI data for March is due at 1230 GMT and is expected to show a rise in inflation.
Markets will also be paying attention to how yields react to a 30-year Treasury auction.
The inflation figure alone was unlikely to move the dollar, said Ned Rumpeltin, head of European currency strategy at TD Securities, but any reaction in U.S. yields could create a knock-on effect on currency markets, particularly in the dollar-yen pair.
At 1103 GMT, the dollar was up 0.1% against a basket of currencies, at 92.221, moving away from recent three-week lows.
Dollar-yen was down 0.2% at 109.150.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 1.6677%, still well below the 1.7760% level reached on March 30, which was the highest in over a year.
""There's a widespread expectation that inflation is set to rise in the coming months, but also a consensus for the most part that this will be a transitory phenomenon,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note.
Likewise, Rumpeltin said that the inflation number could be driven by factors other than demand.
""If there are supply-chain problems and the costs are rising because of it, that's not really inflation in my book,"" he said.
Worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve would scale back - or ""taper"" - its quantitative easing programme was seen as the biggest risk among investors in BofA's fund manager survey released on Tuesday.
Overnight data showed China's exports rose in March, with import growth rising to four-year highs, signalling an improvement in global demand.
Asian stock markets were broadly positive after the data, but the boost did little to support currency markets. In London trading, China's offshore yuan was down 0.1% against the dollar, changing hands at 6.5536.
The euro was down 0.2%, at $1.18935, with European shares just below all-time highs.
The Australian dollar, which is seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, was down 0.2% versus the U.S. dollar at 0.7609.
On Monday, Australia abandoned its goal to vaccinate nearly all its population by the end of 2021.
The New Zealand dollar was steady . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is due to meet on Wednesday and is expected to keep rates constant.

Elsewhere, Bitcoin hit a record of $62,741 on Tuesday, extending its 2021 rally to new heights a day before the listing of Coinbase shares in the United States.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Tuesday, helped by rising Treasury yields, but gains have been limited ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.210, only marginally higher than Thursday's low of 91.995, which was the weakest since March 23.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% at 109.59, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1896, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7610.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note has gained by about 2 basis points to just above 1.69% early Tuesday, after the Treasury auctioned $38 billion of 10-year paper on Monday, although this is still well below the 1.78% level hit on March 30, which was the highest in over one year.
The greenback has eased back along with U.S. yields this month after surging to multi-month peaks on expectations that massive fiscal stimulus and a robust economic recovery will spur prompt the Fed to tighten faster than it is currently guiding.
However, Fed officials have repeatedly stated that the central bank sees any near-term price pressures as transitory, and the central bank will want to see concrete improvements in inflation in employment before it tightens policy.
With this in mind, all eyes will be on the release of the U.S. consumer price index for March, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to show inflation increasing by 0.5% on the month, or 2.5% year-over-year, up from 1.7% in February.
“We do look for DXY [Dollar Index] gains during the early part of the week,” said analysts at ING, in a note, “but failure to advance through the 92.55/70 technical area this week will leave open the scenario that the corrective dollar rally was exhausted on the last day of March.”  
However, it appears the inflation rate (and employment levels) aren’t the only data the Federal Reserve is looking at as a judge as to when to start tightening its accommodative monetary stance.
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Monday that getting three-quarters of Americans vaccinated would be a signal that the Covid-19 crisis was ending, a necessary condition for the central bank to consider tapering its bond-buying program. 
Just over a fifth of Americans are currently fully vaccinated, but worryingly the United States reported an 8% rise in new Covid-19 cases last week, the fourth week in a row that infections have increased, according to Reuters data.
There are speeches later from the Federal Reserve's Mary Daly, Esther George, Patrick Harker and Raphael Bostic.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3748 after Britain's economy grew by 0.4% in February from January.
This was slightly below the expected growth of 0.6%, but the fall in gross domestic product in January was not as severe as previously estimated, down by 2.2% compared with the initial reading of a 2.9% drop.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, but near a three-week low as investors await the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for March, due later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.16% to 92.293 by 13:03 AM ET (5:03 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.32% to 109.72.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.31% to 0.7599 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.30% to 0.7007.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.5515. Chinese trade data released earlier in the day said that exports grew 49% year-on-year in March. Imports grew 38.1% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at USD116.35 billion.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 1.3728.
""The dollar index has been slipping in recent days but should find stability with the U.S. macro outperformance narrative set to get a strong airing"" in data this week, Westpac strategists said in a note, which also forecasts a rally toward 94.500.
""Treasury issuance is surging at the same time as inflationary pressures show in the data, which should lift the U.S. dollar,"" and 10-year Treasury yields are expected to rise toward the top of its recent 1.6-1.755% range in the coming week, the note added.
U.S. Treasuries slowly climbed up on Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year note yield at 1.6764%. Auctions of three- and 10-year notes on Monday saw decent demand, while 30-year notes will go under the hammer later in the day.
“How Treasury yields react to this week’s supply and to key U.S. data releases will undoubtedly provide direction for the USD in the near-term... a strong (CPI) print may re-invigorate inflation fears and lend support to the dollar, "" Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said in her own note.
Foley also forecasts the greenback to trade ""choppily"" in a $1.17 to $1.20 range versus the euro. It is currently at $1.1904, near its weakest level since Mar. 23.
Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren also said on Monday that the U.S. economy could see a significant rebound in 2021 thanks to accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, though the labor market still has much room for improvement."

Investing.com – The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies Monday, but experts appear to be pricing in a bumpy road ahead for the greenback as the short-squeeze trade fizzes out and the Federal Reserve continues to dispel talk of a sooner-than-expected rate hike.  
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.01% to 92.16.
""At this stage, the dollar has lost all its positioning 'advantage,' having a neutral speculative positioning, which suggests we should no longer see dollar rallies against most G10 currencies exacerbated by the unwinding of USD shorts,"" ING said in a note.
The value of the net short dollar positions dropped to $6.103 billion in the week ended April 6, from $8.22 billion the previous week, according to according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The USD net shorts are now worth only 2% of open interest (a drastic move from the peak at 19% on 19 January), ING added.
But dollar bulls could see further pressure from a fall in Treasury yields, which trade inversely to prices, as investors appear to back the Fed's manta that inflation pressures will prove transitory.
""Although inflation readings are likely to be elevated during the next few months –peaking in April at 2.3% –it is likely to be transitory, and below 2.0% on a sustainable basis until 2023,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Sunday said that it is ""highly unlikely"" the Fed would raise rates this year. “I’m in a position to guarantee that the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gained ground on Monday after last week's drop as traders assessed the outlook for Treasury yields, while awaiting crucial U.S. inflation and retail sales data in coming days. 
Elsewhere it was a quiet start to a data-heavy week for foreign exchange markets. 
The euro dipped back below $1.19 while the British pound briefly fell to a two-month low, with some analysts citing blood clot concerns around AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, which the UK has relied heavily on for its aggressive vaccination programme.
The dollar's fortunes have been tied to the performance of Treasury yields for most of 2021, after concerns about rising inflation in the United States and a stimulus-fuelled economic rebound triggered a significant jump in yields on U.S. government bonds in February.
A fall in U.S. yields last week triggered the worst week for the dollar in 2021, but the currency found some stability on Monday.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a U.S. media interview released on Sunday that the U.S. economy was at ""an inflection point"" and looked set for a strong rebound in the coming months, but he also warned of risks stemming from a hasty reopening.
Investors are now waiting for U.S. March inflation data due on Tuesday.
""We are set to see the first evidence of the much anticipated surge in inflation that is widely expected through the coming months as base effects from a year ago begin to take effect as the sharp declines post-COVID start to fall out of the annual calculations,"" said MUFG analysts.
They said the dollar's fortunes could well ""remain linked to 10-year yields"".
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.6462% after dropping to as low as 1.6170% last week. It had surged to a more than a one-year high of 1.7760% on March 30.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.1% to 92.275 while the euro dropped 0.2% to $1.1875.
Bitcoin traded above $60,000, closing the gap to its record high.
Against the pound the dollar initially gained before reversing course. The British currency was last up 0.2% at $1.3734 after briefly touching a two-month low of $1.3669.
The dollar fell 0.2% to 109.41 yen versus the Japanese currency.
""USD has some upside potential this week,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kimberley Mundy wrote in a report.
""Strong U.S. economic data will highlight the divergence between the U.S.’s fast economic recovery and the more stunted recoveries in other developed economies.""

The dollar can lift back toward 110 yen, while the euro has scope to retrace most of the recent gains from its almost five-month low near $1.17, she said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, but still traded near 2-1/2-week lows as the recent decline in Treasury yields undercut support for it. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.248, after falling below 92 late last week for the first time since March 23.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% at 109.57, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1887, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3705, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.76095.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell continued the mantra Sunday that near-term price pressures will prove transitory, and the central bank’s ultra-easy monetary policies were here to stay.
He added the U.S. economy is at an ""inflection point"" with expectations that growth and hiring will pick up speed in the months ahead, but also noted risks that a hasty reopening could lead to a continued increase in coronavirus cases.
This insistence that monetary support is not going to disappear shortly has resulted in the greenback and bond yields weakening after scaling multi-month peaks at the end of last month, powered by expectations the Fed would have to move as an accelerating U.S. recovery from the pandemic lifts inflation faster than expected.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.65%, considerably below the  more than one-year high of over 1.77% seen at the end of March, even after Friday’s stronger-than-expected producer price data.
“By the start of this year it did look fairly obvious that consensus would need to hike U.S. growth forecasts massively following i) fiscal divergence, ii) vaccination divergences and iii) a nice growth boost from previous dollar weakness,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “Now all of that ought to be priced-in to some extent, and more good (and ‘unexpected’) news may be needed to propel yields – or the dollar higher.”
More U.S. data will be released during the week, including the consumer price index on Tuesday, the Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday, and retail sales as well as industrial production data on Thursday.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.4% to 8.1882 ahead of Turkey’s latest current account data, with pressure on the lira set to mount.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the head of the central bank late last month after he lifted interest rates sharply to protect the currency. The new governor, Sahap Kavcioglu, has pledged to deliver price stability, but it’s difficult to see how he can achieve this with Erdogan expecting interest rates to head lower at some point.
During the lira’s last bout of weakness last year, Turkey spent more than $100 billion of foreign reserves to support the currency, according to a report by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and thus the current account data will be studied carefully.
USD/INR rose 0.2% to 74.843, with the rupee hitting an eight-month low overnight as India overtook Brazil to become the second most-affected country in the world.
Indian CPI and industrial production data, due late Monday, will be studied carefully to gauge the impact on the country.
Also, USD/RUB rose 0.3% to 77.614, with a buildup of Russian forces near the border between Ukraine and Russia fueling concerns that Moscow is preparing to send forces into Ukraine again, which could result in further sanctions from the West.

441,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 02:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Indian rupee and stocks declined to multi-month lows, amid worries that expanding lockdowns across the nation may weigh on an economy that is showing signs of recovery from the worst contraction in nearly seven decades.
The Indian rupee dropped past 75 to a dollar for the first time since August 2020, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index declined as much as 3%, the most in nearly two months. India reported record 168,912 new infections on Sunday, taking the tally to 13.53 million cases.
India is facing an escalating health crisis, with its second wave of virus infections hitting record highs. Reports are emerging of hospital beds running short and immunization centers turning away people as they run out of vaccines. Many provinces across the nation, from the financial hub Mumbai to Capital New Delhi, are bringing back stricter restrictions on movement of people to curb the surge in cases.
That and a vaccine shortage “are unnerving markets and no one is sure whether lockdowns will help bring cases under control,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. “The incentive to try and bottom-fish at this point is limited for traders.”
The Nifty 50 Index also dropped by a similar magnitude. All but one of the 19 sector sub-indexes compiled by BSE Ltd. slipped, led by a gauge of property stocks.  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI) was the biggest drag on the Sensex, falling 2.8%.

Both the dollar and bond yields climbed down from their multi-month peaks reached in March, with the accelerating U.S. economic recovery fueling bets of runaway inflation.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has sought to calm these fears, insisting that any near-term price pressures are transitory. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy is at an ""inflection point"" with expectations that growth and hiring will pick up speed in the months ahead in an interview on Saturday, but also warned of risks stemming from a hasty reopening. Powell will also speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Washington.
""Key for the near-term outlook will be whether yields continue to consolidate around these levels, or march higher,"" which would support the dollar, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) strategist Tapas Strickland said in a note.
However, the note also struck a more positive tone, saying that ""the broader thematic of a rapid rebound in the U.S. economy on the back of an impressive COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues,” the note added.
On the data front, Friday’s U.S. producer price index recorded its largest annual gain in nine-and-a-half years, giving the dollar a boost.

Investing.com – The dollar looks set to snap a three-week win streak Friday, and while analysts are expecting short-term gains to resume, the longer-term outlook for the greenback is less convincing.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.10% to 92.17.
""In the coming weeks, the dollar is more likely to gain on account of the strong recovery of the US economy. However, it is likely to weaken again versus the euro in the second half of the year,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The gloomy outlook on the dollar comes as investors are reining in their bets on inflation spiraling out of control and the Fed acting sooner-than-expected.
The injection of further monetary policy from President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan could prove as another potential source of weakness for the greenback.
Further stimulus would ""not be the magic formula with which to boost the US economy … rather, it would only trigger a short- to medium-term artificial boom, which is too obviously finite for the FX market to be seduced by it in the long term,"" Commerzbank added.
In the short-term, however, there is room for the dollar to ride on the coattails of Treasury yields.

The International Monetary Fund said that it sees the U.S., as well as China, as the locomotive for global economic growth. The world’s largest economy, fueled by trillions of dollars in stimulus spending, is expected next year to surpass its pre-pandemic projected level of output.
But many emerging and developing economies, struggling with slow growth and mountains of debt, will take much longer. The central theme of the IMF’s virtual spring meetings with the World Bank was “giving everyone a fair shot” -- a slogan that underlined both concerns about inequality and the importance of speeding up the distribution of vaccines globally.
Here are some of the highlights from the meetings:
Economic Improvement
The IMF said the outlook for global economic growth has brightened since its last estimate in January, forecasting a 6% expansion for the year -- the fastest pace in four decades of data. The U.S.’s $1.9 trillion relief package passed last month will have sizable positive spillovers for trading partners.
Still, emerging-market and developing economies may take until 2023 to recover their pre-pandemic output levels, and the world economy in 2024 will be about 3% smaller than anticipated before the Covid-19 outbreak, according to the fund.
Poorer countries will need to deploy $450 billion to rebuild over the next five years and accelerate their income convergence with advanced economies, according to the IMF, underlining their need to collect more revenue and receive external financing.
Special Drawing Rights
New Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen put her weight behind a proposal for an issuance of $650 billion in IMF reserve assets, called special drawing rights, or SDRs, that was blocked for almost a year by the Trump administration.
The Group of 20 largest economies also backed the plan, which would provide $21 billion in liquidity support to low-income countries, freeing up more resources to spend on health care as the world battles vaccine inequality.
Yet because SDRs are allotted to nations according to their share of the IMF, finding ways to reallocate them once issued will be just as important. The Rockefeller Foundation calls for countries to use at least $100 billion of their unneeded rights to provide support to the developing world. Mexico and Argentina also called for finding more ways for middle-income nations to benefit from SDRs, a proposal that Georgieva said the fund will discuss.
Debt Relief
In the meantime, the G-20 extended its Debt Service Suspension Initiative, or DSSI, for the poorest countries, due to expire in June, to the end of the year, while stating that this will be the final extension of the program started in May 2020. More than 40 participating countries have so far received roughly $13 billion in temporary relief.
Nations stand to receive billions of dollars in additional debt relief. Yet neither the DSSI nor the SDR allocation will avoid debt restructurings for countries that need them, and creditors will need to consider debt forgiveness, said Carmen Reinhart, the World Bank’s chief economist. Already Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia have sought to renegotiate through the G-20’s Common Framework, with more nations likely to eventually join.
Failure to address the debt issues could lead to a “lost decade” for countries in Africa and Asia, said Mohamed El-Erian, president of the University of Cambridge’s Queens’ College and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.
Global Tax
U.S. cooperation with the rest of the global economic community after years of Trump’s “America First” mantra isn’t just on SDRs.
Yellen used a speech on Monday ahead of the meetings to lay out the case for a harmonized corporate tax rate across the world’s major economies. The Biden administration also floated a compromise proposal to counterparts around the world that would apply a new international tax code to, at most, 100 global corporate giants.
While hurdles remain, the surprise U.S. offer could help move previously stalled negotiations to consensus, and G-20 finance chiefs this week pledged to agree on new rules by mid-year. An accord could have significant ramifications for the world, bolstering incomes for many governments as they try to rebuild their economies after the pandemic.
The IMF is very much in favor of a global minimum tax, Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said. “We have a large amount of tax shifting, tax avoidance, countries sending money to tax havens,” she said.
Green Recovery
The Biden administration is pushing aggressively into climate-change policy, a reversal from the Trump years. It’s a priority that the IMF shares.
During an event with Georgieva, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry flagged that Biden would issue an executive order around disclosing climate-change risk, which would affect financial firms. A draft of the document indicates a government-wide strategy is set to be developed within 120 days.
Kerry said Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal is slated to form one part of the climate-friendly approach, which includes funds to make assets more resilient to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels. Georgieva endorsed the green infrastructure focus for generating growth and jobs.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Friday, but remains anchored near two-week lows following disappointing jobless figures and with the Federal Reserve showing no signs for changing its ultra easy monetary policy stance.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.278, after dipping as low as 92.037 earlier Friday for the first time since March 23. The index has dropped around 0.8% this week, the largest fall so far this calendar year.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% at 109.47, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1888, but remains over 1% up this week, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.7% to 0.7595, after a warning from Australia's central bank of excessive lending risk.
Rising Treasury yields amid expectations that a strong economic recovery and rising inflation would force the Federal Reserve to rein in its ultra easy monetary policies sooner than originally thought led to substantial dollar gains last quarter.
However, this tone has changed of late. The weekly initial jobless claims figures on Thursday actually showed U.S. unemployment unexpectedly rose last week, while the minutes for the U.S. central bank’s last meeting showed that the officials remained committed to monetary policy support for some time to come.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell continued the theme at a virtual International Monetary Fund conference on Thursday, stating policy wouldn't shift until there was a prolonged spell of strong economic data, while board member James Bullard said the Fed should not even discuss changes until it is clear the pandemic is over.
“We expect the very accommodative Fed to eventually weigh on USD as we move into the summer,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.4% to 1.3674, with sterling hurt by growing concerns about Britain's reliance on AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine to continue its successful vaccination program.
The vaccine has been plagued by safety concerns amid links to very rare blood clotting issues. Both EU and British medical regulators have declared this week that the benefits of the drug still outweigh the risks, but a number of countries have restricted its use. The U.K. itself has recommended other vaccines should be used, where possible, with younger people.
“GBP is currently the largest speculative long in the G10 FX space based on CFTC data,” added ING, “which clearly exaggerated [the] impact of vaccination concerns.”
Additionally, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.5569 after China released stronger-than-expected March consumer and producer price indexes data earlier in the day. The CPI grew 0.4% year-on-year and the PPI grew 4.4%, its fastest rate in over two and a half years.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar advanced slightly on Friday but was headed for its softest week of the year as strong data in Europe, surprisingly weak U.S. jobs figures and a determinedly accommodative Federal Reserve have prompted investors to trim bets on the greenback.
The euro and yen are also poised for their largest weekly percentage gains in four and five months, respectively, while the dollar index, which has fallen 0.9% this week, is parked near a two-week low at 92.171.
""In short, the energy has gone out of the dollar's first-quarter rebound, just as it has gone out of the bond sell-off,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
In the Asia session, the euro eased 0.1% but held above its 200-day moving average at $1.1900, while the yen pushed through its 20-day moving average to hold at 109.32 per dollar. Both currencies have gained 1.3% against the dollar so far this week.
The euro has also risen more than 2% against the pound this week, bouncing from a one-year low of 84.70 pence on Monday to touch 86.81 pence, its highest since February, amid growing concerns about Britain's reliance on AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine. Sterling was an outlier against the dollar this week and has so far fallen 0.7% to sit at $1.3723. 
The vaccine - developed with Oxford University and considered a frontrunner in the global inoculation race - has been plagued by safety concerns and supply problems. Australia and the Philippines have limited use of the shot, the African Union dropped plans to buy it and Hong Kong has delayed it. 
The Australian and New Zealand dollars meandered in the top half of ranges that have held them for about two weeks. [AUD/]
A slightly cautious mood in equity markets and a warning from Australia's central bank of excessive lending risk put a dampener on the Aussie, which slipped about 0.4% to $0.7623 to put it on track for a 0.4% weekly gain. The kiwi dipped 0.3% to $0.7036 and is up 0.3% on the week.
DOLLAR EBBS
The pause in the dollar's rally follows a solid rebound from what had been the greenback's softest year since 2017. Rising Treasury yields and a growing consensus that the U.S. economy can lead the world out of the pandemic lifted the dollar index 3.6% last quarter, its best quarter in nearly three years.
However after a run of strong data, Thursday figures showed U.S. unemployment claims unexpectedly rose.
Fed speakers also again vowed to keep monetary policy super easy. Chair Jerome Powell said policy wouldn't shift until there was at least a monthslong string of good data, while board member James Bullard said the Fed should not even discuss changes until it is clear the pandemic is over.
A crucial test looms in coming weeks and months, according to Indosuez' head of capital markets in Asia, Davis Hall, as markets and the Fed contend with higher inflation outcomes and possibly a European recovery gathering steam.
European factory gate price rises, meanwhile, accelerated on the heels of surprisingly strong business activity growth.
""We are very skeptical that this is going to remain a sustainable dollar rebound,"" Hall said on the phone from Hong Kong.
""Dollar/yen can move higher and dollar/Swiss can move higher, because of interest-rate differentials, but if U.S. growth is strong, it's not sure that it's going to benefit the dollar provided that Europe can start their own vaccination success and momentum - that's the key.

""We're allowing for the dollar to rally, but we're going to use dollar-rebound strength to diversify away from dollar exposure, and we like Asian currencies.""

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, even as downbeat U.S. jobs figures and a stubbornly dovish U.S. Federal Reserve prompted investors to unwind some bets on the greenback and drove it towards its worst week of the year.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 92.140 by 11:30 PM ET (3:30 AM GMT). The index is parked near a two-week low after falling 1% during the past week.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.05% to 109.30.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 0.7640 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7050.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.5526, with China releasing better-than-expected March consumer and producer price indexes data earlier in the day. The CPI contracted 0.5% month-on-month while growing 0.4% year-on-year, and the PPI grew 4.4% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3735.
Investors remained cautious about the dollar, however.
""In short, the energy has gone out of the dollar's first-quarter rebound, just as it has gone out of the bond sell-off,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) head of FX strategy Kit Juckes told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the euro and yen are poised for their largest weekly percentage gains in five months, with the euro up 1.4% and the yen up 1.3% against the dollar this week.
In the U.S., Thursday’s figures said that jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 744,000, more than the 680,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 728,000 claims filed during the previous week.
The Fed continued to maintain its dovish stance on monetary policy, with Chairman Jerome Powell telling an International Monetary Fund event on Thursday that the stance would only shift after a few consecutive months of positive data. Powell’s colleague and St. Louis Fed president James Bullard added at a separate Southern Illinois University gathering that the central bank should not even discuss changes until there are clear signs that the COVID-19 pandemic is over.
The disappointing jobs data and the comments from the Fed saw Treasuries rise, pushing benchmark 10-year yields to a two-week low of 1.6170% and further denting the dollar’s appeal. The dollar’s loss was risk currencies’ gain, with the AUD and NZD also supported by the broadly upbeat mood in stocks.
""Markets (are) re-thinking the U.S. dollar exceptionalism view... stronger U.S. growth should benefit all global cyclical assets, including the NZD and Asian currencies, and this appears to be the theme now at play,"" ANZ Bank analysts said in a note."
449,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 08:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A bumper payout from Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. could spell trouble for the won this month.
Dividend payments to foreign investors -- which typically pressure the currency in April -- are expected to more than double this month to 10.5 trillion won ($9.4 billion) from a year ago, according to Bloomberg’s calculations based on company filings and data from the Korea Exchange. This is mainly due to a special cash handout from Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics.
The headwinds risk undercutting the positive momentum that’s helped the won outperform its Asian peers over the past one month. The currency has rebounded from its biggest quarterly loss in a year as a recovery in exports and consumer sentiment point to an upturn in South Korea’s economy.
“There is growing vigilance in the South Korean foreign-exchange market as the season of remitting dividend funds out of the country arrives,” said Jeon Seungji, a currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. “Markets will be particularly attentive to such flows around April 16 when Samsung is scheduled to allot its dividends.”
The expected jump in dividend payments this month is largely due to Samsung Electronics’ special cash handout worth 1,578 won per share. Combined with the regular payment, the company’s year-end dividend per stock is worth 1,932 won, more than five times the usual amount.
Still, some say the pressure on the currency will be short-lived. Lim Hyeyoun, an economist at KTB Investment & Securities Co., expects the won to rise as high as 1,080 in the second half of the year, versus its close of 1,117.40 on Thursday.
“Once the events pass, the won is expected to return to its fundamentally adequate level,” Lim said.

Investing.com – The dollar fell against its rivals Thursday, and remains set to snap a three-week winning streak as the reflation trade that had pushed bond yields appear to be running out of steam.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.43% to 92.07.
The dollar followed U.S. bond yields higher, which trade inversely to price, as investors are begging to release ""the bar for the next leg of the sell-off is thus getting higher,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Bets the Fed will be forced to blink on monetary policy in the wake of positive economic news and growing inflation are turning more nuanced as markets have already priced in a Fed lift off in 2022. The central bank continues to reiterate easy monetary policy is here to stay.
""With few left who are not bullish on US growth, markets already way ahead of the Fed (the FOMC's median dot is unchanged until 2024) and the Fed reluctant to push the exit debate, the bar for the next leg of the sell-off is thus getting higher,"" Commerzbank said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday echoed the Fed's narrative of lower for longer rates and the steady monthly purchase of bonds.
""There is a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy from fiscal support, vaccines, but unevenness in recovery is a serious issue,"" Powell said during an IMF panel discussion. ""We want to see a string of months like the March jobs report to see progress.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar traded near its lowest in more than two weeks versus major peers on Thursday, tracking Treasury yields lower, after minutes of the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting offered no new catalysts to dictate market direction. 
Fed officials remained cautious about the risks of the pandemic - even as the U.S. recovery gathered steam amid massive stimulus - and committed to pouring on monetary policy support until a rebound was more secure, the minutes showed Wednesday.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a virtual International Monetary Fund conference later on Thursday.
The dollar index which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six currencies, edged lower to 92.30 in London trading, after dipping as low as 92.134 on Wednesday for the first time since March 23.
The index rallied to an almost five-month high of 93.439 at the end of last month as the U.S. pandemic recovery outpaced that of most other developed nations, particularly in Europe.
""The Fed minutes delivered no negative surprise for risk sentiment, with the committee reiterating no need to rush into tightening of monetary conditions and further support the recovery,"" said Petr Krpata, chief EMEA FX and interest rates strategist at ING. 
""We expect the very accommodative Fed to eventually weigh on USD as we move into the summer - rising inflation, yet no signs of imminent rate hikes will push front-end US real rates further into the deep negative, and coupled with the recovering global economy (which should be of a more synchronized nature in 2H21), should weigh on USD.""
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was around 1.658% on Thursday, after dipping below 1.63% overnight. It hit 1.776% late last month, its highest in more than a year.
The S&P 500 eked out a modest gain on Wednesday, moving mainly sideways since surging to a record high to start the week.
The chief currency strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan, Osamu Takashima, said that the market's direction is difficult to call, but expects the next move for the dollar to be lower.
""Current market sentiment is mild risk-on, and under such circumstances the dollar will weaken gradually - but no big moves,"" he said.
The retreat in U.S. yields has also removed a driver for dollar gains, he added.
The dollar weakened to 109.49 yen , consolidating after retreating from 110.97, its highest in more than a year, reached on March 31.
The euro was almost unchanged from Wednesday at $1.1876, after rebounding from $1.1704, its lowest in almost five months, touched on March 31.
""The vaccination progress in the Eurozone is significantly lagging that of the U.S., and coronavirus infection rates in the Eurozone are on the rise again,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Joseph Capurso wrote in a client note.

""As such, EUR/USD is vulnerable to a move lower towards 1.1700 in the near‑term.""

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Thursday, trading near two-week lows after minutes of the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting pointed - unsurprisingly - to continued loose monetary policy.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.340, after dipping as low as 92.155 on Wednesday for the first time since March 23.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% at 109.70, GBP/USD was up 0.3% at 1.3769, EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1881 after rebounding from the almost five-month low of 1.1704 at the end of March, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.3% at 0.7635.
The minutes for the U.S. central bank’s last meeting showed that the officials remained cautious about the country’s economic recovery from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic, even while acknowledging that the recovery was gathering steam, and committed to monetary policy support until a rebound was more secure.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a virtual International Monetary Fund conference later on Thursday.
Also weighing on the greenback has been the recent slide in bond yields. Although the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield last traded around 1.66%, after dipping below 1.63% during the previous session, this is still a far cry from the more than one-year high of above 1.77% late last month.
“The greenback has been showing signs of weakness this week, especially versus the low-yielders, but it seems too early to conclude this is the start of a broader USD downtrend just yet,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
The dollar's strong rally of the previous quarter was based on the idea that accelerating U.S. economic growth and inflation could force the Fed to abandon its pledge to keep interest rates near zero until 2024.
While the Fed maintained its dovish stance, it did acknowledge that growth was expanding, and a quick look at the situation over in Europe with virus infections on the rise suggests that this competitive advantage is here to stay, at least for the next few months.
“A continuation of the euro’s good momentum is likely to need to rely on a tangible improvement in the EU’s virus/vaccine situation, which may still take some time to materialize, “ added ING.
Elsewhere,  USD/PLN fell 0.2% to 3.8433, while EUR/PLN dropped 0.1% to 4.5640 after the Poland’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.1% for an 11th straight month on Wednesday.
“The post-meeting statement confirms that the Council expects elevated CPI inflation to be only temporary and reiterated the need to continue bond purchases and the bill discount credit program,” ING analysts said, in a note.

454,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yuan is hurting after months of standing tall against the dollar.
In March, the currency gave up all its 2021 gains and then some. There are signs a short-term retreat may be starting as the drivers that lifted the yuan last year -- a quicker economic rebound from the pandemic and investors seeking yields -- get eroded, dimming the currency’s appeal.
Investors flooded into Chinese bond markets in 2020, boosting yuan usage and furthering China’s ambitions to internationalize its currency. But, a spike in Treasury yields is now cutting into the yuan’s yield premium, while an FTSE Russell index inclusion will now take place over a much longer period, slowing inflows. Throw in tensions between Beijing and Washington, and all these are speed-bumps for a currency that jumped almost 7% against the dollar last year.
“Last year, 10-year U.S. versus Chinese government bonds were glaringly attractive whereas that’s compressed now,” Thu Ha Chow, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia in Singapore, said of yield spreads. “Dollar-yuan can go up a bit, but not to the worrying levels like what we saw” previously, she added.
Foreign investors boosted their holdings of Chinese bonds by more than 1 trillion yuan ($153 billion) last year to a record 3.3 trillion yuan, according to data from the central bank. The funds were driven by a yield spread that touched a record of around 2.5% in November, and a resilience that made China’s debts a haven.

So far, the current bout of weakness doesn’t seem to be worrying the People’s Bank of China. Two weeks ago, it vowed to increase currency flexibility, a sign that Beijing will allow the yuan to drop against the dollar. Another policy maker recently expanded the quota for outgoing investments.
“The PBOC will have tools to deal with any sharp depreciation, and it looks to be comfortable with the yuan correction for now,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd.
The yuan’s decline in March, its biggest monthly drop in a year, has arrested a steady advance that saw it head toward 6.4 from a low of 7.18 against the dollar last May.
Yield Advantage
This year, a relentless climb in Treasury yields has narrowed the yield gap of Chinese government bonds by around 1 percentage point from the record high. That advantage looks set to erode further with some on Wall Street forecasting that U.S. yields will climb to 2%.
Adding to the strains is an extension of the inclusion period for Chinese bonds into FTSE Russell’s flagship index to three years rather than the 12 months envisioned.
“The yuan will likely keep weakening in the near-term, as none of the key developments in global markets is good news for the currency.” said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., adding the yuan may drop to 6.6 per dollar soon. “But the depreciation will be temporary, with the currency steadying in the second half, as the dollar rise will lose steam.”
There’s also evidence that Chinese corporates and individuals have become less willing to own the yuan. They cut buying for two months as of February, the first back-to-back reduction in more than two years. At the same time, onshore banks became more active dollar buyers via the swaps market.

To top it off, U.S.-China relations are back in the limelight. The first face-to-face meeting between officials of the Biden administration and their Chinese counterparts failed to reach agreement on the way ahead. Washington recently imposed sanctions over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, spurring a backlash from Beijing.
When the trade war between China and the U.S. escalated in August 2019, the yuan quickly tanked to 7 per dollar, the first time in a decade.
Still, any decline would be temporary, according to Chow at Loomis Sayles. “When the yields become attractive again there’ll be a whole load of people who’d have global mandates needing to allocate to China,” she said. “If there was a big weakness, there’d be an opportunity for people to get back in.”

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.09% to 92.51
""Participants noted that it would likely be some time until substantial further progress toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals would be realized and that, consistent with the Committee's outcome-based guidance, asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until then,"" the minutes showed.

The U.S. 10-year bond yield rose 1 basis point to 1.665% after falling to 1.628% at the lows of the day.
The dollar had made poor start to the week falling for two-straight days, but some were wary of suggesting a downtrend was forming ahead of the minutes.
""The greenback has been showing signs of weakness this week, especially versus the low-yielders, but it seems too early to conclude this is the start of a broader USD downtrend just yet,"" ING said.

456,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Indian rupee tumbled to the lowest in more than four months, with some analysts saying the central bank’s formal plan to buy bonds will add to a liquidity glut.
The rupee fell as much as 1.4% to 74.4288 per dollar, the weakest since Nov. 18. The central bank said Wednesday it will buy one trillion rupees ($14 billion) of bonds in the secondary market this quarter, in addition to its existing liquidity operations.
“A defined primary liquidity infusion via the bond program is de-facto a secondary QE of RBI,” said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. “This will imply massive narrow money growth and primary liquidity which is clearly going to put depreciation pressure on INR.”
The unwinding of carry trades by offshore traders and dividend payout by a corporate also hurt the rupee, according to two Mumbai-based traders who didn’t want to be identified as they aren’t authorized to comment publicly.
The loss on Wednesday has turned the rupee into Asia’s worst performer for the month. A surge in virus infections is also rekindling concerns the authorities may bring back stricter and wider lockdowns. India’s richest state Maharashtra, that houses the financial hub Mumbai, has ordered company employees to work from home and has also shut shopping malls.
“Markets are nervous due to the worsening Covid situation in India, and talks of lockdowns potentially becoming nationwide, and more prolonged rather than what is just announced in Maharashtra, said Unnati Parekh, head of currency derivatives at Kanji Pitamber & Co.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Wednesday, but remained near two-week lows after bond yields fell sharply despite further signs of strong U.S. economic growth.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.390, just above a two-week low of 92.246, slipping further from a five-month high of 93.439 set at the end of last month.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% at 109.78, GBP/USD was down 0.2% at 1.3793, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7649.
The previous quarter saw the dollar's strongest rally in years on rising expectations that accelerating U.S. economic growth and inflation could force the Fed to abandon its pledge to keep interest rates near zero until 2024.
However, these expectations have been reined in at the start of the new quarter, with EUR/USD rallying to a two-week high of 1.1878, and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropping sharply to 1.65%.
Yet many investors still question whether the Fed can stick to its dovish stance, particularly given the recent employment data. Friday’s payrolls report was much stronger than expected while Tuesday’s data showed the job market is creating more opportunities at a faster clip than many economists and employers forecast.
“The labor market is probably running hotter than you think and global key figures are now in tightening territory,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. “Perhaps the Fed’s dual mandate will be fulfilled already by early 2022?”
The market will get a little more insight into what Fed policy makers were thinking about inflation and the current state of the bond-buying program when the minutes of last month's Open Market Committee meeting are released. later Wednesday.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday moved up the Covid-19 vaccine eligibility target for all American adults to April 19, two weeks earlier than the May 1 deadline he announced previously.
Elsewhere, USD/INR soared 0.8% to 74.065, with the Indian rupee falling to the lowest level since November low after the country’s central bank kept its benchmark repurchase rate at a record low of 4% but cut its cash reverse ratio and also signaled readiness to act to support growth. The RBI said it will keep its accommodative stance for as long as necessary.
In Europe, Poland’s central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.1% for an 11th straight month later Wednesday, with worries about the economic damage from tighter Covid-19 restrictions set to outweigh rising inflation and a weaker national currency.
USD/PLN rose 0.1% to 3.8716, while EUR/PLN climbed 0.1% to 4.5959. The zloty hit a 10-year low against the euro last week under pressure from record Covid-19 infections - only three months after the central bank had intervened to stop it strengthening against the euro.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar softened to a two-week low against a basket of currencies on Wednesday after U.S. bond yields declined as traders rolled back aggressive expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten its policy earlier than pledged.
The dollar index hit a two-week low of 92.246, slipping further from a five-month high of 93.439 set on March 31, and last stood at 92.343.
""Following the dollar's strong gains last quarter, some investors appeared to have over-allocation in dollar assets and they probably need to sell dollars for rebalancing,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of FX Sales at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank's Tokyo branch.
The previous quarter saw the dollar's strongest rally in years on rising expectations that accelerating U.S. economic growth and inflation could force the Fed to abandon its pledge to keep interest rates near zero until 2024.
The dollar index rose 3.6% in the quarter, its biggest quarterly rise in three years. Against the yen, the U.S. currency rose 7.2%, the largest since the last quarter of 2016.
As some bullish bets on the dollar were unwound this week, the euro rallied to a two-week high of $1.18785 and last stood at $1.1867. 
Similarly, the common currency jumped almost a pence against the British pound overnight to trade at 85.90 pence, its biggest gain since Dec. 10, in a reversal from the pound's steady gains during the last quarter.
The dollar was on the defensive at 109.77 yen, extending its retreat from a one-year high of 110.97 touched a week ago.
The dollar is nearing a critical juncture to maintain its long-term uptrend, said Osamu Takashima, chief currency strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan, noting a break below a key support level from its 21-day moving average, at 109.40 now, could herald a bearish turn.
Another key technical indicator, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), is already flashing a warning sign, falling below its previous bottom of 66 to 62, he said. 
Traders were recalibrating their expectations on the Fed for now after U.S. interest rates futures earlier this week had priced in a 0.25 percentage point rate hike by the end of 2022.
The five-year U.S. Treasury yields dropped sharply to 0.874% after hitting a 14-month high of 0.988% on Monday. 
Yet many investors think the jury is still out on whether the Fed can stick to its dovish stance.
""Vaccines are now helping to boost U.S. economic activities, while we also have largesse from the government spending and easy money from the central bank... So while the Fed says it is not worried about inflation, markets still are. The risk for interest rates is still on the upside,"" State Street's Kaida.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar held firm near a two-week high against the dollar at $0.7652 while the British pound slipped to $1.3824 from Tuesday's two-week high of $1.3910.

Bitcoin was flat at $57,872.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, as U.S. bond yields fell and investors retreated from aggressive expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten its policy earlier than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 92.330 by 12:51 AM ET (4:51 AM GMT). The index hovered near a two-week low, slipping further from a five-month high of 93.439 set on Mar. 31.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 109.73 continuing its decline from the one-year high of 110.97 reached during the previous week.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7655 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7056.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.5403. Investors digested the Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index released by China on Tuesday, with March’s reading at 54.3, higher than February’s 51.5 reading. China will release inflation data, including the Consumer Price and Producer Price indexes, on Friday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 1.3829.
A rosier economic outlook, with U.S. economic growth and inflation both accelerating, could see the Fed tightening its policy earlier than indicated. Interest rate futures earlier in the week priced in a rate hike as early as late 2022.
Investors now await the minutes from the Fed’s March meeting later in the day, and chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks at a panel about the global economy a day later.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields also fell, with the five-year note dropping sharply to 0.874% after hitting a 14-month high of 0.988% on Monday. The note is now viewed as a major barometer of how much faith investors have in the Fed's pledge that it does not expect to raise interest rates until 2024.
Some investors view the dollar's retreat as a correction after its rally in February. Against the yen particularly, the greenback recorded its biggest monthly gains in more than four years in March, rising almost 4%.
""Last quarter, the dollar got a boost from the Senate runoff in Georgia, Biden administration's COVID-19 relief package and then infrastructure plan. This quarter we are running out of such big themes and the market will be looking to economic fundamentals. We expect the dollar to remain strong, but it is unlikely to rise as much as it did last quarter,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
On the cryptocurrency front, Bitcoin was flat at $57,966."

Governor Shaktikanta Das said the six-member Monetary Policy Committee held the benchmark repurchase rate at 4% -- a decision predicted by all 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

Policy makers had been expected to keep policy accommodative amid continued risks from the Covid-19 crisis.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Tuesday,  with traders retaining a largely positive tone on the back of signs of strong U.S. economic growth and an impressive vaccine rollout. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.688.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% at 110.31, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3885, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7634 after Australia’s central bank kept its key policy instruments unchanged Tuesday. 
“Until Europe gets its fiscal stimulus on the road and more importantly makes inroads on vaccinations (continental Europe has 10% of its population vaccinated, US 29%, UK 45%) it is hard to fight the case against dollar exceptionalism,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Germany announced plans Monday to have 20% of its population immunized against the novel coronavirus by the beginning of May, but that would still put the European Union’s largest country way behind the U.S. in percentage terms.
Additionally, while the European Union faces recession given the lockdowns associated with the third wave of the Covid-19 virus, the data coming out of the U.S. points to a sharp economic recovery, with the Institute for Supply Management services index surging on Monday, following on from Friday’s stellar jobs report. 
U.S. job openings for February are released Tuesday at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), with analysts tracked by Investing.com expecting a reading of 6.99 million, which would be up from 6.917 million the prior month.
The one part of Europe that is showing some life is the U.K., with England confirming on Monday plans to reopen the likes of hairdressers, gyms and pubs/restaurants to outside seating from next week.
The U.K. saw some healthy revisions to its fourth quarter 2020 GDP growth data late last week, to 1.3% quarter on quarter from 1.0%, said. ING. “This should continue to support GBP on a relative basis, with EUR/GBP remaining pressured near 0.8500.”  
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.5490, after data showed the recovery in China's services sector picked up speed in March as firms hired more workers and business optimism surged.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stabilised near an almost two-week low versus a basket of its peers on Tuesday, moving in tandem with a retreat in Treasury yields from recent peaks despite signs of a robust U.S. economic recovery. 
The dollar index sank as low as 92.527 in the Asian session, its weakest since March 25. The softer turn comes less than a week after hitting an almost five-month top at 93.439.
The yen continued to recover from a more than one-year low near 111 per dollar, briefly strengthening back below 110 on Tuesday. The euro extended its rise from a nearly five-month trough close to $1.17 to trade as high as $1.1821.
The greenback has risen strongly this year, along with Treasury yields, as investors bet on a faster U.S. pandemic rebound than other developed nations amid massive stimulus and aggressive vaccinations.
But the dollar’s drop this week even after Friday's much-stronger-than-expected monthly payrolls data was followed on Monday by the highest reading for services industry activity on record may indicate that much of the bullish outlook is priced in for now.
""While the U.S. does look exceptional, COVID normalization over time means the rest of the world will converge,"" Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), the global head of foreign-exchange strategy at TD Securities, wrote in a client note.
""The USD level has now outstripped the pickup in non-U.S. growth expectations,"" meaning ""there's room for a USD pause"" in its recent uptrend, he wrote.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields continued their retreat Tuesday, dipping below 1.7% early in the Asian session, from a peak of 1.776% last week - a level not seen since January of last year.
That's even as the robust economic outlook boosted U.S. stocks to record highs. 
However, Westpac strategists see room for further dollar gains, saying the run of strong data ""cement the USD’s unbeatable growth rebound credentials.""
""DXY has not capitalised on the strong macro tailwinds,"" they wrote, referring to the dollar index.
""Pullbacks into 92 should be bought for a run to the 2020 Q3 highs around 94.50.""
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar, considered a proxy for risk appetite, slipped slightly to $0.76415 on Tuesday, after rallying 0.8% to start the week. The Reserve Bank of Australia left policy unchanged on Tuesday, as expected.
The British pound rose to a 2-1/2-week high of $1.3915 in Asia, building on the previous session's 0.6% advance.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded around $58,882 on Tuesday, easing back a little after a two-day gain. It reached a record high at $61,781.83 in the middle of last month. 

The cryptocurrency market capitalization hit an all-time peak of $2 trillion on Monday, according to data and market trackers CoinGecko and Blockfolio, as gains over the last several months attracted demand from both institutional and retail investors.

Investing.com – The dollar fell sharply against its rivals Monday, paced by declining U.S. bond yields, but the pullback could be short-lived as the expected rise in rates has forced some on Wall Street to ease their bearish bets on the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.48% to 92.61.
U.S. bond yields slipped, though the 10-year yields remained above 1.7% after data showed U.S. services activity hit its highest level since 1997. The drag on the greenback from lower yields, however, is unlikely to continue in the wake of the positive economic backdrop.
""A backdrop of strong economic growth and rising inflation expectations may well see the U.S. yield curve continue to steepen. We continue to recommend a defensive posture in bonds,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.
The poor start to the week in the dollar did little to knock optimism on the greenback as its three-month win streak has forced some on Wall Street to rein in the bearish calls.
""Although we still expect these currencies to appreciate versus the dollar over the coming quarters, firm U.S. growth and rising bond yields may keep the greenback supported over the short-term,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said. ""After a choppy few months we are closing our recommended dollar short trade.""
Still, the road ahead for the greenback could be paved with uncertainty in the form of a potential rebound in the euro.
Goldman Sachs forecasts the single currency to hit $1.28 against the dollar by year end - from the current level of $1.1813 – thanks to expected to boost vaccine rollout efforts.
France last week imposed a four-week lockdown including school closures from Saturday, while Italy extended restrictions as a third wave of Covid-19 sweeps across parts of the continent.  "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dipped to one-week lows against a basket of currencies on Monday as stocks hit record highs, and as investors waited on the next catalyst to drive direction.
The dollar has rebounded this year along with rising U.S. Treasury yields as investors bet on faster U.S. economic growth and higher inflation as the economy reopens after COVID-19-related business shutdowns.
The greenback has generally risen at the same time as stocks gain. Investors are now watching to see if that relationship continues as it may indicate a shift in how the currency responds to improving risk appetite.
“The trickiest thing for markets right now is to figure out what the dollar’s sensitivity is to good U.S. economic news,” said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York.
“This is a huge question because if we’re entering a phase where the dollar is no longer a safe haven and more of a ‘risk on’ currency, that’s big regime change,” Nelson said.
The dollar fell on Monday as stocks gained. It was last down 0.20% against a basket of currencies at 92.77. It has fallen from 93.44 on Wednesday, which was the highest since Nov. 5.
The greenback had rallied on Friday after data showed that the U.S. economy created the most jobs in seven months in March as more Americans got vaccinated and the government doled out additional pandemic relief money, marking the start of what could be the strongest economic performance this year in nearly four decades.
Trading volumes were light on Friday, however, with many traders out for the Good Friday holiday. Financial markets in Britain were also closed on Monday.

The euro gained 0.29% to $1.1786. Sterling rose 0.42% to 1.3886. The Australian dollar, which typically rises when risk appetite is strong, gained 0.64% to $0.7639.
Investors are also focused on U.S. President Joe Biden’s proposed infrastructure plan, which would involve raising corporate taxes to pay for the new spending.
Biden would be willing to push through his $2 trillion infrastructure plan without the support of Republican lawmakers if he cannot reach a bipartisan deal, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Sunday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar rose on Friday in thin trading, posting its third straight weekly gain, after data showed the world's largest economy created more jobs than expected in March, suggesting it is on a steady path to recovery from the pandemic.
Financial markets are closed in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Britain, and Europe in observance of the Good Friday holiday. Wall Street is also closed, while the U.S. bond and currency markets are open because Good Friday is not a U.S. government holiday.
Friday's data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged 916,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. 
""The overall strength of the labor market is likely to prove dollar-positive,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington.
""The hiring explosion showed the economy producing some of the 'substantial further progress' the Federal Reserves wants to see before it pivots away from its low rate policies.""
He added, though, that Treasury yields may take exception given tepid wage growth which is consistent with inflation remaining subdued.
Sentiment for the dollar has improved in recent weeks, while Treasury yields have spiked, as the Biden administration's planned stimulus of more than $2 trillion and a rapid COVID-19 vaccine rollout spurred economic optimism as well as inflation fears.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were last at 1.717%, up nearly 4 basis points from the previous session. [US/]
In midday trading, the dollar index was up 0.1% at 93.025, posting gains in five of the last six weeks. 
The dollar's ascent to multi-month highs is likely to continue as more investors bet on economic recovery.
The dollar was up 0.1% versus the yen at 110.67 yen, not far from its strongest level in a year at just under 111 yen. 
The euro, meanwhile, was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.1756.
In the cryptocurrency market, ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, hit a record high of $2,081.83 and was last up 5% at $2,065.45.
""Basically, there's a decentralized Wall Street blooming on top of ethereum that's currently growing faster than any other sector in the entire cryptocurrency industry, and it all requires ETH to function, likely explaining a good portion of the increased attention on the asset,"" said Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, a decentralized network that provides data to smart contracts on the blockchain.
Bitcoin, meanwhile, briefly rose above $60,000 for the first time in two weeks but then pared gains to trade up 1.1% at $59,400.

Tai and the Vietnamese minister Tran Tuan Anh also ""discussed U.S. concerns on illegal timber practices, digital trade and agriculture,"" the statement said.
The U.S. Treasury Department in December labeled Vietnam a ""currency manipulator"" due to its growing trade surplus with the United States, its large global current account surplus and heavy foreign exchange market intervention to hold down the value of its dong currency.

In January, the USTR released the results of its so-called Section 301 investigation into Vietnam's currency practices.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's real is starting the second-quarter in a somber mood as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc in Latin America's biggest economy and as pressure builds on the government, a Reuters poll showed.
The Brazilian currency lost around 10% in the first three months of the year, briefly revisiting its record closing low of 5.88 per U.S. dollar set last year. That mark could be easily breached soon.
Thousands of Brazilians are dying daily of COVID-19, the economy is struggling and opposition to President Jair Bolsonaro has increased. Under attack from all sides, he has reacted by appointing loyalists in key positions.
""Domestic risks are for BRL downside: the resurgence of COVID-19, potential for further fiscal pressures should the pandemic deteriorate and last for longer, and political uncertainty,"" said Juan Prada (OTC:PRDSY), an FX strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The real is seen at 5.31 per U.S. dollar in 12 months, according to 27 analysts polled March 26-30. The estimate represents an expected 8.4% gain from Wednesday but a big 3.9% drop from last month's survey, presaging more tension ahead.
Out of 11 respondents who answered a separate question about the currency's trajectory over the coming year, a majority of 6 said the trend was for a weaker real, four viewed it on a stronger footing and 1 neutral.
The unit will probably remain soft even after a steep interest rate hike last month that started a policy tightening cycle. The country's central bank head said later the overall adjustment may not be so aggressive.
Besides the high toll in lives from the raging health crisis and its impact on governability, economists worry Bolsonaro's drive to tighten the purse strings could run aground amid increasing social demands before next year's election.
Brazil's Treasury has warned the 2021 budget approved by Congress threatens one of the government's key pillars of fiscal stability and urged the estimates for mandatory spending be brought up to a more ""realistic"" level.
In Mexico, the peso is likely to appreciate 1% in one year to 20.32 per U.S. dollar. However, the 12-month outlook for the currency also worsened significantly from March's poll, as investors remain nervous.
Like Brazil, the country is suffering a severe fresh wave of coronavirus cases. Its death toll is likely at least 60% higher than the confirmed number, putting it in excess of 300,000, according to government data.

Investing.com - The dollar remained strong in early European trading Thursday, near multi-month highs amid expectations of strong U.S. economic growth, helped by more fiscal stimulus and an accelerating vaccine rollout. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.312, having hit a five-month high of 93.472 earlier. 
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 110.78, having risen to as high as 110.97, its highest level in a year. GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3759, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.7% to 0.7544.
U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled his long awaited $2 trillion-plus infrastructure rebuilding plan on Wednesday, injecting more funds into the U.S. economy after his recently approved $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.
This comes with the U.S. economy already showing signs of a strong recovery as its aggressive vaccination program results in large parts of the country reopening.
The ADP report on Wednesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased by 517,000 jobs last month, a precursor to Friday’s official employment report which is expected to show another increase of around 650,000 payrolls in March.
A survey by the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday is expected to show a further improvement in the manufacturing activity.
This increased optimism in the U.S. dollar is best reflected against the euro, with EUR/USD down 0.1% at 1.1723, not far off the near five-month low of 1.170 after ECB President Christine Lagarde's dovish interview on Wednesday.
Large parts of Europe are struggling with a third wave of the Covid-19 virus, shutting down much of the region, resulting in Germany’s retail sales dropping 9.0% on the year in February.
“The environment is clearly supportive for USD, particularly when Europe continues to battle with the third Covid wave,” said analysts at ING, in a note. 
But “USD upside in Q2 should be more limited and European FX should eventually see some reversal,” ING added, as Europe’s vaccination process gathers pace while the American  infrastructure spending is accompanied by around $1.8 trillion worth of tax hikes.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.3% to 6.5715, after China released a disappointing Caixin Manufacturing PMI earlier in the day, reading 50.6 for March, the lowest level since April 2020, and a drop from February's 50.9.
These findings contrast with those in an official survey, released Wednesday, which showed manufacturing activity grew at a stronger pace.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia but still near a multi-month high as investor bets on faster U.S. economic growth continued thanks to fiscal stimulus measures and as more Americans get inoculated against COVID-19.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 93.213 by 10:09 PM ET (2:09 AM GMT), after reaching a five-month high of 93.43 during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 110.68. Japan’s Tankan large manufacturers index was at 5 for the first quarter of 2021, above the –15 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the –10 reading in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Tankan large non-manufacturers index also exceeded expectations, reading –1 against the –5 reading in Investing.com forecasts and the fourth quarter of 2020.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.7580 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.6970.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.20% to 6.5650. China released a disappointing Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) earlier in the day, which read 50.6 for March.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3786.
The euro was trading at $1.1726 after hitting a near five-month low of $1.1704 as Europe continues to deal with a third wave of COVID-19 cases and a vaccination program lagging behind that of the U.S.
Back in Asia, the greenback held firm against the yen after rising to as high as 110.97, its highest level in a year, on Wednesday.
""Rises in U.S. bond yields on hopes of vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus are boosting the dollar, as the dollar/yen is known to be particularly sensitive to interest rates differentials,"" Nomura Securities chief FX strategist Yujiro Goto told Reuters.
Some investors wondered if flows related to conglomerate Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd.'s (T:6501) $9.6 billion acquisition of U.S. software company GlobalLogic Inc. on Wednesday were behind some of the dollar's recent gains.
""Yen-selling due to Japanese companies' foreign direct investment is coming back after a slowdown due to COVID-19 last year,"" Goto added.
In the U.S., President Joe Biden unveiled details of a $2 trillion-plus job plan, inclusive of $621 billion to rebuild infrastructure and alongside the $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed into law earlier in the year. However, divided opinions in Congress on the plan’s details could set the stage for another division down party lines.
However, uncertainties on how the plan will end up remained, with immediate market reactions kept to a minimum.
Trading is expected to be light over the next few days due to the Easter holidays. However, positive U.S. economic data, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI due later in the day, could mean further gains for the dollar."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near a multi-month high against other major currencies on Thursday as investors bet fiscal stimulus and aggressive vaccinations will help the United States grow faster than other economies.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies hit a five-month high of 93.439 on Wednesday and last stood at 93.209.
The gains came as the euro, by far the biggest component in the index, suffers from concerns the euro zone's economic recovery is being hampered by a third wave of COVID-19 infections.
President Emmanuel Macron ordered France into its third national lockdown and said schools would close for three weeks while the currency bloc also lagged the United States in vaccination programmes.
The euro changed hands at $1.1726, after hitting a near five-month low of $1.1704. 
Against the British pound, the common currency hit a 13-month low of 0.8503 pound and last stood at 0.8509.
The U.S. currency held firm against the yen after ending March with its biggest monthly gains since November 2016.
The dollar traded at 110.74 yen, having risen to as high as 110.97, its highest level in a year. 
""Rises in U.S. bond yields on hope of vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus are boosting the dollar, as the dollar/yen is known to be particularly sensitive to interest rates differentials,"" said Yujiro Goto, chief FX strategist at Nomura Securities.
""Yen-selling due to Japanese companies' foreign direct investment is coming back after a slowdown due to the pandemic last year,"" he added.
Japanese conglomerate Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) on Wednesday announced $9.6 billion acquisition of U.S. software company GlobalLogic Inc.
Some traders speculated flows related to the deal could be behind some of the dollar's recent rises.
U.S. President Joe Biden announced his long awaited $2 trillion-plus job plan, including $621 billion to rebuild infrastructure.
Coupled with his recently enacted $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, Biden's infrastructure initiative would give the federal government a bigger role in the U.S. economy than it has had in generations, accounting for 20% or more of annual output.
But the effort sets the stage for the next partisan clash in the Congress where members are divided on the total size and inclusion of programs traditionally seen as social services.
That leaves big uncertainties on how the plan will end up, helping to keep immediate market reactions to minimum.
""On the detail to hand, this new package would certainly be a big positive for the U.S. economy if passed by Congress,"" said Elliot Clarke, senior economist at Westpac in Sydney.
""However, the $2 trillion of the proposed infrastructure and investment initiatives would be spread across eight years. Further, this is not $2 trillion in net stimulus. Rather it is to be offset over 15 years by an increase in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% as well as the rate multi-national companies pay on overseas profits,"" he added.
While currency trading is expected to slow towards the Easter holidays in many parts of the world, the dollar could gain further if upcoming key U.S. economic indicators surprise on the upside.
A survey by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Thursday is expected to show a further improvement in the manufacturing activity.
Economists expect Friday's job data to show an increase of about 650,000 payrolls in March while the latest chatter in the market is it could swing higher, and even top one million.
The ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday U.S. private payrolls increased by 517,000 jobs last month, slightly lower than market forecasts.

In the crypto asset market, bitcoin maintained its firmness over the past several days to trade at $58,766.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will remain strong for at least another month, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists, who still forecast that the currency will weaken in the longer term. 
Following a spike in benchmark Treasury yields, which touched a 14-month high on Tuesday, the greenback is up about 3.5% this year, a solid revival given it started the year on the defensive.
Trillions of dollars in expected government infrastructure spending and a robust U.S. economic recovery will likely keep bond yields rising and the dollar well-supported in the near-term, forcing reassessments of bets against the currency.
Indeed, the latest trader positioning data showed currency speculators trimming their net short positions to the lowest level since June 2020.
""We started the year dollar negative both in the short-term and in the long-term but the shift in the environment is so dramatic that staying dollar negative in the short-term was very risky,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
Over 85% of analysts, or 48 of 56, who answered an additional question said the current dollar strength would last at least another month. Of the 48, 11 said it would last three to six months and 16 said it would last more than six months.
The other eight said the dollar's revival was already over or would end in less than a month.
But beyond short-term outperformance, the March 26-31 poll of over 65 FX strategists in total predicted the dollar would weaken over the 12-month horizon.
Those forecasts line up with a separate Reuters survey of fixed-income strategists published last week who were not expecting sovereign yields to be a lot higher than current levels over the coming year. [US/INT]

""I don't think we're going to have a massive run-up on the dollar in the way we did a couple of years ago. I think we can go a little bit further,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
Analysts still expect the euro, which marked its worst first quarter performance since 2015 this year, to strengthen against the dollar over the next 12 months.

Changing hands at around $1.173 on Wednesday, the euro was expected to trade around $1.20 in the next six months and then rise to $1.22 in a year, clawing back the 4.0% it has dropped so far in 2021.
However, that year-ahead forecast was the lowest since November and was at risk of a further downgrade.
Fifteen of 17 analysts who answered a separate question said risks to their euro forecasts were skewed to the downside.
Much of the negative outlook was because the euro zone was lagging its peers in immunizing its population, putting its major economies at risk of more large-scale lockdowns.
""My forecasts are for the euro to go back up to $1.21 on a three to six month view, but I'm not feeling comfortable with that. I'm beginning to think I'm going to have to bring that lower over the next couple of weeks or so,"" added Rabobank's Foley.
Despite the dollar gaining across the board this year, much like in previous cycles, it was emerging market currencies which suffered the most.
While they were expected to pare some of their recent steep losses over the coming year, there was plenty of selling pressure expected for developing economies' currencies over the next 12 months. [EMRG/POLL]
Nearly 60% of analysts, or 28 of 48, who answered an extra question said emerging market currencies would underperform over the next three months. A similar majority also said a sell-off in risky currencies was likely over the next quarter.
""In the very near-term the environment has become a lot more challenging... We wouldn't be going to buy emerging market currencies right now,"" said Lee Hardman, senior currency analyst at MUFG, the most accurate forecaster for major currencies in 2020.

Investing.com – The euro cut its gains against the dollar Wednesday as investors fret over fresh lockdown measures in the economic bloc that will likely slow the recovery, but some experts see a reversal on the cards for the single currency.
EUR/USD fell 0.18% to $1.1735, after hitting a high of $1.1760.
France widened lockdown restrictions nationwide to curb a third wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe. Non-essential shops and schools will be shut for three weeks.
""We will lose control if we do not move now,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday, a day after the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care topped 5,000, exceeding the prior peak during a six-week long lockdown in the autumn of last year.
In the run up to the decision analysts had estimated that further restrictions would be inevitable given the sharp rise in cases.  
""Unfortunately, the tightening of pandemic containment measures affecting one third of the population is likely to have weighed on spending again this month. And with the number of patients with Covid-19 in intensive care now having surpassed the peak during the second wave in November, extra nationwide restrictions appear on the cards for April,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said.
While the tougher restrictions will likely slow economic growth, the euro is expected to find some reprieve against the dollar if it continues to trickle lower.
""EUR/USD slid to the November 11 low at 1.1745 as expected with the mid-October low at 1.1689 being next in line. Longer term we will be looking for reversal in in the 1.1600 zone,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's share of currency reserves in the fourth quarter of last year plunged to its lowest since 1995, IMF data showed on Wednesday.
The greenback's share slid to 59% in the fourth quarter, from 60.5% in the third, declining for three straight quarters. Its share in 1995 was 58%.
Still, the dollar has the largest share of currency reserves held by global central banks. It posted a high of nearly 73% share in 2001, data showed.
""For the most part, Wall Street and the rest of the world are convinced that we're bound to see a weaker dollar. If you take a look at the money growth, the initiatives from the Biden administration, it's only going to get worse,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at online FX trading platform OANDA.
""The ballooning trade deficit is going to continue and you're probably going to see that the longer-term outlook for the dollar is going to be much weaker.""
In the fourth quarter, the dollar posted losses of 4%, its worst showing since June 2017. It recovered somewhat in the first quarter of 2021, posting gains of roughly 3.5%, its best performance since June 2018.
Global reserves are assets of central banks held in different currencies and are used primarily to support their liabilities. Central banks sometimes use reserves to help support their respective currencies.
The euro's share, meanwhile, rose to 21.2% in the fourth quarter, compared with 20.5% in the third. The single currency's share in the fourth quarter was the highest since 2014.
In 2009, the euro hit its highest share of FX reserves at 28%.
IMF data also showed global reserves rose to a record $12.7 trillion in the fourth quarter, from a revised $12.246 trillion in the third.
Reserves held in U.S. dollars totaled $7 trillion, compared with $6.939 trillion.
The yen's share of currency reserves grew as well to 6.03% of allocated reserves in the last three months of 2020, rising for three straight quarters.

The Chinese yuan's share increased to 2.25% during the period, gaining for four consecutive quarters. The IMF started tracking the yuan's share in 2017.

Investing.com - The dollar handed back some gains in early European trading Wednesday as bond yields edged off highs, but remained in demand as fiscal stimulus and an aggressive vaccine rollout are seen prompting a strong U.S. economic recovery.  
At 3:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.240, having earlier hit a new 4-month high at 93.472.
USD/JPY rose 0.4% at 110.74 and EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1726. GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3746, after U.K. GDP increased by 1.3% between October and December last year from the previous three-month period, compared with an earlier estimate of 1.0% growth, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7610.
The trickle lower in the dollar comes as U.S. yields struggled to hold onto the new highs, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield seen just above 1.72% having traded above 1.78% on Tuesday.
However, this slip in yields is likely to be just a period of profit-taking as data continued to point to underlying strength in the U.S. economy.
Tuesday’s CB Consumer Confidence index soared to 109.7 in March, the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic, and this increased confidence is expected to be reflected in the U.S. employment report for March, including non-farm payrolls, which is due out on Friday. 
Ahead of that comes the ADP nonfarm employment data for March, due later Wednesday.
This U.S. economic strength is one of the reasons the International Monetary Fund will upgrade its forecast for global economic growth next week, managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Tuesday, from January’s projections of 5.5%. 
That said, “the key event of the week is set to be the unveiling by President Biden of his infrastructure plan on Wednesday, with another bold fiscal move (some media reports suggested the stimulus plan may be as large as $4tn) further endorsing the narrative of U.S. exceptionalism in the economic recovery,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.5577, after the China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for March came in at 51.9, higher than February’s 50.6 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 56.6, surpassing its February reading of 51.4.
The Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs, which look at the private sector, are due later in the week.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, rising to a fresh one-year high against the yen over investor bets that fiscal stimulus and an aggressive vaccine rollout will help the U.S. lead a global economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 93.370 by 9:58 PM ET (1:58 AM GMT). The index held above the 93 mark and was on course for its best month since 2016.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.25% to 110.62, surpassing the 110 mark.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7607 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.6985.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.5669 with the yuan offshore market the weakest since November 2020. China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March was 51.9, higher than the 51 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.6 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 56.6, surpassing its February reading of 51.4.
The Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs, which look at the private sector, are due later in the week.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3737.
U.S. President Joe Biden later in the day will outline how a $3 to $4 trillion infrastructure plan will be funded. He also targeted opening the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine program to 90% of American adults by Apr. 19 earlier in the week.
On the data front, Tuesday’s Conference Board CB Consumer Confidence index soared to 109.7 in March, the highest level since the beginning of COVID-19. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 96.9 figure, while the index was at 90.4 in February.
“U.S. economic outperformance can continue to underpin the dollar in the near term,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist Carol Kong said in a note.
“The yen will be driven by the general dollar strengthening trend,” potentially rising to 113 by year-end, she added.
The U.S. employment report for March, including non-farm payrolls, is due out on Friday. Investors will watch the figures closely after the Federal Reserve cited the lackluster labor market for its continued dovish stance on interest rates. While the Fed’s stance has boosted the economic outlook, it also continues to raise inflation worries.
Rising U.S. bond yields also gave the greenback a boost, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note touching a one-year high of 1.776% on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, bitcoin hovered just below $59,000, working towards touching its record peak of $61,781.83 set earlier in the month again. PayPal Holdings on Tuesday said it launched a 'checkout with crypto’ service allowing U.S. users to pay online merchants globally with the cryptocurrency."

Inveting.com - The U.S. dollar gave up some of its gains Tuesday following a rise to four-month highs on the back of falling U.S. bond yields – a move that analysts warn could continue. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.35% to $93.28, but had been as high as $93.37. 
""Our charts suggest maintaining a positive stance on the US Dollar, but we would tighten up stops as the move higher in US yields may soon lose upside momentum,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
The trickle lower in the dollar comes as U.S. yields struggled to hold onto their gains after hitting price levels that triggered strong selling action, forcing some profit taking.
""The US 10 Yield nears the 50% retracement of the 2018-2020 descent at 1.79 above which sits the 1.95/2.00 major resistance area,"" Commerzbank added.
Still, there a few betting that the latest slip in yields is a sign of reversal as data continued to point to underlying strength in the economy.
The consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 109.7 in March, up from 90.4 in February, beating economists' forecasts of 96.9.
In a sign of further economic recovery, inflation expectations continued to rise - reaching 6.7%, up from 6.5% previously – and will likely continue to advance amid inventory shortages.  
""Although we expect inflation to moderate in the medium term, the inventory story will be in play for several more months to come,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""Manufacturers have not made much progress in restocking the shelves, and the recent delays in shipping through the Suez Canal will exacerbate these issues as well."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gained against major currencies on Tuesday and climbed to a one-year high against the yen, as accelerating U.S. vaccinations and plans for a major stimulus package stoked inflation expectations and raised Treasury yields.
The safe-haven dollar found support across the board as investors also digested the fallout from the collapse of highly leveraged investment fund Archegos Capital.
The dollar index rose above the 93 mark and was last up around a third of a percent at 93.185, its highest level in four months.
The dollar also rose above 110 yen, a level not seen since March last year, and was last up 0.5% on the day. 
It is on track for the best month since late 2016, with the end of Japan's fiscal year this month driving up dollar demand as companies square their books.
Analysts said the yen was also vulnerable to higher inflation expectations in the United States than in Japan and a rise in long-term U.S. yields.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to 14-month highs on Tuesday, the day before President Joe Biden is set to outline how he intends to pay for a $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan. 
""USD/JPY has by far the highest correlation amongst G10 currencies with long-term US yields,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG in a note. 
""Upward pressure on long-term US yields is expected to be supported by another fiscal stimulus policy announcement from the Biden administration.""
The euro weakened on the day to $1.17290, its lowest level since November.
Tougher coronavirus curbs in France and Germany have dimmed the short-term outlook for the European economy. A a widening spread between U.S. and German bond yields is adding pressure on the euro.
The monthly U.S. non-farm payrolls report will be closely watched at the end of this week, with Federal Reserve policymakers so far citing slack in the labour market for their continued lower-for-longer stance on interest rates.
""In a week when the market is feeling so optimistic about the forthcoming payrolls release, it seems very likely that the greenback will find strong support,"" Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley wrote in a report.

However, ""the market is in danger of pricing in too much inflation risk,"" meaning ""we see scope for the USD to soften in the months ahead,"" the report said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Tuesday, hitting a one-year high versus the Japanese yen, as U.S. Treasury yields started climbing again on inflation concerns. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.052, a new 4-1/2-month high.
Most of the greenback’s move higher Tuesday has been against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.3% at 110.15, moving above 110 for the first time since March of last year, with this pair particularly sensitive to movements in U.S. Treasury yields.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield last traded at 1.75%, around the 14-month high of 1.7540% touched earlier this month, as accelerating vaccinations, signs of economic recovery and massive U.S. stimulus stoked inflation concerns. President Joe Biden is due to unveil a big new plan for spending on infrastructure later this week, with additional spending plans on childcare and healthcare due to be unveiled after the Easter break.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3771, with sterling holding its own as a number of mobility restrictions are lifted in England on the back of the country’s successful vaccination program, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7645.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1749, at a 4-1/2-month low, on course to fall by around 2.5% this month, the most since mid-2019, as rising Covid-19 cases and renewed lockdowns in the likes of France and Germany dim the short-term outlook for the European economy.
“The EUR/USD bounce failed to make much progress on Friday, probably leaving it vulnerable to 1.1700 this week,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The main U.S. economic release Tuesday will be the March CB consumer confidence figure, which is expected to show an improvement as states reopen and the U.S. vaccination program continues apace. 
That said, most eyes will be on the monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, released on Good Friday, with Federal Reserve policymakers continuing to cite weakness in the labor market for their continued accommodative monetary policy stance.
“Getting the USD outlook right will likely prove to be the cornerstone of all good position-taking over summer, which will leave stakes high. We remain USD positive, and find more reasons to start removing reflationary bets than vice versa currently,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note. 
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 0.8% to 8.2528 following the news that Turkish deputy central bank governor Murat Cetinkaya has been removed from his post, according to a presidential decree published in the Official Gazette on Tuesday.
This follows President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sacking hawkish former governor Naci Agbal earlier this month and appointing Sahap Kavcioglu, raising fears that the country will return to unorthodox methods to tackle high inflation.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 92.927 by 10:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT), staying near a four-and-a-half month high of 92.964 reached on Monday. The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.11% to 109.91.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7644 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.7011.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.5714, ahead of China’s release of its manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 1.3773.
Investor worries about the market impact of Achegos Capital’s collapse also gave the safe-haven U.S. currency a boost, although worries seemed to have died down by the time Asian trading got underway on Tuesday.
The dollar traded as high as 109.89 against the yen on Tuesday, its highest level since March 2020. Also helping the greenback on the path to its best month since 2016 is the dollar demand from Japan, as companies begin to square their books at the end of Japan’s fiscal year this week.
In Europe, the short-term economic outlook became gloomier as France and Germany introduced tougher restrictive measures to curb a third wave of COVID-19 cases on the continent. Also applying pressure on the euro was the widening spread between U.S. and German bond yields.
The euro remained near the four-and-a-half month low reached on Monday, with March 2021’s decline set to the biggest since mid-2019.
On the data front, the U.S. employment report for March, including non-farm payrolls, will be released on Friday and closely watched for signs of economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has cited the labor market’s slow recovery from COVID-19 as a reason for its dovish stance on interest rates.
Some investors were cautiously optimistic.
""In a week when the market is feeling so optimistic about the forthcoming payrolls release, it seems very likely that the greenback will find strong support,"" with the dollar index looking to test 93, Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said in a note.
However, ""the market is in danger of pricing in too much inflation risk,"" meaning ""we see scope for the dollar to soften in the months ahead,"" the note added.
Meanwhile,  Visa Inc  . (NYSE:V) will now allow the use of cryptocurrencies to settle transactions on its payment network. The company’s decision pushed bitcoin back near the $57,620 mark on Tuesday, after touching a record $61,781.83 earlier in March."

Investing.com –  The dollar was boosted by rising U.S. bond yields Monday, but data showing bearish bets against the greenback are running out of room could keep a lid on the world’s reserve currency, experts say.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.15% to 92.91.
The dollar continued to ride the jump in U.S. bond yields amid ongoing expectations for an improvement in the economy, with analysts at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) now expecting the 10-year yield to jump to 2% by year-end.  
""There have been seven periods over the past 30-years when longer dated interest rates have climbed in a meaningful way .. but the most recent move in rates was below the average,"" Wells Fargo said. ""We forecast a yield of roughly 2% by year-end 2021.""
The appreciation in the dollar has forced traders to cut their short positions, adding further fuel to the greenback's climb, but some warn this short-squeeze ride is running out of road.
""Looking at the latest data, it appears that the room for the dollar to benefit from further short-squeezing has shrunk significantly,"" ING said.
The bullish bets on the dollar against the reported G10 currencies improved for a tenth consecutive week, with net shorts ""now worth only 5.6% of open interest … but were as high as 19% in mid-January,"" ING added.
Looking ahead, the dollar is set for busy week of top-tier economic data, with the latest jobs report due Friday that could add to the evidence that the recovery remains on track.
""[N]onfarm payrolls are expected to rise 650k in March, the unemployment rate is expected to decline from 6.2% to 6.0%, and average hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.1% in March and 4.5% over the past 12 months,"" Stifel said in a note."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro languished below $1.18 on Monday as the prospect of tougher coronavirus curbs in France and Germany weighed on the short-term outlook for the European economy.
The euro slipped 0.2% in London trading at $1.1774, nearing last week's four-and-a-half-month trough of $1.1762. On a monthly basis, it is down 2.3%, its biggest drop since July 2019.
Compounding the single's currency woes have been the widening interest rate differentials between German and U.S. yields. The spread for 10-year debt widened to 200 basis points from 150 bps at the start of the year, boosting the dollar.
""In a nutshell, the U.S. economy is much stronger and miles ahead in the immunization game compared to Europe's and Japan's, and this ultimately translates into the Fed normalizing policy years before the ECB or the BoJ,"" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, a strategist at brokerage XM.
The euro's woes have worsened as Europe's faltering vaccination programme runs into a wave of new infections, even as positioning data showed investors remain heavily long euros, a bearish sign for investors. and 
""Much focus will remain on the virus situation in Europe and whether lockdowns can slow rising case numbers and also whether the slow pace of vaccinations can finally reach exit speed,"" ING economists said in a daily note.
The dollar held firm against other currencies as a slight risk-off sentiment rippled through global markets, with U.S. stock futures in negative territory in quiet quarter-end rebalancing flows.
YEN SHORTS GROW
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar steadied at 92.810, just below a November 2020 high of 92.92 hit last week.
Weekly positioning data showed the broad trend of growing dollar bullishness remained in play. Hedge funds cut their overall short dollar bets to their lowest levels since June 2020 while ramping up their bearish bets on the yen.
Short yen positions have grown in recent weeks with hedge funds building their net short bets to 33% of open interest, according to ING data.
Steadying stock markets offered some support for the yen, but falling bond yields and expectations of a global economic rebound have rekindled short bets. The yen is among the worst- performing currencies so far this quarter, down 6% loss the dollar. 
Virus-driven caution also helped the dollar higher against the Australian and New Zealand dollars and sterling, and it rose against oil-linked currencies as the re-floating of the ship blocking the Suez Canal pushed crude prices down by about 1.5%.
The Aussie was last down 0.3% at $0.7621 on Monday and the New Zealand dollar had dropped 0.3% to $0.6978. Sterling slipped 0.2% to $1.3767.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, as quickening progress on vaccination tips relative growth expectations in the dollar's favor, ahead of a key employment report.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.865, just below a four-month high of 92.868 reached overnight.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 109.55, GBP/USD was down 0.2% at 1.3760, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7620.
The U.S. dollar has been in demand over the last few weeks, as a cautious market mood pushed investors to safety while U.S. economic strength and a rapid vaccine rollout have added to the greenback's shine.
U.S. jobless claims fell to a one-year low last week and President Joe Biden said he would double his vaccination goal, after surpassing 100 million shots 42 days ahead of schedule.
This has seen bond yields climb sharply this year, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing as high as 1.75% last week.
“There are very few signs yet that what we see as a corrective dollar bounce has run its course,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1781, continuing to suffer as European inoculations have been hit by supply problems and safety concerns.
“Much focus will remain on the virus situation in Europe and whether lockdowns can slow rising case numbers and also whether the slow pace of vaccinations can finally reach exit speed,” said ING, adding “that leaves EUR/USD vulnerable to 1.1700 in the week ahead.”
U.S. data this week includes Purchasing Managers Index figures midweek, but the main release will be the official employment report due on Good Friday, which is expected to show a continued recovery in the labor market, with the unemployment rate seen falling from February’s 6.2%. .
“None of this should really sway the Fed, however, which still awaits 10 million people to re-discover work and has gone out of its way to undermine the unemployment rate as a catch-all figure for those unemployed,” said ING.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, hovering near record gains against the euro and yen. Investors turned to the dollar thanks to the previous week’s U.S. economic data and the quickening pace of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccine program.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 92.812 by 9:54 PM ET (1:54 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 109.66. The yen was not far from strong resistance and Friday's 10-month low of 109.85 against the dollar, as it is sensitive to gaps in returns on U.S. and Japanese government debt.
The U.S. economic recovery has seen a 76-basis-point rise in 10-year Treasury yields in 2021, the biggest since February 2020. The rise drew in Japanese investors, in turn pushing the yen down near 6% in the quarter to date.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7629 and the USD/NZD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.6984.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.5433, with Chinese manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) figures due later in the week.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 1.3777.
The euro traded at $1.1788, close to the previous week’s four-and-a-half-month low, and was headed for its worst month since mid-2019. Supply issues and safety concerns hampering Europe’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout, alongside rising case numbers, led investors to remain heavily long euros, according to positioning data.
Meanwhile, the U.S. has doubled its vaccination goal after meeting its 100-million-shots goal more than a month ahead of schedule.
""The U.S. is also being helped on its own by some pretty good economic data, the fantastic rollout of vaccines, good pace of vaccination and (positive) stock markets... the domestic economy is doing better than expected and that is likely to be the case for the next few months, so that might hold the U.S. dollar up and that's what's caused the AUD, NZD and emerging-market currencies to pull back in March,” Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
Investors will also be watching U.S. jobless claims data, due later in the week, after the number of claims fell to a one-year low during the previous week.
""The distribution of forecasts range from 460,000 to 1 million (jobs), where the whisper number sits at the top end of the range... one million jobs would set the reflation trades alight, with the S&P500 outperforming, led by cyclicals and cause a solid sell-off in bond yields taking USD/JPY and USD/CHF higher,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
""The euro should push through the previous week’s lows of 1.1761 and towards 1.1690,"" Weston added."

Investing.com – The pound rose strongly against the dollar Friday on economic data showing U.K. retail sales rebounded last month, but cable is set to end a second-straight week in the red as experts flag speed bumps ahead.
GBP/USD rose 0.42%, to $1.3789. 
U.K. retail sales rose 2.1% last month following a steep drop at the start of 2021. Looking ahead, retail sales are expected to remain sluggish in March but ""before a rebound in sales after non-essential stores reopen in England from 12 April onwards,"" Daiwa Capital Market said.
But in the midst of the improving economic backdrop, some experts are betting against the ""overvalued"" pound, citing post-Brexit U.K.-EU tensions.
""Growing UK vaccine rollout and escalating post-Brexit tensions with the EU to cloud the UK economic outlook even after lockdown conditions are lifted in Q2. The US economy to boom in Q2,"" Crédit Agricole said.
The pound has recently moved in tandem with the risk assets, which may prove to be its undoing amid expectations for a bumpy second quarter. As well as an expected souring in risk appetite, forecasts for an ongoing rise in U.S. Treasury yields will boost the dollar, keeping a lid on cable.
""Our analysis suggests that overvalued GBP/USD … fair value of 1.3450 could be one of the best G10 FX hedges against the twin risks of elevated UST yields and risk aversion in the second quarter,"" Crédit Agricole added.
Others agree, echoing the positive outlook on the dollar ahead of a crucial week.
""There are very few signs yet that what we see as a corrective dollar bounce has run its course,"" ING said in a note.
""On the agenda next week are a few inputs which on paper look dollar positive.  The first is the US macro data where the March employment numbers (ADP on Wednesday and NFP on Friday) should be strong."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near its highest since November against most major currencies on Friday, buoyed by hopes over improving U.S. economic data and the availability of coronavirus vaccines, while the euro recovered from heavy losses a day before. 
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar stood at 92.793, not far off a four-month high hit a day earlier and on course for a weekly gain of 0.9%. 
In further signs of strength, the dollar rose to 109.44 against the Japanese yen, its highest since June. Against the Swiss franc, it rose to its highest since July, holding onto a 0.5% gain from the previous session. 
U.S. jobless claims fell to a one-year low last week and President Joe Biden said he will double his vaccination plan after reaching his previous goal of 100 million shots 42 days ahead of schedule, both of which support optimism in the dollar.
Data on U.S. personal consumption due later on Friday was also on traders' radars. 
""The extent of the strength (of the dollar) is more because of Biden's stimulus package,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG. 
A resurgence of COVID-19 cases in major economies such as the euro zone has also favoured, he added.
The dollar's gains in the past few weeks have been so rapid that some analysts are warning against chasing the dollar higher from current levels.
""We believe recent moves in FX markets are corrective and not part of a new 2021 trend,"" ING analysts wrote in a note. 
The euro managed to come back from Thursday's four-month low, with the common currency bruised by doubts over the slow pace of vaccinations. 
Against the euro, the dollar slipped 0.1% to $1.17630 but remained near its strongest level since November.
Germany's Ifo survey later on Friday is expected to show an improvement in business morale. 
That's unlikely to halt the euro's slide, though. Worries about the European Union's slow vaccination rollout and bickering with former member Britain over vaccine exports have become a dominant theme, traders said. 

A notable exception to the dollar's gains was the British pound, which gained 0.3% to $1.37735 after rising 0.4% on Thursday.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Friday, but remains near multi-month highs on the back of rising optimism about the U.S. economic recovery, helped by a strong rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.793, just below a four-month high of 92.868 reached overnight.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 109.25, near its highest since June, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3750, helped by retail sales posting a modest rebound in February after a brutal start to the year, climbing 2.1% on the month, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7619.
The latest indication of the strength of the U.S. economic recovery came from Thursday’s weekly jobless claims data, which showed the number of people filing last week fell to a one-year low of 684,000 from the 781,000 claims filed during the previous week. 
Later in the session the final print of the University of Michigan sentiment reading for March is expected to tick up as stimulus checks arrive and the country starts to reopen.
Other data, including personal spending and personal income in February, are due later in the day and could provide further hints about the U.S. economic strength.
Another positive driver for the greenback has been the strong start to the U.S. vaccination program, especially compared with the European equivalent.
President Joe Biden pledged on Thursday to double the U.S. vaccination rollout plan after reaching the previously set goal of 100 million shots 42 days ahead of schedule.
EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1787, close to lows last seen in November last year, with the single currency suffering due to renewed coronavirus lockdowns and the slow pace of vaccinations across the European Union even as the region’s leaders meet to try and improve the situation.
Focus will turn to the release of the keenly-watched German business sentiment release later in the day, with the Ifo index expected to climb to 93.2 in March from 92.4 the previous month.

The euro fell against the dollar to $1.1776, the strongest for the greenback since November 2020. Investor sentiment for the single currency has weakened thanks to fresh lockdowns and delays in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the continent.
Although Germany releases its March Ifo Business Climate Index later in the day, which is expected to show improved business morale, it is unlikely to stop the euro’s fall. The slow vaccine rollout and disputes with the U.K. over vaccine exports remain dominant themes for now, according to other investors.
There were warnings, however, against chasing the dollar higher from current levels from some corners over worries that the dollar’s gains over the past few weeks have been too rapid.
""The euro has broken through the 200-day moving average, and that is a clear sign that it will continue to go lower... the yen is getting strong on some of the crosses, which will cap dollar/yen.

(Reuters) - Economic growth and higher bond yields will keep the U.S. dollar stronger for now, but the rally will lose steam later in 2021 because of a dovish Federal Reserve and rising fiscal deficit in the United States, economists and strategists said.
The dollar rally will be mitigated in the coming months because the Fed's extraordinary monetary policy won't result in sustained inflation, they told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
Fed officials have said the central bank will ignore the price pressures expected to accumulate in coming months and let the economy run ""hot"" to encourage more hiring.
""The most likely outcome is that after a spring peak (of) around 3.5% for headline CPI and 2.5% for core PCE, inflation will fall back, while remaining above 2% for longer than at any other time over the past decade,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
Graphic: Fed sees strong economy, low rates Fed sees strong economy, low rates - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/PROJECTIONS/gjnpwoaxxpw/chart.png
The risk of inflation spiralling out of control was limited because rising prices would in turn restrain demand, and the Fed can eventually rely on its toolkit, including forward guidance and yield-curve control, to control runaway prices.
""The inflation we are seeing is not wage/price spiral stagnation inflation, it is recovery inflation and transitory,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.
Halley expected the dollar to end the year lower, with the Japanese yen topping out at 112.00 to the dollar. It is currently at 108.99.
There is a real possibility that bond yields will keep rising, but the Fed doesn't have to raise interest rates to combat it, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.
""Operation Twist is most likely,"" Hooper said, adding that she expected the Fed to act only if markets became ""disorderly"" when the 10-year yield reaches 2%.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield is currently at 1.6191%. US10YT=RR
""But if the 10-year yield rises to even 3% and markets are able to digest the rise in yields, then the Fed will not step in,"" she said.
Eric Freedman, CIO at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, likened the communication between the markets and the Fed to ""the game of Marco Polo,"" where markets sell bonds and wait to see if the Fed is worried about that interest rate level.
Freedman said rates would have to move higher and more abruptly for the Fed to get concerned.

492,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 04:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Swiss National Bank kept interest rates at record lows and pledged to continue its policy of foreign-exchange interventions as the economy remains vulnerable due to the pandemic.
Officials led by President Thomas Jordan reiterated that the franc is “highly valued,” and also kept both the policy rate and deposit rate at -0.75%, as predicted by economists.
Although the currency’s drop to a 20-month low against the euro in recent weeks has given officials some respite, inflationary pressures remain weak and the slow deployment of Covid-19 vaccinations is crimping economic activity.
“The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to have a strong adverse effect on the economy,” the SNB said in a statement on Thursday. “Despite the recent weakening, the Swiss franc remains highly valued.”
The SNB spent 110 billion francs ($117 billion) last year on interventions, the most since 2012, as the pandemic roiled markets. That didn’t escape the notice of the U.S. Treasury, which labeled Switzerland a manipulator in December.
The central bank has denied the charge, saying the small size of the domestic bond market makes interventions the most effective tool for curbing the currency’s strength and staving off deflation.
Central-bank data also suggest the pace of interventions has dropped since the start of the year, as the franc depreciated against the dollar and the euro.
The SNB reiterated its growth forecast released in December for an expansion of 2.5%-3% this year. It raised its outlook for inflation in 2021 and 2022, though beyond that horizon its projection is “virtually unchanged,” officials said.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Thursday, climbing to a four-month high against the euro as the third Covid wave and slow vaccine rollout in Europe weigh on the single currency.  
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.712, just below a four-month high of 92.692 reached overnight.
USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 109.07, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3672, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7583.
EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1805, having traded at a new four-month low of 1.1803 earlier, with the single currency suffering as a consequence of the region’s extended lockdowns and delayed vaccine rollouts.
A number of European countries, such as Germany, France and Italy, have recently extended their mobility restrictions following a sharp pickup in Covid-19 cases.
Indeed, the French government is ready to take tougher measures if current restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus fail, Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Wednesday.
“With the extension of European lockdowns delaying any EZ [eurozone] economic recovery, EUR/USD has broken below the important 200-day moving average support level of 1.1863. Technically, this keeps EUR/USD vulnerable,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed their confidence in the U.S. recovery during a second day of testimony to Congress.
This confidence surrounding the U.S. economic rebound is in contrast to large parts of the developed and developing world, who are struggling to reopen their economies as they combat rising numbers of Covid cases.
“Factors behind USD strength have moved away from concerns about the reflationary impact on US Treasurys to concerns about global growth expectations,” added ING.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY fell 0.1% to 7.9170, with the lira benefitting slightly from the state news agency Anadolu reporting that Turkey’s new central bank governor has promised to stick to the single interest-rate framework adopted by his predecessor, citing a meeting between the monetary authority and commercial lenders on Wednesday.

USD/CHF rose 0.1% to 0.9365 and EUR/CHF climbed 0.1% to 1.1061 ahead of the latest interest rate decision by the Swiss National Bank.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Investors were bearish on all Asian currencies for the first time in a year, and also turned short on the Chinese yuan after a strong run since last summer, a Reuters poll showed, as U.S. economic outperformance and new lockdowns elsewhere muddy the outlook for risk assets.
Higher vaccinations and expectations that the U.S. economic recovery will far outpace the rest of the world has kept Treasury yields elevated and the dollar at a four-month high, tipping investors away from emerging market currencies and bonds that traditionally yield more though are considered riskier.
With a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in parts of Asia, such as India and the Philippines, alongside a new wave across Europe and the relatively slower pace of vaccinations, the path to a global economic recovery looks more uncertain. 
For the first time since April 2020, when markets were grappling with global shutdowns and uncertainty, investors turned short on all nine Asian currencies, a poll of 11 respondents showed on Thursday. 
Central banks in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia recently left their key policy rates unchanged despite pressure from a strengthening U.S. dollar and outflows, in stark contrast to sharp interest rate hikes in Brazil and Turkey. The Philippines central bank meets later on Thursday. 
Bets on the yuan, which had been relatively more bullish as China emerged from the pandemic first and was the only major economy to see growth in 2020, turned short for the first time since last June. 
""Unlike last year, the U.S. is now seen matching China in leading the global recovery in 2021,"" DBS analysts said in a note. 
Growing worries that authorities in the world's second-largest economy may tighten policy have also fuelled worries.
Analysts at BCA Research say while they expect Beijing to gradually remove policy accommodation, ""the team is also warning that there is a risk that policymakers inadvertently overtighten this year.""
Even positions on Taiwan's dollar and India's rupee turned short for the first time since May and June, respectively. 
Bearish bets on the Philippine peso and Thai baht were raised and stood at their highest since April. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hit a fresh four-month high against the euro on Thursday as the U.S. pandemic response continued to outpace Europe's, which has been hobbled by extended lockdowns and delayed vaccine rollouts.
The safe-haven greenback held on to most of a broad two-day advance, which has been fuelled by worries ranging from Europe's third COVID-19 wave and potential U.S. tax hikes to the persistent spectre of inflation.
Even Germany's reversal of a call for a strict lockdown over the Easter period did little to build confidence in the region's economic outlook, instead compounding discontent with Chancellor Angela Merkel's handling of the pandemic.
""The weak point in Europe remains around the vaccine rollout amid the rise in new virus cases and the tightening of restrictions ... which likely means the mooted acceleration in Q2 may have to be pushed back by a quarter,"" Tapas Strickland, director of economics and markets at National Australian Bank, wrote in a client note.
""The narrative of the U.S. outperforming Europe in the coming quarter remains.""
The euro traded near the four-month low of $1.1809 touched earlier in the Asian session, while a gauge of the dollar against six major peers hovered just below a four-month high of 92.617 reached overnight.
The dollar gained 0.2% to 108.905 yen, another safe-haven currency, as the pair continued to consolidate below 109.
At the same time, the dollar's rally showed some signs of fatigue, as some of its bruised rivals recovered from lows amid gains in many Asian equity markets.
Australia's dollar, considered a liquid proxy for risk appetite, bounced 0.3% after earlier dipping to $0.7579, the lowest level since Feb. 2.
The British pound rose 0.2%, climbing out of a six-week trough at $1.3675.
Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields consolidated around 1.6%, a week after hitting a more than one-year top of 1.754%, which had also supported the dollar.
""The U.S. longer-term Treasury yield is lower than the previous week’s level, and that is a very big factor for the improvement in market sentiment,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
""Even if the yield is 1.6 or 1.7%, it is not enough to push up the dollar constantly.""
On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed their confidence in the U.S. recovery during a second day of testimony to Congress.
Yellen told Senate lawmakers she was open to banks buying back stock and paying dividends, an updated view showing her confidence in the economy. Powell also said he thinks 2021 will be a ""very, very strong year in the most likely case.""
A day earlier, though, the treasury secretary had put investors on alert after espousing tax hikes to pay for President Joe Biden's plans for upgrading infrastructure and other investments. 
Inflation could also rear its head as disruptions in the supply chain exert cost pressures for manufacturers, with U.S. factory activity picking up in early March.
Meanwhile in Europe, an unexpected expansion of business activity did little to brighten the mood, with renewed COVID-19 lockdowns in many of the bloc's member nations meaning the gains may not last through April.
Concerns have been magnified because the third wave of infections is being largely driven by the U.K. strain of the virus, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kim Mundy.
""The risk is that the more contagious and deadly strain of the virus elicits a stronger response from European governments, which sees Europe remaining locked down for longer,"" she wrote in a note.
""A significant delay to Europe's re‑opening efforts will only widen the divergence between the economic outlook in Europe and the U.S.,"" putting additional pressure on the euro, she said.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin continued to swing widely, falling below $52,000 again in early Asian trading before recovering to around $52,123. 
That is after briefly topping $57,000 overnight after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk said customers can now buy the company's electric cars with the digital token.
Bitcoin hit a record high of $61,781.83 on March 13.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, reaching a four-month high against the euro. The gap in the U.S. and European COVID-19 response continues to widen thanks to fresh lockdowns and a delayed vaccine rollout in the continent.
The U.S Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 92.650 by 9:53 PM ET (1:53 AM GMT), with the safe-haven U.S. currency remaining broadly strong following a two-day rally.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.20% to 108.94.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.7594 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.6969.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.15% to 6.5327 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3684.
Meanwhile, Europe continues its battle against a third wave of COVID-19 cases. However, even Germany’s extended, strict lockdown failed to restore confidence in the regional economic outlook, with discontent with Chancellor Angela Merkel's handling of COVID-19 compounded instead.
""The weak point in Europe remains around the vaccine rollout amid the rise in new virus cases and the tightening of restrictions ... which likely means the mooted acceleration in Q2 may have to be pushed back by a quarter... the narrative of the U.S. outperforming Europe in the coming quarter remains,"" National Australian Bank director of economics and markets Tapas Strickland said in a note.
Even Wednesday’s positive economic data for March, including the German Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) as well as the European Manufacturing and Service PMIs, failed to lift investor sentiment. The most recent lockdowns likely mean that the gains will not hold through April.
Investor concerns have been amplified, with the B.1.1.7. COVID-19 strain first seen in the U.K. driving the latest wave of cases said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) strategist Kim Mundy.
The euro hovered near the four-month low of $1.1809 touched earlier in the Asian session.
Back across the Atlantic, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated their confidence in the U.S. economic recovery as they testified before Congress for a second day on Wednesday.
Yellen said she was open to banks buying back stock and paying dividends, a day after she mulled tax hikes to fund infrastructure upgrades and other investments and set off investors’ alarms. Powell added that 2021 will be a ""very, very strong year in the most likely case.
Inflation remains a concern for investors, however, with disruptions in the supply chain exerting cost pressures for manufacturers. Wednesday’s manufacturing and services PMIs indicated that U.S. factory activity picked up in March."

Investing.com – The euro fell against the dollar Wednesday and could soon be staring down the barrel of a plunge below $1.18 as the third wave of Covid-19 threatens the outlook for the economic bloc.
EUR/USD fell 0.22% to $1.1823 and could continue its bearish trend as the U.S. appears on track for a stronger recovery thanks to a speedy vaccine rollout, while the EU finds itself in the midst of lockdowns. There was some reprieve on the lockdown front for Germany, Europe's economic engine, as Chancellor Angela Merkel today scrapped plans for harsher Easter lockdown amid widespread criticism. 
""The current uncertainty about the third wave … increases the risk that EUR-USD slips below 1.18,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Economic data, meanwhile, is likely to play second fiddle to the ongoing pandemic dynamic as many expect economic steps in either direction are unlikely to spark the European Central bank into action.
""[W]ith the third Covid wave, the data are likely to continue to look lukewarm for the time being, especially compared to the USA,"" Commerzbank added. ""The data publications have become less relevant recently as they do not lead to a decisive decision on the part of the ECB.""The bank's remarks were supported somewhat as the single currency shrugged off economic data showing better-expected manufacturing output in the bloc.
Data on Wednesday showed stronger manufacturing activity for March. The index for manufacturing rose by 4.6 points to a reading of 62.4, while the index for services rose by 3.1 points to a reading of 48.8.
The euro is headed for its second straight slump against the greenback as traders have continued to trim their bullish bets, according to data from the Chicago Futures Trading Commission.
Speculative traders cut their net long positions in the euro by 12,000 to 90,000 for the week ended March 16."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a four-month high on Wednesday as concerns over a third COVID-19 wave in Europe, potential U.S. tax hikes and escalating tensions between the West and China sapped risk appetite. 
The dollar index rose to a four-month top of 92.608 in early London trade, its highest since Nov. 23. 
The gauge ""looks determined to test the top end of a new, higher 91-93 range we think will form in coming weeks,"" Westpac strategists wrote in a client note, adding that extended lockdowns in Europe have sapped confidence in an economic rebound. 
""Meanwhile, the U.S. will have an impressive rebound in coming months amid a strong vaccine roll-out, stimulus payments and economic reopenings,"" they said.
The index that measures the greenback's strength against a basket of peer currencies is up nearly 3% year-to-date, confounding widely held expectations among analysts for a decline.
Strategists at BCA Research said they believe the U.S. dollar is experiencing a ""countertrend rally within a bear market.""
""Over the near-term, the dollar benefits from two supports. First, the U.S. growth will outperform thanks to generous fiscal policy and the country’s lead in vaccinations. Second, the NASDAQ and other highflying global equities have been correcting since February, creating some risk-off undertones that help the countercyclical greenback.""
""However, real interest rate differentials will ultimately determine the currency’s cyclical outlook. The Fed’s commitment to maintaining an accommodative policy will cap upside to US real rates at the short-end of the curve. This will prevent a sharp appreciation in the dollar.
The euro hit a four-month low of $1.1812 after Germany extended a lockdown and urged its citizens to stay at home during the Easter holiday.
Worries over the pace of the pandemic recovery were heightened after a U.S. health agency said the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc vaccine may have included outdated information in its data. 
The flight to safety received an additional nudge when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers that future tax hikes will be needed to pay for infrastructure projects and other public investments. 
Yellen was testifying to the House Financial Services Committee along with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who reiterated that an expected near-term spike in inflation will be transitory.
That helped tame U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark sinking below 1.6% on Wednesday for the first time in a week, as it continued its retreat from a more than one-year high of 1.7540% touched last week. 
Both Yellen and Powell are also scheduled to testify to the Senate Banking Panel on Wednesday. 
Human rights sanctions on China imposed by the United States, Europe and Britain, which prompted retaliatory sanctions from Beijing, are adding to market concerns.
The safe-haven yen, which gained in Asian trade, weakened 0.1% by the start of trading in London. Australia's dollar - considered a liquid proxy for risk - weakened further on Wednesday. 
The Aussie slipped to as low as $0.7582, a level not seen since Feb. 5.
The British pound weakened as far as $1.3675, also the lowest since early February.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 4% to $56,500, off a record high of $61,781.83. 
Seasonal factors are likely exacerbating currency moves, as some investors lock in profits ahead of the quarter-end and the holidays of Easter and Passover, according to Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""The main scenario for the market, that the global economy is recovering from the pandemic shock, is intact,"" he said.

""We may see more of a correction into the start of April, but after that I expect a restarting of a risk-on trade,"" with commodity currencies of advanced economies benefitting most, he said.

Investing.com - The dollar climbed in early European trading Wednesday, nearing a four-month high as worries about a third Covid wave and potential tax hikes prompted traders to seek out the safe haven. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.485, approaching a four-month top of 92.506 hit earlier this month.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 108.62, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7589.
GBP/USD fell 0.5% to 1.3684, after British consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell to 0.4% in February from 0.7% in January.
""The sharp fall in CPI inflation in February reflected clothing retailers slashing prices, because the lockdown has left them with excess stock. Prices will snap back, as they have after previous lockdowns. No reason to doubt that CPI inflation will be c.2% by end year,"" said analyst Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1824, falling to a four-month low, after the Netherlands joined the likes of Germany, France and Italy in extending its lockdown following a sharp pickup in Covid-19 cases, threatening to overwhelm its hospitals.
Adding to the concerns, a U.S. health agency said Tuesday the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine may have included outdated information in its trial data. 
This vaccine has had a troubled history, with a number of European countries suspending its use last week over reports of blood clots from a small number of its recipients. It was cleared late last week by the European regulator, but confidence in its efficacy has been shaken, and this news will hardly help, particularly given the slow rollout of vaccines in the region.
“Europe’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis certainly seems to be taking its toll on the EUR. Third waves now look a reality for the likes of France, the Netherlands and Italy, triggering fresh lockdowns and delaying the day when Europe can play its part in the global recovery,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The greenback was also supported by comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday indicating that tax rises may be on their way.
Yellen was asked about the impact of corporate tax hikes on prices and consumers, and replied that existing studies are ""very unclear"", but added the funds raised from taxes would help fund the government's spending plan, including an infrastructure package.
Both Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are scheduled to testify to the Senate Banking Panel on Wednesday.
“The USD should be rising 20% in YoY terms instead of falling 15% according to relative growth expectations,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.5248, amid escalating tensions between the West and China, after human rights sanctions on China imposed by the United States, Europe and Britain prompted retaliatory sanctions from Beijing.
USD/TRY rose 1% to 8.0164 as the lira continues to suffer from the decision of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to fire his hawkish central bank chief, Naci Agbul at the weekend.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia near a four-month high, as COVID-19 concerns, potential U.S. tax hikes, and tensions over tit-for-tat sanctions between China and the West turned investors towards the safe-haven asset.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 92.382 by 12:18 AM ET (4:18 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.05% to 108.50.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.7606 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.30% to 0.6983.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.5227. The sanctions imposed on China by the U.S., Europe, and the U.K. over human rights issues, prompting the former to retaliate with sanctions of its own, continue to add to investor market concerns.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 1.3727.
The dollar index rose to a two-week high as the Asian session opened and was near the four-month record of 92.506 set earlier in the month. The index “looks determined to test the top end of a new, higher 91-93 range we think will form in coming weeks,” Westpac analysts said in a note.
“Extended European lockdowns have sapped confidence in a synchronized global rebound; meanwhile, the U.S. will have an impressive rebound in coming months amid a strong vaccine roll-out, stimulus payments, and economic re-openings,” the note added.
A third wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted fresh lockdowns in several countries. Germany extended its lockdown until Apr. 18, with France and Italy also extending restrictive measures, and the euro fell towards a four-low of $1.18360.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S.’ data safety monitoring board warned that the data submitted by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC and the University of Oxford in support of its COVID-19vaccine could be outdated.
Also nudging investors towards safe-haven assets was U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, where she said that future tax hikes will be needed to pay for infrastructure projects and other public investments.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying alongside Yellen, added that an expected near-term spike in inflation will be transitory. His comments prompted the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield to drop to 1.6048% on Wednesday.
Yellen and Powell will repeat their testimonies before the Senate Banking Panel later in the day.

501,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 05:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s decision to allow a regulatory exemption for banks to lapse at the end of March has led to a jump in year-end funding premiums.
December Eurodollar contracts -- which are priced off interbank rates -- have come under persistent selling pressure since the central bank said Friday that relief for banks under the supplementary leverage ratio would expire this month as planned. Traders are preparing for greater frictions in dollar borrowing markets now that lenders are expected to be more conservative in managing their balance sheets.
The frictions are mainly manifesting themselves over year-end, a period when regulatory scoring often leads banks to scale back lending. An increasing premium can be seen in December pricing of a key gauge of banking sector risk known as FRA/OIS -- the spread between Eurodollar futures and the fed funds rate -- which has widened two basis points since the Fed’s announcement. The gap is now seven basis points greater than the FRA/OIS spread for the September contract, which doesn’t cover year-end.
The Fed introduced the SLR relief for banks last year as it sought to support the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Under the exemption, it allowed banks to hold extra Treasuries and deposits without setting aside capital for potential losses.
The direct implication of letting the relief expire is tighter bank-level controls over leverage capital, which will create more frictions in over-the-counter derivative markets, Henry St John, a fixed-income strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), wrote in client note.
As allocations of capital get stricter, there will be more bouts of volatility in leverage-intensive markets such as foreign-exchange swaps, he said.
The Fed’s announcement has also led to a widening in yen-dollar three-month cross-currency basis -- a measure of the cost to access U.S. currency. While the spot rate is around negative eight basis points, the December starting contract -- which covers year-end -- has widened three basis points since Thursday and is now around minus 41 basis points, according to data from Martin Brokers in London. A widening basis indicates a higher premium to hold dollars.
While the Fed allowed the current SLR exemption to lapse, the central bank also said it is seeking comment on further adjustments. This has given markets some optimism that a more permanent solution for the policy will be forthcoming.

Investing.com - The dollar strengthened in early European trading Tuesday, with focus turning towards testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and what this may mean for bond yields. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 91.877, just below recent highs.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 108.69, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1925, after Germany, the euro zone’s largest country, extended its lockdown until April 18, while GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3833.
Elsewhere, NZD/USD fell 1.2% to 0.7076, hitting a three-month low, after the New Zealand government announced new measures to try and cool its fast-growing property market by increasing the supply of houses and removing tax incentives for speculators. This dragged the risk-sensitive AUD/USD lower, with this pair 0.8% lower at 0.7685. 
That said, attention Tuesday will be on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who are scheduled to make their first joint appearance before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services. 
The dollar has appreciated some 2% this month, boosted in part by rises in U.S. Treasury yields, something that Fed officials have signalled that they are prepared to live with.
Powell and Yellen are expected to be asked about the Treasury’s and Federal Reserve’s pandemic response, as well as the potential risks from the Fed's super-easy policy including how far bond yields will rise. 
Ten-year U.S. bond yields eased to 1.67% in early Tuesday trade, after climbing above 1.75% last week.
“DXY [the dollar index] remains supported largely by the sluggish roll-out of vaccines and new lockdowns in Europe – remember European FX has a 77% weight in the DXY. But arguably DXY should have done even better given the 70bp+ rise in US 10-year yields this year,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Also of interest this week, the U.S. Treasury will sell $60 billion of two-year notes later Tuesday, $61 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday and $62 billion of seven-year notes on Thursday.
The Treasury will have to sell a lot of paper to fund the substantial budget deficit. Although recent auctions have proceeded smoothly, the $62 billion seven-year note auction, in late February, saw the lowest demand ratio for that maturity on record and prompted a sharp rise in yields.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 1.3% to 7.8956, continuing to weaken after Monday’s sharp 7.5% drop in the wake of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan replacing hawkish central bank governor Naci Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu over the weekend.
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.5112, with the Chinese yuan holding largely steady despite the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposing sanctions on Chinese officials on Monday for human rights abuses against Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China."
503,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 01:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s sacking of his third central bank governor in less than two years, Turkey’s dominant political leader of the past century has demonstrated yet again his determination to fight the conventions of modern economics.
Markets are again unpersuaded.
Investor flight drove the lira down as much as 15% on Monday, adding to losses that have kept inflation in double digits for the past 16 months. The yield on 10-year lira bonds rose by the most on record and stocks had their steepest drop since 2013.
“This is a sudden stop in capital flows,” similar to the currency meltdown in 2018, said Robin Brooks, chief economist of the Institute of International Finance in Washington. “The result back then was a deep recession due to tighter financial conditions. It’ll be the same now.”
Erdogan’s decision to fire Naci Agbal as central bank governor in the early morning hours Saturday followed a stunning 200 basis point interest-rate increase last week that drove the benchmark rate to 19%. In his four months in the office, Agbal had lifted the gauge by a cumulative 875 basis points -- a direct contrast to the president’s unusual belief that higher borrowing costs fuel inflation. His moves helped stabilize the currency and attract investment.

While the Turkish president was looking at a year of strong growth and a stable lira as recently as last Thursday, his actions over the weekend have made Turkey a tougher sell to foreign investors. They’re critical to helping finance the country’s current-account deficit, which exceeded $36 billion in 2020.
The abrupt move at the central bank wrongfooted lira bulls who had come to believe in Erdogan’s apparent switch to mainstream economic policies in November, when he installed Agbal and appeared to cede to economic choices needed to contain spiraling prices that were eating into his popularity.
Erdogan hasn’t addressed the matter since naming a new chief of monetary policy, Sahap Kavcioglu, a Marmara University economics professor. Kavcigolu has occasionally written in support of Erdogan’s unorthodox ideas on interest rates in his column in the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper.
The appointment stoked fears of a rerun of monetary policies of the past two years, pushing the lira 8.9% lower to trade at 7.8609 per dollar as of 4:53 p.m. in Istanbul on Monday. The currency did pare losses from as low as 8.35, with both state and private banks selling dollars from local investors, who saw the weak lira as an opportunity to take profit on dollar holdings, according to traders familiar with the flows.
State lenders didn’t appear to be defending a specific lira level as they did for much of the past two years when they were selling Turkey’s foreign FX reserves, the traders said, asking not to be identified, in line with their companies’ regulations.
Market Backlash
The yield on Turkey’s 10-year lira bonds rose 483 basis points to 18.89%, the biggest jump in the 11 years since Turkey started selling those securities. Stocks slumped nearly 10%, triggering circuit breakers that halted trading twice at Borsa Istanbul during the day.
The cost of borrowing the local currency for one week surged to as high as 2,067% on Monday as traders scrambled to get their hands on lira liquidity needed to unwind their long bets.
The approach under Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan’s son-in-law who resigned from that position in November, was to use foreign reserves to prop up the lira. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated that policy cost Turkey more than $100 billion in lost assets -- leaving little ammunition to defend the currency now.
“We will never turn bullish on the lira as long as Erdogan is effectively running the central bank,” Nordea Bank currencies and rates strategist Andreas Steno Larsen said on Twitter.
Turkey’s total gross reserves, including gold and reserves held by the central bank on behalf of commercial lenders, dropped 20% last year until Agbal’s appointment to $85.2 billion, while net foreign-exchange reserves fell by more than half to $19.6 billion.
Foreign Cash
Turkish growth and portfolio inflows are closely correlated as strong domestic demand -- traditionally the main driver of activity -- usually results in a wide deficit in the country’s current-account balance.
Weakening inflows and intermittent bouts of currency weakness resulted in boom-and-bust cycles that saw gross domestic product get stuck at under $800 billion for much of the past decade. While Erdogan continued to win most elections in that period, his approval rating failed to recover from the 46% level seen in 2019, according to a February survey by Ankara-based pollster MetroPOLL. That’s when he suffered the most stinging electoral defeat ever, losing the mayor’s post in Istanbul to the opposition.
“Not many are surprised that Erdogan is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. But to do it so quickly is remarkable even by his standards,” Renaissance Capital Chief Economist Charles Robertson wrote in a note to clients. “In the long-term, Erdogan may have lost himself the 2023 election – but by then Turkey might be a Frontier market or Frontier Emerging Market.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar hovered below recent peaks on Tuesday as investors looked to U.S. policymakers for clues on whether they may seek to slow rising yields, while the New Zealand dollar dropped after housing reforms cooled policy-tightening expectations.
The Turkish lira also showed some sign of stability following a 7.5% dive on Monday after President Tayyip Erdogan sacked a hawkish central bank chief, but markets' relief was offset by worries about fresh lockdowns in Europe. 
The dollar crept 0.1% lower against the safe-haven yen to 108.74 yen and was steady at $1.1928 per euro, while making advances against the kiwi, Aussie and sterling.
The New Zealand dollar hit a three-month low after the government introduced taxes to curb housing speculation, a move investors reckoned could allow the central bank to hold interest rates lower for longer with less risk of a property bubble.
""The Reserve Bank (of New Zealand) will ... likely revise down its house price forecasts,"" ANZ Bank analysts said in a note. ""This will add caution around official cash rate hikes via less-than-otherwise housing-induced domestic momentum.""
The kiwi lost as much as 1% and traded at $0.7093 during the Asian afternoon. The move also rallied Kiwi bonds, especially at the short end, and it pulled the Australian dollar about 0.4% lower to $0.7711. [AUD/]
Sterling slipped almost 0.2% to $1.3845 and oil linked currencies also fell with crude prices on worries that a new wave of infections will bring more lockdowns in Europe.

DOLLAR DOLDRUMS 
The broad U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies stood almost flat in Asian trade at 91.831 after a slip of 0.32% on Monday.
The pause follows a 2.0% gain so far this quarter, as speedy rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States and the Biden Administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus are seen lifting growth, driving up bond yields and drawing investors.
The dollar's attraction was further boosted as U.S. Federal Reserve officials appeared to tolerate recent rises in yields - turning the focus now to Congressional testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen later on Tuesday.
""U.S. bond yields could rise further as the market may try to find out where the pain threshold for the Fed is,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
For now, though, the 10-year U.S. bond yields eased to 1.668% after peaking at 1.754% on Thursday, keeping the dollar in check.
""The market is interested in how far U.S. bond yields will rise. While top Fed officials have said they will keep interest rates low through 2023, there could be dissenting voices,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The Turkish lira traded at 7.8500 per dollar after a steep fall on Monday to as low as 8.485, near its record low of 8.58.
The lira's massive fall, however, has done little so far to shake investors' confidence in emerging market currencies as the event, the third firing of a central bank chief by Erdogan since 2019, was not perceived to hold wider risk.
The MSCI emerging market currency index dipped only slightly on Monday and steadied on Tuesday. China's yuan also held steady despite U.S. and European sanctions, and traded at 6.5095 per dollar. 

Bitcoin stood at $54,586, having fallen almost 5% on Monday to trade near last week's low of $53,221.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia but just below recent highs as investors gauge how far top U.S. policymakers will allow U.S. bond yields to climb.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.12% to 91.847 by 12:26 AM ET (4:26 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.09% to 108.73.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.44% to 0.7710 and the NZD/USD pair fell 0.98% to 0.7092. The NZD fell against major currencies after the government introduced steps to rein in soaring property prices, which dampened speculation that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand would raise interest rates.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.5098 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 1.3845.
The dollar index has gained 2% so far during the first quarter of 2021, boosted by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. and the signing of a $1.9 stimulus package into law earlier in the month. Hopes for economic recovery also drove U.S. bond yields up and drew investors to the greenback.
Also adding to the dollar’s attraction was the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent, perceived tolerance of rising bond yields.
“U.S. bond yields could rise further as the market may try to find out where the pain threshold for the Fed is,” MUFG Bank chief currency analyst Minori Uchida told Reuters.
Ten-year U.S. bond yields eased to 1.684% after climbing up to 1.754% during the previous week.
Investors will be focused on the joint congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen later in the day.
“The market is interested in how far U.S. bond yields will rise. While top Fed officials have said they will keep interest rates low through 2023, there could be dissenting voices,” Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Investors also looked to the U.S. Treasury’s auctions of two-, five- and seven-year debt later in the week.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira traded at 7.7980 per dollar, regaining some stability after Monday’s steep 7.5% dive. The dive came after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan replaced hawkish central bank governor Naci Agbal with Sahap Kavcioglu on Saturday.
However, investor confidence in emerging market currencies was little shaken by Erdoğan’s firing of his third central bank governor since 2019, which was considered to hold no wider risk.

Investing.com – The dollar's recent rate-driven climb was halted Monday by falling bond yields that could continue to drop as temporary boosts to rates ease ahead of testimony from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell later this week. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.21% to 91.69, as U.S. bond yields fell, with the U.S. rates falling below 1.7% after hitting 14-month highs last week.
The move lower in rates comes just days ahead of further clues on monetary policy as Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are set for two-day testimony before Congress starting Tuesday at 10 AM ET.
Ahead of the testimony, Powell reiterated the central bank's dovish stance in a WSJ op-ed. ""At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy with the support that it needs for as long as it takes,"" Powell said. ""I truly believe that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and better, as we have done so often before.""
The expected testimony comes a week after the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged and forecast rates to remain near zero at least through 2023. In a press conference that followed the Fed’s rate decision, Powell shrugged off the recent spike in bond yields, and made it clear that the central bank wasn't thinking about scaling back, or tapering, its $120 billion monthly bond purchases.
The Fed’s dovish policy stance triggered some on Wall Street to suggest the market is too bearish on bond prices, which trade inversely to yields, or rates, and a correction would soon follow.
""[W]e don't think that higher inflation will deter the fed from staying the course ... we think the market-implied pricing of rate hikes has gone too far and is due for correction,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said, referring to current market bets that a rate hike occurs in late 2022 followed by two 25 basis points hikes in 2023.
As well as an expected decline for the odds of earlier rate hike, temporary factors that have driven the recent boost in rates will continue to subside and keep a lid on rates.
The recent price action has been driven by several factors including “overnight selling … and U.S. banks holding back demand - all of which are ""likely to temper or reverse,"" Morgan Stanley added, and reiterated its neutral stance on the dollar. “We remain overall neutral on the dollar index .. but we see USD-positive risks potentially growing for a broadening of FX weakness versus the dollar.”

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey could dust off a range of strategies to defend its sliding lira after President Tayyip Erdogan abruptly replaced the central bank governor -- including limits on currency swaps, interventions by state banks and even capital controls. 
Erdogan's shock decision to fire the hawkish Naci Agbal and replace him with Sahap Kavcioglu, a like-minded critic of high interest rates, sent the currency down as much as 15% to near a record low in volatile early trade on Monday.
While Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan said Turkey would stick to free-market rules and a free-floating currency, analysts said the government would probably return to a less orthodox playbook used before Agbal cranked up rates to protect the lira and dwindling foreign reserves. 
Many pointed to the costly market interventions that prevailed under former finance minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, who resigned the day after Agbal was appointed in November. 
State-owned banks have sold some $130 billion to stabilise the lira in the last two years, supported by swaps from the central bank. As a result, the central bank's foreign currency fell by three-quarters last year, to a mere $11 billion.
But if foreign reserves cannot be topped up, and the lira keeps falling as investors expect a cut in interest rates, a balance of payments crisis looms - leaving few palatable options.
Current account deficits and steady outflows of foreign funds have dogged Turkey's import-heavy economy for years - although Agbal's rate hikes had reversed the outflow for a few months.
Turkey's external debt payment obligations are nearly $8 billion this month and will be a bit higher in June, central bank data shows.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said a ""rapid adjustment"" in the current account may be necessary, since markets would be less and less likely to fund the deficits. It predicted that the currency interventions would restart as pressure on the lira builds.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), another Wall Street bank, said however that the risk of debt default would probably convince Turkish authorities to avoid unorthodox steps that might deter investors further.
Phoenix Kalen, analyst at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said: ""We anticipate a return to the regime of soft capital controls that prevailed during Berat Albayrak's tenure, as policy makers try to stabilize rates and currency markets.""
Graphic: Timeline of lira's decline - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpelnjjvr/Lira%20Timeline%20Central%20Bank%20Governors.PNG
SWAP LIMITS, CAPITAL CONTROLS
If the central bank's policy rate does rapidly ease from its current 19%, as some investors predict, regulators could again tighten the limits on banks' currency swaps in order to stem outflows and raise the cost of shorting the lira. 
The bank watchdog expanded the limit to 10% of reserves in September, after cutting it to 1% in April. 
A minority of analysts, including at SEB, said Turkey would eventually be forced to adopt capital controls, including new taxes on hard currency earnings and limiting local buying of hard currencies.
A deputy head of Erdogan's ruling AK Party, Nurettin Canikli, said on Monday capital controls were a ""red line"" not to be crossed.
Turks' holdings of foreign currency touched a record $236 billion in January, reflecting concerns about inflation near 16% - compared to a central bank target of 5% - and distrust in the lira, which has shed half its value in less than three years.
""Domestic savers were right again,"" said Kerim Rota, a founding member and head of economic policy at Turkey's opposition Future Party, which launched in 2019.

""We think the new central bank governor will return to the set of policies implemented by Albayrak before November 2020,"" he said, adding that Turkey had come to a ""fragile and unreliable point in the eyes of foreign capital"".

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira briefly fell 15% to near its all-time low on Monday after President Tayyip Erdogan's shock weekend ousting of a hawkish central bank governor sparked fears of a reversal of recent rate hikes.
Sahap Kavcioglu, a former banker and ruling party lawmaker who shares Erdogan's unorthodox view that high interest rates can fuel inflation, was the third central bank chief abruptly installed by the president since mid-2019.
Kavcioglu had sought to ease investors' concerns about a sharp pivot from tight to expansive monetary policy, telling bank CEOs on Sunday that he planned no immediate policy change, a source told Reuters. 
Nurettin Canikli, a deputy head of Erdogan's ruling AK Party, said that ""the government changing a Central Bank governor who it thought did not use monetary policy instruments rationally, ... and thus brought a big financial burden to the economy, is not defiance of the markets"".
The dismissal of Naci Agbal reaffirmed the political control that has for years harmed foreign investors' view of what is a major emerging economy.
Analysts said Kavcioglu was likely to reverse the interest rate rises Agbal had implemented to shore up Turkey's capital account and its dwindling foreign reserves. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analyst Phoenix Kalen said the move left Turkey ""beyond the point of no return"" and predicted ""financial turmoil"".
'TWO CHOICES'
The currency briefly dipped to 8.4850 to the dollar from 7.2185 on Friday, near its intraday record low of 8.58 from last November, before Agbal was appointed.
It recovered about half of its losses after Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan said Turkey would keep to free market rules, and at 0930 GMT stood at 7.95 to the dollar, 9% weaker - and about half what it was worth before its last crisis, in mid-2018. 
Istanbul's main share index was down 9%, with banks off nearly 10%.
Longer-dated dollar-denominated government bonds suffered their biggest daily drop on record. The 2045 bond fell as much as 9.7 cents to as low as 87.01 - a level last seen in early November.
Five-year credit default swaps, insurance against a Turkish default, surged from Friday's 305 basis points to 464, their highest since Nov. 9.
Turkey ""will be left with two choices"" said Per Hammarlund, senior EM strategist at SEB Research.
""Either it pledges to use interest rates to stabilise markets, or it imposes capital controls."" 
Finance Minister Elvan said authorities were determined to stick to free-market rules and a free-floating currency regime. He said in a statement the macro policy framework would continue until there was a lasting fall in inflation.
Erdogan fired Agbal two days after a 2% rate hike that was meant to head off inflation of nearly 16% and shore up the lira, which rose 3% in response. 
In less than five months on the job, Agbal had raised rates by almost 9 percentage points to 19% and regained some policy credibility.

'PRO-GROWTH FROM NOW ON'
Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities, said his removel suggested ""looser, unorthodox, and eventually mostly pro-growth policies from now on"".
On the call with Turkish bankers, Kavcioglu said current policy would continue and any change would depend on lowering inflation, which he said was the primary goal, the source familiar with the call said. 
The central bank did not immediately comment on the call. On Sunday, Kavcioglu said the bank would focus on permanently lowering inflation, which has been stuck in double digits for most of the last four years. 
He said policy meetings will remain on a monthly schedule, suggesting any rate cuts may wait until the next planned meeting on April 15.
A former AK Party lawmaker, Kavcioglu wrote in a newspaper column last month that high rates ""indirectly cause inflation to rise"".
After Agbal was sacked, investors said they had worked through the weekend to predict how quickly and sharply rates would be cut - and how much the currency would retreat.
Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicted a ""discontinuous"" drop in the lira, and a ""front-loaded"" rate-cutting cycle, and told clients it was reviewing investment recommendations. 
It said capital outflows appeared likely and a rapid adjustment in the current account might be necessary since markets would shy away from funding Turkey's chronic deficits.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Monday, with the Turkish lira particularly hard hit after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan abruptly removed his hawkish central bank governor from office.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.047, helped by its safe haven status.
USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 108.70, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3853, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7727. EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1888, continuing to weaken as a third wave of Covid-19 cases hit large parts of Europe.
That said, a lot of the market’s focus will be on the Turkish lira, with USD/TRY up 8.4% at 7.8226 following Erdogan's shock weekend decision to dismiss central bank governor Naci Agbal after just four months in the role. The decision came only days after he announced a sharp rise in interest rates to combat rising inflation.
Erdogan subsequently appointed Sahap Kavcioglu, a ruling party lawmaker who has argued for lower interest rates, raising fears he will reverse the orthodox moves taken to battle inflation, which could lead to prolonged market volatility.
In his short time on the job, Agbal had raised rates by 875 basis points to 19% and regained some policy credibility prompting the lira to rally from the depths
""Without much remaining reserves to defend the currency, and considering an expected exodus in foreign and local investor capital, it may be difficult for Turkey to avoid another currency crisis in the coming months,” said Societe Generale’s strategist Phoenix Kalen, in a research note.
Worries that this turmoil would spread to other emerging markets has helped the dollar, with USD/RUB, for example, rising 0.8% to 74.732 despite the Russian central bank raising its key rate on Friday for the first time since 2018.
Later this week, investors will turn their attention to a heavy slate of U.S. bond auctions focused in maturities that have seen heavy selling of late amid a brightening outlook for growth and inflation.
“The rising third wave of Covid-19 cases in Europe and the threat of a disorderly sell-off in US Treasuries still haunt risk sentiment. This is providing the dollar with some support,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Additionally, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are expected to make their first joint appearance before the U.S. House Financial Services committee to testify on Fed and Treasury pandemic policies on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Turkish lira slumped toward a record low versus the dollar after President Tayyip Erdogan stunned investors over the weekend by replacing the hawkish central bank governor with a critic of high interest rates.
The yen rose against the euro and the antipodean currencies on speculation that Japanese investors who have been buying the lira recently for its high rates will cut losses and close out their positions.
Worries that events in Turkey will cause disruptions in other financial markets also supported the dollar because of its status as a safe-harbour currency.
""Other emerging market countries are not in the same position as Turkey, but there still could be some contagion,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""There are concerns that people will start taking profits in other markets. This looks like a time to re-think your investment strategy, because the rotation into higher-yielding emerging market currencies will be put on hold.""
The Turkish lira stood at 8.0500 per dollar, down 10% from its close on Friday.
At one point the lira fell by as much as 14.9% to 8.4850, which is close to a record low of 8.5800.
Analysts said they are braced for bigger moves as more investors enter markets later in the day.
The yen edged up against the euro, the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, boosted by expectations that Japanese retail investors who lost money on the lira will unwind other popular cross yen trades.
The dollar eased slightly to 108.82 yen but steadied against the British pound at $1.3851.
The euro fell slightly to $1.1892.
Erdogan fired the central bank governor only two days after a sharp rate increase that was meant to head off inflation of nearly 16% and support the lira.
The new central bank governor will most likely lead to a reversal of the hawkish and orthodox steps taken to battle inflation, which could lead to prolonged market volatility, analysts said.
""After regaining investor confidence with a series of aggressive rate hikes, Turkey has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,"" analysts at Brown, Brothers and Harriman wrote in memo.
Worries that turmoil would spread to other emerging markets helped the dollar rise against the Thai baht, the Indonesian rupiah, and the Philippine peso.
The onshore yuan held steady at 6.5085 against the greenback after China kept its benchmark lending rate for corporate and household loans unchanged for an 11th straight month.
A decline in risk appetite weighed on the Australian dollar, which fell to $0.7724. The New Zealand dollar also fell slightly to $0.7155.
Further declines in the Aussie and the kiwi are likely to be limited because both currencies will still benefit from rising commodity prices and an acceleration in global trade, Mizuho's Yamamoto said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira plunged 15% to near its all-time low after markets opened following President Tayyip Erdogan's shock weekend decision to oust a hawkish central bank governor and install a like-minded critic of high interest rates. 
The appointment of Sahap Kavcioglu, a former banker and ruling party lawmaker, in the early hours on Saturday marked the third time since mid-2019 that Erdogan has abruptly fired a central bank chief.
Kavcioglu had sought to ease concerns over a sharp selloff in Turkish assets and a pivot from rate hikes to cuts in a 90-minute call on Sunday, in which he told bank CEOs he planned no immediate policy change, a source told Reuters. 
The currency tumbled to as weak as 8.4850 versus the dollar, from 7.2185 on Friday, back to levels touched in early November when it reached an intraday record of 8.58. It last changed hands at 8.0749.
""The lira is being smashed by investors fearing that the custodian of its value does not share their hopes for a stable currency underpinned by positive real interest rates,"" said Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow, adding that the lira may not yet have found a bottom.
""The real test will be when the volume comes in in Europe,"" he said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and others had expected a sharp dive in the lira and Turkish assets given the new governor's dovish and even unorthodox views, and what was seen as the latest damage to the bank's credibility amid years of policy interference that has dogged the major emerging market economy.
The weekend overhaul could soon reverse the hawkish steps taken by predecessor Naci Agbal, analysts said, and nudge Turkey toward a balance of payments crisis given its depleted buffer of FX reserves. 
One possible scenario would see the lira swing as much as 15% in both directions in Monday's European session as ""TRY sets off on a roller-coaster ride driven by capital flight, central bank interventions and bargain hunters,"" SEB Research wrote in a client note.
Erdogan fired Agbal two days after a sharp rate hike that was meant to head off inflation of nearly 16% and a dipping lira. 
In less than five months on the job, Agbal had raised rates by 875 basis points to 19% and regained some policy credibility as the lira rallied from its nadir. But the currency gave back most of those gains in less than 10 minutes as the week's trade began. 
""It is going to be a dark and long day on Monday,"" said one Turkish fund manager. 
Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities, predicted a 10%-15% lira depreciation over the coming days. 
The overhaul ""demonstrates the erratic nature of policy decisions in Turkey, especially with regard to monetary matters (and risks) looser, unorthodox, and eventually mostly pro-growth policies from now on,"" he said. 
On the call with Turkish bankers, Kavcioglu said any policy change would depend on lowering inflation, which he said was the primary goal, the source familiar with the call said. 
Kavcioglu said the current policy approach would continue, the source added. The central bank did not immediately comment. 
In a statement on Sunday, Kavcioglu said the bank would focus on permanently lowering inflation, which has been stuck in double digits for most of the last four years. 
A former member of parliament for Erdogan's AK Party (AKP), Kavcioglu has espoused the unorthodox views shared by the president. He wrote high rates ""indirectly cause inflation to rise,"" in a newspaper column last month.
WEEKEND OF QUESTIONS
Agbal's latest rate hike was 200 basis-points on Thursday which sparked a more than 3% lira rally. 
His hawkish stance dramatically cut Turkey's CDS risk gauges and started to reverse a years-long trend of funds abandoning local assets. 
But after Erdogan ousted Agbal, investors told Reuters they had worked through the weekend to predict how quickly and sharply Kavcioglu might cut rates - and how much the currency would retreat.
The heads of some local treasury desks had estimated offers up to 8.00 on Monday. At Istanbul's Grand Bazaar on Saturday, one trader said a dollar bought 7.80-7.90 of the local currency. 
Wall Street bank Goldman told clients it was reviewing investment recommendations and predicted a ""discontinuous"" drop in the lira, and a ""front-loaded"" rate-cutting cycle. 
The overhaul meant capital outflows appeared likely and a rapid adjustment in the current account may be necessary since markets would shy away from funding Turkey's chronic deficits, it said. 
Concerns over central bank independence have exacerbated Turkey's boom-and-bust economy and record dollarisation, and prompted last year's unorthodox and costly policy of FX interventions, economists say. 
The lira has lost half its value since a 2018 currency crisis. 

Kavcioglu said in the statement that policy meetings will remain on a monthly schedule, suggesting any rate cuts may wait until the next planned meeting on April 15.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, but the Turkish lira tumbled towards a record low against the greenback after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan replaced hawkish central bank governor Naci Agbal over the weekend.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.16% to 92.073 by 10:26 PM ET (2:26 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 108.84.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.30% to 0.7719 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 0.7151.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.5108.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.26% to 1.3832.
Erdogan fired Agbal in a surprise move that came two days after a sharp rate hike aimed at heading off nearly 16% inflation and support the lira. With Sahap Kavcioglu now at the helm, the central bank will likely reverse the hawkish steps taken to battle inflation so far, which could lead to prolonged market volatility.
The Turkish lira stood at 8.10 per dollar in early Asia trade, down 11% from its close on Friday. The lira fell by as much as 14.9% to 8.4850 at one point, close to a record low of 8.5800. Liquidity was thin during early trading in Asia, but some investors were bracing for bigger moves as European and U.S. markets open later in the day.
“After regaining investor confidence with a series of aggressive rate hikes, Turkey has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,” Brown, Brothers, and Harriman analysts said in a note.
Other inventors worried that the events in Turkey could cause disruptions in other financial markets giving the safe-haven dollar a boost.
“Other emerging market countries are not in the same position as Turkey, but there still could be some contagion… there are concerns that people will start taking profits in other markets. This looks like a time to re-think your investment strategy because the rotation into higher-yielding emerging market currencies will be put on hold,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
The yen climbed against the euro, the AUD, and the NZD, with the safe-haven asset boosted by expectations that Japanese investors will cut their losses on the lira, which they had bought due to its high rates, and unwind other popular cross yen trades.
Further declines in the AUD and the NZD are likely to be limited because both currencies will still benefit from rising commodity prices and an acceleration in global trade, Mizuho’s Yamamoto said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gave up early gains on Friday as Treasury yields dipped from near 14-month highs, while investors digested the Federal Reserve's pushback against expectations of any early interest-rate hikes.
The dollar index was down about 0.1% at 91.689 after rising as much as 0.2% in early Asian trading. 
The euro gained versus the dollar after posting its worst day in two weeks on Thursday. The British pound rose 0.1% to $1.3951.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) pledged this week to press on with aggressive monetary stimulus, saying a near-term spike in inflation would prove temporary amid projections for the strongest U.S economic growth in nearly 40 years.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield climbed to a more-than-one-year peak of 1.754% overnight before easing to 1.6821%.
""With the Fed looking for the unemployment rate to drop below 5% this year and below 4% in 2023, it (is) difficult to see how long the 10-year bond yield can hold below 2%,"" said Chang Wei Liang, macro strategist at Singapore-based DBS Bank.
""Overall, the FOMC affirmed our decision on Monday to upgrade the outlook for the dollar to push above 92 towards 94 by mid-year.""
The yen dipped briefly after the Bank of Japan widened its target band for the benchmark yield in a decision that was in line with market expectations.
The dollar was last down 0.1% at 108.760 yen after small gains overnight.
""There's no reason for dollar-yen to react to the latest results of the BOJ assessment because it's almost in line with what the media reported in advance,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""For dollar-yen, U.S. Treasury yield change is a much more important driver than the JGB yield change.""
The euro was up at $1.1935 after tumbling 0.5% on Thursday.
While AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccinations are poised to restart in Germany, France and other European nations, the region's growth outlook suffered as Paris went into a month-long lockdown.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin stood at around $57,530 after briefly topping $60,000 again overnight. 
It had surged to a record high of $61,781.83 on Saturday, after more than doubling since the start of the year.
""Bitcoin is a momentum trade and it feels like it could go a lot further,"" said Edward Moya, a New York-based senior market analyst at online FX broker OANDA. ""Is it a bubble? Yes. But it can easily go to $100,000 before it comes crashing down.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Friday, but remains at elevated levels, supported by higher Treasury yields following the Federal Reserve's dovish stance.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 91.710, following a 0.5% jump Thursday, the most in two weeks. 
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 108.81, falling slightly after the Bank of Japan widened its target band for the benchmark 10-year yield by an implicit 5 basis points. The move that had been trailed in the press and BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda downplayed suggestions that it was tightening its policy.
GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3951, after weakening 0.3% a day earlier on concerns that the U.K.'s vaccination campaign is set to slow. The Bank of England maintained its easy policy stance at its meeting on Thursday and warned the outlook for Britain's recovery remained unclear.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1930 after falling around 0.5% Thursday as a third wave of Covid-19 cases hit large parts of Europe, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.1% to 0.7762.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear earlier this week that the central bank will maintain its stance of aggressive monetary stimulus, saying a near-term spike in inflation would prove temporary even though the Fed is projecting the strongest U.S economic growth in nearly 40 years. 
This resulted in the benchmark U.S. 10-year yield climbing over 1.75% overnight, its highest level since January 2020, before easing below 1.70% in early European trading.
“The Fed keeps repeating that inflation will be allowed to overshoot and that they need to see the inflation first before anything related to tightening can be just barely considered,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
“This will, in our view, allow USD bond yields and inflation expectations to continue to increase during Q2 (potentially a lot).”
Looking at the emerging markets, USD/RUB fell 0.3% to 74.115 with Russia’s central bank meeting later Friday. It’s expected to keep interest rates on hold at 4.25%, but pressure is building on the central bank to tighten policy as soaring food prices and a sanctions-weakened currency have driven inflation to the fastest pace in four years. Brazil and Turkey, two of the world's biggest emerging markets, both hiked rates by more than expected earlier this week to rein in inflation.
USD/TRY fell 0.4% to 7.2904, meaning that the lira has gained over 3.5% against the dollar this week.
“The Turkish central bank made an aggressive 200bp adjustment to the policy rate on the back of deteriorating global risk appetite, an uptrend in commodity prices and a weakening lira, adding to elevated inflation risks,” said ING analysts, in a research note.

Investing.com – The dollar inched down on Friday morning in Asia but was boosted by rising Treasury yields and a fall in global shares. Investors also continue to contemplate the U.S. Federal Reserve’s deflection of early interest-rate hike expectations.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01 at 91.862 by 11:59 AM ET (3:59 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 108.89.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.7742 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7166.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.13% to 6.5136 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3916.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield climbed to a more than one-year peak of 1.754% during the previous session before dropping to 1.715%. The Fed handed down its policy decision on Wednesday and pledged to carry on with aggressive monetary stimulus.
“After some navel-gazing,” bond investors “concluded that the Fed is not [posing] any challenges or discomfort for longer-dated UST yields to keep pushing higher,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
“The USD regained its mojo,” the note added.
Rounding up a week of central bank policy decisions, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) handed down its own decision earlier in the day. BOJ also announced the results of a comprehensive policy review and was expected to slightly widen the implicit band in which it allows long-term interest rates to move around its 0% target.
The Bank of England (BOE) handed down its decision the day before. It also warned that the outlook for U.K.’s recovery from COVID-19 remained unclear, which disappointed expectations that BOE would signal a more confident outlook.
Elsewhere in Europe, several countries, including Germany and France, plan to resume usage of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC/University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s endorsement of the vaccine on Thursday to calm jitters over potential side effects is set to give the continent's COVID-19 vaccination rollout a boost.
However, a third wave of COVID-19 cases in France saw Paris and other parts of the country enter a fresh lockdown, dampening investor sentiment. The euro slipped 0.1%, extending Thursday’s 0.5% drop.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin weakened to around $56,703 as the Asian trading session got underway, after briefly surpassing the $60,000 mark during the previous session. It had climbed to a fresh record high of $61,781.83 during the previous week, after more than doubling since the start of 2021.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Thursday, helped by rising U.S. Treasury yields even after the Federal Reserve reiterated that it was in no hurry to raise interest rates while predicting strong growth in the world’s largest economy.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 91.602, climbing from the low of 91.295 seen earlier in the session. 
USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 109.18, near the nine-month high hit earlier this week, as the Bank of Japan starts its two-day policy meeting, ending on Friday. A Nikkei report earlier Thursday said the BOJ is expected to slightly widen an implicit band at which it allows long-term interest rates to move around its 0% target.
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1957, but not far removed from its one-week high of 1.1989, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7812.
Chairman Jerome Powell made it pretty clear, as he handed down the central bank's latest policy decision on Wednesday, that the Fed would be sticking to its easy money policies for some time, even while predicting a strong economic recovery and a jump in inflation above target.
The Fed predicted that the economy would grow 6.5% in 2021, the largest annual jump in GDP since 1984 and a hefty increase from the 4.2% growth projected just three months ago. It saw core personal consumer expenditures - its favored measure of inflation - at 2.2% by the end of the year, and remaining marginally above 2% for the next two years.
The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury note climbed above 1.73%, its highest level in more than a year, providing support for the greenback in the wake of Powell’s dovish comments.
“Four out of eighteen FOMC members see a rate hike in 2022 compared to only one in December,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “which is another way of showing that the Fed has turned more upbeat, but they remain extremely cautious in terms of sounding just barely tightening biased and a clear consensus still refrains from hinting of any hikes at all.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3948, having gained around 0.5% overnight. The Bank of England is not expected to change its monetary policy stance when it meets later Thursday, but it probably will emphasize its high bar for tightening monetary policy even as the economic outlook brightens.
Looking at the emerging markets, USD/TRY rose 0.8% to 7.5601, ahead of a meeting by Turkey’s central bank, which is expected to result in a rise in borrowing costs.  The Indonesian rupiah was stable after Bank Indonesia left its key rate unchanged, while the Brazilian real was holding on to a 0.8% gain after the Brazilian central bank delivered the biggest interest-rate increase in more than a decade in order to tame inflation, hiking by 75 basis points to 2.75%, and becoming the first Group of 20 country to lift rates this year.
USD/BRL rose 0.1% to 5.5845 in early European trading.
Most economists see the central bank lifting its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 18%, in order to combat soaring inflationary risks given the recent rises in oil prices and lira volatility."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on the defensive on Thursday after the Federal Reserve signalled it was in no hurry to raise interest rates through all of 2023 even as it saw a swift recovery in the world's largest economy.
The dollar's index against six major currencies stood at 91.488. It had hit a two-week low of 91.340 after remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampened speculation the stronger economic outlook could propel the central bank to wind back its stimulus.
The euro eased to $1.19655, but was hovering close to its one-week high of $1.19900 after rallying 0.6% on Wednesday.
""What the Fed said is a very market-friendly outcome. It's negative for the dollar, good for inflation expectations,"" said Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone Markets Ltd, a foreign exchange broker based in Melbourne.
""Ultimately, the market was kind of positioned for something a little bit more hawkish, and maybe the fact that those rate hikes are pushed out to 2023 has been enough to cause some decent dollar selling.""
The U.S. central bank now sees the economy growing 6.5% this year, which would be the largest annual jump in gross domestic product since 1984. Inflation is now expected to exceed the Fed's 2% target to 2.4% this year, although officials think it will move back to around 2% in subsequent years.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield edged back up to about 1.6710% and was nearing a more-than-one-year high.
Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.2% to as low as 108.620 yen after a Nikkei report said the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to slightly widen an implicit band at which it allows long-term interest rates to move around its 0% target.
A recent Reuters poll showed two thirds of Japanese firms had expected the BOJ to curb rises in long-term interest rates and keep them steady ahead of the central bank's review this week on how it will make its stimulus policy more sustainable.
The British pound traded at $1.3946, having gained about 0.5% overnight.
The Bank of England is expected to keep its benchmark Bank Rate at a historic low of 0.1% and its bond-buying programme unchanged at 895 billion pounds later in the day. 
""Similar to what we've seen from the Fed, the Bank of England will talk up their prospects of the economy relative to where we've been, but at the same time emphasize that we're still a long way from full recovery,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
""We expect the BoE to gently warn against the shift in market pricing from a rate cut to around 50bps of hikes over the next three years."" 
The Australian dollar rose to a two-week high of $0.78350, whereas its New Zealand counterpart briefly lost momentum after the country posted a surprise contraction in GDP in the final three months of last year.
The kiwi dollar last traded at $0.7241.
Bitcoin held firm at $58,954.64, having bounced from Tuesday's one-week low of $53,221.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, with the U.S. Federal Reserve saying it was in no rush to raise interest rates through all of 2023 even after predicting a V-shaped recovery in the U.S. economy.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.10% to 91.483 by 9:42 PM ET (1:42 AM GMT) but was at its lowest level in two weeks.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.24% to 109.09.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.37% to 0.7823 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7245. New Zealand’s GDP posted a surprise contraction of 1% quarter-on-quarter during the fourth quarter of 2020 earlier in the day.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.14% to 6.4948 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 1.3950.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stuck to his dovish tone as he handed down the Fed's latest policy decision on Wednesday, putting paid to speculation that the central bank would pull back its stimulus as hopes rise for a strong economic recovery.
“It was the usual Jay after all... markets have been thinking the Fed will raise rates perhaps once next year and a couple of more times in 2023... there will remain questions over whether the Fed can control inflation,”  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank Tokyo Branch Manager Bart Wakabayashi told Reuters.
The Fed also predicted that the economy would grow 6.5% in 2021, the largest annual jump in GDP since 1984 and a 2.3 percentage points difference from its projection three months ago.
Inflation is predicted at 2.4%, above the Fed’s 2% target. However, seven of 18 Fed officials now expect higher rates in 2023, compared to five in December 2020.
The Fed’s comments also sent the ten-year U.S. Treasuries yield on a roller-coaster ride, with yields at around 1.648% during the Asian session.
Some investors remain concerned about potential further market volatility, however.
“While our view remains that movements in yields through the latter part of February and into March have been akin to a ‘taper-less tantrum’, there is potential for further market volatility, perhaps around ‘data tantrums’ over the coming months,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management macro strategist Gurpreet Gill said in a note.
In other central bank news, the Bank of England is widely expected to leave its benchmark bank rate at a historic low of 0.1% and its bond-buying program unchanged when it hands down its policy decision later in the day. The Bank of Japan will hand down its own policy decision on Friday."

Investing.com – The dollar slumped on Wednesday, paced by a decline in U.S. bond yields after the Federal Reserve kept rates on hold and projected no hikes through 2023.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.43% to 91.48 as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield retreated from 13-month highs.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would continue its $120 billion monthly bond purchases.
""Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak. Inflation continues to run below 2 percent,"" the Fed said in a statement.
The Fed upped its growth targets for the years ahead, forecasting the economy to grow by 6.5% in 2021, and 3.3% in 2022, but it kept its interest-rate outlook unchanged for no hike through 2023. 
""We will give a signal that we're on a path to possibly achieve substantial growth to consider tapering. I think what we've learned from the experience of these last dozen years, is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, [and] well in advance,"" Powell said."

Investing.com - The dollar maintained a strong tone in early European trading Wednesday, as traders looked forward to the conclusion of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting for guidance on future monetary policies.
At 3:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 91.925, having risen for three straight sessions on support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields. 
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 109.15, near the nine-month high hit earlier this week, and ahead of the Bank of Japan’s two-day policy meeting ending Friday. 
GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3915, ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.1% to 0.7736.
The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, and is expected to update its economic forecasts to predict stronger U.S. economic growth in the wake of a ramped-up Covid-19 vaccination program and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus.
That said, “a substantial shift in tone by the FOMC appears unlikely and markets will probably remain unfussed by a mere reiteration of the “lower-for-longer” (and QE for longer) pledge despite improved recovery prospects,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Traders will also be looking to see whether the Fed will give any inclination to start raising interest rates in 2023, earlier than it has previously said.
“That would likely lift the dollar, which should otherwise see its upside limited given no deviation from the current ultra-dovish stance,” ING added. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1892, not far removed from last week's 3 1/2-month low of $1.1835 as concerns grow about further lockdowns in Europe and delays in vaccinations.
Late Tuesday, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said his country had entered a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, as the seven-day average of new cases rose above 25,000 for the first time since late November.
This comes after France, along with a few other European countries, suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, against the advice of the region’s medical authorities.
“There is a risk that public trust on the vaccine has been compromised, and this may weigh on the euro as the vaccination gap between the EU and US may widen even further,” added ING.
Additionally, Brazil’s central bank meets later Wednesday, and is poised to hike interest rates by 50 basis points, becoming the first Group of 20 country to lift rates this year.
The bank is expected to do so to stem a slide in the currency that’s pushing inflation higher, driven, at least in part, by the amount the country has spent trying to shield its economy from the effects of the pandemic.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, with other major currencies holding tight ranges ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 91.903 by 12:59 AM ET (4:59 AM GMT). The index has risen for the past three sessions, boosted by U.S. bond yields that are climbing as expectations of a strong economic recovery grow.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 109.12.
The AUD/USD edged down 0.12% to 0.7735 and the NZD/USD inched down 0.07% to 0.7184.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.5024, while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3895.
The Fed decision is widely expected to match the rosy view, with investors watching for any indications the central bank could start rate hikes earlier or let bond yields rise further.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades, as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout gathers pace and U.S. households start to benefit from a $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed into law during the previous week.
The more pertinent question for investors is whether the Fed will give any inclination to start raising interest rates in 2023, earlier than it has previously said. Such a move could drive a further rally in the dollar.
“The Fed will likely revise up its economic forecast. But for its median forecast on the Fed funds rate in 2023 to be raised, four or more members have to raise their projections. So the market’s expectations of earlier rate hikes may not be validated by the Fed,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
“But on the other hand, the Fed is likely to sit idle on rising long-term rates as well. All considered, it is hard to expect the dollar/yen to weaken after the FOMC, though it could face more headwinds if it tests new highs,” Kadota added.
The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will hand their own decisions down on Thursday and Friday respectively.
The euro was at $1.1903, after its downward trend over the last three days, with Sweden and Latvia the latest countries to suspend usage of the AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)/University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine over potential side effects concerns. The growing list of countries doing the same is dealing a further blow to Europe’s vaccine rollout.
The European Medicines Agency will release the results of its side effects investigation on Thursday.
“Depending on the outcome, it could hurt the euro zone’s business sentiment further and the euro could face fresh selling pressure on the low vaccination theme,” Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno told Reuters."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held gains against major currencies on Wednesday as investors looked to the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting for indications it could start rate hikes earlier or let bond yields rise further.
Against the yen, the greenback firmed 0.1% to 109.085 yen, hovering near nine-month highs hit this week. The euro was flat versus the dollar after declining in the past three sessions.
With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on cues that the central bank could start raising interest rates in 2023, earlier than it had said. 
""It is likely that the FOMC's economic forecasts will acknowledge the improved growth picture this year, but will continue to show a long road toward conditions consistent with maximum employment that would put sustained pressure on inflation,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Matthew Hornbach said.
""The Fed being more dovish than expected would suggest U.S. yields and the dollar moving lower in the near term, particularly against risk currencies, but we continue to see upside risks for USD into 2Q.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Tuesday, amid cautious trading with the focus very much on the Federal Reserve in a week dominated by central bank meetings.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 91.927.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 109.22, after rising to a nine-month high of 109.36 on Monday and ahead of the Bank of Japan’s two-day policy meeting starting Thursday. 
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1919, while GBP/USD fell 0.5% to 1.3831, ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday on a combination of rising inflation expectations and confidence that the Bank of England will keep its policy unchanged at its meeting on Thursday. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.3% to 0.7736.
The main focus will be on the Federal Reserve this week, as it begins its two-day policy meeting later Tuesday. 
While the U.S. central bank is not expected to make any changes to its current monetary policy, what Chairman Jerome Powell has to say about the run-up in bond yields will be keenly studied amid concerns that economic growth and rising inflation could prompt a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy. 
“A largely unchanged FOMC statement and a Jay Powell press conference repeating that the Fed has a long way to go before reducing stimulus should prevent the dollar running too far ahead,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The market is also waiting for a decision on the supplemental leverage ratio exemption, a move that allows big banks to exclude reserve deposits and Treasury holdings from their capital ratio calculations. This is due to expire at the end of this month.
“Failing to extend it would be a big surprise, hit Treasuries and also hit equities on the view that U.S. banks would have to raise more equity capital,” ING added.
Away from the Fed, Norway’s central bank is likely to keep its key policy rate unchanged when it meets on Thursday, but the upturn in inflationary pressures will make for increasingly difficult decisions for Turkey’s central bank, also on Thursday, and Russia’s on Friday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar clung to small gains on Tuesday as caution reigned in currency markets ahead of major central bank meetings, beginning with a two-day Federal Reserve gathering due to start later in the global day.
The greenback hovered just off its highest since June versus the yen and cemented a position around $1.19 per euro in muted trading.
The firmer tone for the dollar came despite a retreat in U.S. benchmark yields from the highest levels in more than a year ahead of the Fed meeting. 
Expectations are running low for monetary policymakers to shift from their accommodative stance despite forecasts of rapid economic growth in the wake of an accelerating COVID-19 vaccine roll-out and a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.
Investors will pore over whatever the Fed has to say about the run-up in yields, which have risen on bets that economic growth and inflation could prompt a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy.
""It's a very pivotal meeting from that perspective,"" said Mayank Mishra, an FX strategist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank in Singapore.
""The other thing that is being awaited is any decision on the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) exemption. We don't expect any explicit push back on back-end yields, but an extension of the SLR can offer some relief to the market.""
The SLR exemption, a regulatory break that allows big banks to exclude reserve deposits and Treasuries from capital ratios, is due to expire on March 31.
The dollar was little changed at 109.170 yen after rising to a nine-month high of 109.365 on Monday. The Bank of Japan begins a two-day policy meeting on Thursday, along with an extensive policy review.
The euro was largely flat at $1.19330, languishing below $1.20 since March 5. Europe's vaccine roll-out has been hampered by the suspension of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots in Germany, France and other nations amid concerns about possible serious side effects.
Sterling fell about 0.2% to $1.3871 ahead of a Bank of England meeting on Thursday, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at its historic low of 0.1% and its bond-buying programme unchanged.
The dollar's index against six major currencies was flat at 91.798 after rising nearly 0.2% on Monday.
The Australian dollar, viewed widely as a liquid proxy for risk appetite, and the New Zealand dollar were little changed against the U.S. dollar. The commodity-linked currencies are on course to post their fourth straight quarterly gain as commodity prices rebound on bets of economic growth.
Bitcoin, meanwhile, slipped to $54,198.64 following its jump to a record $61,781.83 on Saturday.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, holding onto small gains ahead of a week of central bank meetings, headlined by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day gathering that starts later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 91.882 by 10:15 PM ET (2:15 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 109.19, with the dollar little changed at 109.170 yen early in the Asian session, after hitting the 109.365-mark overnight. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) will begin its own two-day policy meeting along with an extensive policy review, on Thursday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7747 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7198.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.5028 and the GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3876.
The dollar’s gains come amid a retreat in U.S. benchmark yields from their highest levels in more than a year ahead of the Fed meeting. The benchmark ten-year Treasury yield was last at 1.6073%, after climbing to 1.6420% at the end of the previous week.
The Fed is widely expected to make few changes to its current monetary policy. However, investor concerns about runaway inflation continue to grow, fueled by the global COVID-19 vaccine rollout, a $1.9 trillion stimulus package in the U.S., and optimism for a faster-than-expected global recovery from COVID-19.
A particular focus for investors will be on any Fed comments addressing the run-up in yields. Of particular interest would be whether the movement in yields will prompt central banks to normalize policy quicker than they have so far signaled.
“Markets (are) essentially marking time ahead of the FOMC meeting,” which is “keeping investors a little bit cautious … there is a lot of focus on whether the new forecasts and dots plot will vindicate the current lift in Fed hike expectations,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) foreign-exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
Other central banks due to hand down their policy decisions as the week progresses are the Bank of England, whose decision comes on Thursday, followed by BOJ.
The euro remained largely unchanged and remained below the $1.20 mark since Mar. 5 as Europe’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout runs into some snags. Germany and France are among the European countries that have suspended the AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)/University of Oxford shot over concerns about potential side effects.
Bitcoin continued to slide downwards from the record $61,781.83 high reached on Saturday, hovering around $54,782 on Tuesday."
526,"<span>Mar 15, 2021 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan’s policy review to shore up its stimulus for the longer term is set to land this week as rising bond yields cause angst for central bankers around the world.
The European Central Bank has already made clear it intends to keep pumping out more stimulus while the Federal Reserve is expected to remain cautious over the strength of the post-pandemic recovery at its meeting starting Tuesday.
That means the BOJ needs to avoid pushing through any changes that give the impression it is stepping off the accelerator pedal when it announces the review’s findings around lunchtime in Tokyo on Friday.
But if global bond pressures are vexing the Fed and ECB, they may be more welcome in Tokyo, where yields are controlled in a tight band around zero. The growing difference between Japanese sovereign and U.S. Treasury yields has already helped weaken the yen against the dollar, and the resulting tailwind for exporters and the inflation outlook is a favorable development for the BOJ.
“This is a very sensitive time for communications at global central banks such as the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ,” said Shigeto Nagai, Japan’s head of Oxford Economics and a former senior BOJ official. “With little room for further easing, the BOJ is looking to send the most dovish message among them to keep the yen weak, and yield curve control is a useful framework for highlighting the difference.”
That’s why most economists and investors expect the review to deliver only a fine tuning of its measures.
Still, as criticism mounts over the central bank’s huge footprint in the government bond and stock markets, the BOJ also needs to show the review has taken sufficient consideration of the adverse effects of its easing measures.

According to media reports and economists’ expectations, the BOJ is likely to:
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“The rapid rise in global yields likely limited the BOJ’s ability to make its yield curve control and asset purchases more flexible and an ultimate exit easier. Still, even minor policy adjustments should help it roll out stimulus for longer.”
-- Yuki Masujima, economist

Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced the policy review in December with the yen around 103 against the dollar, consumer prices falling at the fastest pace in a decade and with the BOJ having just become the largest individual owner of Japanese stocks to add to its long-held position as the nation’s biggest holder of government debt.
Despite fears of inflation accelerating elsewhere in the world, Kuroda doesn’t see Japan hitting its 2% goal before 2024. Hence the need to alleviate some of the harmful side effects of its measures for stimulus that will stay in place for years to come.
Since the call for the review, long-term Treasury yields have jumped around 70 basis points in the U.S. compared with around 10 in Japan, and the dollar is hovering around 109 yen.
“If the yield differential keeps up the weakening pressure on the yen, that’s a positive for the BOJ and has probably helped it avert taking more drastic action,” said Takenobu Nakashima, chief rates strategist at Nomura Securities.
Most of the tweaks to be unveiled in the review will aim to mollify discontent among bond traders, commercial banks, pension funds, life insurers and stock activists.
If the show must go on with its inflation goal still distant, the BOJ needs more participants in Japan’s economy to cheer it on.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gained for a second consecutive session on Monday as rising U.S. Treasury yields forced traders to cut their bearish dollar bets to four-month lows.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were trading at 1.6320% on Monday, close to Friday's top of 1.6420%, a level last seen in February. Rising U.S. yields have lifted the greenback in recent weeks thanks to widening interest rate differentials relative to other major bond markets. 
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, held at around 91.84 in early London trading on Monday. It hit a late November 2020 high of 92.51 last week.
Rising bond yields will continue to dominate investors' minds this week before a Federal Reserve meeting at which some analysts expect policymakers to strike an optimistic tone on the U.S. economy.
""The Fed is not expected to tinker with its monetary policy but instead communicate via forecasts that the situation is under control and that markets are running way ahead of themselves,"" SEB analysts said in a note.
U.S. producer prices increased strongly in February, leading to the largest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years, with the country's economy set for a massive shot in the arm from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package.[
The greenback rose 0.2% against the yen to 109.22 yen, drifting to its highest since June 2020. 
The euro weakened 0.2% to $1.1925 after rising last week for the first time in three weeks as latest data showed hedge funds slashed their net euro positions.
The Australian dollar -- viewed widely as a liquid proxy for risk appetite -- fell 0.3% to $0.7732, extending Friday's 0.4% loss.
Bitcoin weakened 1.4% after surging to a record high of $61,781.83 over the weekend.

The dollar has been supported by a paring of bets for its decline, with speculators cutting net short positions to the lowest since mid-November in the week ended March 9.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Monday, helped by a jump in Treasury yields on inflation concerns ahead of this week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 91.817, climbing from the one-week low of 91.364 seen at the end of last week.
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 109.23, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1928, after rising last week for the first time in three weeks, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3912, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.4% to 0.7734.
Traders have started to become wary of rising inflationary pressures on the back of massive fiscal stimuli and pent-up consumer demand as the vaccination campaign ends lockdowns.
U.S. producer prices had their biggest annual gain in over two years, data showed on Friday, and this is before President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package comes into effect.
Benchmark 10-Year Treasury yields were at 1.62% on Monday, close to Friday's top of 1.64%.
This will put the spotlight on the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, ending on Wednesday. Expectations are low that the central bank will announce major policy changes at its second meeting of the year, but it’s likely to raise its estimates of 2021 growth and inflation while making its first quarterly economic forecasts of the year.
“ [Fed chief] Jay Powell will be faced with a truck-load of inflation questions on Wednesday, and if he keeps referring to inflation being allowed to ‘moderately overshoot’, then we should expect long bond yields to continue up since inflation expectations will likely follow,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Both the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England are also set to hold policy meetings later in the week.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.5057, with the yuan helped by the release of strong Chinese economic data, suggesting the world’s second largest economy is recovering strongly from the Covid pandemic.
National Bureau of Statistics data released earlier Monday indicated that industrial production grew 35.1% year-on-year in February, while retail sales climbed 33.8% year-on-year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, holding firm after bouncing off a one-week low hit during the previous week. The greenback was supported by a rise in benchmark Treasury yields to more-than-one-year highs as inflation fears continue to persist.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 91.748 by 13:14 AM ET (5:14 AM GMT) after climbing from near a one-week low at the end of the previous week. The dollar Index contract rolled over to the Jun. 21 contract on Mar. 14.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 109.19.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.23% to 0.7744 while the NZD/USD pair was up 0.28% to 0.7195.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.5048. Chinese data released earlier in the day said that industrial production grew 35.1% year-on-year in February, above the 30% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previously recorded 7.3% growth.
Retail sales also soared 33.8% year-on-year, against the predicted 32% growth and the previously recorded 4.6% growth. The unemployment rate was at 5.5%, higher than the previously recorded 5.2%.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3923.
Investor worries about a faster-than-expected economic recovery leading to runaway inflation grew after a $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law and the pace of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts quickens. U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered every state to make all adults eligible for vaccination by May 1.
Benchmark ten-year Treasury yields were at 1.6282% on Monday, not far from the record 1.6420% hit on Friday.
The U.S. currency has also been supported as investors pared bets on its decline and cut net short positions to the lowest since mid-November in the week ended Mar. 9, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The dollar index has gained 1.8% in 2021, tracking the rise in benchmark yields from below 1%. It fell nearly 7% In 2020, and some investors expect the dollar to resume that move downwards in due course.
“Higher bond yields alone are unlikely to sustain the upswing in USD,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analysts said in a note, adding dollar declines were coming “soon”.
“The move higher in bond yields largely reflects the better economic outlook, which is ultimately a weight on the USD,” the note added.
On the central bank front, the U.S. Federal Reserve will hand down its policy decision on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of England on Thursday and the Bank of Japan on Friday.
Bitcoin dropped below the $60,000 mark after surging past a record $61,000 over the weekend. India will reportedly push ahead on a proposed law banning cryptocurrencies and fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets. The law, if it came into force, would be one of the strictest policies against digital assets."

Investing.com – The dollar rose Friday, but remains set to snap a two-week winning streak as investors turned attention to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting due next week that could prove to be a ""wildcard"" for U.S. bonds yields, which have been driving up the greenback.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.26% to 91.66, driven by a move higher in U.S. rates as investors bet on stimulus-led recovery.
The backdrop of liquidity from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, the ongoing positive economic data, and the greater supply of bonds – to fund the government spending – will likely continue to support rates in the near term, but the Federal Reserve remains a key wildcard, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
""[W]e do expect the rate move to continue in the very near term. The Fed as ever remains a key wildcard,"" Jefferies added. ""So we do think folks need to watch the price action quite closely here going into next week’s Fed meeting,"" it added.
The Fed will provide a fresh update on its economic outlook that will likely reflect the faster pace of growth and the transitory inflation pressures, but with the labor market still below pre-pandemic levels, the central bank will stick with its projection on rates to remain near zero through 2023.
The increasing scrutiny over price action in the bond market comes in the wake of a rapid move higher in bond yields, which trade inversely to price, and is more often a boon for the dollar. There are fears the move could signal inflation is at risk of the spiraling of control. Still, the level of concern appears overdone somewhat as real yields are only two basis points.
The press conference that follows the Fed decision was be closely watched after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a recent virtual event -- hosted by the Wall Street Journal -- said the move in rates has caught his attention, but he downplayed the risk of the runaway inflation.  
""Bonds sold off after Powell’s WSJ Q&A, pressuring risk assets and lifting the dollar. If the Fed Chair can present a dovish narrative in such a way that US Treasuries avoid a disorderly sell-off, then those currencies exposed to the global business cycle – including the EUR – can probably enjoy some modest gains later in the week,"" ING said in a note."
531,"<span>Mar 12, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday, recovering its losses from the day before, as a spike in Treasury yields early in the European session triggered a risk-off move in global currency markets, with riskier currencies taking a hit.
Market participants have grown wary in recent weeks that there could be a spike in inflation caused by massive fiscal stimulus and pent-up consumer demand when economies reopen from their coronavirus lockdowns.
Although soft U.S. CPI data on Wednesday went some way to calm those fears, U.S. Treasuries sold off again on Friday, with the 10-year yield rising above 1.6%.
The dollar was up 0.4% on the day at 0840 GMT, at 91.835. But it was still below the high of 92.506 it reached on Tuesday, which was its strongest since November 2020.
""There is concern over inflation in the months ahead and that sense is dollar-supportive,"" said Neil Jones, head of FX sales at Mizuho.
""It looks like pretty upbeat in the United States in terms of rollout of further vaccine plays, and of course that feeds into the economic recovery in the States, and a time when fiscal stimulus is extremely high, monetary stimulus is extremely high,"" he said.
President Joe Biden told U.S. states on Thursday to make all adults eligible for a coronavirus vaccine by May 1, hours after he signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law.
The dollar index was still on track to end the week down by around 0.1% and Mizuho's Jones said he thought the strengthening on Friday was likely to be temporary.
""My personal view is that the dollar is not on a trajectory for a higher fundamental trend,"" he said.
Riskier currencies lost out, erasing recent gains. The Australian dollar - which is seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - fell by 0.5% to 0.77457 versus the U.S. dollar at 0841 GMT.
The New Zealand dollar was down around 0.6% against the U.S. dollar. The Norwegian crown lost out to both euro and dollar.
The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would increase the pace of its money printing to prevent a rise in euro zone bond yields.
Although the euro was down around 0.5% at $1.19325 at 0841 GMT, it was still set to end the week up 0.2% overall.
Market attention now turns to the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where traders will be looking for any comments about rising yields.
ING strategists wrote in a note to clients that the market will probably wait until after the Fed's meeting before pushing the dollar index into 90 and 91 territory. 
Dollar-yen was up around 0.6%, changing hands at 109.140 at 0842 GMT. That's close to the peak of 109.235 reached on Tuesday, which had been the yen's weakest since June 2020.
The dollar was gaining some support versus Asian currencies because of rising U.S.-China tensions, said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG.
The Biden administration amended licenses for companies to sell to China's Huawei, further restricting companies from supplying items that can be used with 5G devices. 

Elsewhere, bitcoin traded around $56,738 at 0838 GMT, having come close to, but not exceeded, its recent record high of $58,354.14.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Friday as Treasury yields returned to their recent highs, but it still looks set to record its first weekly fall in three. The euro and sterling were also in focus after the ECB meeting and the release of U.K. growth data.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.4% at 91.755, but just above the 91.364 low seen, the weakest level since March 4. 
The index has dropped around 0.4% this week, but has firmed around 2% this year to date as it tracked benchmark 10-year Treasury yields from below 1% to as high as 1.62% at the end of last week. On Friday, the yield stood at around 1.59%, climbing from the 1.55% level seen Thursday.
USD/JPY was up 0.5% at 109.03, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.5% to 0.7749.
U.S. President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package into law late Thursday, a day after the House of Representative gave its final approval, meaning that checks for $1,400 will arrive on the doorsteps of many Americans in the near future.
The dollar, along with U.S. Treasury yields, has been rising steadily due to expectations that the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus will stoke inflation. 
While this week’s consumer prices data dampened those expectations, recent employment numbers showed a strongly recovering labor market, with last week’s payrolls growing much more strongly than expected and Thursday’s jobless claims fell to the lowest level since the pandemic started.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1945 after the European Central Bank said on Thursday it would accelerate its emergency bond purchases over the next quarter to combat rising European bond yields.
“As long as the whole PEPP [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme] envelope is not extended, the negative impact on the euro should be limited as this only changes the pace of the bond purchases, but not the overall size,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Additionally, GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.3943 after the latest growth data showed Britain's economy shrank by 2.9% in January from December as the country went back into a coronavirus lockdown.
Although this was a smaller drop than expected, it still indicated that the economy was 9.2% smaller than in January last year.
The Bank of England stated last week that Britain’s economy is likely to shrink 4% in the first quarter of 2021, hit by the latest Covid-related lockdowns as well as post-Brexit trade disruptions.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but remained near a one-week low as calmer bond markets boosted investor sentiment and risk appetite overall.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 91.555 by 11:12 PM ET (4:12 AM GMT).
The dollar index kept near the 91.364 level reached during the previous session for the first time since Feb. 4. It has dropped around 0.6% during the past week, after retreating from a more than three-month high of 92.506 reached on Tuesday.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.21% to 108.72. The dollar consolidated against the yen, a fellow safe-haven currency, after pulling back from a nine-month high reached on Tuesday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7784 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7219. New Zealand lifted the remaining restrictions in Auckland, its largest city, after no locally transmitted COVID-19 cases were reported for two weeks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.09% to 6.4875 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 1.3982.
The index remains 1.6% higher in 2021, following ten-year Treasury yields that rose from below 1% to as high as 1.625% at the end of the previous week. Yields have since retreated to around 1.5% after auctions of ten-year Treasury benchmark and 30-year notes were successfully concluded.
Investors cheered as U.S. President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package into law, ahead of schedule and a day after the House of Representative gave its final approval on Wednesday.
On the data front, Wednesday’s core consumer prices data also eased fears that massive fiscal stimulus and continuous ultra-easy monetary policy could lead to runaway inflation. Fewer Americans claimed unemployment benefits than expected, with 712,000 claims filed over the past week against the 725,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 754,000 claims recorded during the previous week.
“Risk sentiment is back in the ascendancy … a 1.5% rather than 1% risk-free rate is evidently no longer a problem for risk assets,” although for the dollar, “it still looks a bit premature to call a resumption of the 2020 downtrend with any degree of conviction,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of forex strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
The euro also traded close to a one-week high, after the European Central Bank pledged to accelerate money-printing to keep yields down as it handed down its policy address on Thursday.
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin briefly rose above $58,000, near a record high. It last traded at $57,185.71, up more than 12% for the week, after rising past the $58,000 mark on Thursday for the first time since its record high of $58,354.14 set on Feb. 21."

Investing.com – The euro jumped against the dollar and looks set to snap its two-week losing streak as experts suggest that the single currency's downward trajectory is likely over for now following the latest's European Central Bank monetary policy meeting on Thursday.
EUR/USD rose 0.48%, to $1.1983.
""On what we’ve seen today the EUR has stabilised and there’s been no meaningful drop below our 1.1850 outlined support in recent days,"" National Bank Australia said following the ECB's monetary policy meeting and press conference from central bank president Christine Lagarde.
The European Central Bank left rates unchanged at 0.00%, as expected, but did pledge to step up its pace of bond purchases to stem the rise in European bond yields and keep financial conditions steady.
""While the ECB today predictably left unchanged its main policy parameters, including its interest rates and the EUR1.85 trillion PEPP ceiling, the Governing Council's post-meeting statement went further than expected in addressing concerns about its willingness to tolerate the recent upwards shift in yields,"" Daiwa Capital markets said in a note.
The euro looks set to trade in a range between $1.22 and $1.23 before stepping up gains to reach $1.26 by mid-year as the vaccine-led recovery takes shape.
""[W]e don’t see reason to chase the [euro] lower, unless the situation on the European vaccine side really deteriorates,"" National Bank Australia added.  ""Right now, it’s a case of Europe being a couple of months or so behind, but by the summer the northern hemisphere should be pretty much on the same page.""
The sentiment on the eurozone recovery echo the view laid out by the bank on Thursday.
The ECB upped 2021 GDP to 4.0% from 3.9% in December, and forecast that growth rise above pre-pandemic levels in the middle of next year. For 2022, however, it cut its forecast to 4.1% from 4.2%.  
""Looking ahead, the ongoing vaccination campaigns, together with the gradual relaxation of containment measures – barring any further adverse developments related to the pandemic – underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021,” Lagarde said."
535,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar index fell to its lowest in a week early in Thursday's European session and there was a mild ""risk on"" tone in currency markets, as attention turned to the European Central Bank's policy meeting.
Softer consumer prices data in the United States on Wednesday helped to ease fears about a possible spike in inflation when economies re-open from the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. Treasury yields declined from their recent spike.
At the European Central Bank meeting, policymakers are expected to send a message that they will prevent bond yields from rising further and harming the bloc's economic outlook.
The bank is expected to signal faster money printing but stop short of adding to its already aggressive policy package.
The ECB's policy decision will be at 1245 GMT, followed by a news conference at 1330 GMT.
Analysts at ING wrote in a note to clients that they do not expect the euro to be the focus of discussion, since it has fallen since the previous meeting. The euro-dollar pair is being more driven by dollar-related factors such as Treasury yields, ING said.
At 0834 GMT, the dollar was down around 0.2% at 91.606 against a basket of currencies, having dropped from the three month high of 92.506 it reached on Tuesday.
The euro was around 0.3% higher against the dollar, at $1.19585. It has fallen 2.1% so far this year.
""If the central bankers signal that they would not only be willing to exhaust their current asset purchasing programme but to even extend it in reaction to a further rise in yields, this might put a dampener on possible rate expectations thus putting pressure on the euro,"" wrote Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Thu Lan Nguyen in a note to clients.
""However, I would not expect a significant impact as the market is only expecting rate hikes in the euro zone to occur in the very distant future compared with the U.S. anyway,"" she said.
Elsewhere, currency markets showed signs of mildly increased risk appetite.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were up for the third session in a row, both at their highest in a week versus the U.S. dollar, helped by rising commodity prices.
The Norwegian crown was at its strongest in just over one year against the euro, with the pair changing hands at 10.032 at 0818 GMT.
Focus later in the day will be on an auction of 30-year U.S. Treasuries. An auction of 10-year notes on Wednesday drew sufficient demand, helping to allay concerns about investors' ability to absorb an increase in debt needed to finance the response to the pandemic.
""Considering the centrality of Treasury yields in the current market narrative, the auction should be a key driver of risk appetite: another contained reaction in yields (even in the event of a somewhat weak auction) may leave more room for risk stabilization and continue to benefit pro-cyclical currencies while keeping USD pressured,"" said ING.
The safe-haven Swiss franc dropped against both dollar and euro.
The Japanese yen was down around 0.2% versus the dollar at 108.605.
Also aiding the improved risk appetite was U.S. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill winning final approval in the House of Representatives on Wednesday.

Elsewhere, bitcoin was a touch lower, down around 2.2% on the day at $54,640. The cryptocurrency has recovered some recent losses but not surpassed its all-time high of $58,354.14 which was reached on Feb. 21.

Investing.com - The dollar traded marginally lower in early European trading Thursday after benign data eased inflation fears, while the upcoming European Central Bank meeting meant the euro was also in the spotlight.
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.727, after hitting a one-week low of 91.698 earlier.
USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 108.70, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3948, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7774.
The dollar, along with U.S. Treasury yields, has been rising steadily on a combination of loose fiscal and monetary policy - the U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to a massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package on Wednesday - will stoke a stronger recovery, leading to inflation and an earlier end to monetary stimulus than the Federal Reserve's messaging would suggest. 
However, this view took a hit Wednesday after data showed that core consumer prices rose by just 0.1% month-on-month in February, unchanged from January’s release. On the year, prices rose 1.3%, slowing down slightly from the 1.4% rate recorded in January.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was at 1.51% early Thursday, a considerable drop from the one-year high of 1.63% last week.
Focus later in the day will be on an auction of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds. A poorly received 7-year auction in February preceded the recent rise in yields, but both auctions - 3-year and 10-year - this week have drawn enough demand to ease concerns about the market’s ability to absorb this year's hefty increase in debt needed to finance the response to the pandemic.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1942 ahead of the European Central Bank latest policy-setting meeting, with the announcement due at 7:45 AM ET (1245 GMT). 
“With euro strength no longer a pressing issue and higher bond yields in focus instead, the ECB meeting should not be a risk event for the euro,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Instead of its views on the currency, investors will be looking for what the central bank says regarding bond yields with policymakers offering up differing views on the subject ahead of the meeting.
“While the ECB may talk about the unwarranted increase in yields and the tightening of financial conditions, more forceful action that would weigh on the single currency (i.e. an increase in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme's 'envelope' – be it an announcement or outright signaling) is highly unlikely,” added ING.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Investors cut long bets sharply on the Chinese yuan while turning short on most other Asian currencies, a Reuters poll showed, as U.S. economic growth and rising Treasury yields bolstered the dollar.
Expectation that the U.S. economic recovery will far outpace the rest of the world has seen Treasury yields on the rise and is giving the dollar an added boost, sapping appetite for emerging market currencies and bonds that traditionally yield more though are considered riskier.
Positions on the yuan have remained long since July last year as the world's second-largest economy emerged from the crutches of the pandemic and was the only major economy to see growth in 2020. The view on the yuan now is on the verge of turning bearish, a fortnightly poll of 13 respondents showed.
Bets on the South Korean won, Singapore dollar and Malaysian ringgit all turned bearish for the first time since early last summer. 
For the Indonesian rupiah, which backs some of the highest-yielding debt in emerging markets, investors turned short for the first time since late October, and were the most bearish since earlier that same month. Since the last poll two weeks ago, the rupiah has lost about 2.2%.
Positioning data shows hedge funds paring net short-dollar positions to $29 billion last week.
Concerns also remain that the $1.9 trillion U.S. coronavirus relief package, set to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden this week, may cause inflation to rise.
OCBC Bank's 'pressure gauge', which indexes various factors that influence exchange rates, for Asian currencies is moving into the depreciation zone. 
""The move of the FX pressure gauge into the depreciation zone leaves us concerned about the near-term prospects of Asian currencies,"" Terence Wu, an FX Strategist at OCBC, wrote in a note. 
He said they cannot rule out the pressure gauge deepening in the depreciation zone, which could see portfolio outflows extend for equities in North Asia and Indonesian bonds.
In Taiwan, investors remained long on the local dollar though bets were scaled back. 
The central bank governor said the United States may label the trade-dependent island a currency manipulator. On Wednesday, data showed it spent a net $39.1 billion last year to intervene in the foreign exchange market.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar inched up on Thursday morning in Asia, reversing some losses stemming from trimmed rapid inflation acceleration bets over U.S. consumer price data and a drop in Treasury yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 91.787 by 9:10 PM ET (2:10 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 108.48.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7742 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.7203. Although the riskier Antipodean currencies steadied against the dollar, sentiment for them remains strong thanks to rising commodities prices and continuing hopes for an acceleration in global trade.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4986 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3933.
The U.S. data, released on Wednesday, showed that core consumer prices rose 0.1% month-on-month in February, down from the 0.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but unchanged from the 0.1% growth recorded in January.
Prices rose 1.3% year-on-year, slowing down slightly from the forecast 1.4% growth, and the 1.4% growth recorded in January.
However, dollar sentiment remained positive thanks to signs of the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19. The U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to a massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with some investors hoping that any further declines in the dollar are likely temporary.
President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law before current enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire on Sunday.
“The reflation trade looks set to continue … the dollar is the dominant theme in the currency market, and any downturn is just a temporary pause in its uptrend,” IG Securities senior foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters.
Investors are also keeping an eye on U.S. Treasury yields, which are climbing steadily over expectations that the Federal Reserve’s loose monetary policy and massive fiscal stimulus could drive inflation up.
Also on investors’ radars is the auction of 30-year Treasuries later in the day, an important indicator of demand for new debt. Wednesday's auction of ten-year Treasuries was met with sufficient demand and allayed concerns about investors’ ability to absorb the increase in debt needed to finance the COVID-19 response.
If future auctions also draw reasonably strong demand this would be another positive factor for the dollar, said IG Securities’ Ishikawa.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) will hand down its policy decision later in the day. Investors will look out for the central bank’s take on preventing bond yields from rising further, with ECB avoiding large-scale market intervention so far and policymakers divided ahead of their meeting.
The strengthening euro is also causing investors to be cautious ahead of the ECB’s meeting and policy decision. The dollar was quoted at $1.1928 against the euro, after its 0.2% fall during the previous session."

LONDON (Reuters) - Talk of a commodities ""super cycle"" and gains in prices from iron to copper have brightened the outlook for resource-linked currencies, but the tide hasn't lifted all boats, with emerging market currencies struggling to keep up with developed peers. 
Emerging currencies have been at the sharp end of a recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, which sparked a shakeout across global markets. 
Below are four charts showing the connection between commodities and currencies and how current moves compare to previous episodes. 
1/ TAKING STOCK 
Commodities from oil and iron ore to coal and copper play a crucial role in determining the future outlook for currencies like Russia's rouble and South Africa's rand.
After they hit troughs in 2020, gains have been eye-watering: oil prices have more than tripled since the Saudi-Russian crude war saw prices drop below $20 per barrel. 
But a mix of slower vaccination rollouts, fading growth prospects, rising debt burdens and geopolitical tensions have hamstrung currencies across many emerging markets. 
""That's just simply a reflection of the fact that domestic risks, and risk to the pace of domestic recovery in those EM commodity currencies are greater,"" said Aaron Hurd, senior currency portfolio manager at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
""You're in with domestic risks, and I'm specifically referring to fiscal risks, and debt levels are much higher.""

2/SUPER CYCLES PAST AND PRESENT
Compared to previous super cycles, emerging commodity currencies have got off to a markedly slower start, found  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
In the commodity rebound immediately following the 2008 global financial crisis, and after rallies starting in late 2010, 2014 and 2015, the recovery phases lasted around 21 weeks. 
In each case, an average 15% rise in commodity prices resulted in global commodity currencies rallying around 7%-8% against the dollar and emerging commodity currencies rising by 1%-4% depending on the region.
""At the 21-week stage in the current cycle, commodity prices were also up around 15% but with a far more subdued performance from global FX,"" said Morgan Stanley's James Lord, citing smaller yields, weaker growth and worsening debt sustainability as reasons for the underperformance. 
""EM currencies in particular were barely off the floor.""

3/SHIFTING POSITIONS
Positioning data shows investors pulled back from emerging market currencies in recent weeks. Following EM euphoria at the start of 2021, many big banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have switched to a more cautious stance.
While overall dollar positions show a large short bet of $29 billion, a look below the surface reveals a big difference in positions. 
For example, hedge funds are holding their biggest short bet in four months against the Brazilian real while net long bets on the Australian dollar are at a five-month high.

4/REER BUFFERS
However, comparing currencies to average real effective exchange rates over the past five years, emerging commodity currencies are more undervalued than G10 peers, said Francesco Pasole, FX strategist at ING.
""The relatively attractive valuation is one of the factors that makes EM currencies (including the commodity segment) less vulnerable to the rise in U.S. Treasury yields compared to the pre-2013 'taper tantrum' state of affairs,"" Pasole said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Wednesday, clawing back some of its losses sustained overnight, as U.S. yields found a floor following their drop from one-year highs.
Riskier currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars retreated after logging big gains on Tuesday. Bitcoin turned lower after earlier topping $55,000 for the first time since Feb. 22.
The euro was 0.05% lower at $1.18940 after bouncing off a 3-1/2-month low of $1.18355 on Tuesday.
Against the yen, another traditional safe-haven currency, the greenback traded 0.2% higher at 108.68 yen, following its retreat from a nine-month top of 109.235.
Investors will have their eye on U.S. inflation numbers due later today.
Traders are also wary yields could rise further this week as the market will have to digest a $120 billion auction of 3-, 10-, and 30-year Treasuries, especially after last week's soft auction and a 7-year note sale that saw a spike in yields.
""Particularly the latter (the 10y auction today will be followed by a 30y UST auction tomorrow) is the main risk to market sentiment today should low demand reinstate pressure on the fragile UST market (the non-negligible decline in UST yields was a key factor behind the risk rally yesterday),"" said ING strategists in a daily note.
""Equally, a good take-up could reiterate the risk-friendly mood in FX markets observed yesterday. Hence, one should get ready for a day of volatility with the FX market looking for signs of confirmation as to whether the risk rally yesterday was a short-term blip or the tentative start of a trend."" 
The dollar index has closely tracked a surge in Treasury yields in recent weeks, both because higher yields increase the currency's appeal and as the bond rout shook investor confidence, spurring demand for the safest assets.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stabilised around 1.5490% on Wednesday in European trade after a three-day drop from a one-year high of 1.6250%.
The dollar index strengthened about 0.2% to 92.147 in Asia on Wednesday, after falling back sharply from a 3-1/2-month high of 92.506 overnight. It was last 0.1% higher at 92.027 in European trade.
Bond investors have been selling on bets that a faster-than-expected economic rebound would spark a surge in inflation, with President Joe Biden expected to sign a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package as soon as this week.
Many analysts still expect the dollar to weaken over the course of this year, but the speed of recent gains has forced some to adjust their views.
Westpac, which last week was talking about selling the dollar index into 91, now sees it reaching as high as 94.50 before resuming last year's downtrend as the rest of the world closes the gap with the U.S. economic recovery.
""Global reflation is alive and well, and Europe will get her vaccination act together at some point too,"" Westpac strategists wrote in a note.
""A continuation of the global recovery ... should see commodity currencies outperform.""
The Aussie dropped 0.2% to $0.7700 after jumping 1% overnight, as a top central banker rebuffed market chatter about early rate increases, helping pull local yields lower. [AUD/]
New Zealand's kiwi slipped 0.2% to $0.7156 following a 0.8% increase on Tuesday.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rose as high as $55,855 on Wednesday before dropping back to $54,729. It hit a record high of $58,354.14 on Feb. 21.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Wednesday, helped by the stabilization of U.S. Treasury yields following their drop from one-year highs.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.155, after falling back Tuesday from a 3 1/2-month high of 92.506.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1881, after climbing from a 3-1/2-month low of $1.1835 on Tuesday, USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 108.83, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3871, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7690.
The greenback has closely tracked a surge in Treasury yields in recent weeks, with higher yields boosting the currency's appeal as well as shaking overall investor confidence, spurring demand for the safest assets.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield  stabilized around 1.54% on Wednesday after a three-day drop from a one-year high of 1.6250%.
Helping this calming was the successful auction on Tuesday of $58 billion in U.S. three-year notes. Weak demand at an auction of seven-year notes in late February helped start the trend of higher yields.
Investors are now looking at Wednesday's auction of $38 billion in 10-year notes to see if this can also be absorbed successfully. And there will be plenty more of these in the months to come with President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal package to be funded.
Also on Wednesday’s slate is the release of February U.S. inflation data, with CPI expected to rise 0.4% on the month, up 1.7% on the year.
Speaking of inflation, February inflation in Norway rose to 3.3%, while core inflation stood at 2.7 % on the year, higher than the country’s central bank predicted. 
EUR/NOK traded up 0.2% at 10.0897, near at 12-month low, and USD/NOK traded up 0.3% at 8.4932, near a 2-year low.
“Core inflation is not most important for Norges Bank now, as developments in the real economy matter most,” said analysts at Nordea Bank, in a research note, but “overall, these figures pull in the direction of a slightly higher rate path in March.”
In China, USD/CNY inched up to 6.5073, with February’s CPI growing 0.6% month-on-month while contracting 0.2% year-on-year. February’s PPI grew 1.7% year-on-year."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, reversing some losses from the previous session, as U.S. yields found a floor following their drop from one-year highs.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.21% to 92.157 by 11:26 AM ET (4:26 AM GMT). The index fell back sharply from the three-and-a-half-month high reached during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.32% to 108.81. The dollar traded 0.3% higher against its fellow safe-haven currency, aft retreating from a nine-month high of 109.235.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.34% to 0.7684 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.29% to 0.7146. The riskier Antipodean currencies took a tumble following their gains during Tuesday’s session.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.5112. Data released earlier in the day showed that February’s Consumer Price Index grew 0.6% month-on-month while contracting 0.2% year-on-year. February’s Producer Price Index grew 1.7% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 1.3868.
The euro was 0.2% lower, with the European Central Bank due to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
The dollar has closely tracked the recent climb in Treasury yields, with higher yields increasing the safe-haven currency’s appeal as investor confidence was shaken by the bond rout. The benchmark ten-year Treasury yield stabilized around 1.54% as the Asian session opened, after its three-day drop from a one-year high of 1.6250%.
Investors continued to sell bonds on expectations of a quicker-than-expected global economic rebound from COVID-19 will lead to inflation. Driving these expectations is the U.S. House of Representatives voting to take up a $1.9 trillion stimulus package bill on Tuesday. With the Senate already passing the bill earlier in the week, the vote clears the way for the House of Representatives to consider the bill on Wednesday and President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law as soon as this week.
Although some investors expect the dollar to continue its downward trend as 2021 progresses, the speed of recent gains forced some to tweak their forecasts.
Westpac, which as recently as the previous week was talking about selling the dollar index into 91, now sees it reaching as high as 94.50 before resuming last year’s downtrend as the rest of the world closes the gap with the U.S.’s pandemic recovery, Westpac analysts said in a note.
“Global reflation is alive and well, and Europe will get her vaccination act together at some point too … a continuation of the global recovery ... should see commodity currencies outperform,” the note added.
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin rose as high as $55,855 earlier in the session, topping the $55,000 mark for the first time since Feb. 22, before dropping back to $53,995."

Investing.com – The euro looked set to snap its four-day losing streak against the greenback on Tuesday, shrugging off weaker eurozone fourth-quarter growth ahead of the European Central Bank meeting expected later this week.
EUR/USD rose 0.50% to $1.1902.
Eurozone quarterly GDP  was revised down to -0.7% in Q4 from the preliminary reading of -0.6% despite stronger growth from Germany, as the lockdowns across the euro area weighed on growth. ""The return of lockdown measures were the main factor behind the negative number that sets the Eurozone up for a technical recession over Q4/Q1 and will leave the ECB in crisis mode for now,"" Action Economics said.
But as lockdowns are set to reopen, albeit slowing, investors are pricing a stronger recovery and an uptick in inflation that has pushed European bond yields higher, and stoked talk of tightening financial conditions that the ECB will have to address later this week.
At its meeting on Thursday, the ECB, however, will hold rates steady and try to ""downplay the recent increase in bond yields, and lay out the welcome mat for further bond purchases,"" ING said.  ""The ECB could frontload its PEPP [ Pandemic emergency purchase programme purchases] in the coming weeks to demonstrate its willingness to maintain favourable financing conditions. ""
Others agree, suggesting that the central bank will not be panicked by the uptick in bond yields.
""Despite recent evidence of a tightening of credit standards on bank loans, overall financial conditions remain highly accommodative by historical standards, while the GDP-weighted yield curve remains well below its level before the pandemic struck, Action Economics said. ""The Governing Council will welcome the recent upwards shift in financial market inflation expectations as well as the modest weakening of the euro against the US dollar. And the ECB's updated economic projections will also suggest that it doesn't need suddenly to change course with policy,"" Action Economic said.
The sharp uptick in the euro was also helped by dollar weakness on a fall in Treasury yields as the selloff in bonds paused. "

Investing.com -- Only three months ago, the dollar didn’t have a friend in the world. Now it’s turning heads wherever it goes.
Consensus opinion has done what it so often does – and turned on a dime. The notion that a combination of loose fiscal and monetary policy in the U.S. must inevitably debase the world’s reserve currency looked solid on paper but overlooked other important implications that are only now becoming clear.
The first is the galvanizing effect they would have on growth, especially when underpinned by the progress of a vaccination campaign that – it seems – will ensure that Americans never have to be as scared of Covid-19 again. Merck’s recent agreement to let Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) brew its one-shot vaccine at its extensive manufacturing facilities means that all U.S. adults who want should be inoculated by the end of May. That also moves up the day when the U.S. can be a net exporter of such vaccines.
Wall Street already started revising up its growth forecasts the minute that President Joe Biden’s administration drafted its $1.9 trillion package. This Tuesday, when the package was due for its final vote in Congress before going off for signing, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the plan would add 3.3 percentage points to U.S. growth and 1 percent to global growth this year.
The OECD now sees U.S. growth at 6.5% this year, and is still at the conservative end of a forecast range that implies a sharp improvement on returns on dollar assets across the board.That starts with the U.S. Treasury, whose unprecedented demand for dollars to fund a substantial expansion of the U.S.’s welfare state means that it simply has to pay a higher price for those dollars.
And, just as the Treasury’s demand reaches record highs – an estimated $274 billion in the first quarter alone – the big U.S. primary dealers who habitually warehouse much of the new Treasury issuance are more reluctant than usual to add to their holdings.
That’s because the Federal Reserve has so far refused to say whether it will extend a vital loophole in their capital requirements that it created to ease last year’s panic. Under the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, a product of the post-2008 regulatory reforms, banks have to hold 3.5 cents of capital for every dollar of assets they hold, irrespective of the risk. The SLR was suspended last year to help the financial system cope with the stress of the pandemic’s first wave. It’s due to be reinstated at the end of March (unless the Fed decides otherwise at its Federal Open Markets Committee meeting next week).
If it isn’t, the Treasury will have to offer even higher rates on its IOUs. The $2.3 trillion deficit projected this year by the Congressional Budget Office is nearly double what the Fed is currently committing to buy through its quantitative easing program.
The loser in all of this haven assets in general, and gold in particular. The dollar has risen over 5% so far this year against both the yen and Swiss franc, whose negative nominal returns have been made to look even worse as 10-year Treasury yields have shot above 1.5%. The euro hardly looks any better positioned as its stuttering vaccination campaign allows the U.S. and U.K. to steal a three-month head start in reopening their economies. Analysts at Nordea see $1.13 as a fairer value than the $1.19 currently traded.
But it is the other traditional haven asset, gold, that is hurting most. Since peaking in August, it has lost 16% against the dollar. In part, that is because Bitcoin has stolen its thunder. But mainly, it is because real (that is, inflation-adjusted) bond yields, which typically drive gold prices, are less steeply negative than they were a year ago.
Having sharply discounted last year the reflation that is now materializing, the yellow metal has nowhere to go but down in the short term. As JPMorgan analysts wrote to clients last week, a basket of commodities, or commodity currencies, or even basic materials stocks, offer a better hedge against inflation.
“It’s simply still expensive in real terms, and it offers no yield,” they summed up. And to make matters worse, it now has Bitcoin to contend with.",,,,,

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Tuesday, but remained near multi-month highs on the back of rising Treasury yields and the expectation of a robust U.S. economic recovery.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.130, after earlier climbing to 92.528, its highest level since late November.
EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.1883, after earlier falling to lows last seen in late November 2020, ahead of the release of the latest revision of the euro zone’s fourth-quarter GDP data later Tuesday and the European Central Bank handing down its policy decision on Thursday. Data released on Monday showed that the ECB hadn't noticeably stepped up its purchases of bonds two weeks ago as inflation jitters grabbed world markets. 
Another test for the market later will be the sale of three-year Treasury notes at 1 PM ET (1800 GMT), a week after a poorly-received auction of seven-year notes triggered a sharp rise in yields. Three-year maturities are more sensitive to short-term interest rates, and the prices bid will thus be a more explicit comment on when investors expect the Federal Reserve to start hiking interest rates.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 108.78, just off a nine-month high after Japan’s fourth-quarter GDP was revised to show quarterly growth of 2.8%, versus a preliminary 3.0% gain. GBP/USD rose 0.4% to 1.3880, having touched a three-week low of $1.3779 on Friday, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.4% to 0.7680.
Driving the gains in the greenback, with the dollar index up around 2.5% this year, has been upbeat macroeconomic data, combined with a loose monetary policy. Analysts have revised their forecasts for U.S. growth higher while tending to revise down their forecasts for other countries.
Added to the mix has been the passage of the Biden’s administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Saturday, which heads back to the House of Representatives this week after being passed by the Senate over the weekend, which has raised concerns of increased inflationary pressures.
“The rise in yields has not been quite sharp enough to trigger a tipping point in global equity markets – we’re more seeing a rotation out of Tech and into Financials – yet we are seeing speculative dollar shorts getting unwound against the low yielders – first JPY, then CHF and now it looks like EUR,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury currently trades around 1.55%, below the 1.62% level seen at the end of last week, but could rise again this week as the market will have to digest a $120 billion auction 10- and 30-year Treasuries in addition to the three-year notes later Tuesday.
That said, “we do see this as a corrective dollar rally - not a turn in the bear-trend - and would be looking for it to stall after a 1%-2% extension higher,” ING added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 3 1/2-month high against its rivals on Tuesday as higher bond yields and expectations of faster economic normalisation from the pandemic in the United States put the U.S. currency at an advantage.
The dollar's index against six major currencies rose 0.1% to 92.469, its highest since late November, building on a 0.5% gain on Monday.
Against the yen, the dollar rose to 109.235 yen, its highest level in nine months, while the euro was nearly flat at $1.18530, hovering near lows last seen in late November.
The safe-haven Swiss franc softened to 0.9369 per dollar, its lowest level since late July, while the British pound inched up 0.1% to $1.3834 , having touched a three-week low of $1.3779 on Friday.
""The move in the last two to three weeks has been driven by real yields, and that is what is supporting the dollar,"" said Mayank Mishra, an FX strategist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank in Singapore.
""It is interesting that despite the fact that U.S. equities have started to bear the pain of rising yields, dollar/yen continues to make new highs,"" Mishra added. ""The pair's own risk correlations have broken down and real yields are in the driving seat.""
The dollar index has firmed more than 2% so far this year as upbeat marcoeconomic data, combined with a loose monetary policy, has lifted bond yields and pressured richly valued U.S. technology stocks. [US/] (N)
All eyes will now be on the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meeting next week, although expectations are low that the central bank will announce major policy changes after Chair Jerome Powell last week did not express concern about the rise in bond yields. 
""The thing that markets are going to get from the FOMC that's new is an update to their forecasts for inflation, economic growth and unemployment,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joseph Capurso.
""They're going to have do some upgrades if they have already taken into account the almost certain passage of the ($1.9 trillion) stimulus package. If they haven't taken that into account because it's not law yet, then they won't do the upgrades and that might give markets a little bit of a shock.""
The 10-year U.S. bond yield stood near a one-year peak hit on Friday. [US/]
Traders are wary yields could rise further this week as the market will have to digest a $120 billion auction of 3-, 10-, and 30-year Treasuries, especially after last week's soft auction and a horrible 7-year note sale that saw a spike in yields.
Higher U.S. yields have started to undermine emerging market currencies, which had attracted funds escaping rock-bottom bond returns in the United States.
MSCI's emerging market currency index dropped to a three-month low after a fall of 0.82% on Monday, the biggest fall in about a year, with high-yielding currencies hit hard.
The Brazilian real sank to a ten-month low while the Turkish lira fell nearly 3% to its lowest level since mid-December. 
Elsewhere, gold also slipped to a nine-month low on Monday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia but was near a three-and-a-half high as bond yields rose and the U.S.’ economic normalization from COVID-19 is expected to come faster than expected, which puts the U.S. currency at a distinct advantage.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 92.308 by 10:56 PM ET (3:56 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.22% to 109.09, with the dollar rising to its highest level against the yen in nine months and surpassing the 109-mark. Japan released data earlier in the day that said that the GDP grew 2.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2020, lower than both the 3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the third quarter’s 5.3% growth. The data also said that GDP grew 11.7% year-on-year, also below the forecast 12.7% growth and the third quarter’s 22.9% growth.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.7661 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7129.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.5216 while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3845.
The euro dropped to a low last seen in late November 2020, ahead of the European Central Bank handing down its policy decision on Thursday.
Investors also continue to price in increasing optimism for the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19, as well as higher inflation, as ten-year U.S. bond yields climbed to a one-year high on Friday.
There are concerns that yields could rise further, ahead of a $120 billion auction of three, ten, and 30-year Treasuries later in the week. The previous week saw a soft auction, particularly for seven-year notes, that drove yields up.
“Rising U.S. bond yields are obviously driving the dollar but what’s behind them is the realization that U.S. vaccination programmed is going ahead very fast and the U.S. economic normalization may happen earlier than people have expected, perhaps by a quarter or two,” Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 vaccines continue to be rolled out in the U.S., with around 30 million people, or 9.2% of the U.S. population, inoculated against the virus. This statistic led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that fully vaccinated people can meet without masks indoors in small groups with others who have been inoculated.
“That also leads to a question as to whether the Fed can maintain its projections that it will not raise rates until 2023. Some policymakers may change their views at their policy meeting next week,” Daiwa’s Ishizuki said.
The Fed will next meet for its two-day policy meeting on Mar. 16."

Investing.com – The dollar rallied Monday, riding on the coattails of surging U.S. bond yields, but rising rates could be in for a rough ride as the bond market is writing checks the Federal Reserve can't cash as the central bank has made it clear it will not tighten policy anytime soon.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.38% to 92.33, driven by a move higher in U.S. rates on the back of expectations for a fresh round of stimulus.
The Senate passed the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Sunday, and the House will vote on the bill on Tuesday, with many expecting the legislation to be signed into law by 14 March to ensure unemployment programs set to expire in mid-March don't lapse.
The Senate package includes direct payments of $1,400 per person for families earnings less than $160,000 per year or individuals earning less than $80,000 per year.
But Treasury yields have approached overbought levels, and could face fundamental headwinds ahead.
""In 'Top Gun,' terms, the bond market's ego is writing checks the FOMC's body can't cash [...] as the bond market is pricing in Fed rate hikes well before the Fed is prepared to deliver them,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. 
In a rising rate environment, bonds today are worth less than bonds in the future, sparking a wave of selling and pressuring prices, which trade inversely to yields. But the appreciation in yields could eventually become too attractive to ignore.
""Banks in Japan sold a  tremendous amount of bonds in May and June 2013, as US Treasury 10-year yields went from 1.75 % to 2.75%, but then banks and pensions funds in Japan began to buy,"" Morgan Stanley added. ""History suggests investors in Japan will not abandon the US rates market forever, especially given the more attractive yields levels today."""

LONDON Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a 3-1/2 month high on Monday as rising U.S. Treasury yields spooked investors and boosted the greenback's safe-haven appeal.
After falling 4% in the last quarter of 2020, the dollar has strengthened by nearly 2.5% year-to-date as investors expect the broad rise in U.S. bond yields to weigh on stretched equity valuations and boost demand for the U.S. currency.
Recent economic figures are also supportive with U.S. data showing non-farm payrolls surged by 379,000 jobs last month while the U.S. Senate approved President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery package. 
""The U.S. labour market is healing quickly, President Biden's gargantuan relief package has been approved by the Senate, and America has stepped up its immunization game, administering a record number of vaccines this weekend,"" Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at XM, said.
But while U.S. yields climbed within striking distance of a one-year high above 1.62% hit on Friday, German yields dipped nearly 5 basis points last week, pulling the euro to a near four-month low below $1.19.
BofA analyst Athanasios Vamvakidis said the potent mix of U.S. stimulus, faster reopening and greater consumer firepower was a clear positive for the dollar.
The dollar index stood at 92.30 against a basket of six major currencies, up 0.4%, its highest level since late-November.
The Australian dollar weakened 0.3% to $0.7658. The New Zealand dollar was down about 0.8%.
The currencies have been in demand because of their links to global commodities trading, but the dollar's bounce dented both.
The dollar held near a one-month high against the British pound, at $1.3819. Against the low-yielding yen JPY=EBS, the greenback held firmer at 108.56 yen, having hit a nine-month high of 108.645 on Friday.

Investing.com - The dollar gained in early European trading Monday, trading around three-month highs, after the passage of the massive Covid-19 relief bill through the Senate added to a strong U.S. labor market report in fostering expectations of a strong recovery this year.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.168, near its three-month high of 92.201 set on Friday.
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1888, just off a three-month low, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3813, near a one-month low, USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 108.45, just off a nine-month high, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7682.
Prompting these gains was the Senate passing the Biden’s administration’s  $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Saturday, a day after data showed the U.S. economy created more than twice as many jobs as expected in February.
While this stimulus is expected to result in a faster economic rebound this year, concerns about higher inflation have pushed up bond yields despite assurances from the U.S. Federal Reserve that monetary policy will stay loose.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield last traded at 1.60%, having jumped to a one-year peak of 1.62% late last week.
“The speed of the rise in U.S. yields is impacting positioning – especially short dollar positioning – and until we begin to see a little stability in Treasuries, the risk is that this bear market bounce in the dollar runs a little further,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
The Federal Reserve holds its next rate-setting meeting next week and its members have entered a traditional blackout period. With no speakers to focus on, investors will closely watch U.S. inflation figures on Wednesday and Friday amid worries over the potential implications of rising price pressures.  
Also of interest this week will be the latest get together by the European Central Bank. 
“Expect a modest downward revision to 2021 GDP forecasts and an upward revision to CPI forecasts, but probably not enough to make a material difference for the EUR,” added ING.
That said, the major focus will probably be on what ECB President Christine Lagarde says about rising bond yields, given members of this central bank have tended to be more vocal about their concerns than their Fed equivalents.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.4% to 6.5245, rising to a more-than-two-month high, with the rise in U.S. yields prompting many investors to re-evaluate forecasts for the yuan.
This comes despite China trade data released earlier in the day showing that exports rose 60.6% year-on-year in February and imports rose 22.2% year-on-year. The figures are a little distorted due to the comparison effect with early 2020, when the pandemic was raging in China.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, but fell against the currencies of major commodity exporters, as investors increased bets on countries that stand to benefit from rising prices for oil, metals, and other goods.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.09% to 92.073 by 11:48 AM ET (4:48 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 108.44, with the dollar close to hitting a nine-month high against the yen.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7692, while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7156. Both Antipodean risk currencies largely benefitted from their links to the global commodities trade.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.24% to 6.5114. China trade data released earlier in the day showed that exports rose 60.6% year-on-year in February and imports rose 22.2% year-on-year. The trade balance was at $103.25 billion.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 1.3819.
The dollar index was not far from a three-month high reached on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy created more than twice as many jobs as expected in February. Non-farm payrolls for February were at 379,000, above the 182,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January’s 166,000 reading.
Positive economic data and progress in passing a $1.9 trillion stimulus package through the U.S. Congress boosted sentiment for the dollar, but that the U.S. currency could struggle against commodity currencies as expectations for a rebound in global trade continue to rise.
Rising Treasury yields saw the dollar fall against the pound and the euro but maintain multi-month highs against the yen and the Swiss franc.
“We are seeing a significant divergence in the dollar … commodity prices simply aren’t coming down, so there’s no way the dollar can rise against the AUD and NZD. However, the dollar will remain strong against the yen because yields are the main driver,” Daiwa Securities foreign exchange strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
Surging oil prices, with Brent oil futures rising above the $70 mark for the first time in more than a year, pulled investors towards currencies of oil exporters and triggered bids for commodity currencies as the Asian session opened.
Investors also cut their net short dollar positions in the latest week to $27.80 billion, which is the smallest short position since Dec. 15, 2020, and an indication that dollar bears are giving up on betting against the greenback."

Investing.com – The dollar is set for a second weekly gain after rallying on Friday, on strong labor market data, but economists suggest the greenback's resurgence will be limited as low inflation will persist.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.35% to 91.96.
The U.S. economy created 379,000 jobs last month, well above economists' consensus forecast of 182,000, with the unemployment rate falling to 6.2% from 6.3%, underpinned by easing Covid-19 restrictions and a ramp-up in vaccine distribution. 
But a rapidly improving labor market, however, doesn't necessarily translate into stronger inflation, which will likely keep the Fed on pause, stifling the dollar's momentum.
""The USD appreciation potential remains limited for the time being […] as it is inflation that will determine when the US Federal Reserve will consider raising interest rates,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. ""[It] is likely to be a long time before the Fed is satisfied with the inflation trend, which is why we do not forecast any interest rate hikes within our forecast horizon (i.e. until the end of 2022) and thus also no USD appreciation trend.""
Commerzbank's remarks echoed that of the Fed chairman Jerome Powell who downplayed the risk of a sustained uptick in inflation, and reiterated that current monetary policy measures are appropriate.
""There's good reason to think we'll begin to make more progress. But even if it happens, it's likely to take some time to achieve substantial further progress, or interest rates to raise interest rates above zero,"" Powell said on Thursday."

Investing.com - The dollar gained in early European trading Friday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell largely dismissed concerns over rising Treasury yields.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 91.760, a three-month high.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1957, just off a new three-month low, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3872, USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 108.25, climbing to an eight-month high earlier in the session, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7710.
These dollar gains came on the back of the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped back above 1.5%, rising as high as 1.58%, not far off the one-year peak of 1.61% it reached last week.
Fed chair Powell said in Thursday’s conference that the sell-off in U.S. government bonds was not ""disorderly"" or likely to push long-term rates so high that the central bank might have to intervene more forcefully.
He also reiterated a commitment to maintain ultra-easy monetary policy until the economy is ""very far along the road to recovery.""
“It seems clear that upside risks to U.S. yields will dominate into the Fed meeting of 17 March, leaving both risk assets and short dollar positions vulnerable,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill is soon to be debated in the Senate after it passed the Democratic-led House of Representatives last weekend.
A total of 158.5 million households would receive direct payments under the Senate version of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill, the White House said on Thursday. This impending U.S. fiscal stimulus is adding fuel to expectations of higher inflation, thus higher Treasury yields, as the economy recovers.
A key gauge of the recovery of the labor market is due later in the session, with the official February employment report due at 08:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). An addition of 182,000 payrolls is expected, up from just 49,000 last month, but Wednesday’s ADP private payrolls and Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims data showed only modest improvement.
“Powell made it very clear that the U.S. has a long way to go to meet its full employment goals,” added ING, “Yet any stronger than expected numbers do risk exacerbating the bond sell-off and warns this dollar correction has further to run.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, hovering near three-month highs after U.S. Federal Chairman Jerome Powell stuck firmly to a dovish line even as bond market volatility increased.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 91.703 by 12:07 AM ET (5:07 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 108.06, maintaining the multi-month high of 108 reached during Thursday’s 0.9% surge.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.7708 and the NZD/USD pair fell 0.32% to 0.7166.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.4730. China set a conservative economic growth target of above 6%, below economists’ forecasts, for 2021 as the National People’s Congress opened earlier in the day. China’s leadership also outlined fiscal support for China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3883.
The greenback soared the most in a month after Powell’s comments at the Wall Street Journal jobs summit on Thursday. He said the sell-off in Treasuries during the past week was “notable and caught my attention” but was not “disorderly” or likely to push long-term rates so high as to warrant a more forceful Fed intervention. Instead, Powell reiterated the central bank’s commitment to maintaining its ultra-easy monetary policy until the economy is “very far along the road to recovery.”
The comments re-ignited a selloff in Treasuries, causing the benchmark ten-year Treasury yield to climb back above 1.5%, rising as high as 1.5830% in Asia. The climb came after the yield soared to a three-month height of 1.614% during the previous week.
Riskier currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars, were down along with global stocks as investor sentiment soured again.
“Quite a night for market volatility, with the bond market the center of attention … the market was seemingly looking for Powell to push back harder on the recent increase in yields,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of forex strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.
The safe-haven dollar has been supported by higher Treasury yields and the increased risk aversion brought about by the bond rout.
Meanwhile, investors looked to progress on the latest U.S. stimulus measures. The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to take up President Joe Biden’s $19 trillion stimulus package bill and is widely expected to approve it when debate concludes over the weekend.
Also adding to worries of higher inflation is the continuous global rollout of COIVD-19 vaccines, in turn, heightening hopes for a quick global economic recovery from COVID-19. Commodity-linked currencies, such as the AUD and NZD, have been hurt by the souring mood even as some investors expect them to gain as economies re-open after COVID-19."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hit multi-month highs against the euro and the yen on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell did not express concern about a recent sell-off in bonds while sticking to his stance to keep interest rates low for a long time. 
While Powell did stick with dovish rhetoric overall, he said the sell-off in Treasuries was not ""disorderly"" or likely to push long-term rates so high the Fed might have to intervene more forcefully, reigniting a sell-off in Treasuries.
He also reiterated a commitment to maintain ultra-easy monetary policy until the economy is ""very far along the road to recovery."" 
""Markets are listening to the central banks and if they are going to be on hold for a long time, that means long-term inflation is going to be higher and that's why you're seeing the bond and equity markets sell off,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joseph Capurso. ""The currency markets are reacting to the increase in volatility in both those markets."" 
The euro slipped 0.2% to a three-month low of $1.19515 following a 0.7% slump overnight.
The dollar hit an eight-month high of 108.035 yen earlier in the session before giving up much of its gains. 
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso declined to comment on the yen's decline when asked about how the depreciation would affect the economy.
The dollar index hit a three-month high and last stood at 91.672 in the Asian session after gaining 0.7% on Thursday
The dollar's gains came as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped back above 1.5%, rising as high as 1.584% in Asia. Last week, it soared to a one-year peak of 1.614%.
Impending U.S. fiscal stimulus is adding fuel to expectations of higher inflation, as the accelerating roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines boosts confidence in an economic recovery.
Riskier currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars slid along with stocks as investor sentiment again turned sour. 
""Once the bond rout comes to an end, once the volatility fades away, the commodity currencies (the Aussie and the kiwi) are going to be able to climb back up because commodity prices aren't falling,"" said Capurso at CBA. 
The Aussie weakened 0.3% to $0.7705, extending Thursday's 0.7% drop. The kiwi fell 0.2%, adding to its 0.8% slide overnight.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin fell 2.3% to $47,272.65. Ether dropped 3.6% to $1,483.43.

China’s yuan is the mirror image, becoming increasingly undervalued, the IIF found in a periodic assessment of exchange-rate misalignments.
“The biggest surprise is that U.S. dollar overvaluation has grown since our November 2020 update, even though the dollar has fallen,” Robin Brooks, the IIF’s chief economist, wrote in a March 4 report. “The offset to this overvaluation is China, where the renminbi is substantially undervalued.”
The “aggressive” deployment of fiscal stimulus in the U.S. has helped boost its economic growth prospects, in turn widening the country’s current-account deficit, Brooks wrote.
IIF modeling indicates the dollar is 11.7% overvalued, compared with 10.2% in the November analysis, while China’s yuan -- also known as the renminbi -- is 12.8% undervalued, slightly less than the 13.4% last time.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher in early European trading Thursday, helped by rising U.S. Treasury yields, while traders look to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later for guidance.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 91.002, adding to Wednesday’s gain of around 0.3%.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2058, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.13, after hitting a seven month high the previous session. However, commodity currencies were still well-bid: the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7812, continuing to show strength after Wednesday’s strong GDP data. The kiwi and Canadian dollar also rose.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded around 1.49% overnight, heading back towards a one-year high of 1.61% set last week on bets that a strong economic recovery aided by government stimulus will result in revived inflation, prodding the Federal Reserve into early tightening action.
This brings Fed chief Jerome Powell firmly into focus, as he is due to speak at a conference at 12:05 PM EST (1705 GMT), in what will be his last outing before the Fed's policy-making committee convenes mid-March.
Many Fed officials have downplayed the rise in Treasury yields in recent days, although Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday acknowledged that the rapid rise in yields had “caught her eye.”
“Comments that he’s monitoring events in the Treasury market might be enough to calm things down, encourage a return to high yield FX and a softer dollar,” said ING analysts, in a research note. “No such concern from Powell would suggest that the Fed is happy for U.S. Treasury yields to ‘find the right level’ – as our bond strategy colleagues would say – potentially triggering another spike in U.S. yields and more dollar short-covering.”
The over rise in Treasury yields came despite Wednesday’s data showing the U.S. labor market struggled in February, when private payrolls rose less than expected. However, the weekly initial claims numbers will also be studied carefully, ahead of Friday’s official payrolls release.
The issue of higher yields was not solely a factor in the United States, with the 10-year U.K. Gilt yield climbing to 0.78%, near its 11-month high of 0.836% hit last week, after the government unveiled much higher borrowing. 
It has since slipped back to 0.775%, but sterling remains supported, with GBP/USD trading 0.1% higher at 1.3956.
“Yesterday’s U.K. budget was seen to strike the right balance and support the spring recovery.  Gilts sold off on the larger than expected supply plans, yet we think the re-assessment of UK growth prospects can support GBP,” ING added."

Investing.com – The dollar inched up on Thursday morning in Asia after hitting a seven-month high against the yen during the previous session. With U.S. Treasuries recording orderly gains and boosting the dollar, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is also due to give a speech later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 91.032 by 9:19 PM ET (2:19AM GMT), with the dollar holding onto its 0.32% gain from Wednesday.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.04% to 107.03, the highest level since July 2020 and above the 107 mark.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7788 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.7258.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.4696. The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 1.3937, easing slightly.
The benchmark ten-year Treasury yield gained to 1.4894% during the Asian session, with the dollar trading up against most currencies as calm continued to return to the market and boosted investor sentiment.
The dollar could continue to gain against the yen should Treasury yields continue to rise in an orderly fashion but could fall against currencies of major commodities exporters as the global economy continues to recover from COVID-19.
“The performance of the dollar will vary depending on the currency … dollar/yen looks well bid because of yields and because Japan’s economy is underperforming relative to the U.S., but as long as commodity prices rise, the dollar will weaken against commodity currencies,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
Powell will give a virtual speech to the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit later in the day, and investors will be closely watching for any signs of concern over the recent Treasuries selloff and for any changes in his assessment of the economy ahead of the Fed’s next meeting ending Mar. 17.
Concerns that the unprecedented government spending to support the global economy through COVID-19 could drive inflation up resulted in a massive selloff in Treasuries since the beginning of 2021. The selloff culminated in 10-year yields hitting their highest levels in a year during the previous week.
The rise caused global shares to hit pause on their rally and the dollar to drop against most currencies. However, as calm continues to return to the market, it seems that the dollar is back on an upwards trend.
However, other investors were more cautious, saying that the declines in the Australian and New Zealand dollars are likely to be temporary as both economies continue to progress in their economic recovery from COVID-19 and that an acceleration in global trade will give both currencies a boost."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The reflation trade that spooked currency markets and threw them into disarray will be in play for at least another month, according to a Reuters poll of strategists, who were still holding on to their outlook for dollar weakness in the long run.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields vaulted to their highest since the pandemic began last week on improving economic expectations and inflation concerns, what has become known as the reflation trade.
That dramatic surge in bond yields, which knocked global stocks off their record highs, has challenged overwhelming bets against the dollar, with the currency up over 1% this year.
While recent moves have confounded analyst expectations for a weaker dollar in 2021, the March 1-3 poll of over 70 foreign exchange strategists showed the consensus for broad dollar weakness in a year was still intact.
But a majority, 50 of 65 strategists, in response to an additional question predicted moves in currency markets based on an upswing in economic activity and prices, or the reflation trade, would continue for at least another month, including 33 who said over three months.
""There is this battle going on now between the pricing-in of this reflation trade and on the other hand the central banks just wanting to temper the pace of the optimism,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""We've got this period of struggle between the bond markets and the other central banks trying to keep optimism from getting too significant - and in that period what we might see is the dollar being a little bit more resilient than the consensus has been expecting.""

Despite those predictions for dollar resistance in the near-term, global stocks were forecast to continue their rally over the coming year, according to separate Reuters polls of equity strategists and investment managers. 
That lines up with the latest currency market outlook, which showed the dollar's appeal against most currencies would be sapped once volatility ebbs and normalcy returns.
""Yes, real yields will be higher, but then there's a level of yields which will be consistent with the fact the (growth) outlook is more optimistic. If we stabilize for two or three weeks, the market will decide you can live with it,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""I'm still pessimistic about the dollar with everything that's going on. What gives me confidence in my outlook is: there's no piano which dropped out of a window that landed on the sidewalk, and they're looking at it and saying - wow! Nobody will ever be able to fix it.""
The euro, down more than 1.0% this year, was forecast to trade at $1.21 in a month, around where it was on Wednesday. It was then expected to reverse trend and gain over 3.5% to $1.25 in a year.
Sterling, up over 2%, was forecast to change hands at $1.42 in a year, a further 2% gain from just below $1.40, where it was trading.
When asked which currencies would outperform against the dollar over the next three months, 38 of 63 strategists opted for commodity-linked currencies, - which have had a dream run so far this year - tracking the rise in commodity prices. 
The others were split between developed and emerging market currencies.
Commodity-linked currencies such as the Aussie dollar, the Kiwi dollar and the loonie were predicted to gain further in 2021 after hitting multi-year highs last month.
""Broader market thematic of reflation, commodity rebound, vaccine trade remains in play. Pro-cyclical FX such as AUD, NZD ... can benefit while countercyclical FX such as USD stays on the back foot,"" noted analysts at Maybank. 
""The trajectory for the dollar remains broadly similar and modestly skewed to the downside for 2021.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Wednesday as investor sentiment improved and government bond yields extended their retreat, while commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars rose. 
The lower U.S. bond yields also sapped some of the dollar's appeal among low-yielding currencies, with the yen and Swiss franc recovering from multi-month lows overnight.
Bonds have been at the centre of a storm in markets in recent weeks, following a jump in yields globally. Investors were betting an economic recovery would lift inflation and lead central banks to normalise monetary policy as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Global stocks dropped from near record highs and prices of commodities wobbled.
But this week has seen some calm return to the market, with yields dropping and stocks rising. 
An index of the dollar against six of its major peers slipped to 90.971 after dropping back from a nearly one-month high overnight.
Analysts said they expected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to reiterate on Thursday recent comments from fellow policymakers that any rises in rates would be gradual and that the U.S. economy was still far from the Fed's goals.
""The Fed is rightly more concerned about the speed of the move rather than the move higher in yields. The comments should help to dampen volatility in the bond market and the U.S. dollar's upward momentum in the near-term,"" MUFG analysts said in a note. 
The Aussie rose 0.1% to $0.7828, building on gains of about 0.7% the previous two days, after data showed the Australian economy grew much faster than expected in the fourth quarter.
The Norwegian crown, another commodity-linked currency, traded mostly higher against the dollar and the euro after advancing about 1% in each of the past two sessions.
The euro was little changed at $1.2086 after rising more than 0.3% in the previous session, when it rebounded from an almost one-month low below $1.20.
European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta said the bloc's monetary authority should expand bond purchases or even increase the quota earmarked for them if needed to keep yields down.
""Equity market reaction will be one of the key determinants of the impact of this move in global rates on FX markets,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo. The lull in volatility could prove fleeting if an improving U.S. economy re-ignites bond selling, with closely watched monthly payroll figures due on Friday.

Sterling traded 0.1% higher at $1.3973 before the UK budget' release, due at 1230 GMT.

Investing.com - The dollar traded marginally lower in early European trading Wednesday, remaining on the defensive as U.S. Treasury yields retreated, boosting risk sentiment. Sterling will also be in focus ahead of the U.K. budget.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.748, hitting a three-week high.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2094, USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 106.82, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7828, adding to recent strong gains after GDP data showed the Australian economy grew much faster than expected in the fourth quarter, up 3.1% on the quarter.
Movements in the global bond market have been very influential in guiding the foreign exchange rates, following last week’s dramatic jump in bond yields amid concerns inflationary pressures would cause central bankers, and the Federal Reserve in particular, to end the easy monetary policies which have been in place since the start of the Covid pandemic.
However, Treasury yields have stabilized this week, with the benchmark 10-year note currently yielding 1.40% after briefly hitting 1.60% last week, with Fed speakers keen to let the market know their accommodative monetary policy stance will be around for a while.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard is the latest to express such an opinion, saying it will take “some time” to meet the conditions needed for scaling back asset purchases. Even so, she admitted that the speed of last week's move up in bond yields had 'caught her eye'.
Also boosting risk sentiment was the decision by Texas Governor Greg Abbott to lift the state's remaining lockdown restrictions, and President Joe Biden's statement that the U.S. should have enough vaccines for all adults by the end of May, two months earlier than previously thought.
European authorities, meanwhile, have expressed more concern about the difficulties associated with rising yields. 
European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta said Tuesday that the bloc's monetary authority should expand bond purchases or even increase the quota earmarked for them if needed to keep yields down.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3982 ahead of the U.K.’s annual budget, with Finance Minister Rishi Sunak set to outline the country’s latest taxation and spending plans as it struggles to cope with the financial damage caused by the pandemic.
“Overall, the additional fiscal support to be announced ... should underscore the constructive outlook for GBP for 2Q, with the further fiscal help facilitating the economic rebound and making GBP the outperformer in the G10 FX space,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
 Additionally, USD/PLN rose 0.1% to 3.7566 ahead of the latest meeting by Poland’s central bank. It is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low as it weighs the impact of accelerating inflation against the threat of new Covid-19 restrictions stifling economic growth.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, but the safe-haven asset remained broadly weaker as Treasury yields continued to fall. The retreat also restored calm to global markets and turned investors towards riskier assets.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 90.817 by 11:05 PM ET (4:05 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.16% to 106.84, after coming close to hitting the 107 mark, a level unseen since August 2020, during the previous session.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7825 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7288.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.09% to 6.4647. China’s Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for February, released earlier in the day, was 51.5 against January’s 52 figure.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.3965.
Commodity-linked currencies, such as the Australian dollar, held on to sizeable two-day advances as yields fell. Positive Australian economic data stated that GDP grew 3.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021 and shrank 1.1% year-on-year, both above forecasts, also provided additional support for the AUD.
Bonds have caused volatility in the market as of late, after Treasuries led a dramatic jump in yields globally during the previous week. The volatility came even as central bankers, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, called for patience in normalizing monetary policy as global economies continue their recovery from COVID-19.
Continued progress on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden led to hopes for a quick economic recovery from COVID-19.
“Risk sentiment dynamics are the key driver of currencies in general right now … equity market reaction will be one of the key determinants of the impact of this move in global rates on forex markets,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
The calm in markets could prove short-lived should an improving U.S. economy lead to a second bond selloff. The U.S. employment report, including non-farm payrolls, will be released on Friday.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard stuck to the Fed’s dovish tone earlier in the week, saying there is still a lot of ground to cover on jobs and inflation. However, she added she is “paying close attention” to bond market developments, where “the speed of the moves caught my eye.”

The collapse, on a scale Lebanon has never seen, has slashed about 85% of the currency's value in a country relying heavily on imports. Prices of many consumer goods such as diapers or cereal have tripled.
Political leaders have failed to agree a rescue plan since the crisis erupted in late 2019 as dollar inflows dried up and protests gripped the country.
The cost of scarce dollars hit 10,000 Lebanese pounds on Tuesday, said two currency dealers on the informal market, a main source of cash since banks stopped dispensing dollars. Three other dealers said the greenback traded at 9,900.

EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.2010, GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.3885, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.84.

Currency markets have recently been taking their cues from the global bond market, and while Treasury yields have stabilized the dollar has pushed higher on expectations that the Fed will show greater tolerance of higher bond yields than other central banks.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has recently tried to tone down expectations of early tightening, saying the central bank would look through any near-term inflation spike. He will speak again at the end of the week.
Additionally, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin played down recent Treasury market volatility, in remarks that reinforce the message that the U.S. central bank is not yet troubled by the increase in yields.
However, the European Central Bank has taken a different stance, with top ECB officials expressing concern about the recent rises in bond yields. 
President Christine Lagarde said the central bank will prevent a premature increase in borrowing costs for firms and households, while François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, said some of the recent rises in bond yields were unwarranted.
The euro also suffered Tuesday from weak German retail sales as the Covid-19 lockdown and the withdrawal of a temporary cut in sales tax hit consumer spending in Europe's largest economy. 
Retail sales fell 4.5% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised decline of 9.1% in December. 
“Yet, as long as the re-opening of economies remains on track from 2Q – which we still believe to be the case – volatility should give way to a resumption of the dollar bear trend later this year,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“Despite ECB threats to cut rates, we still expect EUR/$ to be pressing 1.25 this summer and possibly break above it amidst broad global growth into year-end.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood firm against its low-yielding peers on Tuesday on bets of a faster economic recovery in the United States and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will show greater tolerance of higher bond yields than other central banks.
Risk sensitive currencies stepped back from sharp gains the previous day, as China's top financial regulator discussed the need to proactively take measures to stabilise the housing market, while expressing wariness of the risk of bubbles bursting in foreign markets.
The dollar index rose 0.2% to 91.176, hitting a three-week high to edge closer to its February peak of 91.600.
The U.S. currency rose to as high as 106.93 yen, its highest since late August, and last stood at 106.78 yen while the euro dipped 0.2% to $1.2026, touching its lowest level in almost a month.
""The jury is still out on whether the bond market sell-off is over. But people expect the Bank of Japan to keep a tab on bond yields, which means there will be a bigger yield premium for the dollar,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of FX sales at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank's Tokyo Branch.
The euro was under pressure as top officials from the European Central Bank sounded alarm over rises in bond yields.
President Christine Lagarde said the ECB will prevent a premature increase in borrowing costs for firms and households.
Policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau was even more explicit, saying some of the recent rises in bond yields were unwarranted and that the ECB must push back using the flexibility embedded in its bond purchase programme.
Traders were quick to sense the marked difference in tone between the ECB and the Federal Reserve. 
Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said on Monday the uptick in long-term bond yields so far seems to suggest an adjustment to stronger growth and inflation outlook.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said last week that bond yields remain comparatively low, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has not appeared unduly concerned by rising bond yields. 
""Central banks continue to take diverging views on the signals sent by the recent rise in yields. The U.S. Fed is taking it as a positive signal,"" Tapas Strickland, director of economics and markets at National Australian Bank in Sydney, said in a note.
The U.S. economic recovery is reckoned to be on firmer ground, bolstered by prospects of a $1.9 trillion relief package and successful rollouts of COVID-19 vaccinations.
A survey by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing activity increased to a three-year high in February amid a surge in new orders.
On the other hand, the Australian dollar dropped as much as 0.45% before erasing some losses to trade at $0.7766, after the Reserve Bank of Australia re-committed to keeping interest rates at historic lows.
While keeping rates at 0.1%, it emphasised that its targets for employment and inflation were not likely to be met until 2024 at the earliest.

The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7754, and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.7244.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12 % to 6.4725 and the GBP/USD pair was down 0.36% to 1.3872.
The dollar soared above the three-week high hit overnight and could be on target to reach its February peak of 91.600, Across the Atlantic, the euro dropped to $1.2049, near its lowest level in almost two weeks.
Top European Central Bank (ECB) officials expressed concern about the recent rises in bond yields. ECB President Christine Lagarde said the central bank will prevent a premature increase in borrowing costs for firms and households, while François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, said some of the recent rises in bond yields were unwarranted and that the ECB must push back via its bond purchase program.
The ECB was markedly differed in its tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell showed no undue concerns about rising bond yields and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin suggested the uptick in long-term bond yields so far could be an adjustment to stronger growth and inflation outlook. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic even said during the previous week that bond yields remain comparatively low.
“Central banks continue to take diverging views on the signals sent by the recent rise in yields. The Fed is taking it as a positive signal,” National Australian Bank director of economics and markets Tapas Strickland said in a note.
In Asia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept March’s interest rate steady at 0.10% earlier in the day. The decision was in line with expectations as well as reinforcing RBA’s forward guidance for three more years of near-zero rates.
The central bank has stepped up bond buying following a global bond market selloff, and any further warning against rising yields could cap its latest rebound, some investors warned.
“The market has been in a euphoria for some time, and everybody says the dollar will weaken on rising risk appetite. But oil prices dipped yesterday, and gold also slipped. If commodity markets are waking up to the reality, then we could see some weakness in commodity-linked currencies,” SMBC Nikko Securities chief FX strategist Makoto Noji told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden will be debated by the U.S. Senate later in the week, further raising hopes that the U.S. economic recovery is on solid ground."

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Monday, with riskier currencies back in vogue as U.S. Treasury yields stabilized after last week’s hefty selloff in global bond markets. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.752.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2090, after dropping 0.9% at the end of last week, the most since April. GBP/USD climbed 0.4% to 1.3991, while USD/JPY was largely flat at 106.56, near the six-month high of 106.69 touched Friday despite Japan's factory activity expanding at the fastest pace in over two years in February. 
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.8% to 0.7770, following a 2.1% plunge on Friday, as the Reserve Bank of Australia said it would buy twice the normal volume of long-term bonds at this week's regular operation. The RBA's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday. NZD/USD climbed 0.9% to 0.7290, recovering some of Friday's 1.9% slide, while USD/CAD fell 0.5% to 1.2680.
Currency markets have recently been taking their cues from the global bond market, where yields have surged in anticipation of an accelerated economic recovery and the expectation that central banks will have to tighten monetary policy earlier than had previously been expected.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield currently trades around 1.41%, stabilizing having briefly traded above 1.60% last week and giving higher-yielding currencies some breathing space.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has recently tried to douse the early tightening fires, saying the central bank would look through any near-term inflation spike, but data this week could easily create another spark.
He will speak again at the end of the week, but attention will quickly switch to the closely followed monthly payrolls data on Friday.
“Market corrections after long, benign periods of risk-taking tend to be short, sharp affairs and until the Fed chooses to verbally intervene in the bond market, we would say risk assets remain vulnerable over the week ahead and the dollar could enjoy a brief corrective rally,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.4627 after China's factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in nine months in February as weak overseas demand and coronavirus flare-ups weighed on output, according to a business survey.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI fell to 50.9 in February, from 51.5 in Januar, registering its thrid straight monthly drop.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would look through any near-term inflation spike and tighten policy only when the economy is clearly improving in two testimonies before Congress during the past week.

Investing.com – The dollar surged Friday, riding on the coattails of the recent surge U.S. Treasury yields amid bets the U.S. will emerge from the crisis stronger than its peers, but the greenback's momentum is unlikely to last, experts warn.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.87% to 90.91.
Expectations the U.S. economy is likely to emerge from the crisis ""better and faster than many other economies"" has pushed inflation expectations and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield sharply higher recently, sparking a move higher in the dollar, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Data on Friday, however, showed that fears of runaway inflation could be misplaced as the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve preferred measure of inflation, showed price pressures were tepid last month. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index increased 1.5% from 1.4% in December.
But with another round of fiscal stimulus expected to come, and the Federal Reserve seemingly content to continue its pace of the bond purchases and near-zero interest rates, investors are pricing a further run-up in inflation that could boost prices.
""A round of updates on the US consumer’s financial position offered a glimpse toward what lies ahead in the form of a strong consumer-led rebound driven by massive fiscal stimulus. In the process, evidence of inflationary pressure may well be upon us already,"" Scotia Economics said.
Others, however, don't expect inflation and the knock-on uptick in the dollar to sustain their run higher.
""For the second half of the year, we expect inflation expectations and bond yields to fall again somewhat. Then the dollar, which is still benefiting from rising US bond yields, should weaken again,"" Commerzbank added."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank twice waded into the spot currency market on Friday, selling a total of $1.545 billion as the real slid further against the dollar to cement its status as one of the world's worst performing currencies this year.
The central bank's action brought its total intervention over the past 24 hours to $3.08 billion, following two spot dollar sales on Thursday, the first this year. [L1N2KV2T2]
Traders said Brazilian markets had suffered in a global move to reduce risk exposure against a backdrop of surging bond yields, and that the central bank's action was simply aimed at meeting strong demand for dollars.
The real traded through 5.60 per dollar for the first time in almost four months, bringing its year-to-date losses to more than 7%. 
Aside from the Libyan dinar and Sudanese pound, which have both suffered huge one-off devaluations, the real is the biggest decliner against the dollar so far this year, according to 152 currencies tracked by Refinitiv. 
""There was apparently a lack of spot liquidity, a scarcity of (dollar) sellers yesterday and today,"" said Cleber Alessie Machado, head of financial derivatives at Commcor DTVM in Sao Paulo.
""The central bank is sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves, so it has room to sell. I don't think there is anything particularly deep behind its actions,"" he said.
The real has failed to gain any tangible support from the growing belief that Brazilian interest rates will start rising soon. 
Economists at Rabobank and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were the latest to revise up their calls, to a 50 basis point hike, at the central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting.
Morgan Stanley now sees the benchmark Selic rate ending this year at 4.25%, up from 3.50% previously. It has been at a record low 2.00% since August. 

Meanwhile analysts at Rabobank raised their year-end dollar/real forecast to 5.15 from 5.05, and their end-2022 call to 5.05 from 4.95.

The swap line, which has never been used, was opened in March last year at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and was scheduled to expire in March this year.
""This line does not imply any economic policy conditionality, and expands the funds and instruments available for the provision of dollar liquidity by the central bank,"" the monetary authority said in a statement.

Investing.com - The dollar climbed higher in early European trading Friday, lifted by a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields, while riskier currencies were hit hard amid fears central banks will have to tighten sooner than previously expected.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.4% at 90.468, also higher for the week and only 0.2% lower this month.
EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.2137, after touching a seven-week high Thursday, GBP/USD fell 0.6% to 1.3933, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 106.07, after earlier touching 106.43 for the first time since September. 
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.6% to 0.7823, after earlier trading near a three-year high, NZD/USD dropped 0.5% to 0.7338 after reaching 0.7463 Thursday, a level not seen since August 2017, while USD/CAD climbed 0.3% to 1.2632.
Government bonds, and particularly U.S. Treasuries, have started to become the focal point of markets globally, as traders now expect inflation to rise aggressively as economies recover on the back of extreme levels of fiscal stimulus and very loose monetary policies. As such, the fact that a Treasury auction on Thursday drew the weakest ratio ever of bids relative to the intended sale volume was the catalyst for a broad collapse in risk sentiment across markets.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly crossed the 1.6% level to trade at its highest level in more than a year. 
While central bank rhetoric has remained very dovish - notably the testimony this week from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, the rise in bond yields has indicated a growing belief that monetary policies will have to be tightened more quickly than originally envisioned.
“Risks are tilted towards a faster rise in yields. History has shown us that exiting from very easy central bank policies can be tricky,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. ”While Powell has for now promised that sizable bond purchases will continue, the time to start to tweak that communication may not be that far into the future.”
The bank says the dollar is at risk of wrong-footing the consensus once more, strengthening rather than weakening in 2021, and lowers its year-end forecast for EUR/USD to 1.16.
Currencies favored for leveraged carry trades all suffered, and in Europe USD/TRY rose 0.3% to 7.3561.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar touched a fresh six-month high versus the yen and extended a rebound from a three-year lows to the Aussie on Thursday, lifted by a sharp increase in U.S. bond yields overnight.
Government bonds, and particularly U.S. Treasuries, have become the focal point of markets globally, after traders aggressively moved to price in earlier monetary tightening than signalled by the Federal Reserve and its peers.
Asian stocks extended a global equity sell-off, with risk appetite souring as the surge in yields fomented inflation worries. Emerging-market and commodity-linked currencies continued to retreat Thursday, while cryptocurrencies stabilised after tumbling overnight.
""The market has gotten more and more confident about how strong the global economy could look in the second half of the year, and implied in that is increasing skepticism that central banks will be able to honor the promises they've given that rates are not going anywhere,"" said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
""The decline in bonds spooked equities,"" leading to ""classic U.S. dollar safe-haven support,"" he said.
The dollar index edged up to 90.38, holding on to a 0.2% rise from Thursday, when it rebounded from losses of as much as 0.26% before the bond tender. That leaves it down less than 0.2% for the month, following January's 0.6% gain.
The greenback was little changed at 106.165 yen after earlier touching 106.43 for the first time since September. It has strengthened 2.8% this year after the first back-to-back monthly increases since mid-2018, putting the yen among the worst performing major currencies in 2021.
Both the dollar and yen are traditional haven currencies, but the yen tends to decline when U.S. yields rise, whereas the dollar tends to strengthen.
Bond yields have climbed this year on the outlook for massive fiscal stimulus amid continued ultra-easy monetary policy, led by the United States.
An acceleration in the pace of vaccinations globally has also bolstered what has become known as the reflation trade, referring to bets on an upswing in economic activity and prices.
In recent days though, a rise in inflation-adjusted bond yields has accelerated, indicating a growing belief that central banks may need to pare back ultra-loose policies, despite their dovish rhetoric.
""The fixed income rout is shifting into a more lethal phase for risky assets,"" after initially being interpreted as a ""story of improving growth expectations,"" Westpac strategists wrote in a client note.
""It appears to be the case that bond markets are 'taking on' the central bankers' world view, and standing in front of the current momentum is unwise.""
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield surged above 1.6% overnight for the first time in a year, after an auction of $62 billion of 7-year notes was met with weak demand.
The Australian dollar continued its retreat after topping $0.80 on Thursday for the first time since February of 2018, declining 0.6% to 0.78195.
New Zealand's currency dropped 0.4% to $0.7336 after reaching $0.7463 Thursday, a level not seen since August 2017.
The Canadian dollar weakened 0.1% to C$1.2620 after falling from its own three-year top to the greenback at C$1.2468 overnight.
The euro slid 0.2% to $1.21475 after touching a seven-week high of $1.22435 on Thursday.
Cryptocurrencies remained lower after tumbling overnight. Bitcoin changed hands at $46,443 following Thursday's 5% slide, while ether traded at $1,473 following a 9% drop.

Investing.com – The pound slumped Thursday to remain on pace for its first loss in six trading days against the dollar as rising U.S. bond yields sparked risk-off sentiment.
GBP/USD fell 0.66%, to $1.4043.
The pound, which in recent months has moved in tandem with risk assets, followed a slump in equities on a sudden jump in U.S. bond yields. The United States 10-Year, which moves the opposite direction of prices, rose to a more than one year high above 1.6%, before giving back some gains.
Despite its penchant to follow risk assets, not everyone is convinced that the pound has become a risk-on currency. “[The pound’s] role as a risk-on currency is not well deserved,” HSBC said, according to Bloomberg.
The pound has a “slightly lower correlation with equities than other ‘risk-on’ currencies,” and the recent appreciation in the currency has been driven by optimism over the U.K. recovery, the bank added.
The upbeat outlook on the economy has been fueled by the rapid pace of the vaccine rollouts that has alleviated the pressure on the country’s healthcare system, and prompted the government to lay out plans to reopen the economy in the summer.
“[T]he plan to reopen the majority of sectors by mid-May looks achievable and should contribute to a 5% bounce in second-quarter GDP - even if, in reality, the plan to end social distancing entirely in June looks somewhat ambitious,” ING said in a note.
The strength in cable since the turn of the year has caught some by surprise.  Bank of America recently conceded that its skepticism on how long the currency pair could continue to rack up gains was misplaced.  ""Our scepticism about the durability of the GBP recovery beyond the initial relief has been misplaced,"" said Kamal Sharma, a foreign exchange analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). “[T]he UK's handling of the pandemic in 2020 was lacking, it is in stark contrast to the highly effective vaccine roll-out in 2021,"" he added."

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Thursday, falling to near three-year lows against a number of riskier currencies after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated the central bank’s easy policy stance was here to stay.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 89.920.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2193, near a one-month high, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.4153, after almost reaching 1.43 overnight for the first time since April 2018, and USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 106.08. 
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7992, a fresh three-year high, NZD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7447, just off Wednesday’s high of 0.7455, while USD/CAD fell 0.1% to 1.2496, near the three-year low of 1.2493.
Fed boss Jerome Powell continued his semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday, telling the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services that the central bank won't change its extremely accommodative stance until the U.S. economy is clearly improving, particularly the labor market, and would thus look through any near-term spike in inflation. 
 “Our policy is accommodative because unemployment is high and the labor market is far from maximum employment,"" Powell said.
These remarks maintained the dovish tone he had used in his testimony before the Senate on Tuesday.
“The Fed’s reiteration of a looser for longer policy and the lack of signal of any reduction in bond purchases regardless of the improving economic outlook remains – from an FX perspective – a key point in favour of a generalised dollar decline,” said ING analysts, in a research note. 
Easy financial conditions, the promise of fiscal stimulus, with an additional $1.9 trillion making its way through Congress, and an accelerating Covid-19 vaccine rollout have resulted in growing confidence in a global economic recovery, to the detriment of the safe-haven dollar.
With Powell emphasising the importance of the labor market, eyes will focus later in the session on the weekly unemployment claims data. Analysts are expecting a slight improvement though still-elevated levels of both initial claims and continuing claims. 
The second print of the fourth quarter gross domestic product release is also due later Thursday, with analysts expecting a reading of 2.0%, which would be up slightly from the first print of 1.9%.

The euro was also trading near the top of its recent range, after nearing a one-month high earlier in the week.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday reiterated that the central bank would maintain its easy policy until there are clear signs of economic improvement and would look through the short-term rise in inflation. The comments, part of Powell’s testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, were not dissimilar to Powell’s testimony before the Senate on Tuesday.
“Powell made it very clear that the improvement in the economic outlook thus far will not instigate the Fed to tighten monetary policy … the punch bowl ain’t going anywhere anytime soon and the policy backdrop should remain supportive for risk assets for some time,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) foreign exchange strategist Rodrigo Cattrill said in a note.
Investors also continue to turn to the reflation trade, placing bets on increasing economic activities and prices, driven by easy financial conditions, the promise of fiscal stimulus and an accelerating COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
In a boost for the global vaccine rollout, an Israeli study showed that two doses of the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine cut symptomatic COVID-19 cases by 94% across all age groups, and severe illnesses by nearly as much. The study results were published and peer-reviewed in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday."

The Fed expects this year to be an important one for the development of a digital U.S. currency, Powell said in response to a lawmaker's questions during testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, especially in its engagement with the U.S. public on the matter. 
The Fed and a number of other monetary authorities and governments around the world are working to develop digital versions of their so-called fiat currencies, partially in response to the rapid growth of alternatives such as bitcoin.

Powell said the Fed this year will be looking at the ""challenging"" policy and technical issues associated with a digital version of the dollar, a matter made more complex by the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The Fed will be careful that its actions do not undermine the functioning of key markets that are largely priced in dollars, he said.

583,"<span>Feb 24, 2021 04:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Sterling’s vaccine-fueled rally against the euro is beginning to look relentless.
The pound extended its longest winning streak in five-and-a-half years after the Telegraph reported the U.K.’s exit from lockdown could be accelerated if data on the effect of vaccines proves better than expected. The euro fell as much as 0.8% to 85.41 pence, dropping for a ninth straight day, on optimism that Britain will bounce back faster than its European peers.
The U.K. has administered more than 27 doses per 100 people, according to Bloomberg’s tracker. That far outpaces the six doses for the EU and has helped turn the pound into the best performing Group-of-10 currency against the euro this year. BofA Global Research this month revised their year-end target for the euro-pound pair to 0.88, from 0.94 previously. Dankse Bank sees the cross trading at 0.85 in the second half of the year.
“The main driver is building confidence that the U.K.’s world-leading vaccine roll-out will allow the U.K. economy to re-open more quickly than the rest of Europe,” said Lee Hardman, a foreign-exchange strategist at MUFG Bank. “I would say the case for the pound to continue to outperform in the near-term remains compelling.”
Yet Brussels could be closing the gap. The EU may be able to vaccinate 75% of its adult population by the end of August, about two months earlier than previously forecast, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.

Investing.com - The dollar drifted lower in early European trading Wednesday, with traders betting on riskier currencies after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell kept a dovish stance in his semi-annual testimony to Congress.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.058.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2156, USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 105.50, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7920, trading near a three-year high.
Fed chief Powell reiterated on Tuesday that U.S. interest rates will remain low for some time and the central bank will keep buying bonds to support the U.S. economy, even as Congress prepares to authorize President Joe Biden’s new $1.9 trillion support package.
“The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,” Powell said, in the text of his testimony delivered Tuesday to the Senate Banking Committee. He continues his two-day testimony later Wednesday.
While these policies are designed to support the U.S. economy, many see them as being long-term negatives for the dollar. 
“USD liquidity will arrive in truckloads already this week,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “which should be good news for risk appetite but not for the USD.”
There is growing optimism about the global economic outlook, resulting in money flowing toward currencies that are expected to benefit from a pick-up in global trade and to countries that are bouncing back quickly from the pandemic.
For example, NZD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7373, a three-year high, after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% earlier in the day. Despite saying that it was ready to reduce its overnight cash rate further if needed, the RBNZ said the risks to the economy from here on were ""balanced"".
Standard & Poor’s rating agency upgraded its country rating on New Zealand to AA+ earlier this week, the world’s first sovereign upgrade since the start of the pandemic, citing its successful containment of Covid-19 and resultant economic recovery.
Additionally, GBP/USD was up 0.5% at 1.4176, rising to its highest level since April 2021.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined his plan to ease the current lockdown restrictions in stages earlier this week as the country continues its rapid vaccine rollout.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, sliding to a three-year low against the GBP and recording losses against commodities currencies, as increased bets that the global economic recovery from COVID-19 will whet investors’ risk appetite.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.10% to 90.032 by 9:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.15% to 105.39.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.35% to 0.7937. The AUD, a usual beneficiary of rising metal and energy prices, climbed to near a three-year high. The NZD/USD pair was up 0.40% to 0.7369.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.09% to 6.4585.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.43% to 1.4171. The pound rose to its highest level since April 2018 after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced a plan to ease current lockdown restrictions in stages as the country continues its rapid COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
The dollar traded close to a six-week low against the euro.
The NZD was the focus of attention as the Asian session opened. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) said that it would keep its interest rate unchanged at 0.25% earlier in the day, in line with expectations. Investors had also been on the lookout for comments from RBNZ officials that were positive about economic prospects.
However, some investors told Reuters that the central bank could increase rates by the end of 2022 as its economy recovers more quickly than expected from COVID-19.
Across the Pacific Ocean, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s commitment to low interest rates and bond purchases to support the U.S. economic recovery. However, the Fed support could be a long-term negative factor for the greenback.
“Signs of economic recovery are lifting commodities prices, which in turn supports currencies of commodities exporters … risk appetite has improved a lot, and this leaves the dollar at a big disadvantage,” IG Securities foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters.
Powell also dismissed concerns that loose monetary policy could lead to inflation and financial bubbles which have dominated 2021 so far as skepticism grows over the rally in global stocks.
Simultaneously, investors are turning to currencies that stand to gain from the increased global trade, and countries that are making progress on their COVID-19 recoveries, also contributing to the dollar’s decline.
Meanwhile, central bankers whose economies saw less disruption from COVID-19 face the opposite dilemma of whether to tighten their monetary policies. Should they start doing so, the dollar will lose even more of its appeal, some investors warned."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to a three-year low against the British pound and nursed losses against commodities currencies on Wednesday as investors increased bets that a global economic recovery will boost riskier assets.
The New Zealand dollar was in focus before a central bank meeting that could send the kiwi higher if policymakers make any positive comments about the local economy.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated on Tuesday that interest rates will remain low and the Fed will keep buying bonds to support the U.S. economy, which many traders say is a long-term negative factor for the dollar.
At the same time, more money is flowing toward currencies that are expected to benefit from a pick-up in global trade and to countries that are bouncing back quickly from the coronavirus pandemic, which is also weighing on the dollar.
""Signs of economic recovery are lifting commodities prices, which in turn supports currencies of commodities exporters,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities.
""Risk appetite has improved a lot, and this leaves the dollar at a big disadvantage.""
The Australian dollar, which tends to benefits from rising metal and energy prices, traded near a three-year high.
The British pound rose to $1.4120, the highest since April 2018.
The outlook for sterling has brightened as investors cheer Britain's rapid coronavirus vaccination programme and its plans to ease lockdown restrictions on economic activity.
Against the euro, the dollar traded at $1.2153, close to a six-week low.
The dollar held steady at 105.29 Japanese yen.
Powell pushed back against suggestions that loose monetary policy will lead to runaway inflation and financial bubbles, which have emerged as two important themes this year, because there is growing scepticism about the rapid pace of gains in global stocks.
For economies that have limited disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak, their central bankers now face questions of when to start tightening policy, which makes the dollar look less attractive, some analysts say.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to keep policy on hold on Tuesday, but three economists in a Reuters poll expect a rate hike by the end of next year due to a quicker-than-expected economic recovery. 
Ahead of the decision, the New Zealand dollar held steady at $0.7338, close to a three-year high.

587,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia would really prefer if its currency didn’t trade above 80 U.S. cents, eroding the competitiveness of its exports sector just as the economy is trying to recover from the pandemic.
Since its float in December 1983, the Australian dollar has averaged 75.90 cents. Given this history, Australians tend to think that a 7 in front of it is about right; an 8 is getting high, while a 6 means something significant is happening offshore or there are problems at home.
“The conversation around the Aussie changes when you leave the 70s,” said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. in Sydney. “The RBA might be dismayed by the break of 0.80 but given the commodity price backing is so strong, they should take some comfort that the A$ doesn’t seem overvalued. It’s a headwind, but they saw worse in 2011-12.”
The floating exchange rate acts as the economy’s shock absorber: it slumped to 55 cents in March last year as Covid-induced market turmoil peaked. Since then, it has surged more than 40% as central banks pumped monetary stimulus, authorities suppressed the virus and commodity prices rebounded on a wave of global liquidity and Chinese demand. The currency last hit 80 cents in 2018.
“A number as round as 80 cents is a milestone,” said Callow. “You also have the likelihood of options strikes or stop losses around that figure.”
A large build up of options contracts that give traders the right to sell as much as A$4.3 billion of the currency at 79 cents remain in play until Friday, which is likely to slow its ascent over the next few days.
It traded at 79.09 U.S. cents at 10:05 a.m. on Wednesday in Sydney.
Export Earnings
Even with Australia’s borders closed for almost a year now, shutting down the country’s top services exports of international education and tourism, currency appreciation is still a worry, according to Ian Harper, who sits on the RBA’s board.
“Has the weight that’s placed on what might happen to the exchange rate, when thinking about how quickly the bank achieves its objectives, has that changed? Well no,” said Harper. He points out services only make up 25% of exports. The other 75% are commodities.
Trade statistics show that exporters with limited market dominance are already impacted by the eroding competitiveness.
Bond Buying
The RBA has made no secret that it had the currency partly in mind when it launched a A$100 billion ($79 billion), six-month quantitative easing program in November targeting longer-dated bonds.
The central bank followed up earlier this month by announcing another A$100 billion of purchases from mid-April, when the current program ends. Christopher Kent, who oversees financial markets at the RBA, reckons the currency would’ve been higher without these QE program.
“Historical relationships with commodity prices would have implied a much larger appreciation of the Australian dollar,” Kent said on Feb. 17. “While history only provides a rough guide, this difference suggests that the bank’s policy measures have contributed to the Australian dollar being as much as 5% lower than otherwise, in trade-weighted terms.”

Investing.com – The pound rallied to a nearly three-year high on positive labor market news and ongoing hopes for a vaccine-fueled recovery as the U.K. sets its sights on reopening over the next few months, but another sharp increase in the currency could trigger the Bank of England to rein in the high-flying currency.
GBP/USD rose 0.34% to $1.4110 to its highest level since March 2018.
The strength in the pound Tuesday was also supported by better-than-expected labor market data despite the ongoing lockdown. “The latest UK labour market figures were largely consistent with stability around the turn of the year,” Daiwa Capital Markets said.
Sterling has made a strong start to the week following five straight months of gains and optimism over the reopening in the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country would end Covid-19 restrictions by June 21.
“The plan Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced yesterday which entailed lifting all corona-related restrictions by the middle of the year, provided some further support to Sterling,” but if the appreciation continues apace it would have an increasingly restrictive effect on the real economy and threaten to slow the recovery. I would therefore not expect any further support for sterling from the BoE,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Still, sterling is unlikely to see an abrupt end to its months-long rally as its gains since December are “not dramatic yet,” the bank added. “On a trade weighted basis Sterling has appreciated by approx. 5% since mid-December.”
Earlier this month, the central bank but ended expectations of cutting rates below zero.
“While the Committee was clear that it did not wish to send any signal that it intended to set a negative Bank Rate at some point in the future, on balance, it concluded overall that it would be appropriate to start the preparations to provide the capability to do so if necessary in the future,” the BoE said."

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trading Tuesday, after earlier falling to a near six-week low ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s semi-annual testimony to Congress.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.01% at 90.002.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2174, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.14, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7917, climbing to the highest level in almost three years as commodity prices have soared.
These gains have triggered worries of a global rise in inflation, and puts the focus on Fed chief Jerome Powell, who testifies before Congress later in the day.
He is expected to provide assurance that the Fed will not respond to higher inflation with an immediate rate hike, which could potentially cause the dollar to drop further.
“His challenge will be to express confidence in the recovery, but not too much confidence such that the bond market slide turns into a collapse,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
“Typically, the Fed finds the right words on these occasions – most certainly downplaying the forthcoming rise in inflation into 2Q – such that the bond market decline can probably stay orderly.” 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was up 0.2% at 1.4083, up almost 3% this month as the U.K. has impressed with its Covid-19 vaccine program, in turn boosting confidence in a U.K. economic recovery.
Britain's unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in the last three months of 2020, its highest since the first quarter of 2016, official data showed Tuesday. That said, separate data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of employees on company payrolls in January rose by 83,000 from December.
On Monday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out his aim to ease lockdown rules in a series of stages over the next four months.
“The switch from Brexit-related uncertainty to the vaccine rollout-related upside to the UK growth outlook argues for more frequent periods of GBP valuation overshoots,” ING added.

Elsewhere in Europe, the euro is set to re-test resistance around the $1.2220 mark after a small gain to $1.2165.
Riskier currencies such as the AUD and NZD climbed to their highest levels in almost three years as prices for materials such as oil, copper, lumber and milk powder also rose. These gains, however, have triggered worries of a global rise in inflation and a huge sell-off in longer-dated bonds.
Powell, who testifies before Congress later in the day, is expected to provide assurance that the Fed will not respond to higher inflation with an immediate rate hike, which could potentially calm bond markets and could eventually potentially cause the dollar to drop further.
“I think he will talk up the downside … if anything, I think he will give markets a bit of a cold shower and say, ‘Mr. Market, you’re getting a bit ahead of yourself. There are plenty of risks ... and the U.S. economy is long, long way from full employment,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.
The market made slight moves ahead of Powell’s testimony, but expectations of low U.S. interest rates in the short term could see trade-exposed currencies could climb further, which could lead to further drops in the dollar.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling looks set to extend its rally beyond $1.40, thanks to the pace of Britain's COVID-19 vaccine rollout and signs that investors are flocking back to assets out of favour during years of Brexit turmoil.
The signing of a post-Brexit accord on Christmas Eve, while leaving Britain more distanced from the European Union than investors had hoped, ended years of uncertainty.
That alongside a vaccination campaign running well ahead of most countries has helped the pound become this year's best-performing G10 currency, with a 3% gain versus the dollar.
With sterling hitting a three year high, that is a major turnaround from September/October, when the pound fell below $1.27 and overseas investors fled. 
Sterling's year-to-date gains are even more impressive against other currencies - it is up 5%-plus to the Swiss franc and Japanese yen.
""First of all, the UK doesn't have Brexit risk anymore,"" said April LaRusse, head of fixed income investment specialists at Insight Investment.
""Second, it's doing a tremendous job vaccinating which is making people think there's scope for UK to recover earlier than Europe and in line with the United States,"" she added.
Reopening the economy matters more for Britain than most developed nations, LaRusse said, noting services comprise 80% of its annual output. The corresponding figure in Germany is 70%.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a ""cautious but also irreversible"" plan on Monday to end England's COVID-19 lockdown, although the final step -- when most restrictions would be lifted -- will not start until June 21 at the earliest.
The government's pledge to offer all adults a first COVID-19 shot by July 31 has prompted a rash of forecast upgrades on the pound.
Citi strategist Adam Pickett said on Sunday his target was $1.43 over the next one-to-three months, describing bets on the reopening of the British economy as not well priced and investor positioning not ""particularly stretched"". 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advises buying the pound versus the Swiss franc with a 1.30 franc target -- a further 3% sterling gain.
The bank cited the Bank of England's reluctance to cut interest rates below 0% and the chance of the services-dependent British economy rebounding strongly ""when excess savings are unleashed"".
The UK household savings rate stood at 16.9% last September, from 7.7% in December 2019.
Reflecting the mood, three-month implied sterling volatility -- an option market gauge of how much a currency could move -- has dropped from emerging market-like double digit rates seen during Brexit brinkmanship to 7.3%. 
It averaged above 9% during much of 2020. 
Adding to sterling's appeal, the 10-year inflation-adjusted yield premium that investors can earn from U.S. Treasuries over British government bonds has fallen to its lowest in five years.
LOW OWNERSHIP
Britain's economy shrank 10% last year, its biggest contraction in 300 years. The BoE forecasts a 4% fall in the first three months of 2021. But the promise of a faster rebound is luring investors who had been deterred by Brexit and the pandemic hit.
Global fund managers had a net 10% underweight to British stocks, BofA's February survey showed, compared with a 34% underweight three months ago. 
Britain's stock market is also dominated by mining, energy and financial firms. Out of favour for years, these sectors are now pricing in a global post-pandemic rebound.
""We're getting more signs of interest in sterling, UK assets, property, we're seeing a pent-up demand for the UK,"" Jeffrey Sacks, head of EMEA investment strategy at Citi Private Bank told Reuters, citing ""low ownership"" as a key reason.
Nor have investors taken out huge bets on sterling to rise since the recent upturn in price. Long positions - or bets on the pound to rise versus the dollar - total 13% of open interest, up 10 percentage points since the start of the year, ING Bank notes.
Yet as recently as March 2020, sterling long positions were far higher, CFTC data shows.
What is more, when measured against a basket of the currencies of its trade partners, the pound is 15% below its long-term average value.
Some such as Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), reckon the pound is ""overbought"".
After all, Britain still must agree a deal with the EU for financial services and its balance of payments deficit makes it vulnerable to sentiment swings.
Debates over Scotland's independence could create renewed political uncertainty if the Scottish National Party wins May's Scottish parliamentary election.
The FTSE still lags U.S. and euro zone peers year-to-date, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts noted, warning of setbacks if robust economic recovery boosts government bond yields.
Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at asset manager Mediolanum, is long sterling but says markets should not get ""carried away"" by UK prospects.

""From a developed market economy perspective, Britain has become a litmus test for vaccines and how the move out of lockdown will go,"" he added.

592,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 05:43AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira slipped 1% on Monday, paring some gains after a four-month rally as rising U.S. bond yields gave the dollar a boost and as the finance minister defended his predecessor's policies that oversaw a sharp decline in FX reserves. 
Data painted a mixed picture of the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic with tourist arrivals still in a deep slump, and manufacturing confidence rising. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) both upgraded GDP forecasts for 2021. 
The lira - which has outperformed emerging market peers by far this year - weakened as far as 7.0275 against the dollar and was at 7.0020 at 1026 GMT, down 0.7% on the day. Last week it rallied to 6.9, the best since August. 
The dollar rebounded from multi-year lows on rising expectations of faster economic growth and inflation in the world's largest economy, putting pressure on the lira. 
Turkey's currency has gained more than 20% since early November when a new central bank governor and a finance minister were named, boosting expectations of tight monetary policy and a more orthodox approach after years of perceived mismanagement.
Under the former finance minister, Berat Albayrak, who is President Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law, the central bank's FX reserves were badly depleted due to a costly policy of state banks selling some $128 billion in dollars to support the lira. 
Late on Sunday new Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan condemned recent political criticism of Albayrak's policies and said transactions that had reduced reserves aimed to ensure financial stability amid the volatile pandemic.
The central bank under new Governor Naci Agbal says it will start to rebuild the reserves, which buffer against financial crisis, and which on a net basis fell by about three quarters throughout 2020.
Ratings agency Fitch revised Turkey's outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' on Friday, citing a more consistent and orthodox policy mix under a new leadership that has helped ease near-term external financing risks. 
Turkey's economy, hit hard in the second quarter of last year, has rebounded well and should record growth for 2020 as a whole. BofA raised its 2021 growth forecast to 4.6% from 4.1% despite what it called signs of a slowdown in the first quarter.
Wall Street bank Goldman raised this year's expectation to 6% growth from 4%, and also pencilled in an interest rate cut to 16.5% from 17% now due to the lira's recent strength. 
Turkey's capacity utilisation rate slipped a bit to 74.9% in February, still well above the decade low touched in April. Manufacturing confidence in the same period rose to 109.3 points, central bank data said.,

In January, Turkey saw less than a third of the tourists from a year earlier. Tourism revenues, key to funding the country's chronic current account deficit, plummeted last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar pared losses in early European trading after hitting multi-year lows against sterling and the Australian and New Zealand currencies as vaccine progress, expectations for faster economic growth and inflation sent bond yields higher.

The British pound was holding the $1.40 line after reaching 1.4043, its highest since April 2018, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson charts a path out of lockdowns on the back of rapid vaccinations. 
The Aussie rose as much as 0.5% to an almost three-year high of $0.7908 before letting the dollar come back to 0.7864. 
The kiwi hit $0.7338, also its best since early 2018, helped by S&P's upgrade of New Zealand's sovereign credit ratings by a notch, but also saw the greenback gradually pare most losses.
The yen lost 0.33% at 105.78 while the euro lost 0.2% at $1.2095 ahead of a German sentiment survey and a speech at 1345 GMT by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann argued that much at stake for the relationship between the euro and the dollar lies in the growth differential between the two economies. 
""Where EUR-USD is going to go medium-term depends on whether the U.S. economy really will be able to achieve a stronger post-lockdown boom than Europe"", he said, adding he expects the common currency to suffer in that regard in the first half of 2021. 
All in all, the U.S. dollar index was up 0.28% at 90.543.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin eased from the record high of $58,354.14 hit during the weekend, retreating to $56,039.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, rebounding to a degree after earlier falling to multi-year lows against a number of currencies as vaccine progress prompted optimism on a prompt global economic recovery.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.442.
GBP/USD was down 0.2% at 1.3986, after earlier Monday climbing to 1.4052, its highest since April 2018, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson set to detail his country’s path out of lockdowns on the back of rapid vaccinations.
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7862, after earlier climbing to an almost three-year high of 0.7908, while NZD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7290, easing back from 0.7338, its best since early 2018, helped by S&P's upgrade of New Zealand's sovereign credit ratings by a notch.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.1% ahead of the monthly German Ifo survey to 1.2106 and USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 105.75.
Although the greenback has edged higher Monday morning, the overall tone for the safe-haven dollar remains negative as the focus remains on the global economic recovery from Covid-19 pandemic.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before Congress this week, starting on Tuesday, and investors will study his words carefully for any clues as to when the central bank’s easy monetary policy stance will start to change.
“Fed Chair Powell will have the difficult task to express confidence on the recovery while keeping tapering speculations muted at his semi-annual testimony,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“Bonds may stay fragile, but the dollar has struggled to rally on the recent spike in yields and the recovery story may keep supporting pro-cyclical currencies.”
The coming week should also see some progress on the US$1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus bill, where a vote could go to the House floor on Friday. This means the Senate should see the bill the following week.
“The Senate is on track to send a robust $1.9 trillion package to the president’s desk before the March 14 expiration of unemployment insurance benefits” from the last round of stimulus, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Friday letter to colleagues. “We will meet this deadline.”
Additionally, USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 6.4688 after the People’s Bank of China kept its loan prime rates steady for a 10th month in February. The five-year loan prime rate was set at 4.65%, while the one-year loan prime rate was set at 3.85%"

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, falling to a three-year low against the AUD and a three-year low against the GBP as continued progress on curbing the COVID-19 virus boosted risk sentiment.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 90.323 by 9:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.22% to 105.66, with the dollar holding steady against the yen.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.26% to 0.7890 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.23% to 0.7320. Giving a boost to the Antipodean risk currencies is the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, with New Zealand starting inoculations on Sunday and Australia following suit earlier in the day.
Australia was also set to report no local cases for a third consecutive day. Fitch also said on Monday that the vaccines will also ease risks to Australia’s economy over the year as it maintained the country’s AAA credit rating, albeit with a negative outlook.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.4625.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.4025, with the pound climbing above the 1.4 mark. In the U.K., investors await Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to ease the current COVID-19 lockdowns as the country presses on with one of the fastest vaccine rollouts globally.
An investor move towards currencies with close ties to the commodities trade as risk sentiment improves also benefitted the Antipodean currencies. The dollar dropped towards a three-year low against the NZD, while the AUD was at its highest level since March 2018.
Some investors said that the safe-haven greenback is likely to drop further as the focus remains on the global economic recovery from COVID-19, and progress against the pandemic continues to be made.
“Commodity currencies and the pound are particularly strong against the dollar, and this trend looks set to continue,” Daiwa Securities foreign exchange strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
“The U.K.’s vaccination program is making a lot of progress. Economic activity is gradually returning to normal in many places, which puts some pressure on the dollar,” Ishizuki added.
Also contributing to the dollar’s woes was dollar net short positioning falling to $29.09 billion during the previous week, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. This is dollar shorts’ lowest level since mid-December and a fourth consecutive week of losses, an indication that some dollar optimism remains.
Recent gains in long-term Treasury yields and an improved U.S. COVID-19 response will lend the dollar some mild support, Daiwa’s Ishizuki said.
Meanwhile, in cryptocurrency, bitcoin dropped slightly to the $57,090 mark but remained near the previous week’s record high as mainstream acceptance of the digital asset continues to increase. Rival cryptocurrency Ether dropped to $1,918."
596,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 08:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of England policy maker Gertjan Vlieghe gave his strongest backing yet for the use of negative interest rates if the U.K. needs more stimulus, highlighting a growing schism between officials on the institution’s toolkit.
Two days after Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said the BOE had scope for more quantitative easing to support the economy -- describing it as a “tried and tested tool” -- his colleague on the Monetary Policy Committee contended that there’s “little QE can do to add further stimulus to the economy.”
“Should market functioning deteriorate again, of course the MPC will not hesitate to accelerate the buying pace again, if that is appropriate,” Vlieghe said in a speech released on Friday that will be delivered to Durham University next week. “Absent such a deterioration, and with long-term interest rates already very low, we need to look for tools other than QE to deliver further stimulus if required.”
The remarks underscore a growing rift between BOE policy makers on the contingency they could resort to if the massive stimulus already deployed to the economy proves to be insufficient to drive a recovery from the pandemic crisis. While officials have agreed that negative interest rates could be used in theory, such a prospect is still months away.
Vlieghe zeroed in on the risk of labor market weakness, highlighted Thursday by fellow rate-setter Michael Saunders, saying that he favored negative rates to deal with such a threat. He added that if the economy evolves in line with this month’s projections, “no further monetary stimulus is required.”
“My preferred path for policy would be to keep the current monetary stimulus in place until well into 2023 or 2024,” Vlieghe said, adding that if labor market slack persists, “I would favor a negative Bank Rate as the tool to implement the stimulus.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Friday, after disappointing labor market data diluted optimism over a quick U.S. economic recovery. Sterling remained strong despite weak retail sales numbers for January.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.483, after a 0.4% decline overnight cut short a two-day winning streak.
EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2107, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.62, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.4% to 0.7793.
The dollar had posted gains over the last couple of days as U.S. Treasury yields had risen with the release of strong retail sales data, but the unexpected rise in the number of jobless claims came as a reminder of how much slack the pandemic has left in the labor market. 
A total of 861,000 claims were filed during the previous week, hitting a four-week high, compared with the 765,000 claims expected and the 848,000 claims filed during the previous week.
The Federal Reserve had already warned, in the minutes from its January policy meeting, that the labor market would take time to return to trend and thus its easy monetary policy would stay in place for a considerable period. 
And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made it clear that $1.9 trillion in pandemic-relief spending is still needed, defending the need for President Joe Biden’s plan despite the recent strength in retail sales.
“It’s very important to have a big package that addresses the pain this has caused,” Yellen said on CNBC Thursday. “The price of doing too little is much larger than the price of doing something big.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded up 0.1% at 1.3979, with sterling retaining its recent strength despite the release of very weak economic data Friday. British retail sales fell 8.2% in January on the month, a much sharper fall than expected as non-essential shops went back into coronavirus lockdowns.
The pound traded near an almost three-year high overnight, helped by perceptions that Britain's aggressive vaccination program will result in the country coming out of lockdown more quickly than its neighbors. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to lay out the country's roadmap for exiting lockdowns on Monday.
Additionally, U.K. government borrowing climbed to 270.6 billion pounds ($378 billion) in the first 10 months of the fiscal year, as the pandemic played havoc with public finances. Britain is facing its largest deficit in peacetime, while its public debt is now over 100% of GDP
“All of this suggests that the path of least resistance for GBP/USD in the near term should be lower,” said Kathy Lien, analyst at BK Asset Management, as cable nears the 1.40 level.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar paused on Friday after its biggest loss in 10 days as disappointing U.S. labour market data bruised optimism for a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The greenback continued to buck its traditional role as a safe-harbour currency, falling in sympathy with U.S. stocks overnight after an unexpected increase in weekly jobless claims soured the economic outlook.
The British pound traded near an almost three-year high reached overnight, when it surged the most in more than a month, amid Britain's aggressive vaccination programme. 
The dollar index was little changed at 90.561 in the Asian session, after a 0.4% decline overnight cut short a two-day winning streak. For the week, the gauge is now back to more or less break-even. 
The string of soft labour data is weighing on the dollar even as other indicators have shown resilience, and as President Joe Biden's pandemic relief efforts take shape, including a proposed $1.9 trillion spending package.
""The prospect of a massive U.S. fiscal stimulus plus a successful vaccine roll-out are solid arguments to bet on a U.S. recovery this year,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney, wrote in a client note.
""But the overnight jobless claims data serve as a reminder of the unevenness of the recovery so far.""
Sterling was mostly flat at $1.3965 on Friday following a 0.8% jump in the previous session, when it rose as high as $1.3986 for the first time since April 2018.
The euro was little changed at $1.2093 after rising 0.4% overnight.
The dollar bought 105.555 yen, little changed following a two-day retreat from the five-month high of 106.225 reached Wednesday.
Many analyst expect the dollar to weaken over the course of the year as it has traditionally done during times of global economic recovery, though it might take some time to develop.
""It looks to me like there’s some exhaustion in that just-straight global reflation theme,"" leading the dollar to trend largely sideways for now, said Daniel Been, head of FX at ANZ in Sydney.
The trade should reignite once fiscal stimulus starts to kick in and services start to reopen in a more fulsome way, he said.
""We see it broadly as a dollar-negative story,"" he said.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin traded at $51,335.71, consolidating for a second day after hitting a record $52,640 on Wednesday in a rally fuelled by endorsements from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and others. It has risen about 78% so far in 2021, after more than quadrupling last year.
Smaller rival ethereum rose to a record $1,951.89 on Friday, just pipping the previous day's high, before trading at $1,909.41. It has surged some 162% this year. 
On Thursday, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp announced a new processor designed specifically for mining ethereum.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, clawing back some losses. The U.S. currency saw its biggest losses in ten days after disappointing U.S. labor data finally dented recent optimism for the country’s quick economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.09% to 90.632 by 9:16 PM ET (2:16 AM GMT). The index was little changed as Friday’s session opened, after it dropped 0.4% overnight.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 105.72. The dollar was little changed against the safe-haven yen after two consecutive days of retreat from a five-month high hit on Wednesday.
The AUD/USD pair inched down to 0.06% to 0.7762 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7206.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.27% to 6.4691.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3954. The pound was mostly flat after climbing to an almost three-year high during the previous session, the highest gains in more than a month, as the U.K. continues to roll out an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program.
Elsewhere in Europe, the euro was also flat after gaining 0.4% overnight.
The greenback is slowly returning to its safe-haven asset role, but sentiment was soured by the unexpected rise in the number of U.S. jobless claims. A total of 861,000 claims were filed during the previous week, against the 765,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 848,000 claims filed during the previous week.
The disappointing data is impacting the dollar, however, even as progress is made on a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden and other economic indicators are more positive.
“The prospect of a massive U.S. fiscal stimulus plus a successful vaccine roll-out are solid arguments to bet on a U.S. recovery this year … but the overnight jobless claims data serve as a reminder of the unevenness of the recovery so far,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior foreign exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
Cryptocurrencies took a little breather, with bitcoin near the $51,500 mark after reaching a record $52,604 in a rally driven by endorsements from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) among others. It has risen around 71% in 2021 to date, after it more than quadrupled in 2020.
Ethereum took advantage of its larger rival’s breather, climbing to a record high of $1,951.89 on Friday, soaring around 162% in 2021. It was also boosted after chipmaker NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a new processor designed specifically for mining the cryptocurrency."

Investing.com – The pound surged to nearly three-year highs against the dollar Thursday, and is likely to continue its upward trajectory over the short-term, but could be in for rude awakening once the impact of Brexit begins to make its mark.
GBP/USD rose 0.81% to $1.3965 reaching its highest level March 2018.
The sharp jump in the pound comes as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said the lockdown restrictions would be lifted in stages. The prime minister has appeared eager to quell growing optimism over a faster reopening, insisting further data was needed on how much vaccines can reduce transmission rates.
Further data from the U.K.'s vaccine roll out is expected Friday, though it is unclear whether it will how effective the vaccine is at reducing the spread of infection.
While the successful vaccination campaign in the U.K. is ""fueling hopes for a quick recovery and boosting the pound, … once the effects of the Brexit become more apparent, the trend is likely to turn again,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
It may, however, take a ""considerable time before the impact of the pandemic and that of Brexit become more clearly distinguishable … due to the Corona-related lockdown, "" Commerzbank said.
Still, those willing to stick with the pound are likely to be rewarded as the ""chances are good that the pound will appreciate significantly more in the short term than we currently assume in our forecasts,"" it added.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Thursday, with riskier currencies more in favor after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting reinforced its easy policy stance.  
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.903. 
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2047, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3864, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.81, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7758.
The Federal Reserve released the minutes from its January policy meeting on Wednesday, and these reinforced its plans to let the economy overheat while maintaining an ultra-accommodative monetary policy.
“The Federal Reserve's meeting minutes showed that the central bank is upbeat on America's growth prospects in 2021 – more than beforehand,” said Yohay Elam, an analyst at FX Street, in a research note. 
“However, the Fed seems unmoved from all the talk about higher inflation and is unlikely to raise rates nor taper its bond-buying scheme. Under these circumstances, the greenback will likely remain under pressure.”
Progress is being made on President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package, with the president meeting labor leaders on Wednesday to canvass support.
This package is prompting much discussion over the likely path of inflation levels going forward, given it’s expected to be largely funded by borrowing.
The U.S. economy received some positive news Wednesday, as retail sales grew 5.3% month-on-month in January, against the forecast 1.1% growth and December’s 1% fall.
“Some are concerned that this good news is bad news - as it may lower pressure for stimulus,” added Elam. “However, unemployment remains high, with some ten million Americans still out of work. Weekly jobless claims are set to provide a reminder that the economy is still struggling.”
Weekly initial jobless claims are due for release at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). 
Elsewhere, USD/TRY pushed 0.1% higher to 6.9684 ahead of the latest meeting of Turkey’s central bank, where interest rates are expected to remain unchanged at 17% for a second month.
The lira has soared against the dollar since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan overhauled his economic policy team in November, installing a new central bank governor who promptly instigated a series of rate hikes to support the previously battered currency.
Overnight, the Indonesian central bank cut its deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points each, as expected. The move reflected the rupiah's sustained strength over the last four months. The dollar edged up 0.1% against the rupiah as a result."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia following its first back-to-back gains in two weeks overnight. Positive U.S. data that continued to raise hopes that the country will see a faster economic recovery from COVID-19 than its global peers.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 90.938 by 9:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT). The index has gained about 1% in 2021 to date, after rebounding from the almost 7% slide recorded in 2020 that extended to a two-and-a-half year low of 89.206 in early January.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.04% to 105.81. The yen was almost flat against the dollar on Thursday, after the dollar pulled back from an almost five-month high overnight.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7752 while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.07% to 7184.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.4527. Onshore trading in the yuan resumed as Chinese markets returned from a holiday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3860.
The euro was steady after dropping 0.5% overnight, the most in two weeks. Bitcoin continued its rally, hovering near a new record high of $52,640 during the previous session. However, the cryptocurrency’s surge of around 58% in February has prompted some investors to warn that the rally could be unstable.
Upbeat U.S. data released on Tuesday gave the greenback a boost. Core retail sales grew 5.9% month-on-month in January, compared to the 1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 1.8% fall recorded in December. The Producer Price Index grew 1.3% month-on-month in January, higher than the forecast 0.4% growth and December’s 0.3% growth. Retail sales grew 5.3% month-on-month in January, against the forecast 1.1% growth and December’s 1% fall.

“Biden’s stimulus plans, a steep decline in new infections and rapid vaccine rollout leave the U.S. well positioned to recover sooner than most … that will generate periodic bouts of dollar upside,” Westpac analysts said in a note.
However, alongside other investors, the Westpac analysts expect the dollar to decline in 2021 due to the Fed’s relentless money printing. With that in mind, Westpac recommends fresh dollar index shorts on rallies toward 91.0."

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Wednesday, following a surge in U.S. bond yields on the prospects of a prompt economic recovery and a possible acceleration in inflation.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 90.757, bouncing from the three-week low of 90.117 hit on Tuesday. 
EUR/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.2074, USD/JPY was flat at 106.06, after earlier hitting a five-month high, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7746.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields made a fresh one-year high late Tuesday, rising as high as 1.333% from around 1.20% at the end of last week, and the prospect of better risk-free returns lent support to the U.S dollar. 
Central to the discussion is the likely path of inflation levels going forward, particularly given the likelihood of the Biden administration getting its way and an additional $1.9 trillion of stimulus, largely funded by borrowing, being injected into the U.S. economy.
The gap between ten-year and two-year U.S. yields also widened to the largest level in nearly three years, suggesting investors don’t expect the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates in the short-term. But for how long will they be prepared to stay accommodative if inflation climbs above the 2% level?
The minutes later on Wednesday from the U.S Federal Reserve's January meeting will be closely watched for clues as to when the central bank will move.
“U.S. CPI inflation also disappointed a touch in January, which may have soothed some inflation fears. This will however all change in a couple of months’ time,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “Indeed, we expect the current inflation breeze to strengthen into gale force winds by the second quarter, at least in terms of the market’s narrative.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3878, weighed by the support for the dollar, even as U.K. inflation accelerated in January, with consumer prices increasing 0.7% from a year earlier, slightly up from 0.6% in December, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday.
It leaves inflation well below the 2% level targeted by the Bank of England, which has cut interest rates and expanded its bond-buying program in response to the economic damage caused by pandemic."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held the upper hand against low-yielding currencies on Wednesday, hitting a five-month high against the yen as U.S. bond yields jumped on the prospects of further economic recovery and a possible acceleration in inflation.
Bitcoin traded just below the $50,000 mark, a day after the cryptocurrency hit that level for the first time, bringing its total market capitalisation to more than $900 billion, as traders bet on its further acceptance among major companies.
The dollar's index against six other major currencies jumped back from a three-week low of 90.117 hit on Tuesday to last stand at 90.665.
Soaring U.S. bond yields boosted the dollar, with the 10-year yield rising to as high as 1.333% from around 1.20% at the end of last week.
""The move up in yields has been driven by increasing inflationary concerns amid a rise in energy prices along with the prospect of a big U.S. fiscal stimulus and the global recovery entering a more solid stage as vaccine roll out lead to the reopening of economies,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
The yen, which is sensitive to U.S. yields, reacted the most with the dollar jumping to as high as 106.225 yen, its highest since September, before retreating to 105.91 yen.
""I think the dollar's downtrend is over. At the start of the year, speculators were betting on a fall in the dollar below 100 yen. They seem to have abandoned such a view now,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
A sign of dwindling bets on the dollar's fall against the yen is apparent in the options market, where short-term dollar call options, or bets on the dollar, have become more expensive than dollar puts, bets against the currency.
The one-week risk reversal spread is now in favour of dollar calls for the first time in almost five years.
""If one thinks U.S. yields will rise further, we could see more gains in the dollar,"" said Jun Arachi, senior currency strategist at Rakuten Securities.
""I would say this trade could continue until Biden Administration's stimulus package will come into effect, possibly in March, at which point people could start unwinding their bets to 'sell-on-fact'"".
Biden tried to build public support for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan in a town hall. 
The euro slipped slightly to $1.2085 though its fall was less pronounced due to its gains earlier on Tuesday following strong German economic sentiment data.
The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State manufacturing report released on Tuesday offered an upbeat economic picture, with a rise in its ""prices paid index"" stoking fear of faster inflation.
That optimism was echoed by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who told CNBC that U.S. financial conditions were ""generally good,"" and that inflation was likely to heat up this year.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, however, said pressures on inflation are still downward, pushing against critics warning low interest rates and government spending could overheat the U.S. economy and spark high inflation.
""Her comments are not resonating with market players preoccupied with inflation at this point,"" said Daiwa's Ishizuki.
The positive mood on the economic outlook is underpinning risk-sensitive currencies.
The British pound held firm at $1.3895 , having reached its highest level since April 2018 on Tuesday. Against the euro, the pound traded at its highest level since early May at 87.02 pence per euro.
The Australian dollar stood at $0.7750 , down slightly but still not far from Tuesday's one-month high of $0.7805.

The offshore Chinese yuan stepped back slightly to 6.4359 per dollar after hitting a 2-1/2-year high of 6.4010 earlier in the week.

The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 105.94 The safe-haven yen, which is sensitive to U.S. yields, showed a strong reaction by falling to a four-month low against the dollar.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7752 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7199.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4582. The offshore yuan retreated after rising to two-and-a-half year highs on Tuesday.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3891. The euro saw a slight dip, although the fall was cushioned by gains from strong German economic sentiment data. February’s German Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW) Economic Sentiment Index was 71.2, higher than the 59.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January’s 61.8 reading.
Bitcoin held firm after breaking past the $50,000 mark for the first time on Tuesday, with investors betting on a more widespread acceptance of the cryptocurrency among major companies.
The dollar rebounded from the three-week low it hit on Tuesday, as soaring U.S. bond yields also gave the U.S. currency a boost. The ten-year yield rose 1.331% from around 1.20% at the end of the previous week.
“The move up in yields has been driven by increasing inflationary concerns amid a rise in energy prices along with the prospect of a big U.S. fiscal stimulus and the global recovery entering a more solid stage as vaccine roll out lead to the reopening of economies,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
“I think the dollar’s downtrend is over. At the start of the year, speculators were betting on a fall in the dollar below 100 yen. They seem to have abandoned such a view now,” Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
The New York Federal Reserve’s Empire State manufacturing report released on Tuesday also painted an upbeat economic picture. The report showed a rise in the “prices paid index”, further stoking inflation fears.
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard added to the optimism, telling CNBC that U.S. financial conditions were “generally good,” and that inflation was likely to heat up in 2021.
However, Bullard’s colleague, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly, said that pressures on inflation are still downward, pushing against warnings that low interest rates and government spending could overheat the U.S. economy and spark high inflation.
“Her comments are not resonating with market players preoccupied with inflation at this point,” said Daiwa’s Ishizuki."

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was mired at a three-week low on Tuesday as growing optimism about the outlook of the global economy in the coming months sent investors scurrying to purchase riskier currencies including the euro, crown and the British pound.
Against a basket of its rivals, the greenback steadied at 90.229, its lowest level since Jan. 27. It has fallen nearly 1.5% over the past eight trading sessions.
""The positive outlook for the major economies continues to support financial market sentiment thanks to sharp gains in crude oil prices and optimism over better growth ahead due to the impressive roll-out of COVID vaccines,"" MUFG strategists said.
The latest U.S. dollar weakness was more noticeable as it was against a broader backdrop of rising U.S. Treasury yields, a factor that was previously supportive of the greenback. 
The buoyant mood also dragged on the safe-haven Japanese yen, which fell through its 200-day moving average against the dollar and struck multi-year lows against the euro, Aussie and Swiss franc.
Sterling, extended gains to hit $1.3946, its highest level since April 2018 as Britain leads the world in per-capita vaccination speed. The currency has gained almost 3% from early-February lows. 
""Things right now reflect greater comfort with the story of a synchronised global recovery, which is why we are seeing a weaker dollar,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim.
The euro crept 0.2% higher to $1.2150 to re-test recent resistance at that level. Rising oil prices lifted the Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown to multi-week highs. [O/R]
The Chinese yuan slipped 0.1% to 6.4132 per dollar after the Financial Times reported Beijing was exploring curbs on rare earth mineral exports in order to hurt the U.S. firms that use them.

The dollar traded near milestone lows against other currencies. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar hit a one-month high of $0.7802 and the kiwi made a five-week peak of $0.7257.

Investing.com - The dollar headed lower in early European trading Tuesday, falling to a three-week low, as traders turned to riskier currencies amid growing optimism about an economic recovery as the global vaccination program accelerates.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.347, after earlier falling to 90.210, its lowest since Jan. 27. 
EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2133, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 105.50, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7780, after hitting a one-month high of 0.7805, while the Chinese yuan dropped 0.2% to 6.4149 per dollar in the offshore market after the Financial Times reported Beijing is exploring curbs on rare earth mineral exports in order to hurt the U.S. firms that use them.
“Looking across global asset markets it seems confidence is growing in the global recovery,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The release of the minutes of the January FOMC meeting on Wednesday will be studied carefully for clues as to when the central bank will decide to remove the extreme cheap liquidity which has supported the economy since the pandemic hit.
“Our core stance is that the Fed is prepared to let the economy run hot – that’s the whole point of Average Inflation Targeting – and that the dollar should stay broadly offered,” ING added.”Indeed, we’re looking for another broad leg of the dollar decline into 2Q as vaccine rollouts broaden around the globe.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3913, after earlier hitting 1.3951, its highest level since April 2018. The currency has gained almost 3% from early-February lows, helped by the U.K.’s impressive Covid-19 vaccination program - hitting its target of 15 million people vaccinated on Sunday.
“This is probably a good reason to buy GBP since the UK will be free from restrictions earlier than the EU. Even if it is already partly a consensus story, we still find more potential in the GBP bet,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.

Investing.com – The dollar was slightly down on Tuesday morning in Asia, with the pound rising to an almost three-year high over increasing vaccine optimism. Rising oil prices and the general optimism for a global economic recovery from COVID-19 boosted currencies exposed to commodities and trade.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 90.267 by 8:31 PM ET (1:31 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 105.48.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.22% to 0.7795 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.26% to 0.7245.
The USD/CNY pair was steady at 6.4582.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.27% to 1.3941. The pound has jumped as much as 2.5% against the dollar in less than two weeks, over hopes that the U.K.’s aggressive COVID-19 vaccine rollout will enable to the country to see a swifter economic recovery than its European peers. The pound remained above the $1.39 mark that it surpassed on Monday and was holding steady at its highest level against the euro since May 2020.
Trade was thin due to holidays in both China and the U.S., however the optimism weighed on the yen. The safe-have asset dropped to a one-week low against the dollar during the previous session, while tumbling to more than two-year lows against the euro and the AUD.
“The yen has been the worst performing currency of 2021, with its negative correlation to U.S. Treasury yields proving to be the biggest dampening factor … when adding weak safe-haven demand as the global recovery gathers pace, some additional trimming of yen net long positions may be on the cards,” ING currency strategist Francesco Pesole said in a note.
The Chinese yuan strengthened past 6.4 for the first time against the dollar since mid-2018 in offshore trade, taking advantage of greenback weakness in Asia.
The dollar index was hovering near a two-week low reached last Wednesday.
“The dollar tends to underperform when you see this broad positive sentiment in markets,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
There are also inflationary pressures particularly coming from energy prices,” which is pushing up nominal yields. These are adding another weight on the yen as that can attract flows from Japan but keeping real returns on Treasuries steady, he added.
On the cryptocurrency side, Bitcoin was just below the $50,000 mark as profit taking hit the pause button on a rally that has seen a more than 60% gain in 2021 to date.
Investors also await data due later in the day, including the U.S.’ NY Empire State Manufacturing Index for February. Across the Atlantic, the data includes the German Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW) Economic Sentiment index, as well as the EU’s GDP and ZEW Economic Sentiment Index."

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held near two-week lows on Monday, as optimism about COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and a planned $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus package offered a boost to riskier currencies, stock markets and commodity prices. 
Among the gainers versus the weaker dollar, the British pound broke $1.39 for the first time in nearly three years, helped by expectations that the success of the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme could enable the economy to open up and rebound. 
The offshore-traded Chinese yuan continued its recent rise and was on the cusp of breaking above 6.39 per dollar for the first time since June 2018.
Commodity currencies strengthened too, with the South African rand touching a one-year high. The Norwegian crown and the Australian dollar reached their highest levels in three weeks against the greenback. 
Many financial markets in Asia remained closed on Monday for Lunar New Year, and U.S. stock markets were shut for Presidents Day.
The dollar index slipped 0.1%, to close to last week's low of 90.249 - a level unseen since Jan. 27. 
Analysts at MUFG said the dollar could weaken further if market optimism held. 
""We believe there is plenty yet to go in the so-called 'reflation trade' with market participants under-estimating the willingness of global policymakers to let the economy run hot and fuel stronger-than-expected global growth through the remainder of the year,"" the analysts said in a note.
Speculators maintained their short dollar positions, latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed, with net short value standing at $29.53 billion. 
The Japanese yen, viewed as a safe-haven asset, slipped 0.4% against the greenback to 105.27 yen, 
The euro edged 0.1% higher to $1.21310, extending last week's 0.6% advance.
Bitcoin remained volatile, retreating to as low as $45,914.75 a day after reaching a record high $49,714.66.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency rallied 25% last week, boosted by endorsements from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK).

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Monday, as traders walked away from this safe haven amid optimism about a vaccination-led global recovery and the prospect of more U.S. stimulus.
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.335, not far removed from last week’s low of 90.249, a level not seen since Jan. 27. 
EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.2137, the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7779, while the Chinese yuan reached its strongest level since June 2018 at 6.4009 per dollar in the offshore market.
Volumes have been light so far Monday, with many financial markets in Asia still closed for Lunar New Year and the United States also out for Presidents Day.
Additionally, USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 105.12, with the safe haven yen also suffering despite Japan reporting its gross domestic product grew an annualized 12.7% from the prior quarter in the three months through December, ahead of the 10.1% expansion expected.
Japan is expected to start its vaccination program this week, and while the virus is seen pushing the economy back into contraction this quarter, the strong performance at the end of 2020 suggests the recovery could return to a relatively solid footing reasonably promptly.
“Global growth should be very strong over the next six months as the vaccination campaigns play out,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a research note. “We expect global cyclical forces to dominate some degree of ‘U.S. outperformance’, resulting in dollar downside for most crosses.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3889, just off a near three-year high of 1.3901, as data showed the U.K. had delivered 15 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccinations.
The speedy roll out of vaccines coupled with a fall in infections have prompted investor bets the country’s economy will likely rebound stronger than expected when it eventually reopens.
U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will this week judge how quickly England can exit lockdown, but he warned that the death toll and hospital admission numbers are still too high.   
This week will see a number of key U.K. economic data releases, including inflation and retail sales, but the impact of the pandemic will still be reflected in these numbers.
Last week, data showed Britain's economy shrank 9.9% in 2020, the biggest annual fall in output since modern records began, but GDP actually grew 1.0% in the final quarter of last year, double the 0.5% growth widely expected.

Investing.com – The pound surged to more than two-year highs on Friday, and remained on track for its fifth-weekly win on growing expectations for a strong vaccine-led rebound in the economy ahead of an important week of data that will include clues on monetary policy.
GBP/USD rose 0.26%, to $1.3850, its highest level since April 2018.
The unrelenting rally in the pound comes just as the latest figures show the U.K. has rolled out more than 14 million Covid-19 vaccines across the nation and remains on track to meet the government’s 15 million target by mid-Feb. The speedy roll out of vaccines coupled with a fall in infections have prompted investor bets the economy will likely rebound stronger than expected when it eventually reopens.
On Friday, the U.K.’s coronavirus reproduction number - or R number - slipped below one to between 0.7 and 0.9 for the first time since July, easing investor fears about the impact on the economy of a prolonged lockdown.
An improving coronavirus backdrop and faster roll out of vaccines, however, are just one side of the story that has seen the pound hit multi-year highs, according to ING.
“While the bullish repricing of the pound specific outlook has been the main supporting factor of the cross [GBP/USD] over the last two to three weeks, right now GBP/USD is benefiting from the EUR/USD recovery,” ING said “Looking ahead, we expect both factors to work in favour of GBP/USD, with the cross moving towards the 1.50 level throughout the year.”
EUR/USD was flat at $1.2121 on Friday.
Looking ahead, the impact of the pandemic will still be reflected in the upcoming round of U.K. economic data, including inflation and retail sales data due next week, expert said.
“The UK data highlights of the coming week will be the latest inflation figures on Wednesday and official retail sales figures on Friday. The intensification of the pandemic and tightening of containment measures at the start of the year might be expected to add some downwards pressure to inflation,” Daiwa Capital Markets said. “A reweighting of the components in the inflation basket might also have an impact, as could recent sterling strengthening,” it added.
Retail sales data due Friday, meanwhile, comes as England remains in its third lockdown. Excluding fuel, retail sales are forecast to fall 1% on the month in January, though leaving them 4.7% higher compared to their pre-pandemic level.
On the monetary policy front, meanwhile, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ramsden will be speaking on Wednesday about the BoE's QE policy. “The comments might be of interest in light of the MPC's decision this month to review it's current tightening strategy, whereby the BoE would not reduce its asset holdings until Bank Rate had risen to 1.5%,” Daiwa Capital Markets added.",,,,,

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Friday, but still heading for its first weekly loss in three as doubts emerge about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.487, but still on track to fall 0.6% this week.
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 104.88, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2125, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7746.
The weekly initial jobless claims data came in weaker-than-expected on Thursday, adding to last week’s nonfarm payrolls number that suggested that the recovery in the jobs market in the U.S. would be a prolonged affair.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitted as much on Wednesday, when he stated that the central bank would have to remain patient with its accommodative monetary policy stance.
This has all created concerns that the dollar's previous rally had priced in too fast a pace of rebound for the U.S. economy.
“Any shift in the policy stance (to a hawkish, less accommodative side) is not imminent, U.S. front-end rates are to remain anchored, the U.S. curve is set to steepen further and real rates are to remain deeply negative,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3786, after the release of data showing Britain's economy shrank 9.9% in 2020. This was the biggest annual fall in output since modern records began as the coronavirus ravaged its services-dominated economy.
That said, Britain's gross domestic product grew 1.0% in the final quarter of last year, double the 0.5% growth widely expected. 
This release makes it unlikely that Britain will fall into recession, as although the economy is set to shrink sharply in early 2021 due to the effects of the current lockdown, it is expected to rebound in the second quarter as the ongoing vaccination program prompts a return to something like normalcy.
Additionally, USD/RUB rose 0.4% to 73.9209, with the Bank of Russia widely expected to hold its key rate unchanged at 4.25% later Friday.
That said, the International Monetary Fund said in a report this week that Russia should cut interest rates by as much as 50 basis points in the coming months to prevent inflation falling below the central bank’s 4% target later in the year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its first losing week in three as new signs of weakness in the U.S. jobs market dented investor expectations about the pace of economic recovery from the pandemic.
Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $49,000 on Friday after BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) became the latest firm to embrace cryptocurrencies, saying it will form a new unit to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets.
""With names like BONY getting in, it’s going to lay the groundwork for even more mainstream adoption of bitcoin,"" said Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas at crypto finance service provider Amber Group.
""Medium term, the momentum is very strong and the market is going to want to test $50,000.""
The dollar remained on the back foot on Friday in Asia, pinned near two-week lows, after the release of weaker-than-expected weekly U.S. jobless claims data the previous day.
That added to recent concerns that the dollar's previous rally had priced in too fast a pace of rebound for the U.S. economy.
The dollar index edged up less than 0.1% to 90.49 in holiday-thinned trade due to the Lunar New Year, and was on track to fall 0.6% for the week.
There has been a divergence in views among traders this year over just how U.S. President Joe Biden's planned $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package will affect the dollar.
Some see it as bolstering the currency as it should speed a U.S. recovery relative to other countries, while others reckoned it would feed a global reflation narrative that should lift riskier assets at the dollar's expense.
""The U.S. economy will outperform most thanks to fiscal stimulus and faster vaccine deployment, but ongoing reflationary fiscal and monetary policy will leave DXY on a sustained medium term bear trend,"" Westpac strategists wrote of the dollar index in a client note.
The euro slipped less than 0.1% to $1.2122, consolidating for a third day near that level as it headed for a 0.6% weekly advance.
The dollar was mostly flat at 104.795 yen, down 0.5% from the end of last week.
Bitcoin last traded 1.7% weaker at $47,170 after trading at a record high of exactly $49,000.00 on Bitstamp.
The world's most popular cryptocurrency is on course for a nearly 22% weekly advance, its biggest since the period ended Jan. 3.

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trading Thursday, continuing to trade around two-week lows, after Fed chief Jerome Powell emphasised the need to keep monetary policy accommodative for some time.
At 3:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 90.406, after earlier falling as low as 90.249, a two-week low, on Wednesday. 
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 104.66, EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2129, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7741.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, while he spoke at the Economic Club of New York, a ""patiently accommodative monetary policy stance"" is important to boost the labor market and the overall economy following a stall in recent months.
There have been notable names in recent days, including Larry Summers and Oliver Blanchard, who have started to warn against the risk of overheating the U.S. economy, largely as a result of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.
However, Powell reiterated that a strong labor market would not solely be a trigger to tighten monetary policy as full employment, part of the Fed's dual mandate, was unlikely to cause an unwanted increase in inflation.
The view of a prolonged lax monetary stance was also boosted by the release Wednesday of disappointing U.S. inflation data, with core CPI flat on the month in January, growing just 1.4% on the year. 
The main U.S. economic release Thursday will be the weekly iinitial claims data, with traders looking for the labor market to continue to recover after the setback in December as the second surge of the pandemic caused more businesses to shut down.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3831, climbing towards a three-year high, boosted by diminishing expectations for negative interest rates in the U.K. as the country’s vaccination program continues to proceed relatively smoothly.
Still, there could be trouble for sterling ahead as tensions between the EU and the U.K, start to rise again over the part of the Brexit deal covering Northern Ireland.
Late Wednesday, the European Union rebuffed the U.K.’s call to reset the two sides’ relationship, after Britain had requested to delay the implementation of border checks on some goods entering the province. 
This follows a row in late January when the commission briefly threatened to trigger an emergency clause in the Brexit divorce deal to curb vaccine exports to Northern Ireland.
Also on Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey accused the EU in a keynote speech of double standards in withholding ""equivalent"" regulatory status for the U.K.'s financial services, something that has seen an abrupt shift of business away from London to the continent since the start of the year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia but continued to hover near two-week lows. Weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation and a promise from the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low continued to raise investor expectations of meagre returns from the U.S. currency.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 90.415 by 9:53 AM ET (2:53 AM GMT). The index dropped to a two-week low of 90.249 after the release of the U.S. inflation data.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.03% to 104.60.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7723, with the AUD just below the two-week high against the dollar touched during the previous session. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7209.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.37% to 6.4582.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3834. The pound was also boosted by diminishing expectations for negative interest rates in the U.K. and climbed towards a nearly three-year high.
In Asia, moves were slight in Japan and China, with both markets closed for holidays.
U.S. inflation data released on Wednesday showed that the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) was flat month-on-month, against the predicted 0.2% growth and the 0.1% growth recorded in December.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also noted that unemployment was still high, and re-iterated that the central bank’s new policy framework could accommodate annual inflation above 2% for some time before hiking rates, in his speech on Wednesday.
“In other words, easy policy is going to stay there for a long, long time, and that should be negative for the U.S. dollar,” Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
“I think it’ll be something that sits in the background, as just a reminder that the U.S. dollar can’t go up while it’s got that easy policy relative to everybody else,” Speizer added.
Inflation remains a concern, with predictions that pent-up demand and a low-base effect from 2020’s shocks will drive jumps in headline figures by spring. Such a scenario could test the Fed’s resolve.
Investors looked to New Zealand, where COVID-19 is firmly under control, but surging housing prices have pushed inflation above expectations. Investors have pared back further rate cut expectations in response.
“The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) arguably face quite a different communication challenge (to the Fed), with the demand pulse in New Zealand in a much better position than anyone dared hope,” ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.
“RBNZ will welcome this but continue to highlight the need for cautious patience,” the note added.
In Europe, investors await the release of the European Commission economic forecasts, due later in the day."

The dollar has seen selling against major peers as risk sentiment has been bolstered by rising optimism that monetary and fiscal support from policymakers, robust corporate earnings and the prospect that coronavirus vaccines could hasten a return to normality, particularly in the U.S. and U.K.  Central bank governors in both countries are due to speak later Wednesday, with attention focused on any possible reaction by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell to U.S. consumer inflation numbers for January, which are due at 8:30 AM ET. 
“Last Friday’s payrolls report showed that, despite a relatively small increase in payrolls of 49k, the unemployment rate continued to fall at a rapid clip, to 6.3% from 6.7% in December,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
“In the coming months, payroll gains are likely to pick up significantly, driven by recent restaurant reopenings in California and New York, and fewer capacity restrictions in other states.”
Also expected to help the economic outlook is President Joe Biden's planned $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, which now looks set to be implemented in the face of Republican opposition
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its outlook for the U.S. economy in 2021 on Tuesday, now expecting gross domestic product growth of 6.8% from 6.6% this year and 4.5% growth in 2022 from 4.3%.
The influential investment bank cited the Senate passing a budget resolution that paves the way for approval of the package.
Additionally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had administered 43,206,190 doses of Covid-19 vaccines throughout the country as of Tuesday as the vaccination program is ramped up."

“The economic outlook for the year, according to market consensus, appears to be buoyant,” CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters, pointing to the weaker dollar.
“Sentiment and positioning are key drivers of the market right now,” he added.
Hopes that monetary and fiscal support, solid corporate earnings, and the rollout of COIVD-19 vaccines have all boosted hopes for the U.S. economic recovery. The increased risk sentiment has meant declines for safe-haven assets such as the dollar.
Investors remain divided about the impact that a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden will have on the dollar.
Those arguing for a positive impact point to a speedy U.S. recovery compared to other economies boosting the greenback. Those arguing the opposite say that a recovery will drive reflation globally, which will boost riskier assets and contribute to a dollar decline.
Westpac analysts argued the latter in a note, despite the dollar’s strong start in 2021, with the previous week’s U.S. jobs data a key indicator.
“Friday’s disappointing payrolls completely flattened the USD, that data point casting doubt on the budding U.S. outperformance narrative and refocusing minds on the prospect for sustained reflationary U.S. fiscal and monetary policy,” the note added."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar traded near two-week lows as demand for safer assets ebbed on Wednesday, with traders looking ahead to an expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic this year, driven by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus.
Bitcoin consolidated around $46,500 after reaching a new high at $48,216 overnight following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s disclosure of a $1.5 billion investment in the leading cryptocurrency.
""The economic outlook for the year, according to market consensus, appears to be buoyant,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, pointing to the weaker dollar.
""Sentiment and positioning are key drivers of the market right now.""
Traditionally viewed as a safe haven, the dollar has sunk against major peers as optimism over monetary and fiscal support from policymakers, robust corporate earnings and the prospect that coronavirus vaccines could hasten a return to normality in the United States and elsewhere have bolstered risk sentiment.
The dollar index edged higher to 90.509 early in the Asian session on Wednesday, following a two-day loss that took it as low as 90.427 for the first time this month.
There has been a tug-of-war among traders over the impact on the dollar of President Joe Biden's planned $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package.
On one hand, it should speed a U.S. recovery relative to other countries, bolstering the currency; on the other, it is a major driver in a global reflation narrative that should lift riskier assets at the dollar's expense.
After a strong start to the year for the greenback, the latter view appears to be regaining sway -- with last week's U.S. jobs data providing the turning point, according to Westpac analysts.
""Friday's disappointing payrolls completely flattened the USD, that data point casting doubt on the budding U.S. outperformance narrative and refocusing minds on the prospect for sustained reflationary U.S. fiscal and monetary policy,"" they wrote in a client note on Wednesday.
""Nursing eye-catching losses, a test of 90 on the cards in coming days,"" the note said, referring to the dollar index.
The dollar added 0.1% to 104.68 yen, after dipping as low as 104.5 for the first time this month in the previous session.
The euro weakened less than 0.1% to $1.21105 following a three-day gain.

The British pound was about 0.1% lower at $1.3803 after renewing an almost three-year high at $1.382 overnight.

Invesitng.com – The pound surged to a 22-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, underpinned by surging U.K. bond yields on optimism over a strong reopening of the country following a speedy vaccine rollout.
GBP/USD rose 0.46% to $1.3802.
""Sterling has benefited from higher Gilt yields over recent sessions, following the BoE's surprisingly upbeat growth forecasts last Thursday,"" Action Economics said.
The Bank of England left its rates unchanged last week and said it projected GDP to recover rapidly toward pre-Covid levels over 2021.
For 2022, the central bank raised its growth forecast to 7.25% from a previous forecast of 6.25%.
While the U.K. rapid vaccine rollout has stoked investor hope of a rapid re-opening of the economy, officials in the U.K. have ""already warned that virus mutations could derail the vaccination progress and in the short term travel restrictions will actually be tightened further,"" Action Economics said.
The AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine, which is the main vaccine distributed in the UK, offered as little as 10% protection against the Covid variant first seen in South Africa, according to a small study conducted by researchers from the University of Texas medical branch.
The Bank of England all but ended any hope of the cutting rates below zero last week, though kept the door ajar to negative rates in order to achieve ""some of the benefits of lower rates without actually having to cross the Rubicon,"" ING said.  
The fading prospect of negative rates and the speedy vaccine rollouts, however, are widely expected to keep the pound marching ahead.",,,,,

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a one-week low on Tuesday, as a slide in U.S. Treasury yields raised doubts about the outlook for the greenback against the backdrop of a looming U.S. fiscal stimulus package.
But Bitcoin soared to a new record high, on its way toward another key milestone: $50,000. It has surged more than 1,000% since March 2020 at the beginning of pandemic and analysts said forecasts of bitcoin hitting $100,000 this year doesn't seem far-fetched after all.
Market participants pushed up the dollar recently as Democrats moved to fast-track President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. But some analysts say massive fiscal spending and continued ultra-easy Federal Reserve monetary policy will ultimately prove to be a dollar headwind.
""Investors may be registering concerns that the fiscal stimulus will boost the U.S. current account deficit and we concur that structural imbalances remain a weakness in the longer run outlook for the U.S. dollar, especially amid reduced U.S. growth and yield differentials,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief foreign exchange strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto.
U.S. benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to near March 2020 highs on Monday as investors bet on a broader reflationary theme in the financial markets. But it slipped back to 1.14%, down 5 basis points from Monday's session.
The dollar index was 0.4% lower at 90.58, after earlier hitting a one-week low.
Disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday knocked the wind out of a two-week run that had lifted the dollar to a more than two-month high of 91.60.
Osborne said dollar losses at this point were a little premature, ""especially as positioning indicators suggest that active traders continue to reduce what remains a fairly significant U.S. dollar short exposure.""

Tuesday raised familiar doubts among investors, with some traders saying fresh fiscal stimulus along with record low U.S. interest rates will weigh on the currency in the coming months.
""The reflation trade that boosted equities and caused the 30-year yield breach 2% has changed to worries that a quick spike in inflation would be detrimental to risk and also the dollar,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading, at Tempus Inc. in Washington.
BLISTERING BITCOIN
The biggest beneficiary of the weakening dollar was cryptocurrencies with bitcoin rocketing above $48,000, building on a nearly 20% surge overnight after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc announced a $1.5 billion investment in the digital asset.
The yen was another major beneficiary, with the Japanese unit rising 0.6% against the U.S. dollar to 104.69 yen.
The yen has become increasingly correlated with outright yields rather than an indicator of broad risk sentiment. A 90-day rolling correlation between yen and U.S. yields has strengthened considerably since the final quarter of 2020.
Elsewhere, the euro rose 0.4% to $1.2096 on Tuesday, up from a two-month low of $1.1952 touched Friday.
The British pound revisited its highs since May 2018. It last traded up 0.4% at $1.3787.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trading Tuesday, trading near its lowest in a week, after Elon Musk's $1.5 billion bet on Bitcoin was widely interpreted as a vote of no-confidence in a currency under pressure from loose fiscal and monetary policy.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 90.638, continuing the weakness seen after Friday’s disappointing U.S. jobs data brought an end to a two-week run that had lifted it to a more than two-month high of 91.6. 
USD/JPY traded down 0.4% at 104.77, GBP/USD was up 0.3% at 1.3779, EUR/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.2094, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7726.
Friday’s U.S. jobs report for January showed that fewer jobs were created in the economy than expected, with only 49,000 nonfarm payrolls recorded. 
This report, as well as the weekly initial claims data which showed 779,000 unemployment claims filed last week, a number only slightly lower than the previous week, prompted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to say that the U.S. is in a “deep hole” with respect to the job market with a “long way to dig out.”
Yellen was trying to sell to the public the need for President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief deal, adding that the U.S. can return to full employment in 2022 if it enacts a robust enough stimulus package.
This package is likely to pass through Congress shortly, and this massive fiscal spending coupled with continued ultra-easy Federal Reserve monetary policy looks set to drag the dollar down in the longer term.
“Although a higher minimum wage is off the table, a $1,400 stimulus check appears to be a done deal,” said Kathy Lien at BK Asset Management. “As more positive stimulus news comes in, stocks should extend their gains. The U.S. dollar, on the other hand, should suffer as more spending leads to bigger deficits.”
Additionally, the advantage for the greenback caused by Europe’s relatively slow introduction of a widespread vaccination program may not last for very much longer, as the EU has finalized a deal with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech for the supply of an additional 300 million doses of their Covid vaccine."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, hovering near its lowest level in a week as doubts began to creep in about a recent rally fueled by hopes of a faster U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 than elsewhere.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 90.868 by 8:32 PM ET (1:32 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 105.14. The dollar remained mostly flat against the yen, after climbing to 105.765 at the end of the previous week for the first time since October 2020.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.7716 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7231.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.14% to 6.4536 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3754.
The dollar index has hovered near the 91 mark after Friday’s disappointing U.S. jobs report, knocked the wind out of a two-week rally that saw the index climb up to 91.6. A faster vaccine rollout in the U.S. comparative to other areas, as well as moves to fast-track the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden, also saw investors turn to the greenback.
However, there are worries that huge fiscal spending, alongside the continuous ultra-easy Federal Reserve monetary policy, could see the dollar decline in the long term.
“The bottom line is a large stimulus is highly likely to pass soon, exacerbating the widening in the U.S. current account deficit, and weighing on the USD,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joseph Capurso said in a note.
Europe’s “lagging” vaccination program will cap the euro in the short term, but the continent should catch up by the summer, after which the single currency could rally to $1.28 for the first time since 2014, the note added.
The euro was little changed in early Asian trading on Tuesday but was up from the two-month low touched on Friday.
Meanwhile, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) said that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoins as part of a broad investment policy, and that it expected to begin accepting the digital asset as payment for its products “in the near future.” The statement sent the cryptocurrency soaring to a new record level of $47,565.86 on Tuesday, with rival cryptocurrency ethereum also reaching its own record level of $1,784.85 the day before.
“This is a turning point for how we view digital currencies … from here on, bitcoin will be genuinely considered as an asset available for selection by asset managers in their portfolios,” IG Securities foreign-exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar languished near its lowest in a week on Tuesday as investors began entertaining doubts about the scale of a recent rally driven by expectations of a faster pandemic recovery in the United States than elsewhere.
The spotlight remained on bitcoin as it reached a record above $47,000, building on a nearly 20% surge overnight that was the biggest since 2017, after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc announced a $1.5 billion investment in the digital asset.
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies has vacillated around 91 since disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday knocked the wind out of a two-week run that had lifted it to a more than two-month high of 91.6. It last traded at 90.935.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, recovering some of its losses after Friday’s disappointing jobs report raised questions about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 91.075, after falling 0.6% on Friday.
USD/JPY up 0.1% at 105.50, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3735, near a three-year high, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7676.
Friday’s U.S. jobs report for January showed that fewer jobs were created in the economy than expected, with only 49,000 non-farm payrolls recorded. 
“The disappointing U.S. jobs data may mark the end of the first phase of the dollar's recovery,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
However, “we suspect that the employment data is not a game-changer,” Chandler added. “The U.S. economy is expanding, and Japan, and especially Europe, are contracting. Moreover, one way or the other, the U.S. will be delivering significantly more fiscal stimulus.”
The prospect of a hefty fiscal stimulus from President Joe Biden’s administration rose Friday after the House of Representatives adopted the budget resolution that cleared the Senate, paving the way to pass a stimulus bill with only Democratic votes.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen added to the stimulus cheerleading, saying the U.S. can return to full employment in 2022 if it enacts a robust enough stimulus package.
EUR/USD traded largely unchanged at 1.2050, after climbing 0.7% on Friday after the weak nonfarm payrolls release. 
German industrial output stagnated in December, coming in flat on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 1.5% in the previous month as lockdowns held back Europe's largest economy. This was the first stagnation following seven consecutive months of expansions.
Another factor potentially helping the dollar going forward against the euro is the relative speed of the vaccine rollouts in the two regions.
“Some estimates see the U.S. reaching herd immunity with its vaccine plans by early August,” pointed out analysts at ING, in a research note, “while the EU may not reach that milestone until late October.”
Elsewhere, GBP/EUR held on to most of last week's gains despite weekend reports suggesting that the end of the Brexit transition phase had crippled exports to the EU. Exports were down 68% from a year earlier, according to estimates by the Road Haulage Association, an industry group that has been hit badly by the increased bureaucracy involved."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against most currencies on Monday as traders awaited more data on the U.S. economy after a disappointing jobs report last week slammed the breaks on a rally in the greenback. 
The euro held gains versus the dollar but faces a test later on Monday with data that is expected to show German industrial output growth slowed at the end of last year.
Speculators have been reducing short positions in the dollar, but some analysts say better U.S. economic data and continued progress in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic will be needed for further dollar gains.
""Soft non-farm payrolls has really pulled the ladder out from under the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""Now the markets are questioning whether the dollar can rise any further. A lot depends on the coronavirus, but we also need to know when U.S. fiscal stimulus will pass.""
Against the euro, the dollar traded at $1.2042 after a 0.7% slump on Friday.
The British pound bought $1.3731, close to an almost three-year high.
The dollar was quoted at 105.49 yen, having pulled back from a three-month high reached on Friday.
The U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected in January while job losses the previous month were deeper than initially reported, data at the end of last week showed.
The release of U.S. consumer prices and consumer sentiment later this week will help determine whether a recent rise in inflation expectations and Treasury yields was justified.
Any disappointing numbers from either report could knock the dollar lower, some analysts said. Investors are also closely monitoring a U.S. debate on additional fiscal stimulus.
President Joe Biden and his Democrats are pushing ahead with $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has predicted the final relief legislation could pass Congress before March 15. 
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 91.045, after falling 0.6% on Friday.
Speculators' net bearish bets on the dollar fell to $29.95 billion for the week ended Feb. 2, compared with a net short position of $33.81 billion for the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
In the cryptocurrency market, ethereum spot prices rose 0.09% to $1,618 after the listing of ethereum futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Sunday.
Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell 0.42% to $38,693.
The onshore yuan edged up slightly to 6.4577 per dollar, but trade is likely to be subdued before week-long Chinese New Year holidays beginning Thursday.

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar held steady at $0.7675. Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar edged up to $0.7200.

LONDON (Reuters) - An unexpected dollar bounce and some indications of a broader resurgence are confounding market players who took bearish positions on the U.S. currency on a bet that it was headed for a multi-year downtrend. 
Given the volume of global investment and commercial trade flows that hinge on dollar strength or weakness, getting the exchange rate correct is one of the most crucial calls a fund manager can make. 
According to one fund manager, the dollar could be about to complete a trading pattern known as the ""Dollar Smile,"" which has in previous years preceded major U.S. economic rebounds and currency surges. 
Put forward by Stephen Jen, who runs hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital, it holds that the greenback strengthens in tough times as investors rush for safe, liquid assets. 
The currency then falls as U.S. growth flags, forcing Federal Reserve rate cuts that lead the dollar lower- the bottom of the smile - before rising again as the U.S. economy leads the global growth rebound.
Per that theory, the dollar's 40% appreciation between 2012 and February 2020 would have been the final upward stage of the smile following the troughs of 2011-2012. 
In the current cycle, Jen reckons the first two stages of the smile formation are complete: the dollar index shot to a 3-year high in March 2020, when investors sought it out amid the pandemic-linked market mayhem. 
It then declined when the Fed slashed interest rates to 0%, hitting a near three-year low last month on expectations of ultra-easy U.S. policy and additional borrowing that would blow out the balance of payments deficit.
In the past month, however, the greenback has jumped by more than 2%, as a fast vaccination campaign appears to signal that the world's biggest economy will recover more quickly from the COVID-19 doldrums than most other developed nations.
""My point has been that the U.S. would come out of the pandemic very strong,"" Jen said. ""That is being demonstrated very clearly."" 
He predicts the last part of the Smile to complete when the euro falls to $1.13, a level unseen since last July. 
The euro, which comprises more than 50% of the dollar index, trades currently at $1.1985, down 3% from the January highs of near $1.2349, weighed down by a sluggish vaccine campaign; a tenth of Americans have received a dose of the two-shot vaccine, compared to 3% of European Union citizens.
The euro zone's 0.7% contraction in October-December 2020 pitched it into a double-dip recession, compared to a 1% quarter-on-quarter U.S. expansion in the same period.
Dollar bulls got more encouragement this week from St Louis Fed President James Bullard's prediction of ""very strong"" economic growth in 2021.
""The growth gap between the U.S. and the Eurozone is likely to widen further,"" said Stefanie Holtze-Jen, chief currency strategist at DWS, predicting the euro to hit $1.15 by year-end.
LESSONS FROM PAST SMILES
Bearing all that in mind, dollar bears could look at past smile episodes. The last one began in 2008, when investors sought the greenback's safety during the financial meltdown.
It weakened as normality returned, before appreciating from 2012 as the U.S. economy recovered, China slowed and the eurozone fell into a debt crisis.
Another smile episode dates to the late 1990s, when the emerging market crisis boosted the dollar index more than 20%.
So far, the dollar's mini-rally has not shaken out the bears. Net futures market bets on a dollar fall grew last week to $34 billion, their highest level since 2011, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission positions data. 
""Long"" dollar positions peaked last March at $22 billion. 
Betting against the dollar ranked third in the ""most crowded"" trades list, according to fund managers polled by BofA Global Research in January.
But the ranks of dollar bulls may be growing.
Analysts at Nordea said their Dollar-o-Meter, which gauges the greenback's direction using relative growth and inflation, central banking policies and politics, points to more gains for the dollar.

""The dollar is at risk of wrong-footing the consensus once more, and strengthen rather than weaken in 2021,"" they told clients.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its best weekly gain in three months on Friday, lifted by growing confidence that the U.S. economic recovery will outpace its global peers.
The dollar index touched a two-month high in Asian trade amid signs of resilience in the labour market, with closely watched U.S. nonfarm payroll figures due later. It retreated in early London deals.
The dollar greenback also renewed highs versus the euro and yen during Asian trade, although both currencies recouped their losses in European trade.
""The U.S. economy is exceptionally strong relative to other countries, causing dollar short-covering,"" said Tohru Sasaki, J.P. Morgan's head of Japan market research in Tokyo, pointing to employment and manufacturing indicators as well as the pace of vaccinations.
The current bout of dollar strength could continue for ""several weeks,"" he said, but the picture is murkier thereafter as Europe and Asia catch up with immunisations and the Federal Reserve's continued ultra-easy monetary policy caps a rise in long-term U.S. yields.
The dollar index touched 91.60 for the first time since Dec. 1, before drifting back lower to 91.375 by 0853 GMT.
The gauge has risen every day this week and is on track for a 1.1% weekly advance, the most since Nov. 1 and building on a 0.3% rise the previous week.

The dollar has been supported by a rise in longer-term U.S. Treasury yields, which came as traders positioned for massive fiscal spending.
Democrats in the U.S. Senate were poised for a marathon voting session aimed at overriding Republican opposition to President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief proposal.
Strategists at ING said a softening correlation of the dollar with equity markets was noticeable, though it was hard to account for. They noted that while U.S. Treasury yields have picked up in the past week, they have been matched by an equivalent rise in German bunds.
""And certainly, the US vaccination roll-out looks far more impressive than that in Europe, though year-to-date gains in the US S&P 500 (+3.08%) only marginally outpace those of the Eurostoxx 50 (+2.52%),"" they said.
""Heavy short dollar positioning probably plays a big role here and would again seem vulnerable were any part of today’s non-farm payrolls jobs data to be greeted positively.""
Analysts and investors are weighing whether dollar strength this year is a temporary position adjustment after a 7% drop for the dollar index in 2020, or a longer-lasting shift away from dollar pessimism.
There are potentially a lot of dollar shorts to cover, particularly against the yen, where hedge funds had racked up their biggest bearish bets since 2016.
The dollar was 0.2% lower at 105.36 yen on Friday after earlier edging as high as 105.70 for the first time since Oct. 20.
The euro was 0.2% higher at $1.1981 after dipping to $1.1952, a level not seen since Dec. 1.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is expected to rally further over the coming year as a global economic recovery takes hold, and the gains could accelerate if investors perceive the Bank of Canada is preparing to reduce monetary stimulus, strategists say.
The median forecast of nearly 40 analysts in a Reuters poll was for the loonie to strengthen 1% to 1.27 per U.S. dollar, or 78.74 U.S. cents, in three months, matching the forecast in January's poll. It is then expected to gain to 1.25 in one year.
""Global reflation and commodity price support are very likely this year and hence CAD direction is clear – the pace is the only debate,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research, global markets EMEA and international securities, at MUFG Bank.
Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil, which has climbed about 17% since the start of January. It reached a one-year high on Friday above $56 a barrel as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies decided to stick to output cuts. 
Economists in a Reuters poll forecast last month that global growth would rise 5.3% this year after shrinking 3.9% in 2020, helped by COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs and accommodative monetary policies.
The Bank of Canada has indicated it will hold its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.25% until 2023, but money markets have been pricing in the chance of an earlier increase.
""I don't see rates moving higher this year but (BoC) communications could fuel expectations that help provide more support for CAD than we currently assume,"" Halpenny said.
Strategists say the central bank could reduce the pace of its quantitative-easing purchases in the coming months. It owns nearly 40% of government bonds outstanding, up from 14% at the beginning of last year. 
Analysts at Monex Europe and Monex Canada, including Simon Harvey, expect a ""sustained rally"" for the loonie, which has strengthened about 13% since last March as the U.S. dollar declined.[EUR/POLL]
Still, there are risks to the outlook, the analysts say in a note, including struggles delivering COVID-19 vaccines and a U.S. effort to ensure federal agencies buy American-produced goods.
Canada will succeed in inoculating its population despite ""momentary disruptions"" in the supply of vaccines and is working closely with the new U.S. administration to fight the disease, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Reuters on Thursday.
Last week, Trudeau said that Canada will seek exemptions to U.S. President Joe Biden's ""Buy American"" program. Canada sends about 75% of its exports to the United States.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Friday, consolidating after strong gains this week driven by growing confidence in the U.S. economic recovery.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.523, but heading for its best week in three months after touching 91.60 for the first time since early December.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% at 105.51, EUR/USD was flat at 1.1961, after earlier dipping to 1.1952, a level not seen since Dec. 1, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% at 0.7601.
The dollar has gained many friends of late, and the index is on track for a 1.1% weekly rise, the most since Nov. 1, after a 0.3% gain the previous week. 
This sentiment has improved on the prospect of a hefty stimulus from President Joe Biden’s administration, rising Treasury yields and the continued roll-out of vaccines, turning the greenback from a safe haven to a risk-on currency.
Also helping has been signs of an improving U.S.economy. Thursday’s data revealed that 779,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week, an improvement from the 812,000 claims reported during the previous week. 
There’s more U.S. jobs data due later Friday, in the form of the non-farm payrolls report for January, and this is expected to show a gain of 50,000 jobs after December’s fall of 140,000.
By contrast, German factory orders fell for the first time in eight months after the spread of the coronavirus forced the euro area’s biggest economy and many of its trading partners into lockdowns.
“Short term risks remain to the EUR/USD downside, given the positioning and slow pace of EZ vaccination,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3683, after the Bank of England signaled that negative interest rates are less likely. The two-year U.K. gilt yield rose to -0.02% and appears set to turn positive for the first time since May. . 
However, the central bank also pointed to a rapid rebound in growth in the second half of 2021 as the country’s vaccination program gathers steam. Government projections suggest all adults in the U.K. could be vaccinated by June. By contrast, Germany doesn't expect to reach that milestone until September.
“The latest decision from the Bank of England keeps the door open to negative rates, though only after a six-month period of industry preparation,” ING added. “But optimistic growth forecasts suggest that a foray into sub-zero rates is increasingly unlikely in the current cycle.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia but was still heading towards its best weekly gain in three months over growing confidence in the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.05% to 91.507 by 8:39 PM ET (1:39 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 105.50.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.7595, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7155.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.4691.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.3685. The Bank of England kept its February interest rate at 0.10% as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday.
The index remained close to a two-month high reached during the previous session, boosted by positive employment figures. Thursday’s data revealed that 779,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week, fewer than the 830,000 claims predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 812,000 claims reported during the previous week. Further jobs data, including non-farm payrolls, is due later in the day.
""The U.S. economy is exceptionally strong relative to other countries, causing dollar short covering,"" J.P. Morgan head of Japan market research Tohru Sasaki told Reuters, pointing to employment and manufacturing indicators as well as the pace of COVID-19 inoculations.
Although Sasaki expects the current bout of dollar strength to continue for ""several weeks,” questions remain on whether the strength will be maintained as other regions such as Europe and Asia inoculate their populations against COVID-19. The U.S. Federal Reserve also continues to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy, capping a rise in long-term U.S. yields.
Rises in longer-term U.S. Treasury yields, as expectations of massive stimulus packages from the U.S. grows, have also given the greenback a boost. Democrat lawmakers in the Senate prep for a marathon ""vote-a-rama"" session aimed at passing the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden.
Although the dollar index is set for a 1.1% weekly advance, the most since Nov. 1, some investors are analyzing whether the dollar’s strength so far in 2021 is a temporary position adjustment after the index dropped 7% in 2020, or a more long-term move away from dollar pessimism.
Also on investors’ minds is the potential multiple dollar shorts to cover. The yen particularly has seen hedge funds rack up their biggest bearish bets since 2016.
Westpac analysts forecast that Europe's vaccine rollout will accelerate by the end of the first quarter, which, in addition to the Fed's commitment to ultra-loose monetary policy, could put pressure back on the dollar.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's weakening trend is still in play, with the currency predicted to stay range-bound or fall in the next three months, according to a majority of strategists in a Reuters poll, suggesting the currency's recent strength was just a blip.
After a sell-off that began last year, the dollar rose in four of the past five weeks and was up over 1% for the year as traders reviewed heavy bets against the currency.
But all factors underpinning the dollar's strength were expected to be transient, according to the Feb. 1-4 poll of over 70 analysts. They kept their weak dollar predictions over the coming year largely unchanged from the January poll.
More than 85%, or 63 of 73 analysts responding to an additional question, expected the dollar to stay around current levels or decline over the next three months. Only 10 expected it to rise from here.
""There's a lot more downside for the dollar, and our longer-term perspective is for dollar weakness, not for dollar strength,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research and North America macro strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""The expectations investors came in with at the beginning of the year have ended up being derailed somewhat, but in this case we think temporarily."" 
Reuters Poll: U.S. dollar outlook https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/nmopaoewkpa/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20US%20dollar%20outlook.png
Reflecting that outlook, the latest positioning data showed currency speculators were still betting against the dollar, despite trimming some of their dollar shorts last week from the largest in nearly 10 years in the prior week.
When asked about dollar positioning by the end of February, just over half, or 29 of 55 analysts, said bets against the currency would either stay around current levels or increase. Twenty-four predicted a decrease in shorts. Only two expected a reversal to net long positions.
""Current net short positions are around extreme levels, making it harder to increase from here. But we also see little reason to expect a sharp reversal within the next weeks,"" said David Alexander Meier, economist at Julius Baer.
Despite a continued rally in risky assets, the dollar, which usually moves in the opposite direction of stocks, has strengthened as investors turned their focus to a widening gap between the strength of the U.S. and Europe's pandemic recoveries and vaccine rollouts.

The world's largest economy was forecast to lead on both counts, with the euro zone weeks behind the U.S. in immunizing its population.
Still, the euro, which has lost more than 1.5% for the year and was trading near nine-week lows against the dollar on Thursday, was forecast to recoup all those loses and gain over 4.0% in the next 12 months.
The euro was expected to strengthen to $1.23 in six months and to $1.25 in a year. It was changing hands around $1.20 on Thursday.
That is widely attributed to the Fed's worries about the pace of the recovery, putting even more weight behind its pledge to keep monetary policy in an ""accommodative"" stance for what may be months or even years to come. 
""The euro/dollar didn't get to $1.24 because Europe was suddenly wonderful. The euro got to $1.24 because of the Fed,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""About 90% of this (the euro move) is the U.S. side of the equation, and that's not changed. What's changed is that we went into this too fast and that is correcting.""
And it's not just against major currencies - the dollar was also forecast to weaken against emerging-market currencies in the year ahead. [EMRG/POLL]
""A lot of the exceptionalism of the dollar has to do with its scarcity. The prospect now is that there will be no scarcity of dollars and in fact there will be an abundance as far as the eye can see,"" said Standard Chartered's Englander.
""The Fed is going to be forced into this (providing dollar liquidity), because they know what will happen if they raise long-term interest rates or allow long-term rates to go back up.""

Investing.com – The dollar hit two month highs Thursday, but it's revival is nothing more than ""noise"" and will eventually fade as U.S. Treasury yields are set to run out of steam, Citi said.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.46%% to 91.53.
""Although we acknowledge the possibility of a stronger USD over a small timeframe, we remain steadfast in our belief that 2021 will be a weak year for the USD,"" Citi said in a note.
The dollar has found its footing recently rising U.S. Treasury yields as investors bet on vaccine-led recovery and pent-up demand in a post-pandemic world boosting inflation.
The 5-to-30 year Treasury curve – a gauge on the health of the economy  – widened to levels not seen since March 2016.
""CitiFX Technicals also outlines the crossroads markets find themselves at. Developments that are indicative of inflationary rather than reflationary dynamics may create additional turbulence over the short run. We could subsequently see a brief uptrend in nominal yields that may tactically embolden the greenback,"" Citi added.
But not everyone on the Street appears keen to jump on the bearish dollar bandwagon.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said return to focus on fundamentals including relative rates in FX markets will likely support the dollar through the year amid a pick-up U.S. government bond yields.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher in early European trading Thursday, helped by rising Treasury yields as pessimism over the U.S. economic outlook fades.
At 3:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 91.320, near its highest level since early December.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% at 105.22, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to $1.2008, close to a nine-week low, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% at 0.7629.
Sentiment for the dollar has improved of late, helped by the promise of additional fiscal stimulus by new U.S. President Joe Biden, his focus on making progress with coronavirus vaccinations, as well improving economic data.
Treasury yields have started to rise, with the 10-yr Treasury note’s yield up 0.9% early Thursday, on the implication of additional borrowing to fund the stimulus. 
Additionally, U.S. economic data have improved of late, with Wednesday’s ADP data showing the country’s private sector added a net 174,000 jobs in the month through mid-January, bouncing back strongly from its lockdown-related blues.
This brings the weekly initial claims data, due later Thursday, and more specifically Friday’s official employment report firmly into focus to see whether these confirm the rebound in the U.S. labor market.
“We're increasingly confident that growth in the U.S. could top 5 percent this year,” said ING analyst James Knightley, in a research note, “ which is some much needed good news for the rest of the world.”
This has put the U.S. Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary stance firmly in focus, with traders beginning to wonder when the central bank will start to tighten policy.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.4% to 1.3588 ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting that will publish findings on the feasibility of negative interest rates.
“The rapid vaccine rollout and the corresponding likelihood of a spring recovery has taken the pressure off the Bank of England to offer further stimulus,” analysts at ING added. “Policymakers will be careful not to shut the door on negative rates, but we don't expect further rate cuts this cycle.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar traded near its strongest in more than two months against the euro and the yen on Thursday as pessimism about the U.S. economic outlook receded before the release of important data on the jobs market.
The British pound held steady against the dollar and traded near an eight-month high versus the euro ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting that will publish findings on the feasibility of negative interest rates.
Sentiment for the dollar has improved recently as progress in coronavirus vaccinations, moves by U.S. President Joe Biden to pass more fiscal stimulus, and improving economic data forced some bearish investors to give up their short positions.
The dollar faces another test on Friday with the release of non-farm payrolls data, which will help confirm whether the world's largest economy has shrugged off a dip in growth toward the end of last year.
""The dollar's recovery was triggered by a rebound in yields and an increase in inflation expectations,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities.
""This is supporting the dollar, which now has more room to rise against the euro, because the euro zone looks like it is lagging behind U.S. economic growth.""
Against the euro, the dollar stood at $1.2035, close to a nine-week high.
The pound bought $1.3643, stabilising after a 0.2% decline in the previous session. Sterling traded at 88.19 pence per euro, near the strongest since May last year.
The dollar was quoted at 105.04 yen, near its highest since mid-November.
Data due on Friday is forecast to show the U.S. economy added 50,000 jobs in January, which would be a mild recovery from shedding 140,000 jobs in the previous month as a spike in coronavirus infections curbed economic activity.
Since the start of the year expectations for big fiscal stimulus under Biden's Democratic government have supported sentiment. 
The pace of vaccinations in the United States has also picked up, causing many investors to temper their pessimism.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 91.066, not far from the highest since early December.
The Bank of England is not expected to change interest rates or quantitative easing at its meeting on Thursday, but sterling will be closely watched as investors try to measure the likelihood of negative interest rates.
In the cryptocurrency market, ethereum hit a record of $1,698 ahead of the listing of ethereum futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange next week.

Investing.com – The dollar was slightly up on Thursday morning in Asia but trading close to a two-month high against both the euro and yen. Pessimism over the U.S economic recovery from COVID-19 receded ahead of the release of the U.S. payrolls report.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 91.112 by 8:52 PM ET (1:52 AM GMT), near its highest level since early December 2020.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.03% to 105.05, with the dollar near its highest level against the yen since mid-November.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.27% to 0.7638, with the riskier AUD boosted by hopes for continued U.S. stimulus. The Reserve Bank of Australia will release updated economic forecasts on Friday, which could determine the AUD’s direction. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7212.
The USD/CNY pair was flat at 6.4579.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3640, trading near an eight-month high against the euro with the Bank of England handing down its policy decision later in the day. Although the central bank is widely expected to keep both interest rates and quantitative easing steady, investors will look for clues on the likelihood of negative interest rates.
Investors’ sentiment for the dollar recently improved as COVID-19 vaccination programs continue globally, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden advances through Congress, and economic data that has slowly but surely been improving forcing some bearish investors to retreat from their short positions.
On the data front, the U.S. payrolls report for January, including non-farm payrolls, will be released on Friday. The release will be a test for the dollar’s recent rise, as the data will indicate how the U.S. economy reacted to the dip in growth seen near the end of 2020.
Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predict that 50,000 non-farm payrolls were added to the U.S. economy, against the 140,000-jobs contraction reported in December as a second wave of COVID-19 cases and the ensuing restrictive measures decreased economic activity.
“The dollar’s recovery was triggered by a rebound in yields and an increase in inflation expectations … this is supporting the dollar, which now has more room to rise against the euro, because the euro zone looks like it is lagging behind U.S. economic growth,” IG Securities senior foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters.

Investing.com – The pound eased against the dollar on Wednesday, as focus shifted to the Bank of England's meeting, with traders eagerly awaiting clues about negative interest rates.
GBP/USD fell 0.16% to $1.3643.
The Bank of England is expected to keep rates at 0.10% and its pace of monthly bond of purchases £845 billion as the speedy vaccine roll out has cooled calls on the bank to provide further support.
But the policy decision will be accompanied by the central bank's report on the potential impact of adopting negative interest rates that could move FX markets, Citi said.
""The biggest catalyst to FX movements will likely come from any hints around NIRP (negative interest rate policy). Given the mixed outlook with near term risks and optimism for the medium term, there are doubts about the MPC's conviction on the direction of monetary policy this week,"" Citi notes.
""We note vaccine optimism continues to keep the pound well supported, [and] is likely to play out as a medium term catalyst should vaccinations result in a restart of the fragile UK economy,"" the bank added.
Boris Johnson said Wednesday 10 million people had received the first dose of the vaccine, and added that details of the next phase of the vaccine deployment program will be revealed on Feb. 22.
England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said he believed that Britain was past the current peak of the virus, though cautioned that infections rates were still high.
Rising expectations for a strong than expected rebound have prompted analyst to persist with their bullish calls on the pound.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Wednesday, particularly against the euro as traders fret about the state of Europe’s pandemic recovery, particularly weighed against its U.S. equivalent.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 91.097.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2037, after dropping as low as $1.2011 overnight, its weakest level since the start of December. USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 105.06, GBP/USD fell 01% to 1.3653, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% at 0.7617.
Official GDP data out of the euro zone on Tuesday showed the gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the final quarter of 2020, for a 5.1% year-on-year decline. 
On top of this initial estimates showed the region was heading for another, probably steeper decline in the first quarter of this year given the extended lockdowns to combat the virus.
The U.S. recorded 4.0% annualized growth in the final quarter of last year, and on Tuesday Congress made the first moves towards passing President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package.
Earlier this week the Congressional Budget Office forecast the U.S. economic growth to recover ""rapidly,"" with GDP expected to return to its pre-pandemic size by mid-2021.
President Biden’s administration has made it a policy to lift the rate of vaccination for the population, with over 33 million shots already delivered. In Europe, only the U.K. can compete with that rate, with more of continental Europe struggling to organise a steady vaccine rollout. 
“The early year consensus of a broad dollar decline looks like it will be further challenged this quarter. Virus mutations, uneven vaccine roll-outs and frothy asset markets all point to a period of volatility rather than benign rally in risk assets,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also see the return to focus on fundamentals, including rising U.S. Treasury yields, will boost the world's reserve currency.
""Factor shifts lend support to our thesis that improving U.S. fundamentals will provide a tailwind to the U.S. dollar, increasing the risk of a rally as the year unfolds,"" BofA added, in a research note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4594 after economic data showed China’s services sector grew at the slowest pace in nine months in January, as an outbreak of Covid-19 cases in the country impacted consumer sentiment.
January’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index came in at 52, above the 50-mark indicating expansion, but still a fall from December’s 56.3.

Investing.com – The dollar was slightly up on Wednesday morning in Asia, trading near a two-month high against the euro as the disparity between the strength of the U.S. and Europe’s pandemic recoveries widened.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.02% to 91.043 by 11:26 PM ET (4:26 AM GMT). The index rose to a two-month high during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.04% to 105.02, after the USD rose to 105.17 overnight for the first time since Nov. 12.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.7614 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.38% to 0.7218.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.4594, after disappointing data was released in China earlier in the day. January’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index was 52, against December’s 56.3.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.3668.
The disparity was highlighted as the U.S. moves towards passing President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, while across the Atlantic lockdowns are extended and expectations of a decline in euro zone growth this quarter grow.
The dollar was little changed at $1.2038 per euro earlier in the session, after it strengthened to $1.20115 overnight for the first time since Dec. 1.
The U.S. currency’s gains also come amid a rally in global shares and improved risk sentiment, in defiance of the usual inverse relationship between the dollar and stocks.
Some investors predict declines for the dollar as the year progresses, however, as the global economy recovers from COVID-19 amid continued fiscal stimulus and ultra-easy monetary policy.
“The relative growth dynamics between Europe, which is weak, and the U.S., which is better, are favoring the USD at the moment, but it remains to be seen if this can be a longer-lasting theme,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note. He also expects the euro to weaken below $1.20 in the near-term.
A massive round of short-covering, particularly against the yen where hedge funds racked up their biggest short bets against the greenback since October 2016, also gave the dollar a boost.
Although the dollar’s rebound starting form early January is widely seen as a correction to its decline in 2020, other investors said that the new-found firmness could indicate a retreat of the bearish sentiment on the U.S. currency. The dollar index has rebounded 1.2% in 2021 after declining almost 7% in 2020.
“The bear case is facing a short-term stress test … our base case is that without short-term yield support there’s a limit to how far U.S. recovery optimism can boost the USD … global reflation and the Federal Reserve’s determined dovish stance limits upside potential beyond that,” Westpac analysts in a note."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart and the other G10 currencies on Tuesday, as oil prices climbed to a one-year high and the prospect of more U.S. economic stimulus bolstered risk appetite.
Major U.S. stock indexes climbed as Democrats in Congress prepared to take the first steps toward fast-track passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package and new cases of COVID-19 in the United States fell for a third week in a row.
New cases in Canada have also declined in recent weeks. Canada has signed its first deal to allow a foreign coronavirus vaccine to be manufactured domestically, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.
""We're seeing a broad-based rally in risk appetite today ... which is boosting the value of the loonie,"" said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners.
Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the global flow of trade and capital.
U.S. crude oil futures settled 2.3% higher at $54.76 a barrel after major crude producers showed they were reining in output roughly in line with their commitments.
The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.3% to 1.2807 per greenback, or 78.08 U.S. cents, having traded in a range of 1.2781 to 1.2869.
The only other G10 currency to gain ground against the U.S. dollar was the Swedish crown. It was up 0.1%.
""The USD is broadly stronger against the majors illustrating today's move is more about the loonie,"" Smith said.
Canada's employment report for January is due on Friday, which could help guide Bank of Canada interest rate expectations. 

Canada's 10-year yield rose 2.7 basis points to 0.910%, approaching the 10-month high it touched on Friday at 0.922%.

Investing.com – The dollar doesn’t have many supporters on the Street, but Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) believes the return to focus on fundamentals including rising U.S. Treasury yields will boost the world's reserve currency.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.17% to 91.18.
The landscape for FX has ""finally broaden to include traditional factors including relative rates,"" marking a shift from risk-appetite fueled moves seen in FX since last March amid accommodative monetary policy measures, BofA said in a note.
This factor shift will likely see fundamentals back in vogue across FX markets, and in the midst of an improving economic recovery, supporting the current uptick in U.S. government bond rates, the dollar could continue its recent grind higher.
Earlier this week the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast the U.S. economic growth to recover ""rapidly,"" with GDP expected to return to its pre-pandemic size by mid-20.
The bond market has reflected the sanguine outlook, with the U.S. 10-year yield rising above 1% while the 30-year Treasury bond topped 1.8%.
""Factor shifts lend support to our thesis that improving US fundamentals will provide a tailwind to the US dollar, increasing the risk of a rally as the year unfolds,"" BofA added.
But the greenback continues to have its detractors. 
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said this week represented a deciding week for the trend of dollar, though touted that it favored the downward trend to resume.  
""Its make or break for the Dollar this week – as the question over whether this is a base or not is likely to be resolved. Note the 2020-2021 downtrend lies at 91.01, and we are slightly biased to this holding and the market resuming its longer term down move,"" Commerzbank said."

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trading Tuesday, retreating from earlier highs as progress towards a stimulus plan helped risk sentiment.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.965, after pushing as high as 91.063 overnight for the first time since Dec. 10.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% at 105.00, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2066, rebounding after dropping 0.7% on Monday, the most since Jan. 15, following the severe drop in German retail sales for December, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% at 0.7611.
Risk sentiment received a boost late Monday as Democrats filed a $1.9 trillion budget measure in a step toward bypassing Republicans on President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief package. This move came even as a group of Republican senators visited the White House to discuss a scaled-back $618 billion alternative plan.
Also helping were indications that the turmoil in the equity markets was on the wane after retail traders ganged together to buy heavily-shorted stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) at the expense of the hedge fund industry. . 
“The whole turbulence surrounding this targeted attack on a hedge fund and its short position shivered across assets and may have ignited one of the clearest de-grossing/de-leveraging weeks in a long time,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
However, GameStop stock, which had been run up some 400%, slumped 30% on Monday and has continued to drop in premarket trading Tuesday.
“If we get a more convincing signal that this has indeed been a light positioning wash-out this week, then we are tempted to buy in to (more) risk assets again ahead of the re-opening during the spring,” added Nordea.
Additionally, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3683, with sterling receiving a boost as the U.K. steps up its coronavirus vaccinations to improve the chances of an economic rebound.
The U.K. has vaccinated over 9 million people from the Covid-19 virus, outpacing the U.S. and and Europe. This has resulted in markets reducing their bets that the Bank of England will adopt negative interest rates when it meets to discuss monetary policy on Thursday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia but was hovering near seven-week highs. The U.S. currency was a beneficiary of an overnight euro selloff after COVID-19 lockdowns in the continent led to decreased consumer spending.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.15% to 90.890 by 11:36 PM ET (4:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.03% to 104.94.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.7625, with the riskier AUD rebounding from two days of losses. The Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates unchanged at 0.10%, as widely expected, as it handed down its January policy decision earlier in the day. The NZD/USD pair was up 0.27% to 0.7175.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4603. The GBP/USD pair was up 0.21% to 1.3689, with a Bank of England policy decision due on Thursday.
The euro sank to two-and-a-half-week lows overnight in reaction to disappointing German retail sales figures. Retail sales contracted 9.6% month-on-month and grew 1.5% year-on-year in December, well below the respective forecast contraction of 2.6% and 5% growth. Europe is still feeling the impact of a second wave of COVID-19 cases in the continent and is also struggling with its COVID-19 vaccine rollout program.
Meanwhile, gains in Asian shares saw the index ease slightly by 0.1% after rising 0.4% overnight, even touching 91.063 for the first time since Dec. 10. The index has also stuck to a tight range in recent weeks, bouncing back from the three-year low recorded at the beginning of 2021.
The blip in the correlation came down to the euro, and market sentiment would continue to drive the dollar’s direction near-term, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joseph Capurso told Reuters.
“When people think about selling euros, invariably you get some buying of dollars, because the euro-dollar exchange rate is easily the most liquid in the world,” Capurso added.
Global sentiment remains cautious overall, with investors still digesting the previous week’s market volatility that was trigged by a retail treading frenzy in stocks such as  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) Investors are also evaluating whether the almost 7% selloff in 2020 over expectations of a global pandemic recovery amid massive fiscal spending and continued ultra-easy monetary policy, will continue in 2021.
In the U.S., investor sentiment was boosted after a “very productive” two-hour meeting on Monday between U.S. President Joe Biden and a group of ten Republican senators to discuss a downsized COVID-19 stimulus package.
However, Biden maintained that the $618 billion package proposed by the group does not go far enough to solve the COVID-19 crisis and insisted on keeping the $1.9 trillion price tag that he proposed in January. Democrat lawmakers also filed the $1.9 trillion budget measure on Monday, a step towards bypassing Republicans to get the measure passed in Congress, ahead of the meeting."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a seven-week high on Tuesday, largely benefiting from a euro selloff overnight after coronavirus lockdowns choked consumer spending in Europe's biggest economy.
The euro sank the most in 2-1/2 weeks on Monday after data showed German retail sales plunged by more than forecast in December, with the continent still struggling with vaccine rollouts.
The dollar gained even as stocks rallied globally, bucking a recent trend for the U.S. currency to decline when risk appetite improves.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joseph Capurso said the blip in the correlation came down to the euro, and market sentiment would continue to drive the dollar's direction near-term.
""When people think about selling euros, invariably you get some buying of dollars, because the euro-dollar exchange rate is easily the most liquid in the world,"" he said.
On the whole, global markets remain wary with institutional investors trying to get to grips with the retail trading frenzy that boosted  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other so-called meme stocks in recent sessions despite no change in their fundamentals.
The dollar index eased a touch by 0.1% to 90.87 on Tuesday, amid further gains for Asian stocks. 
The gauge rose 0.4% overnight and briefly pushed as high as 91.063 for the first time since Dec. 10.
The euro edged up 0.2% to $1.20835 after dropping 0.7% on Monday, the most since Jan. 15.
The dollar index has been largely tracking a tight range recent weeks, after bouncing from a nearly three-year low of 89.206 at the start of the year.
Investors are trying to evaluate whether an almost 7% selloff in 2020 -- driven by expectations of a global pandemic recovery amid massive fiscal spending and continued ultra-easy monetary policy -- is likely to continue.
Hopes for a speedy U.S. recovery got a boost as Democrats filed a $1.9 trillion budget measure in a step toward bypassing Republicans on President Joe Biden's massive COVID relief package, even as a group of Republican senators visited the White House to discuss a $618 billion alternative plan.
The dollar pulled back 0.1% to 104.875 yen after crossing 105 overnight for the first time since mid-November.
The riskier Aussie dollar added 0.4% to 76.485 U.S. cents, rebounding from two days of losses.

The Reserve Bank of Australia decides on policy Tuesday, with no change expected.

Investing.com – The pound drifted lower against the dollar on Monday, with just days to go until the Bank of England delivers its monetary policy decision and its eagerly anticipated report on the feasibility of negative rates.
GBP/USD fell 0.16% to $1.3878.  
The Bank of England is expected to keep rates and its pace of bond purchases on hold on Thursday,  but the central bank will provide clues on whether negative rates are likely to form part of its policy tool kit.
The BoE will also release its feasibility report concerning the impact of negative rates on banks.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has previously downplayed the prospect of negative rates, citing concerns about the impact on the banking system.  
The odds of negative rates has suffered a setback recently as a Brexit deal was eventually agreed upon, easing U.K.-EU trade uncertainty, while the speedy roll out of vaccines across the U.K. has also brightened the economic outlook.
""Apart from operational challenges and the overall readiness of the financial system, it is unlikely that the BoE will believe there to be a fundamentals-based case for negative rates given a) a Brexit deal was achieved, b) the economic outlook over the monetary policy horizon should be buoyed by vaccines, and c) the BoE is likely to anticipate a powerful rebound in economic activity,""
The U.K. remains on track to reaching its goal of vaccinating 15 million of its most vulnerable people by mid-February, with over 9 million having received the vaccine already.
""As pressure on the healthcare system abates there may be room for a faster relaxation in social restrictions thereby allowing some of the worst areas of the economy and UK market to rebound – investment, employment and consumer & financial services,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a research note.
Still, the boost to the economy from the rapid vaccine deployment is unlikely to be reflected in U.K. growth until 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund.
In its latest forecast, the IMF forecast U.K. GDP would expand by 4.5% this year, down 1.4% points from the 5.9% previously estimated in October last year.
Ahead of the BoE decision, experts are calling on investors to buy sterling against the dollar. ""We are recommending a long cable trade idea. The GBP currently has strong upward momentum against both the EUR and USD. We expect the GBP's bullish momentum to extend further in the near-term,"" MUFG said."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trading Monday, with traders starting a fresh week in a cautious vein given last week’s turmoil in the equity markets.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.575.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% at 104.72, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2125, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% at 0.7659.
Wall Street’s main equity indices suffered their worst week since the end of October last week as hedge funds were forced to liquidate positions to generate funds as retail traders ganged together to buy heavily-shorted stocks, such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). 
Although some of this pressure seems to have eased early Monday, foreign exchange traders are still wary of this war erupting once more. Throw in disagreements on Capitol Hill over President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill and delays to global vaccine rollouts and foreign exchange traders are happy to remain in the dollar safe haven, and least for now.
“An unusual driver of risk appetite in the past few days has been the retail-trading-induced high volatility in some stocks and the following trading restrictions by online platform Robinhood. That surely remains one thread to follow, and might keep investors jittery for a little longer, suggesting fresh defensive dollar positions may not be unwound just yet,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Risk sentiment had been buoyed for many weeks after President Biden, in one of his first acts on taking office, proposed a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. However, this bill is struggling to make its way through Congress, and a group of 10 Republican senators sent him a letter on Sunday, urging him to consider a scaled-down proposal.
Additionally, the EU and the U.K. had a public falling out on Friday over the supply of Covid-19 vaccines to the continent, which at one point threatened to create a border between Northern Ireland, which is in the U.K., and EU member Ireland.  
The slow rollout of vaccines in the EU has weighed on the single currency of late, with EUR/USD down 0.1% at 1.2127. 
Additionally, German retail sales plunged far more than expected in December, slumping 9.6% on the month in real terms, as tightened lockdown measures choked consumer spending in Europe's largest economy"

The NZD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.7201.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.56% to 6.4610. Chinese economic data for January indicated a slowdown in the Chinese economic recovery thanks to a recent resurgence of cases in the country. The manufacturing PMI was 51.3, against the 51.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 51.9. The non-manufacturing PMI came in at 52.4, against December’s 55.7.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI, released earlier in the day, was 51.5 and the Caixin services PMI is due later in the week.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.27% to 1.3735.
In the U.S., Congressional debate over President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package continues, with a group of Republican lawmakers urging a significant reduction in the package’s price tag to $600 billion.
Investors are also calculating whether the almost 7% selloff seen in 2020 will continue into 2021. The selloff was driven by, among other things, expectations of a global recovery from COVID-19, huge fiscal stimulus packages and a continuous ultra-easy monetary policy.
On the COVID-19 front, a slower-than-expected COVID-19 vaccine rollout saw investors turn to safer assets, including the U.S. currency and capping its losses.
U.S. shares are also bracing for more volatility ahead of the first trading day of February, with some investors concerned about a potential market correction. GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other shares saw wild swings after retail investor groups organized via social media targeted hedge fund short positions during the previous week.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trading Friday, with the safe haven in demand as risk sentiment takes a hit on the back of turmoil in equity markets. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 90.690, adding on to Wednesday’s 0.6% gain. 
USD/JPY rose 0.3% at 104.50, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3708, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to $1.2102, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.3% at 0.7656.
U.S. stock futures moved sharply lower in early morning trading on Friday, with Wall Street’s main equity indices on course for their worst week since the end of October. Hedge funds have been forced to liquidate positions to generate funds after their short positions in a number of stocks ran into a wave of buying from retail traders.
This volatility in the equity markets has prompted safe-harbor demand for the U.S. currency.
Also helping the greenback was the release of some positive U.S. economic data on Thursday, with the weekly initial jobless claims falling more than expected. Fourth-quarter GDP, meanwhile, slowed sharply but stayed positive, growing at annualized rate of 4.0%. 
“The economy will likely continue struggling for the next month or two, but with vaccinations accelerating and households looking cash rich, a reopening of the economy could see growth reach multi-decade highs,” said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski, in a research note.
By contrast, the euro-zone economy is likely to shrink again in the first quarter given the stringent lockdowns while the vaccination campaign is hardly pulling up trees. 
The French economy lurched back into contraction in the final quarter of last year, shrinking 1.3% in the final three months of last year after surging 18.5% in the previous quarter, when it staged a strong rebound following a first lockdown. Austria's fell 4.3% as the start of winter tourism season fell flat. However, Spain's GDP defied expectations for a fall by growing 0.4%. 
“Our bearish dollar view for 2021 has been built firstly on the Federal Reserve keeping policy very loose and secondly on the synchronised global recovery providing attractive alternatives outside of the US. Both premises are coming into question,” added Brzeski. 
Investors are also awaiting news of U.S. President Joe Biden’s fiscal spending package, with the delay in its approval suggesting that the proposed $1.9 trillion deal will not end up being as large as expected, meaning less borrowing for the dollar to cope with.

652,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Cargill Inc and  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) are among a group of major foreign companies under probe in Taiwan for speculating on the surging local currency last year, hindering the central bank’s efforts to rein in a rampant foreign-exchange market.
Eight of Asia’s leading food traders, with the help of six overseas banks, built a combined $11 billion in their Taiwan dollar deliverable forwards positions as of the end of July, the central bank said in a statement last week. Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Co. were involved, along with Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly.
 ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. are also being investigated, according to a person familiar with the situation.
The positions were based on overseas physical grain trades deliberately transacted via their Taiwan units to speculate on the local currency, affecting market stability, the central bank said. The companies, which the central bank has not identified, had ceased the trades by the end of July last year. The central bank will announce punishments for four of the banks soon. It has already settled with two other lenders.
The monetary authority can’t sanction the grain firms but is preparing to hand over detailed information about the case to other government agencies, such as the finance ministry and the main financial regulator, to allow them to further investigate the companies.
At least some of the trades were specifically designed to profit from the rising Taiwan dollar, the people familiar said, presenting a direct challenge to the central bank as it battled to contain a rapidly rising currency in its efforts to maintain a stable financial environment for its export-dependent economy.
Taiwan’s central bank tightly regulates how much Taiwan dollars foreign companies can accrue to avoid speculation on the currency. It said the huge positions the commodity companies built up in deliverable forwards went beyond their actual business needs, according to a statement last week. None of the commodity trades behind the forward positions, nor the principle parties involved, were in Taiwan, it said.
“Speculation is typically frowned upon by the central bank as it could destabilize markets and distort pricing,” Christopher Wong, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Malayan Banking in Singapore, said in a message. “The punishment aims to send a deterrence message and the central bank can use this as a means of ‘reminding the markets’ not to be a menace.”
The central bank didn’t comment beyond its statement when contacted by Bloomberg News.

Strongest Taiwan Dollar Since ‘97 Shows Central Bank Easing Grip
The Taiwan dollar strengthened more than 6% in the 12 months leading up to July 31 last year, the biggest gain among Asian currencies. It has continued to appreciate since, triggering ongoing interventions the central bank governor Yang Chin-long insists are merely intended to “smooth” the gains to maintain financial stability. The U.S. responded by putting Taiwan back onto its watch list of potential currency manipulators in December and urging its central bank to allow the local dollar to appreciate further.
Speculators’ Playbook
The case disclosed an unusual source of profit for multinational traders, whose fortunes are traditionally built from their massive control over the physical supply chains in the vast and often opaque global market in food and raw materials.
The main point of contention is related to re-exports. Global companies move goods between different countries for various purposes -- processing, storage, distribution or delivery. Some make use of facilities in different countries as part of their trading operations.
The traders’ Taiwan units placed the orders for agricultural products or other raw materials from foreign sellers, pricing the transactions in Taiwan dollars but settling them in U.S. dollars. The traders then sold the products to buyers based overseas, pricing and settling the deal in U.S. dollars.
The companies intentionally created exposure to the Taiwan dollar during these trades, with their Taiwan-based units building up deliverable-forwards positions with their banks based on the deals, the central bank said. The commodities never entered or exited Taiwan, while payments were handled by the traders’ offices outside of Taiwan.
The eight traders piled up a combined $11 billion in transactions between July 2019 and July 2020, according to the statement. The amount was equivalent to almost 4% of Taiwan’s total imports last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, gained 0.12% to reach 90.632 by 10:15 PM ET (2:15AM GMT), as the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Yield edged up overnight.
In Asia, the USD/JPY pair advanced 0.26% to 104.48, while the USD/CNY pair also inched up 0.26% to 6.4656.
Down under, both the Aussie and New Zealand dollar lost ground to the greenback. The AUD/USD pair was down 0.35% to 0.7652, and the NZD/USD pair was also down 0.11% to 0.7160.
Despite the small gain in the morning, analysts expect the greenback will be on a downward tracjectory. “Wide expectations of that huge issuance that’s coming and the support of the Fed mean that we’re looking in the medium-term for further U.S. dollar weakness,” Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Reuters.
He added that commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar will receive support from the reversal in risk appetite.
Investors are also awaiting news of U.S. President Joe Biden’s fiscal spending package, with worries that the proposed $1.9 trillion deal will not end up being as large as expected."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar remained on the back foot on Friday as an improvement in risk appetite sapped demand for the safest assets, with investors taking cheer from U.S. economic data wasn't as bad as feared.
Wall Street also provided a lift to sentiment, as stocks rebounded after earnings season got off to a strong start and concerns eased around hedge funds selling long positions to cover shorts.
The dollar index was little changed at 90.566 early in the Asian day, after slipping 0.1% overnight. 
The gauge is still on track for a 0.4% weekly advance following safety buying at the start of the week amid concerns that President Joe Biden's fiscal spending package will not be as large as the proposed $1.9 trillion.
However, many analysts expect the dollar to return to the downward trend that saw it lose nearly 7% of its value last year, particularly with the Federal Reserve committed to ultra-easy monetary policy.
""Wide expectations of that huge issuance that's coming and the support of the Fed mean that we're looking in the medium-term for further U.S. dollar weakness,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""The flipside of the reversal in risk appetite is we're seeing good support for commodity currencies,"" like the Australian dollar, he added.
The Aussie was about flat at 76.75 U.S. cents after rising 0.2% overnight.
The euro was little changed at $1.21175 after edging higher in the previous session.
The dollar advanced 0.1% to 104.335 yen, another traditional safe haven, adding to the previous day's gains of about 0.2%.
Bitcoin continued to edge higher, trading at $33,899, after surging more than 10% on Thursday.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency has been consolidating since touching a record high of $42,000 earlier this month.

Investing.com – The pound jumped to a more than two-and-a-half year high Thursday, despite experts warning of ""excessive optimism"" in the currency amid uncertainty over the U.K. economy, which is set to suffer a further dent from an extended lockdown.
GBP/USD rose 0.39% to $1.3740 its highest since March 2018.
""We consider sterling optimism to be excessive and we see the risk of disappointed expectations. We therefore urge caution about betting on further sterling gains,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) warned.
The pound has been riding a wave of optimism for weeks after the U.K. and EU avoided a no deal Brexit, but there remains a lot of unanswered questions about the U.K. economy from Brexit and extended lockdown measures.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Wednesday that the current nationwide lockdown would be extended to by five weeks until Mar. 8 to curb the spread of the virus and allow ample time for vaccines to roll out.
""[T]here is a high degree of uncertainty as it is difficult to say how the pandemic is going to develop short-term and when and how quickly the restrictions can be eased,"" Commerzbank said. ""As a result, the economic outlook remains very uncertain.""
Brexit, meanwhile, only serves to fan the flames of uncertainty and it remains to be seen how ""badly it is affecting the British economy,"" Commerzbank added.
""Against this background further BoE rate cuts are not off the agenda yet and the meeting next week, when a new monetary policy report is also due for publication, is likely to be scrutinised for comments of this nature.""
Most experts, however, agree that while there is an outside chance of a rate cut next week. The BoE is more likely to turn to its bond-buying program to support the recovery as the central bank will want to keep its powder dry for any potential economic shocks in the months ahead.
""Even though we have another lockdown and the pandemic is dragging a bit, the economy seems to be a bit more resilient. The Bank of England will probably try and save that spare ammunition [of negative interest rates] for another shock… If there’s another shock, they won’t really have much more they can do,""  said KPMG UK’s chief economist, Yael Selfin."

Investing.com -- The dollar edged higher in early European trading Thursday, continuing the previous session’s gains with traders becoming more risk averse after hefty stock market losses.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.750, adding on to Wednesday’s 0.6% gain.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% at 104.31, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3655, not helped by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicating that the country’s current lockdown to combat the coronavirus may last until March. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.6% at 0.7613.
The main equity indices on Wall Street saw their biggest one-day percentage drops in three months during the previous session, as hedge funds liquidated positions to raise liquidity after suffering losses on short positions in other stocks, amid highly speculative retail buying.
This helped boost safe-haven demand for the U.S. currency.
Also helping was the more downbeat tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve as it concluded its first policy-setting meeting of the Biden era. The central bank signaled concern about the pace of economic recovery.
“A slightly more downbeat assessment from the Fed re-affirms the view of stable policy in coming months,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“However, if the vaccination program gains momentum and consumer spending rebounds sharply on re-opening, QE tapering will increasingly become a theme for markets.”
Attention will turn to the preliminary reading of U.S. gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), to gauge the extent of the slowdown in the world's largest economy at the end of last year.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2083, after a European Central Bank member floated the idea of interest rate cuts to curb the common currency's recent strength.
The euro’s level “is something we of course monitor very, very carefully,”  Klaas Knot, who heads the Dutch central bank, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “It’s one of the factors, not the exclusive factor, but one of the factors we take into account when arriving at our assessment of where inflation is going to go.”
Although the euro has edged lower Thursday, it gained almost 9% against the dollar last year, the biggest annual jump since 2017.

The Australian and New Zealand dollars, two currencies considered a barometer of risk appetite, also fell against their U.S. counterpart in a sign of waning market confidence.
Concerns about a short-squeeze among hedge funds, worries about corporate earnings, and delays in coronavirus vaccinations have slammed the brakes on a heady rally in global equities, which could continue to lift the dollar in the short term.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, in the wake of a sharp decline in U.S. shares during the previous session. Investors turned to the safe-harbor asset as concerns about excessive valuations remain.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.06% to 90.642 by 8:54 PM ET (1:54 AM GMT), adding to its 0.6% gains from Wednesday.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.17% to 104.27.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 0.7650 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.7151. The two riskier Antipodean currencies saw losses as decreased risk appetite saw investors trim positions in currencies with close ties to the global commodities trade. The pair’s fall against their U.S. counterpart is also a warning sign of decreased market confidence.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.4845.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 1.3681, falling for a second straight session.
U.S. stocks saw the biggest one-day percentage drop in three months during the previous session with Asian stocks mostly following the downward trend on Thursday.
The halt in global shares’ recent rally is due to concerns about a short-squeeze among hedge funds, worries about corporate earnings and delays in COVID-19 vaccinations. Worries that hedge funds were squeezed out of short positions in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and that similar companies will take profits on other assets, also dampened risk appetite.
The halt in shares’ rally could be a short-term boost for the dollar, with some investors remaining positive about the dollar’s prospects.
“Risk aversion supporting the dollar is a healthy correction after a one-way rise in risk assets,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
“The base scenario of economic acceleration in the second half of the year remains intact. The AUD will recover but the euro will struggle,” Yamamoto added.

“There is still room to cut rates, but of course that would also have to be seen in conjunction to our overall monetary stance, which is determined by a multiplicity of tools such as asset purchases, TLTROs, forward guidance, they all come into play,” Knot told Bloomberg.
In its first policy decision of 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept monetary policy steady on Wednesday, as widely expected. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the U.S. economy was a long way from full recovery, which some investors viewed as another negative factor.

Invesitng.com – The dollar held gains on Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, and continued to downplay the potential of tapering its bond purchases sooner than expected.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.55% to 90.65 to remain close to its session high of 90.88.  
The Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of 0% to 0.25% and maintained its $120 billion monthly pace of bond purchases. 
""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,"" Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said.
The Fed chief also downplayed the risk the central bank could taper sooner than expected amid expectations for a post-pandemic pick up inflation.
The Fed will likely take a ""wait and see approach"" to a potential post-pandemic rise in inflation, which he expects would prove to be ""transient,"" Powell said.
The muted reaction in the dollar to the Fed decision comes ahead of the fourth-quarter U.S. GDP slated for Thursday that could provide further direction for the world's reserve currency.
""The consensus for GDP is for a 4.1% annualized rise with the Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now suggesting a stronger 7.5% rise,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) said. ""Into 2021, Q1 growth is likely to be weak given renewed virus restrictions, but growth thereafter is expected to rebound sharply as the vaccine is rolled out and restrictions ease. ""
The dollar was also helped by a fall in EUR/USD, which has a significant weighting in the dollar basket, on reports suggested markets are under estimating the odds of the European Central Bank cutting rates below zero. 
Bloomberg cited an anonymous ECB official as saying that markets are underestimating the odds of a further cut to the -0.5% deposit rate."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday as investors turned more cautious on riskier assets amid growing worries about the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a downward revision to Germany's growth forecast weighed on the common currency.
Investors showed an aversion to riskier assets on Tuesday with stocks and Treasury yields slipping while the safe-haven U.S. dollar drew buyers.
""Today is a solid risk-off day for sure,"" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank.
""You see yields ticking lower and equity markets are dropping. There are a lot of concerns about the effectiveness of the vaccine roll out in the United States,"" Trang said.
Global coronavirus cases surpassed 100 million on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, as countries around the world struggle with new virus variants and vaccine shortfalls.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index was 0.56% higher at 90.666, its highest since January 18.
The euro was further pressured after the German government on Wednesday slashed its growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%, caused by a second coronavirus lockdown.
The euro was 0.59% lower in the day against the U.S. dollar.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar sank 0.79% to $0.7682, while the New Zealand dollar 0.83%.
Silicon Valley Bank's Trang cited the historically elevated level of bearish bets against the greenback as part of the reason for the U.S. currency's strength as investors rush to trim those wagers. 
Despite the dollar's recent rebound from multi-year lows, bearish on the U.S. currency are at a decade-high.
""Anytime you see that kind of buildup and you see a certain reversal, you will see a substantial move,"" Trang said.
Investors are also waiting for the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting later on Wednesday even though the Central bank is expected to signal no change in policy.
Sterling rose to a fresh eight-month high against the euro on Wednesday as Britain's faster COVID-19 vaccine rollout than in the European Union offered support to the pound.

At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.198.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% at 103.70, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3740, after reaching 1.3753 for the first time since May 2018 during the previous session, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.1% at 0.7736.
The Federal Reserve concludes its first policy meeting of 2021 later Wednesday, and traders will be looking to Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments as he is widely expected to renew a commitment to the current ultra-easy policy.
“We suspect the Fed will retain a cautiously optimistic tone at the press conference while seeking to downplay the prospect of any meaningful change in Fed policy anytime soon,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
That said, the bank is increasingly confident that the U.S. economy can grow 5% this year, and that’s before the prospect of the new administration’s $3 trillion energy and infrastructure plan.
“If we are right and we see a period of booming growth, elevated inflation and ongoing fiscal stimulus the Fed may feel compelled to act somewhat sooner than they are currently indicating,” ING added.
The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for 2021 global growth on Tuesday, now expecting the global economy to grow 5.5% this year, a 0.3 percentage point increase from October 2020’s forecasts.
Progress on the U.S. stimulus front is also seen as key in influencing the movement of the greenback. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats may try to pass much of the President's $1.9 trillion spending package with a majority vote, but it is not clear if they have the numbers to override Republican objections.
Economic data Wednesday centers around the durable goods release, but this week’s key data release is Thursday’s 4Q GDP report and it should confirm the slower growth story seen over the last three months. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2155, after Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned Tuesday, following a junior member of Italy’s ruling coalition quitting last week over the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis and economic recession.
“We see three options – new Conte government, national unity government and snap elections,” said ING.

The institution now expects the global economy to grow 5.5% this year, a 0.3 percentage point increase from October 2020’s forecasts, and global gross domestic product to expand by 4.2% in 2022. However, it also warned that new COVID-19 variants could pose a risk to economic recovery.
U.S. Treasury yields also declined overnight, with questions remaining as to the timing and size of a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden and increasing caution among investors.
“The stronger the world economic outlook, the weaker the U.S. dollar,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA) currency analyst Joseph Capurso told Reuters.
The questions arose after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer earlier in the week raised the possibility that Democrats could try to pass much of the package with a majority vote. However, it also remains to be seen if negotiations with their Republican colleagues will be enough to override the latter’s objections to the package’s price tag, among other aspects.

However, doubts are starting to emerge about when and to what degree the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden, to be largely financed by borrowing, will be passed by Congress as some Republican lawmakers rail against the size of the bill.
At the same time, coronavirus cases are surging and U.S. economic data has pointed to a flagging pace in the recovery.
This brings this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, the first under the Biden administration, starting later Tuesday to conclude on Wednesday, into focus. The Fed has pledged to back the economy in any way it can, and rates are likely to be held steady with further commentary about the outlook for an economic revival. 
“The big question during the spring is if [Fed Chairman] Jay Powell is willing to play ball when the potential mountain of issuance hits markets. We doubt that the Fed will increase QE to accommodate the Biden-boom, not least as inflation is about to soar,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
The economic data slate is relatively light Tuesday, but attention will start to focus on the release of the fourth quarter GDP figure later in the week, which is expected to show that the country’s economic recovery has weakened as it continues to fight surging numbers of COVID-19 cases. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2108, amid continued political uncertainty in Italy. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to resign Tuesday, hoping that President Sergio Mattarella will give him a mandate to form a new government with broader backing in parliament.
This follows a junior member of Italy’s ruling coalition, led by Conte, quitting last week over the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis and economic recession.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, after seeing small gains earlier in the session amid ever-rising numbers of global COVID-19 cases and doubts over both the size and speed of further U.S. stimulus measures. Investors were also cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, due to open later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 90.308 by 9:10 PM ET (2:10 AM GMT).
The previous session saw a rally in bonds and a breather in U.S. shares as a more cautious mood overtook the market. The move saw the index sit roughly in the middle of a range seen during the past two weeks.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 103.69.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7712, with Australian markets closed for a holiday. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7194.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.11% to 6.4715 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3672.
“Markets have come a long way on the hope that COVID-19 goes away and governments spend a lot of money,” Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
“Both of those have stalled at the moment, and so markets will stall as well ... one of those needs to break to give you direction for the next couple of weeks,” he added.
Democrat wins in the Georgia Senate runoff election at the beginning of the month gave the party control of Congress. Although the victories raised investor hopes that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden earlier in the month could have a smoother path towards being passed, all-too familiar disagreements with Republican lawmakers are already proving to be obstacles and soured risk appetite.
Positioning data revealed that bets on a continuously falling dollar, with the greenback extending a downward trend that began in March 2020, saw highs not seen in almost ten years.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is due to release a slew of economic data throughout the week, including the fourth quarter GDP. The data is expected to show that the country’s economic recovery has weakened as it continues to fight surging numbers of COVID-19 cases. The Fed, in turn, is expected to maintain the current easy policy when it hands down its policy decision on Wednesday.
“Q4 U.S. GDP is expected to show a very sharp deceleration,” ANZ analysts said in a note to clients.
“Support from the Fed and fiscal intervention is badly needed, and we expect the Fed will dismiss any suggestion of early tapering,” the note added."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar steadied on Tuesday as rising coronavirus cases and doubts over the speed and size of U.S. stimulus tempered financial markets' upbeat mood, while investors were also cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's review later in the week.
In overnight trading, bonds rallied, hard-running U.S. equity markets cooled and the cautious move into safer assets lifted the dollar index a little bit to 90.353, which is roughly in the middle of a range it has kept for the past two weeks. [US/][.N]
The euro and yen are likewise hemmed in, with the euro unable to break resistance around $1.2190 while the continent grapples with new COVID-19 infections and fresh lockdowns.
The common currency slipped slightly overnight to $1.2142 and held there in early Asia trade. The yen was steady at 103.76 per dollar, while the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars softened marginally.
""Markets have come a long way on the hope that COVID goes away and governments spend a lot of money,"" said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer.
""Both of those have stalled at the moment, and so markets will stall as well,"" he said, leaving the kiwi, for example, in ""indecision mode"" between $0.7150 and $0.7240.
""One of those needs to break to give you direction for the next couple of weeks,"" Speizer said. The kiwi was last at $0.7198 and the Australian dollar at $0.7714. Sterling was steady at $1.3670.
Investors had thought that Democrats' control of U.S. Congress, won at Senate runoff elections in early January, could smooth the passage of enormous pandemic relief spending.
Bets the U.S. dollar keeps falling, to extend a downtrend which began last March, hit an almost decade high last week, positioning data shows.
However risk appetite has waned in the meantime as familiar disagreements have emerged to so far delay passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion.
At the same time, coronavirus cases are surging and U.S. economic data has pointed to a flagging pace in the recovery, leaving investors looking for the Fed to maintain easy policy at its Wednesday meeting, while bracing for lacklustre growth figures on Thursday.

""Q4 (U.S.) GDP is expected to show a very sharp deceleration,"" ANZ analysts said in a note to clients. ""Support from the Fed and fiscal intervention is badly needed and we expect the (Fed) will dismiss any suggestion of early tapering.""

Investing.com – The dollar inched higher on Monday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which kicks off on Tuesday and is expected to result in an unchanged decision on monetary policy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.14% to $90.38.
The Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting is expected to culminate in a decision to keep rates on hold within the 0% to 0.25%. The pace of monthly bond purchases is expected to be maintained at monthly pace of $120 billion.
With the Fed widely expected to stand pat on monetary policy, investor attention will focus on the tone from the central bank concerning its economic outlook.
The economic recovery has come under pressure recently from rising infections that have forced further lockdowns but the outlook appears more sanguine over the medium-to longer-term that may likely encourage the Federal Reserve to tightened policy sooner than expected.
""If we are right and we see a period of booming growth, elevated inflation and ongoing fiscal stimulus the Fed may feel compelled to act somewhat sooner than they are currently indicating,"" ING said in a note. ""We could conceivably see the Fed start to taper at the end of this year with a rate hike likely to be on the agenda for 2023.""
In December, FOMC members indicated that the Fed would likely remain on hold through 2023.
Expectations for tightening of Fed policy alongside growing bets for a pick-up in inflation have helped boost U.S. Treasury yields. But the traditional boost to the dollar from a steepening U.S. rate curve – longer-term rates rising faster than shorter-term rates – is unlikely to occur as falling short-term rates contributes to ""lower currency hedging costs for foreigners wishing to neutralize the dollar risk of their U.S. Treasury purchases,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.
""Lower yields and flatter curves abroad is one reason we expect further rises in U.S. rates to be moderate, but a steeper U.S. curve also means cheap currency hedges for foreign investors. We believe this should keep downward pressure on the dollar."""

Investing.com - The dollar eased lower in early European trading Monday, with risk sentiment still buoyed by expected stimulus ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.085, having fallen 0.7% in the last week.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 103.71, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.3% at 0.7738.
Investors still remain hopeful the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden will be passed by Congress in the near future, despite concerns that Senate Republicans could use filibusters to frustrate a large part of it, due to concerns about its size.
The addition of this stimulus is seen boosting the U.S. economy, helping risk sentiment to the detriment of the dollar as the Federal Reserve remains in an extremely accommodative mood.
Analysts at ABN Amro have lifted their U.S. growth forecast, and now expect growth of 5.8% in 2021, from 3.2% previously. They cite three main factors for this decision: significantly more fiscal support; lighter lockdown restrictions in Q4 and Q1; and higher spending on infrastructure and renewable energy.
The Federal Reserve meets for its first policy meeting of 2021 on Tuesday, a two day affair with the policy decision to be handed down on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to maintain its commitment to accommodative monetary policy during the meeting.
“Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen is still talking about the risk of doing too little on the fiscal side and with a Fed very much focused on inclusive growth, it would seem unlikely that the Fed will want to generate any tighter financial conditions"" by raising the prospect of tapering its bond purchases, said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD only gained marginally against the weaker dollar, up 0.1% at 1.2181, amid political uncertainty in Italy with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte struggling to drum up a ruling majority in the country's parliament.
The Italian press has suggested that Conte is close to resigning to then later form a new government that can hopefully count on a wider majority. He needs a majority to push through legislation to tackle one of Europe's worst coronavirus epidemics and the economic crisis it has triggered.
Sterling showed some strength Monday, with GBP/USD gaining 0.2% to 1.3714 and EUR/GBP dropping 0.2% to 0.8880, helped by the U.K.'s relatively rapid distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.
Britain has immunized around five times as many people as a proportion of its population than the European Union, a divergence that helped drive the U.K currency to an eight-month high versus the euro in the past week.

Investing.com – The dollar was slightly down on Monday morning in Asia. However, the U.S. currency was holding ground against riskier currencies over fresh COVID-19 worries and weak European economic data, in turn stretching dollar selling positions as investors turn to safe-haven assets.
Bets against the dollar have become overcrowded, with U.S. data released on Friday showing that net dollar short positions rising to their highest levels since May 2011.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.10% to 90.118 by 11:48 PM ET (4:48 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 103.75.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.29% to 0.7738. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.32% to 0.7207, with New Zealand investigating its first domestic COVID-19 case in months.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.08% to 6.4757.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 1.3708. Data from the U.K. also showed that retail sales grew 0.3% month-on-month in December. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said on Friday that the B117 variant of COVID-19 could be 30% more deadly, adding that stricter travel curbs and continued lockdown measures while the infection rate remains “forbiddingly high” could be possible.
Data released on Friday indicated that economic activity in the European Union shrank notably in January. The manufacturing and service purchasing managers indexes came in at 54.7 and 45 respectively, while the Markit Composite purchasing managers index came in at 47.5.
Elsewhere in Europe, the euro capped gains partly due to growing political instability in Italy. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has so far failed to secure a ruling majority in parliament, receiving few replies to his appeal to centrist and unaligned upper house lawmakers to join his minority government.
The political impasse saw Italian bond yields rise, with spreads over German Bunds hitting their highest since November.
“Given Conte won a confidence vote, a dissolution of the parliament and a general election is unlikely,” SMBC Nikko Securities chief currency strategist Makoto Noji told Reuters.
However, the situation demonstrates the widespread risks of political instability from popular discontent as COVID-19 fatigue settles in.
“The stock markets’ rally during this pandemic is completely dependent on fiscal expansion and debt monetization by central banks... political instability could delay fiscal measures,” Noji added.
Across the Atlantic, investors remain hopeful that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden will be passed by Congress soon. Senators are hoping to pass the measures before the second impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump, which is due to start the week of Feb. 8.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve meets for its first policy meeting of 2021 on Tuesday, with the policy decision to be handed down on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to maintain its commitment to accommodative monetary policy during the meeting."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held ground against riskier currencies on Monday as weak economic data from Europe and fresh worries about the coronavirus supported investor demand for safe-havens, stretching greenback selling positions.
Economic activity in the euro zone shrank markedly in January as stringent lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic hit the bloc's dominant service industry hard while UK data showed British retailers struggled to recover in December.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said on Friday there was evidence a new variant of COVID-19 discovered late last year could be associated with higher mortality.
The news came as bets against the dollar have become overcrowded, analysts said, with U.S. data on Friday showing net dollar short positions swelling to the largest since May 2011.
The dollar index stood at 90.247, flat on the day but off last week's low of 90.043 set on Thursday.
The euro was also little changed at $1.2163, taking a pause after a 0.8% gain last week. The common currency is capped in part by signs of political instability in Rome.
Italian bond yields rose with spreads over German Bunds hitting their highest since November amid a political impasse for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte who has so far failed to drum up a ruling majority in Italy's parliament.
Conte appealed to centrist and unaligned upper house lawmakers outside the coalition to join his minority government's ranks but few have responded.
""Given Conte won a confidence vote, a dissolution of the parliament and a general election is unlikely,"" said Makoto Noji, chief currency strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Nonetheless, Italy's case demonstrates the widespread risks of political instability from popular discontent as communities grow weary of the pandemic.
""The stock markets' rally during this pandemic is completely dependent on fiscal expansion and debt monetisation by central banks,"" Noji said. ""Political instability could delay fiscal measures.""
In Washington, the honeymoon after Joe Biden's inauguration as President last week means investors are hopeful that at least a part of his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan will come through fairly soon.
But Biden will likely need bipartisan support to push his agenda as Democratic Party narrowly controls Congress while the second impeachment trial of former U.S. President Donald Trump expected early next month could complicate his efforts. 
Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its strong commitment to accommodative monetary policy when it holds its first policy meeting later this week.
Elsewhere, the British pound held firm at $1.3684, not far off a 2-1/2-year high of $1.3745 touched on Thursday thanks in part to Britain's lead in COVID-19 vaccinations.

The dollar traded flat at 103.80 yen.

The lira has strengthened since early December when the central bank said it would keep monetary policy tight in the new year and was prepared to hike interest rates more if necessary to lower inflation in a lasting way.
Goldman said in the note on its three-month forecast that the ""currency strength may ultimately be constrained by a necessary attempt at rebuilding (foreign exchange) reserves.""
On the six-month to 12-month lira outlook, Goldman's Tom Arnold wrote that the forecast was for 7.00 and 7.50, compared to 7.75 and 8.00 previously, reflecting ""the likelihood that the extent of lira appreciation may be limited"".

The governor said in December the central bank forecast 9.4% inflation by the end of 2021 and aimed for 5% in 2023.

Investing.com – The dollar is set to snap a two-week winning streak on Friday, but will likely find support over the next few months before resuming its trend lower, experts said.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.09% to 90.21.
The weekly slip in the dollar comes ahead of a busy week, with inflation, economic data and the Federal Reserve on the economic calendar.
The Federal Open Market Committee is likely to provide a more optimistic outlook on the economy in the wake of fiscal stimulus that it has deemed as critical to the recovery.
""A much more positive assessment of the economic outlook by the committee would likely give a boost to U.S. yields and thus also to the U.S. dollar,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
The economy meanwhile is expected to show strong growth for the fourth quarter, further fueling hopes ""for a quick recovery and support the dollar,"" the bank added.
But looking ahead, the dollar is likely to reverse course and trend lower, as its boost from rising bond yields is transitory, with upside in rates expected to be capped by a prolonged period of ultra-loose monetary policy conditions.
The 10-2 Year Treasury Yield Spread curve – the difference between the 10-year treasury rate and the 2-year treasury rate – that serves as a gauge of the health of the economy has been steepening, pointing to growing optimism over the recovery.
""Once yields have stabilized, the U.S. dollar is also likely to run out of steam. Instead, the focus is likely to turn to longer-term risks, which is why we continue to expect EUR-USD trade at higher levels by the end of the year,"" Commerzbank said."

LONDON (Reuters) - How strong is the euro really? Despite European policymakers' alarm over its run to 2-1/2-year highs against the dollar, several factors governing exchange rates imply the single currency's bout of strength is far from over. 
European Central Bank boss Christine Lagarde said on Thursday the bank was closely watching the euro, which surged 9% last year to above $1.23, its biggest annual gain in four years.. 
The currency's strength is a headache for the ECB which is struggling to somehow get inflation towards the 2% mark and saw it stay below 0% in December for the fifth straight month. 
It's a headwind for exporters too as companies in Germany's DAX index derive 70% of their sales outside Europe.
Lagarde's comments, reiterating all instruments could be adjusted to ensure inflation moves towards target, were interpreted by some as a warning -- if traders don't stop pushing the euro higher than levels that suit the central bank, interest rates could be cut, even from current -0.5% levels. 
""The ECB is joining the ranks of those central banks who – because domestic tools have largely been used up – discover the exchange rate as a monetary policy 'tool',"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) told clients.

But euro strength may in reality be overstated, and the ECB's wiggle room limited.
Indeed, a median estimate of a Reuters poll predicted the euro/dollar exchange rate to rise to $1.25 by end-year.
For a graphic on Euro during the coronavirus crisis:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjyjnxpr/Pasted%20image%201611318374606.png
Vasileios Gkionakis, head of FX strategy at Banque Lombard Odier & Cie is even more bullish with a $1.27 forecast. As to whether the euro is too strong, he points out its gains of late were primarily at the expense of the U.S. dollar. 
A wider euro index -- measuring the exchange rate against 42 trade partners' currencies and watched by the ECB -- is indeed near 10-year highs but its gains have been slowed since August as emerging market currencies and the yuan rebounded.
Euro-dollar, meanwhile, strengthened 6% in this period.
For a graphic on Overvalued?:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbelolpq/Pasted%20image%201611318001606.png
There is another euro-supportive factor -- ten-year interest rate differentials adjusted for inflation between the euro zone and the United States are currently at levels last seen in early-2014, when the euro was around $1.37.
For a graphic on EURUSD rate differentials:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmyjjrvr/EURUSD%20rate%20differentials.JPG
Higher U.S. yields could narrow or eliminate that differential but Federal Reserve officials' recent comments suggest they are in no mood to allow borrowing costs to rise even as inflation expectations rise.
And whether the ECB could actually respond with a rate cut remains debatable. 
With European banks facing growing volumes of pandemic-linked bad loans, the ECB will balk at hitting the sector with even lower interest rates.

""Put simply, the bar for more policy easing to stem currency gains is very high,"" Lombard Odier's Gkionakis said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A collision of vaccine races, early policy reversal and even currency wars could well give investors a headache this year.
Speed in ending the pandemic is clearly critical to all economies and markets. And strategists everywhere are poring over relative rates of vaccine rollouts for a lead on whose national herd reaches immunity first - with obvious implications for businesses, consumers and markets.
On available data, Israel seems far ahead with more than 30 doses per 100 people already. Britain and the United States lead the larger economies with between five and seven. Europe, China and the rest of the world lag despite plans to ratchet up distribution.
Some analysts even point to the outperformance of the shekel, sterling and even the U.S. dollar against the euro over the past couple of weeks as being partly related to the varying degrees of vaccine success to date.
But picking winners based on countries fastest to immunize populations may be a lot harder than it seems.
A series of reports from HSBC,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Citi and others this week spotlighted the complexity of the vaccination process, uncertainties around takeup, parallel infection rates and hospitalizations, quick catch-ups in rollout and differing starting points economically and in terms of restrictions.
""The tension between the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine rollouts and the rising case numbers means there is unusual uncertainty,"" wrote HSBC's Global Chief Economist Janet Henry and team this week, adding that ""until the pandemic is contained everywhere it is not completely contained anywhere.""
Deutsche Bank strategist Robin Winkler said a slow start to the process meant the threshold of 'herd immunity', where 60-70% of populations would be vaccinated, had been pushed back to the late autumn now for the major economies.
But he added a more upbeat note that restrictions will start to lift quickly by the spring once 20-25% of the most vulnerable people are reached - with the UK in line to hit that by March, the United States by April and Europe, Canada and Australia by May. ""We doubt that herd immunity is a necessary condition for economies to rebound strongly over the summer,"" he said.
BEWARE SEQUENCING
Yet the read-across to markets is less clean.
Returning business and consumption back to normal clearly hinges on lifting lockdowns quickly. But that may also allow governments to roll back extensive supports earlier too - possibly complicating the picture for stock and bond markets, which have already largely priced recovery on the back of a flood of public rescue money used to bridge gaps in activity.
And currency markets riff off a different script.
The first countries to rebound may be first to reignite inflation. Under most prevailing narratives, relatively higher inflation and inflation expectations should weaken currencies if central banks don't plan to compensate holders with higher interest rates - something few expect for up to two years in the major economies as central banks seek to embed recoveries while keeping accumulated debt piles affordable.
One of the main reasons for the overwhelmingly negative consensus on the dollar right now is an expectation that the Federal Reserve will be more successful in generating higher inflation than in the euro zone or Japan and is now committed to tolerating above-target price rises for longer.
If the Fed effectively caps interest rates and bond yields for two years while doing so, the stress on the dollar will be felt by even more negative real or inflation-adjusted bond yields.
While relative U.S.-European 10-year real rates moved back up in favour of the dollar over the past couple of weeks, steadying the greenback in the process, a quicker U.S. economic re-opening on the back of an early vaccination success and more direct fiscal stimulus would likely have the opposite effect.
On the flipside, most policymakers will not welcome sharp currency gains squashing exports into a global rebound - only to become 'losers' in the so-called currency war at a sensitive time for hobbled businesses.
To the extent the shekel's recent rebound was at least partly down to vaccine optimism, it has been quickly whacked back down by heavy Bank of Israel intervention last week.
And in Europe, successive bouts of euro/dollar strength over the past six months have been met with a barrage of verbal protests by the European Central Bank.

The message may simply be to be wary of sequencing any market bets solely on national vaccination races or supposed currency gains and keep focused on how markets trade the normalisation of the world economy at large.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in Europe Friday, but was still heading for a lower week as traders made bets on an economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.243, but has dropped 0.6% this week. 
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 103.66, GBP/USD dropped 0.4% to $1.3673, on the back of weak retail sales figures, having risen earlier to a 2-1/2 year high of $1.3745 overnight, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.5% at 0.7728.
The dollar has been caught in a tug-of-war over the last few weeks. 
Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, and traders are seeing the change in administration as increasing the chances of increased stimulus given the incoming president has already proposed a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill. 
This supported risk-on sentiment, to the detriment of the greenback, as traders were prepared to buy riskier currencies on the idea of a quicker than previously expected global economic recovery.
However, the idea of greater borrowing to fund this additional stimulus and what this could mean to inflation and the Federal Reserve’s ultra loose monetary stance resulted in rising U.S. Treasury yields, helping the dollar. 
That said, Thursday’s weekly jobless claims number fell only slightly last week, following on from the weak nonfarm payrolls figure earlier in the month. This signaled pandemic-related strains in the U.S. labor market remain, and the Federal Reserve will remain accommodative for some time.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2159,  but the pair is still up around 0.7% this week. 
The European Central Bank held interest rates unchanged on Thursday, as widely expected given it delivered a hefty easing package only in December.
“The main focus was on the comments on the currency,” said ING analyst Petr Krpata, noting that ECB President Christine Lagarde added that the central bank is ‘’very attentive’’ to foreign exchange developments.  
“While we don’t rule out further verbal interventions or even a policy reaction in response to currency strength, for this to happen the euro would have to strengthen sharply and meaningfully first.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, as investors continue to celebrate the Joe Biden administration's inauguration by turning to riskier currencies. There were also renewed bets that an economic recovery from COVID-19 could push the dollar even lower.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 90.112 by 12:07 AM ET (5:07 AM GMT).
Sentiment-driven moves have eroded the dollar’s gains since the Democrats won control of the U.S. Congress earlier in the month. The dollar had risen along with U.S. Treasury yields on expectations of more stimulus measures and government borrowing under the Joe Biden administration.
“It’s pretty hard to run away from the enduring strong negative correlation between U.S. equity performance and the U.S. dollar” as stock market sentiment spills over, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
“I think the market is far happier focusing on the potential positives of the Biden administration’s proposed fiscal plans...rather than any of the negatives … for the time being, while it seems to be onwards and upwards for stocks, it’s put the dollar back on the back foot,” he added.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 103.57.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.7744 the NZD/USD pair was down 0.25% to 0.7194.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was headed for its worst week of the year on Friday, as investors cheered in the Joe Biden administration by buying riskier currencies and refreshed bets that a pandemic recovery could push the greenback lower still.
Against the euro, the dollar is down almost 0.8% this week and it touched a week-low of $1.2173 per euro on Friday. The dollar index has fallen by the same weekly margin, and was steady at 90.075 early in the Asia session.
The euro had found some support from the European Central Bank keeping policy steady and accommodative.
Scandinavian currencies have led the charge higher, with the Norwegian crown up 1.8% for the week, helped by Norges Bank's decision to hold its policy rate steady, albeit at zero. The Swedish crown is up 1.4% for the week.
The risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies have also been gainers, with the Australian dollar up 0.8% and the kiwi climbing more than 1% over the week so far. 
Sterling rose to a 2-1/2 year high of $1.3745 overnight on hopes Britain's vaccine roll-out can usher in a rebound in growth. It held at that level on Friday, up 1% for the week.
The sentiment-driven moves have eroded gains made by the U.S dollar since the Democrats won control of the U.S. Congress earlier this month. The dollar had risen along with U.S. Treasury yields on expectations of more fiscal stimulus and government borrowing under a Biden administration.
""It's pretty hard to run away from the enduring strong negative correlation between U.S. equity performance and the U.S. dollar,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), as stock market sentiment spills over.
""I think the market is far happier focusing on the potential positives of the Biden administration's proposed fiscal plans...rather than any of the negatives,"" he said.
""For the time being, while it seems to be onwards and upwards for stocks, it's put the dollar back on the back foot.""
The dollar was steady against the Japanese yen on Friday at 103.58, but has lost 0.3% over the week.
A heavy sell-off in Bitcoin saw the cryptocurrency drop 5% in Asia trade on Friday to hit an almost three-week low of $28,800. 
Later on Friday, preliminary purchasing managers' index figures are due across Europe and the United States, and weakness is expected as fresh waves of coronavirus infection have driven new lockdowns and curtailed growth.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro ticked higher before a meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday, with the dollar declining versus major peers as plans for a massive U.S. stimulus package fuelled market optimism and sapped demand for safe-haven currencies. 
Stock markets reached record highs on Wall Street and in Asia following the inauguration of Joe Biden, amid hopes the 46th president of the United States would secure a $1.9 trillion package to prop up the COVID-19 hit economy.
The dollar index slipped 0.2% to 90.240, declining for a third day after touching a nearly one-month high of 90.956 on Monday. 
The euro gained 0.2%, reversing a similar decline from the previous session, to trade at $1.2134 about four hours before the ECB's policy announcement at 1245 GMT. 
""We don’t expect many fireworks from the European Central Bank meeting"", ING strategists said, foreseeing ""a fairly uneventful day for the euro"". 
Many analysts expect the dollar to continue its downtrend trend, which saw it lose nearly 7% in 2020 amid ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy and hopes for a post-pandemic global recovery. 
""While the idiosyncratic euro story remains unexciting (the eurozone will not outperform the U.S. economy this year and any ECB policy normalisation is a very distant story), we expect the bearish dollar dynamics to dominate"", the ING strategists said. 
The dollar also lost 0.1% at 103.505 yen on Thursday, after dipping to a two-week low of 103.33.
The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged on Thursday while revising up its economic forecast for next fiscal year.
Norway's central bank left its key policy interest rate at a record-low zero percent on Thursday, as expected, and said the economy was developing largely as anticipated.
Norges Bank has said it plans to raise rates early next year as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, which could making it the first among G10 central banks to raise the cost of borrowing.
The Aussie dollar rose 0.2% to 77.62 U.S. cents, adding to a 0.7% rally in the previous session. Australia boasted another solid rise in employment in December, data released Thursday showed.
The U.S. currency slipped against the Canadian dollar, down 0.13% to C$1.2618 after the Bank of Canada opted not to cut interest rates. 

The central bank said on Wednesday that the arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine and stronger foreign demand is brightening the economic outlook in the medium term, opting to hold its key overnight interest rate at 0.25%.

Investing.com - The dollar started the European session on the back foot Thursday, with riskier currencies in demand amid increased hopes for hefty U.S. stimulus measures as President Joe Biden moved into the White House.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.297, declining for a third day since touching a near one-month high on Monday.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 103.41, after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged earlier Thursday while revising up its economic forecast for next fiscal year.
GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.3695, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7761, after Australia reported another strong rise in employment in December.
Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, and traders are seeing the change in administration as increasing the chances of increased stimulus given the incoming president has already proposed a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill.
The dollar started the year on a firmer footing as U.S. Treasury yields rose on the back of expected greater borrowing to fund additional stimulus. However, this tone has changed with Federal Reserve members keen to point out that policy will remain ultra-loose for years to come, something that will perpetuate the U.S.'s large twin deficits. 
Later Thursday, the weekly jobless claims numbers are scheduled to be released. These are expected to show almost one million new people claiming benefits, while continuing claims are seen at 5.4 million. These figures, combined with a disappointing jobs report for December, could help convince lawmakers to pass Biden’s stimulus proposal. Housing starts and building permits numbers for December are also due.
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank holds its latest rate-setting meeting later Thursday, although changes to its monetary policy are unlikely given it delivered a hefty easing package only in December.
“With the change to policy instruments during the December meeting and what we see as a modest upside risk to the current ECB inflation forecast … the scope for a surprise, which could meaningfully affect the euro, is limited in our view,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The bank recently lifted its year-end EUR/USD forecast to 1.30, adding “we expect the bearish dollar dynamics to dominate as the USD will suffer from the mix of negative rates, a non-reacting Fed to rising inflation and the global economic recovery.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia. The U.S. currency continued its losses as increased hopes for massive U.S. stimulus measures under the newly inaugurated Joe Biden administration eroded demand for safe-haven currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.19% to 90.300 by 11:26 PM ET (4:26 AM GMT), after closing almost unchanged during the previous session.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.04% to 103.47. The dollar was mostly flat against its fellow safe-haven currency, after sliding to a two-week low overnight. The Bank of Japan kept the interest rate unchanged at 0.10% when it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day.
The AUD/USD was up 0.32% to 0.7770. Data released earlier in the day showed that Australia’s employment change in December was 50,000, in line with the forecast prepared by Investing.com and down from November’s 90,000 figure. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.52% to 7.2026.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.4605 and the GBP/USD pair gained 0.22% to 1.3683.
Riskier commodity currencies gained after Asian shares followed their U.S. counterparts to new records as Biden, who has laid out plans for a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, was sworn into on Wednesday. The new 46th U.S. president vowed to end the “uncivil war” in a deeply divided country dealing with the economic impact of COVID-19 and surging case numbers.
“Risk sentiment is quite positive right now and we expect it to remain so this year, with growth expected to rebound quite strongly,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
The Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown are likely to outperform, while European currencies lag. The greenback should also strengthen this year as the U.S. recovers faster than most other countries, he added.
The greenback slipped 0.1% against the Canadian dollar earlier in the session, declining for the third consecutive day and seeing a three-year low during the previous session. It also slid 0.2% against the Norwegian crown in another third day of declines.
The Bank of Canada held its key overnight interest rate at 0.25% on Wednesday, with the arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine and stronger foreign demand brightening the economic outlook in the medium term. Investors had been watching for the prospect of a micro rate cut of less than 25 basis points.
The European Central bank is also due to hand down its policy decision later in the day. The euro gained 0.2%, reversing losses seen during the previous session. Europe also continues to deal with a second wave of COVID-19 cases, and fears are mounting that new strains of the virus could lead to stricter lockdowns and more economic damage."

Investing.com – The euro drifted lower against the dollar Wednesday as investor attention shifted to the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday.
EUR/USD fell 0.19% to $1.2104, after hitting a session high of $1.2158.
The European Central is expected keep interest rates and the pace of bond purchases unchanged on Thursday.
The central bank eased policy measures last month, so many analysts believe there is little need to ease again even as Europe prepares for a prolonged period of Covid-19 restrictions.
""At its last meeting in December, the ECB Council decided on another comprehensive package of measures due to the second corona wave … At present, there is little to suggest that this time will be any different,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) agreed and went a step further, forecasting the ECB to keep rates on hold through year-end. ""We expect no change in policy, with rates unchanged at -50bp, and see the ECB on hold for the rest of the year following December's extension and top-up of the pandemic responses.""
With no change in policy, investor focus will zone in on the ECB's economic outlook, with some analysts warning the pandemic impact presents a risk to the central bank's current economic projections, which were published last month.
""In our opinion, however, its forecast of positive GDP growth in the current quarter appears overoptimistic while slow progress implementing vaccine programs poses a risk to the outlook for later in the year,""  Daiwa Capital Market said.
The recent strength in the euro, however, could draw some commentary from council members, according to Commerzbank.
""An important [discussion] is likely to be how the Council should react to another dynamic appreciation of the euro,"" Commerzbank said. ""After all, following the temporary appreciation of the euro to more than 1.23 dollar, some ECB council members emphasized the council's high vigilance and hinted at an interest rate cut.""

683,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden’s administration may not be targeting a drop in the U.S. currency, yet his pick for Treasury secretary has just started one.
The dollar is heading for its longest losing streak in a month as Biden is set to start his presidency on Wednesday. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen every day this week, as Janet Yellen’s testimony to the Senate invoked an enduring era of low interest rates and the need for giant spending.
That has reversed a rebound in the dollar at the start of the year, which was making many investors nervous given shorting the currency was one of the most popular trades for 2021. Markets have taken Yellen’s comments as a green light to bet against the dollar again.
“Although the Biden administration may not specifically seek a weaker dollar, further depreciation is likely,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, citing a dovish Federal Reserve, more fiscal stimulus and investors unwinding exposure to U.S. assets accumulated over the last decade. “We expect pro-cyclical currencies like the euro, commodity-producer currencies and the British pound to benefit.”
Those currencies were among the biggest gainers on Wednesday, led by the Australian dollar, with sterling touching its highest since May 2018. That resumed a trend that saw the dollar gauge slide more than 5% last year. Hedge funds already boosted net dollar short positions to the highest in nearly three years in the week to Jan. 12, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Funds that bought the dollar as it rebounded in the last couple of weeks were doing more of a rebalancing exercise rather than taking a real shift in view, according to traders in Europe.
The rush to bet against the dollar had been looking overcrowded last month at a time when  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). was touting a drop of up to 20% this year and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was bracing for a tumble of up to 10%. Contrarians see prospects for more spending and distribution of vaccines as helping to buoy U.S. growth prospects and ultimately boosting the greenback.
“It has been a tricky start to the year for Group-of-10 FX, as the favored trades have not performed,” said Stephen Innes, a strategist at Axi. “But with Yellen putting a convincing and staunch dovish footprint on markets by supporting maximum policy overdrive, it should encourage more U.S. dollar shorts on the view that monetary and fiscal policy are singing from the same hymn sheet.”

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Wednesday, with risk sentiment on the rise after comments Janet Yellen, Joe Biden's nominee for Treasury Secretary, pointed towards substantial additional fiscal spending t reflate the U.S. economy..
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.278.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 103.75, ahead of the Bank of Japan’s latest rate-setting meeting on Thursday. EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2154, GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.3670, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.6% at 0.7736.
Yellen appeared Tuesday in front of the Senate Finance Committee as part of her confirmation hearing, and the former Federal Reserve head urged Congress to “act big” on Covid-19 relief. 
She defended the need for President-elect Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion relief package to revive a flagging economy and protect itself against long-term scarring from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Opposition to the plan from Republican lawmakers over its cost given the already sizable budget deficit, but Yellen stated that its benefits will far exceed the costs over the long term.
“Further fiscal stimulus, along with a non-reactive Federal Reserve, should make front-end U.S. real rates even more negative and naturally weigh on the dollar,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Attention now turns to Joe Biden’s inauguration as U.S. President in Washington, at 12 PM ET (1700 GMT), amid a strong security presence given concerns about possible civil unrest. 
In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte won a confidence vote in the Senate late Tuesday, following on from Monday’s victory in the House, after the departure of a junior member of his coalition. However, he will continue without a solid majority in the Senate.
While this is unlikely to completely end Italian political uncertainty, it does suggest “continued limited impact on the euro and limited build-up of risk premia in the currency,” ING added. 
The European Central Bank’s latest rate-setting meeting on Thursday looms large, but changes to its monetary policy are unlikely given it delivered a hefty easing package only in December.
“The focus of Thursday’s ECB meeting will be on [President Christine] Lagarde’s comments on the future of bond purchases and the difference of opinion between hawks and doves,” said Nordea analyst Jan von Gerich.  "

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with investors digesting U.S. Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen’s big spending comments. The euro held onto its gains as a better-than-expected sentiment survey in Germany brightened the mood.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 90.365 by 9:17 PM ET (2:17 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.10% to 103.78. The safe-haven yen briefly passed the 104 mark against the dollar over the improved sentiment but fell against other major currencies earlier in the session. The Bank of Japan is also due to hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
The AUD/USD was up 0.27% to 0.7715 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7126. The risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies saw gains during Wednesday’s session, holding onto the gains made during the previous session.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.4757. The yuan held onto modest gains in offshore trade ahead of the People’s Bank of China announcing January's loan prime rate. No changes are expected in both the one-year and five-year loan prime rates.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 1.3647 The pound was supported after Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane’s prediction during a webinar on Tuesday that the U.K.’s economy could begin to recover “at the rate of knots” from the second quarter of 2021.
Meanwhile, Yellen urged Congress to “act big” on COVID- 19 relief and not worry too much about debt during her Senate confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. Her comments helped mitigate the risk-adverse tone seen earlier in the week and turned investors away from the safe-haven U.S. currency.
“The stimulatory bias of the incoming Biden administration’s economic policy is again at the center of market attention,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
“However, seesawing between expectations of reflation and current soft economic data will probably continue for a while longer,” the note added, limiting upside for currencies such as the NZD.
Yellen could be confirmed as soon as Thursday to head the Treasury, and U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden will take office later in the day. Investors are paying more attention to the blitz of policies promised, rather than the inauguration itself.
Across the Atlantic, the euro gained around 0.4% against the dollar overnight, and hovered around $1.2145 earlier in the session. The currency was boosted by both the Italian government surviving a confidence vote as well as a better-than-expected ZEW economic sentiment survey in Germany.
The index read 61.8 for January, above the 60 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 55 reading.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar nursed losses on Wednesday and the euro hung on to gains as investors' mood brightened in the wake of a better-than-expected sentiment survey in Germany and big spending talk from U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen.
Yellen's comments, urging lawmakers to ""act big"" on coronavirus relief and not worry too much about debt, helped assuage this week's risk averse tone and knocked the dollar index from a one-month high.
The euro bounced off support around $1.2050, lifting about 0.4% on the dollar overnight to hit $1.2145, following a ZEW investor sentiment survey that beat forecasts and the Italian government surviving a confidence vote.
It held near that level in Asia, and the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars edged up in morning trade to also hold modest overnight rises. The Aussie was last up 0.2% at $0.7707 and the kiwi up 0.1% to $0.7122.
""The stimulatory bias of the incoming Biden administration's economic policy is again at the centre of market attention,"" ANZ analysts said in a note to clients.

Joe Biden is inaugurated as U.S. President at noon in Washington on Wednesday (1700 GMT), though traders are more focused on his policies than the ceremony.
The safe-haven yen was sold with the improvement in sentiment and briefly eased past 104 per dollar, as well as falling against other major currencies. It last traded at 103.84 per dollar.
Sterling found support from the Bank of England's chief economist's prediction that Britain's economy begins to ""recover at a rate of knots"" in the second half of the year, and extended overnight gains slightly to $1.3649.
The Chinese yuan clung to modest gains in offshore trade at 6.4757 to the dollar ahead of a monthly interest rate fixing where traders expect no change in either one-year or five-year loan prime rates.
Later on Wednesday Malaysia's central bank meets, with a decision due at 0700 GMT. Nine of 15 economists polled by Reuters expect it will cut benchmark interest rates to historic lows.

The Bank of Canada is expected to hold rates steady when it announces policy at 1500 GMT.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The negative impact of currency fluctuations on North American company results fell sharply in 2020's third quarter, reversing an upward trend, according to data from treasury and financial management firm Kyriba released on Tuesday.
The collective exchange rate impact, including on companies in the United States, Canada and Mexico, was just $2.2 billion, compared with a $14.16 billion negative effect in the second quarter, Kyriba said in a report.
S&P 500 companies have just begun to report results from the fourth quarter of 2020.
The decline in the total currency impacts is ""a trend not usually seen and potentially due to the relative weakening of the USD"", Kyriba said in the report.
The negative impact has risen in every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019.
Kyriba said 69 North American companies reported currency impacts in the third quarter, compared with 246 in the second quarter and 267 in the first.
The U.S. dollar index was down 6.8% in 2020, its biggest yearly decline since 2017. The weakness came amid record-low interest rates, massive financial stimulus and an increasing investor appetite for risk.
But the dollar is up roughly 1% so far in 2021 - gains which have caught off guard many investors who had bet on a further decline following the dollar's weakness in 2020.
Supporting the greenback this month have been rising U.S. Treasury yields and investor caution about the strength of the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it would seek to boost the international role of the euro and build European financial infrastructure so that the EU becomes more independent of outside financial centres and the dominance of the U.S. dollar.
The initiative, which is an announcement of a long-term strategic direction rather than a action plan, follows Britain's EU departure, which took Europe's biggest financial hub -- the City of London -- outside the EU's jurisdiction.
""With the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, there is a strong need and opportunity to develop domestic market infrastructures,"" the Commission said in a paper addressed to EU governments, the EU parliament and the European Central Bank.
The EU is also still smarting from the fallout in 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions, leaving the Europeans unable to continue to trade with Iran under the terms of the accord.
EU-based securities depositories Clearstream and Euroclear were affected by the Iran decision and the EU-based SWIFT bank payment and messaging system had to disconnect Iranian banks. 
""The EU should develop measures to shield EU operators in the event a third country compels EU-based financial-market infrastructures to comply with its unilaterally adopted sanctions, or through other means that interfere with legitimate EU operations,"" the Commission said.
But the EU executive arm offered no immediate solutions, saying only it would first assess EU vulnerabilities and then ""develop tools to counteract"" them.
The Commission said that to strengthen the effectiveness of the EU's own sanctions regime, it would review how they were circumvented, including via cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, and make proposals in 2022. 
BEYOND BREXIT 
The Commission will also reach out to market participants to encourage trade in euro-denominated debt securities, commodities and other instruments, especially that the EU is to issue 750 billion euros ($910.65 billion) of joint debt to fund its post-pandemic recovery.
EU market players should cut their reliance on clearing houses, called central counterparties, outside the EU and use more the ones based in the 27-nation bloc, it said.
The EU also wants to develop euro-denominated energy indices, increase the attractiveness of euro bonds through a reform of its ""MiFID"" securities and benchmark rules. The ECB is also looking at the possibility of launching a digital euro.
The Commission, ECB and the bloc's banking and markets watchdogs will work with industry to assess ""possible technical issues"" related to shifting derivatives positions from London to the EU, the Commission paper said.
This means the EU is unlikely to grant UK financial services access to the EU beyond the temporary access it has granted for derivatives clearers to mid-2022.
When looking at company takeovers, the Commission would also check whether they make an EU company ""more prone"" to complying with sanctions from third countries, the paper said. There is also a need to cut the bloc's ""excessive reliance"" on foreign investment banks and funding in foreign currencies, it said.

Investing.com -- For emerging markets, the new year has carried on much where the old one left off: a combination of loose global monetary policy and expectations of a vigorous rebound in global growth this year are creating the strongest tailwinds for the asset class in a decade.
Pretty much wherever you look, there is a bullish story to tell and, more often than not, it is the huge twin deficits of the U.S. that are ultimately responsible. With President-elect Joe Biden and his incoming administration about to create $1.9 trillion to sustain U.S. demand and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell just as focused on ensuring that financial conditions remain easy, it is hard to see a boat that won’t be lifted by the tide of dollars rushing out of the U.S. this year.
The reflationary policies enacted by Washington have already driven the Chinese yuan up over 5% from where it was a year ago, and that improvement in China’s spending power is sending strong ripples through global markets, as its increased commodity purchases recycle a trade surplus that is back at record levels, for all of Donald Trump’s efforts to cap it over the last four years.
“China is taking advantage of yuan appreciation to buy up stocks of wheat, corn...and probably copper and iron too...at prices that look relatively OK to them,” said Charlie Robertson, an economist with Renaissance Capital via Twitter on Monday.
Nickel and copper, the two metals that are powering the change to electric mobility more than any other, are up 30% and 27% over the last 12 months, respectively. Zinc and aluminum are also up by 10% in that timeframe - not bad considering it has witnessed the sharpest economic contraction in living memory. Coffee, sugar and cocoa have also all started to perform strongly in the last two months.
“The implication is China's surge in demand for these products will end when yuan appreciation stops,” says Robertson.
From Poland and Israel to Chile and Sweden, central banks have started intervening to stop their currencies appreciating too far, too fast. Israel’s bought $21 billion last year but couldn’t stop the shekel rising some 10% from the March low. It now intends to buy $30 billion to keep the shekel down this year.
Things are slightly different in Chile, where the central bank’s announcement of a $12 billion reserve accumulation program for this year is a response to the looming challenges of a 2021 calendar full of bond repayments and political risk events, including election in November.
Chile’s Latin American neighbors suffered grievous hits to their domestic economies from the pandemic last year, and with new strains of Covid-19 still raging in some regions, they will remain dependent to a large degree on external demand to recover this year. Robin Brooks, an economist with the Washington-based Institute for International Finance, says this may make the Mexican peso a better bet this year than the Brazilian real – even though he says the real is still “too cheap.”
“This is mostly about proximity to stimulus,” he argued, pointing to the fact that after the 2009 crisis, the real recovered faster because it was China, the great commodity importer, which opened the stimulus taps the widest. “In 2020 it's the reverse: now, the U.S. is doing a huge debt stimulus, which helps Mexico.”
However, nothing underpins an emerging currency like good old-fashioned economic orthodoxy, and on this score, risk-friendly investors can hardly ignore Turkey. Last year, the country abandoned a highly inflationary policy stance, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally allowing his central bank (under new leadership) to raise interest rates sharply and ending its reliance on accounting sleights of hand to create an illusion of currency stability.
From a high of over 8.59 to the dollar at the depths of last year’s crisis, the lira has rallied to 7.45 as of this week. Although notoriously dependent on imports of vital commodities such as oil, Turkey is well positioned to benefit from the rollout of vaccines, given its status as a popular holiday destination with Europeans and Russians, while its customs union with the EU gives it good exposure to any rebound in the economy there as its 750 billion-euro recovery fund starts to be deployed."

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, with the focus turning to the testimony of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen on Capitol Hill later in the day.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.547, after edging as high as 90.94 overnight for the first time since Dec. 21, although trading was subdued with U.S. markets on holiday.
USD/JPY was up 0.4% at 104.06, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2096, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3597, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.4% at 0.7711.
Janet Yellen steps into a new role Tuesday, as a salesperson for U.S. economic policy after years of defending Federal Reserve actions. She is expected to outline the need for President-elect Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, saying the government must “act big.”
She is also expected to be asked about the incoming administration’s stance on the currency, after outgoing President Donald Trump often railed against dollar strength. 
“Our best guess would be that she would reply along the lines of believing in a strong dollar policy, but exchange rates should be best set by the market,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “We doubt the dollar needs to rally much on these remarks.”
The U.S. currency rallied nearly 2% against major peers since the start of the year, rebounding from sharp losses at the end of 2020 as U.S. Treasury yields rose in response to Biden's plan for a hefty pandemic relief package.
These gains may not last too much longer as U.S. monetary policy is likely to still stay ultra-loose for some time, with the central bank's top management playing down suggestions of 'tapering' its bond purchases before next year.
However, for now there is an abundance of risk events scheduled for the week that will ensure traders remain wary of abandoning the dollar safe haven at this point.
There are concerns about possible civil unrest at Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday, as well as during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Additionally, Thursday sees central bank meetings from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia but hovered near its highest level in nearly a month as investors expect U.S. Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen to affirm a more traditional commitment to market-set currency rates when she testifies at Capitol Hill later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 90.653 by 11:03 PM ET (4:03 AM GMT). The index was 0.1% lower at 90.690 earlier in the session after edging as high as 90.94 overnight for the first time since Dec. 21. Trading was subdued with U.S. markets closed for a holiday.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.29% to 104. The dollar was little changed against the yen and consolidated in a narrow range after reaching a one-month high of 104.40 during the previous week. The Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.42% to 0.7712 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.39% to 0.7134.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.4868, while the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3606.
Yellen will testify before the Senate Finance Committee as part of her Senate confirmation hearing, where she will likely touch on topics ranging from foreign-exchange policy to taxes.
U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden’s nominee to head the Treasury will reportedly affirm the U.S.' commitment to market-determined exchange rates and indicate that the country doesn’t seek a weaker dollar for competitive advantage and is also expected to tell the committee that the government must “act big” with its next COVID-19 relief package.
The comments are indicative of a return to a more traditional posture, with outgoing President Donald Trump often decrying dollar strength. Biden and his administration will be sworn in on Wednesday.
The U.S. currency opened 2021 with a near 2% rally against major peers as U.S. Treasury yields climbed after Biden proposed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package during the previous week. Expectations of ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy and hopes for a post-COVID-19 economic recovery globally saw the dollar shed nearly 7% in 2020.
Losses have also been capped by the recent unwinding of bearish bets, with data showing that hedge funds piled up the biggest net short position since May 2011 in the week ended Jan. 12. The large positions indicate that traders are more likely to reduce their positions than add to their already big bets.
However, some investors still expect the currency to eventually resume its decline during 2021.
An improving economic outlook under increased fiscal spending and accelerated vaccinations, along with ultra-easy monetary policy, will hamper any attempt for a more sustained rally, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Kim Mundy said in a note.
“Further USD upside this week will be contained,” the note added.
The euro rose 0.1% to $1.20855, climbing back up after falling to 1.2054 for the first time since Dec. 2 on Monday."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered around its highest in nearly one month on Tuesday with traders expecting U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen to affirm a more traditional commitment to market-set currency rates when she testifies at Capitol Hill later.
President-elect Joe Biden's pick to head the Treasury is prepared to say the United States ""doesn't seek a weaker currency to gain competitive advantage"", returning to a more traditional posture after outgoing President Donald Trump often railed against dollar strength.
Biden is set to be inaugurated on Wednesday.
The greenback has started the year with a near 2% rally against major peers, supported by a rise U.S. Treasury yields in response to Biden's plan for a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.
The safe-haven currency fell nearly 7% last year on expectations U.S. monetary policy would stay ultra-loose and on hopes for a post-pandemic global recovery.
The greenback has also been helped recently by an unwinding of bearish bets, with data showing that hedge funds piled up the biggest net short position since May 2011 in the week ended Jan. 12. Such large positions suggest that traders would be relatively more inclined to reduce their positions than add to already big bets.
However, many analysts still expect the currency to eventually resume its march lower during 2021.
An improving economic outlook under increased fiscal spending and accelerated vaccinations, along with ultra-easy monetary policy, will scupper any attempt for a more sustained rally, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Kim Mundy wrote in a note.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers pledged continued fiscal support for their economies on Monday and discussed the design of post-pandemic recovery plans as the European Commission warned the COVID crisis was making the bloc's economic imbalances worse. 
""Our discussion today reconfirmed the very strong consensus on the need to maintain a supportive budgetary stance,"" the chairman of the ministers Paschal Donohoe told a news conference after the meeting.
""Ministers also emphasised the importance of coordinating our efforts at euro area level and the core fact that we can achieve more collectively than individually."" 
The Commission said in a note prepared for the ministers that the pandemic was pushing already highly indebted countries deeper into debt and increasing problems in areas like competitiveness or employment.
Such divergences between economies sharing the same currency increases the risk of crises and makes the single monetary policy of the European Central Bank less effective.
To prevent that, the EU has agreed on a 750 billion euro recovery fund, to be jointly borrowed and repaid, that will fund reforms and investment in each of the 27 EU countries to boost their growth potential while avoiding a debt build up.
""We will need to pay great attention to imbalances stemming from the social impact of the crisis, which have not yet been fully felt. We must avoid a further deepening of the already worrying inequalities within our societies and between our countries,"" European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Paolo Gentiloni told the news conference.
Before they can get money from the recovery fund, EU governments must prepare plans for how to spend it under the guidance of the Commission. The plans have to meet EU requirements of making economies greener, more digitalised, improving their resilience to crises and boosting their potential growth.
They also need to take into account individual country recommendations issued by the Commission last year.
The Commission said Germany and the Netherlands should boost investment and household income to reduce their huge current account surpluses. Italy, Greece, Spain, France and Portugal, however, had to tackle high public and private debts, competitiveness and productivity issues, it said.
Gentiloni said governments would probably be able to formally submit their plans, now being discussed informally with the Commission, towards the end of February. The EU executive arm will then have two months to approve them and EU finance ministers can take another month to give their OK.
The Commission would then borrow the money in the bond market in the name of the EU and pass it on to governments whose plans have been approved, paying out some 10% of the money up front and the rest in tranches as the investments progress.
Asked about a recovery plan for Italy, whose government is in turmoil, Gentiloni said drafts seen by the Commission so far were broadly in line with the EU's goals, but needed more work.
""The Italian plan is broadly convergent with our general targets and policies but, as many other draft proposals, needs to be discussed and strengthened,"" he said.

""We have a very good basis, but we should strengthen it, not only for the Italian plan, but also for all the draft plans we are discussing now with member states.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held firm at a four-week high against its rivals on Monday as an undercurrent of risk aversion swept through currency markets in the backdrop of weak U.S. economic data, knocking the Australian dollar and the euro lower.
With U.S. markets shut for a holiday on Monday and Joe Biden set to be inaugurated as the next U.S. President on Wednesday, major currencies remained within well-worn ranges expecting some volatility later in the week.
After a dollar selloff last year, the opening weeks of 2021 has seen a reversal of fortunes with a broad dollar basket rising nearly 2% so far this year thanks to a broad-based rise in U.S. Treasury yields, though analysts remain wary about the short-term outlook.
""History suggests a strong seasonal pattern that points to the potential for further near-term strength but this seasonal bias might prove less forceful this year given the broad macro backdrop remains consistent with continued optimism and support for risky assets,"" MUFG strategists said.
The euro dipped to a six-week low of $1.2066. The Antipodeans were soft against the greenback with the Aussie hitting a one-week trough of $0.7679, while the kiwi at a three-week low of $0.7117. AUD/
Better-than-expected Chinese economic data headed off further weakness among riskier currencies, but was not enough to shift currency traders' mood decisively.
The mood soured after Friday's data showed U.S. retail sales fell for a third straight month in December, stoking worries that the recovery is running into trouble as health authorities warned that the worst of the latest COVID-19 wave might be yet to come.
Europe is also facing surging cases and an Italian government that must survive crucial votes in parliament on Monday and Tuesday in order to cling to power is also making some traders nervous.
The dollar index steadied after touching a one-month high and last traded at 90.857, its highest level since Dec. 21.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Monday, clinging to small gains as traders turn to the safe haven as doubts about the global economic recovery rise while Covid-19 cases surge.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.787, not far removed from the one-month high of 90.860 seen earlier in the session.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 103.75, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3562, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7686.
Trading ranges will be limited Monday, with the U.S. on holiday, but there are plenty of events ahead to cause traders to react with caution.
Friday’s U.S. core retail sales contracted 1.4% month-on-month in December, a much larger drop than expected, suggesting that consumer spending in the world’s largest economy was being impacted by the rapid growth of Covid-19 infections globally.
Additionally, concerns are growing about possible violence at President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday, possibly exacerbated by the impending impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, while there is also opposition from Republicans to parts of the newly-proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.  
Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is also likely to be asked her views on the strength of the greenback when she testifies on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and is likely to reaffirm a strong dollar policy aim.
“We expect the dollar bear trend to take a breather in a week packed with risk events,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2073, with the single currency likely to be under pressure this week with the ECB meeting, EU summit and Italy’s political crisis in focus.
“Little is expected of the ECB after December’s easing measures,” added ING. “However, we would expect President Lagarde to say that the ECB is ‘monitoring the exchange rate carefully’, wary of the euro’s impact on an already subdued inflation rate.”
USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.4857, with the mood remaining risk averse despite stronger than expected Chinese economic data.
Chinese industrial production grew 7.3% year-on-year in December, while retail sales grew 4.6% in the final quarter from a year ago. GDP grew 2.6% on the quarter in the fourth quarter, up 6.5% year-on-year.

Investing.com – The dollar was slightly up on Monday morning in Asia, holding onto gains seen at the end of the previous week, as investors turned to the safe-haven asset amid disappointing U.S. economic data and the rising number of COVID-19 cases.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 90.800 by 10:46 AM ET (3:46 AM GMT), staying near a one-month high of 90.887 seen earlier in the session.
The euro, which saw a surge in 2020, has slipped more than 2% in 2021 and touched a six-week low over ever-increasing COVID-19 cases and an Italian political crisis that is casting doubts over the region’s economic recovery.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 103.77. The risk-adverse mood also supported the safe-haven yen against other majors.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7692, a one-week low, and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7128, a three-week low.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.09% to 6.4858. Chinese industrial production grew 7.3% year-on-year in December, above the 6.9% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, and the 7% growth seen in November, according to data released earlier in the day.
The data also showed that GDP rose 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, above the forecast 6.1% growth but below the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. The GDP also grew 2.6% quarter-on-quarter, this time below the forecast 3.2% and the 2.7% growth seen during the previous quarter.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3575.
Meanwhile, investors are also digesting U.S. economic data released on Friday. The data showed that core retail sales contracted 1.4% month-on-month in December, larger than the 0.1% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 1.3% contraction recorded in November.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) grew 0.3% month-on-month in December, while retail sales contracted 0.7% month-on-month in December.
The dollar has been supported by the Democrat victories in the runoff Senate elections in the state of Georgia earlier in the month, which saw a surge in U.S. yields as Democrats gained control of the Congress and investors see fewer resections on a borrow-and-spend administration.
U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden and his administration are also due to be inaugurated in a heavily guarded ceremony on Wednesday. Alongside the risk that supporters of incumbent President Donald Trump will perpetrate further violence in the runup to the inauguration, investors are also beginning to question how much of the $1.9 trillion stimulus measures proposed by Biden during the previous week will make it through Congress.
Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is also reportedly expected to rule out seeking a weaker dollar when she testifies on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.
Some investors remained cautious, however.
“Optimism is being challenged as the reality of a tough few months is upon us,” ANZ analysts warned in a note to clients.
“The near-term outlook for consumption, the main driver of economic growth, is poor.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday Vietnam's actions to push down the value of its currency are ""unreasonable"" and restrict U.S. commerce, but did not take immediate action to impose punitive tariffs.
Releasing the results of its so-called Section 301 investigation into Vietnam's currency practices, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office said it would continue to evaluate all available options to correct the situation. That process will pass to the administration of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who is due to take office on Wednesday.
The U.S. Treasury Department in December labeled Vietnam a ""currency manipulator"" due to its growing trade surplus with the United States, its large global current account surplus and heavy foreign exchange market intervention to hold down the value of its dong currency.
Business groups and trade experts had feared this would lead to tariffs in the USTR investigation opened last October as a parting shot from the Republican Trump, who aggressively imposed tariffs during his four years in office.
The USTR said it consulted the Treasury Department on Vietnam's exchange-rate policies.
""Unfair acts, policies and practices that contribute to currency undervaluation harm U.S. workers and businesses, and need to be addressed,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement. ""I hope that the United States and Vietnam can find a path for addressing our concerns.""
Vietnamese government said on Saturday it welcomed the decision of the USTR, describing it as ""a positive result"" of the efforts of the government and businesses from both Vietnam and the U.S. 
""Vietnam will continue its efforts to open its market and enhance policy dialogues and strictly adhere to agreements between the two sides...to maintain a stable trade relation with a target for a balanced, sustainable and mutually-beneficial trade,"" the government said in a statement.
The Section 301 investigation - named after a provision in a U.S. trade law - was the same tool that Lighthizer used to launch a sweeping tariff war against China, which has left punitive U.S. tariffs on $370 billion worth of annual Chinese imports and prompted many companies to shift supply chains out of China. Vietnam has been a major beneficiary of investment from those companies seeking to avoid U.S. tariffs on China.
The USTR's decision to hold off on ordering tariffs against Vietnamese goods gives Biden's nominee as trade representative, Katherine Tai, some breathing room in deciding how to approach Vietnam.
A spokesman for Biden's transition team declined to comment on the USTR decision.

The Vietnamese government said its trade ministry and related agencies are willing to talk with the USTR to address the outstanding issues in the trade relations between the two countries to officially close the investigation.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday after President-elect Joe Biden outlined his plans for additional stimulus, but gains are likely to be limited after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declined to join any discussion about reducing monetary stimulus. 
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.267, rebounding from last week’s near three-year low. USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 103.67, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.3% at 0.7753.
Biden released details of his $1.9 trillion spending plan overnight, including more direct payments to households, an expansion of jobless benefits and an enlargement of vaccinations and virus-testing programs.
The proposal has been expected ever since the Democrats won control of the Senate in early January, but questions over how his administration plans to foot the bill has driven Treasury yields higher, supporting the greenback.
Still, gains are limited after Fed Chair Jerome Powell adopted a very dovish tone in a live-streamed interview on Thursday, although he didn't explicitly rule out a tapering of bond purchases toward year-end. The Fed doesn't expect to raise interest rates until 2023 at the earliest.
“Now is not the time to be talking about exit” from the central bank’s easy monetary policies, he said, adding “the economy is far from our goals.”
Last Friday’s jobs report showed the U.S. lost 140,000 payroll positions in December, while the December CPI annual figure advanced 1.4%, still below the 1.7% average over the last 10 years.
The Fed’s low interest rate policy and asset-buying program have weighed heavily on the dollar.
There's an abundance of U.S. economic data to digest later Friday, including December retail sales, PPI and industrial production.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3665 after data showed Britain's economy shrank by 2.6% in November, the first monthly fall in output since April and the country’s initial Covid lockdown. The economy is now 8.5% smaller than it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in February.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2140, only marginally dipping despite the political turmoil in Italy, the euro-zone’s third largest economy, with the ruling administration under pressure after a small party within the coalition withdrawing its support.
The spillover into the foreign exchange market should be limited, said analysts at ING, in a research note, given “we see limited risk of a material widening in the BTP-Bund spread which is set to benefit from the European Central Bank's heavy purchases.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar's rebound from a near three-year low faltered on Friday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates would not rise any time soon.
The release of details of President-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus on Thursday failed to give the greenback additional support, with the main points of the plan already reported by the media.
Bitcoin continued to recover after a nearly $12,000 plunge from the record $42,000 reached last week, briefly topping $40,000 overnight.
The dollar index has rallied after reaching its lowest level since March 2018 last week, as the prospect of more stimulus weighed on U.S. government bonds, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield above 1% for the first time since March.
Although many analysts predict the greenback will resume the decline that saw it slide almost 7% last year versus major peers as the global economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, there is growing concern that the rise in yields will temper that weakness.
""The baseline case is still for a substantial acceleration in the global economy, which historically has proven to be positive for most currencies against the U.S. dollar,""
said Westpac currency analyst Sean Callow.
""But I think there is potential to at least have a debate over whether the U.S. dollar will be quite as weak as people expect.""
The dollar index was little changed at 90.319 after drifting slightly lower overnight. It rebounded to as high as 90.73 at the start of this week from as low as 89.206 on Jan. 6.
Powell said in a live-streamed interview with a Princeton University professor on Thursday that the economy remains far from where the Fed wants it to be, and that he sees no reason to alter its highly accommodative stance ""until the job is well and truly done."" 
The central bank's asset-buying program has weighed on the dollar as it increases supply of the currency, diminishing its value.
The dollar was little changed at 103.77 yen after slipping 0.1% overnight.
The euro eased 0.1% to $1.21395, on track for a three-day decline.
""The implication is that monetary policy will remain loose for a long time, which will keep real yields negative and contain any further USD rallies,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy wrote in a note.
The riskier Aussie dollar slid 0.3% to 77.560 U.S. cents, tempering the previous session's 0.6% rise.
The Chinese yuan inched up, underpinned by the China central bank's decision to drain a small amount of cash from the banking system while keeping interest rates unchanged. The moved reinforced investors' views that it is slowly shifting to a tightening bias in monetary policy as economic activity bounces back to pre-pandemic levels.
In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 6.4673 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.4703 at midday, about 0.1% or 57 pips firmer than the previous late session close.

At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down just 0.04% at 90.302, holding just above the 89.206 low seen for the first time since March 2018 last week.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 104.00, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2155, GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.3666, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.3% at 0.7756.
CNN reported overnight that President-elect Joe Biden will look to outline plans later Thursday of a fiscal stimulus package of around $2 trillion.
The dollar has risen in four of the past five trading sessions as the prospect of more stimulus, largely financed by borrowing, has weighed on U.S. government bonds, sending the benchmark Treasury yield above 1% for the first time since March.
Another factor which has supported the dollar of late has been recent concerns that the Federal Reserve may taper its monetary support sooner than had been originally expected as the economy recovers. 
Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak around 12:30 PM ET (1630 GMT), and this speech will be parsed for clues as to when its bond-buying program may be eased back.
However, many analysts expect the currency's bounce to be temporary, and longer term they expect more U.S. stimulus to support risk sentiment, weighing on the greenback, which is traditionally considered a safe-haven.
“As long as the Fed sticks to its Average Inflation Targeting framework, allows for the CPI overshot and keeps rates on hold (our base case for this year and next), the deeply negative real rate will weigh on USD,” said ING analysts, in a research note.

(Reuters) - Investors scaled back long positions in Asian currencies as the outlook for emerging market debt soured after U.S. yields shot up, a Reuters poll found, with bets almost halved on the South Korean won and Taiwan's dollar.
The greenback has recouped some losses since benchmark Treasury yields jumped to more than 1% after Democrats captured the U.S. Senate last week, making potential passage of a large fiscal stimulus easier via debt issuance.
As a result, bullish bets on the Chinese yuan, Singapore's dollar, Malaysia's ringgit and the Thai baht were trimmed for the first time since COVID-19 vaccines were announced in early November, the poll of 15 respondents showed.
""The bond market is being cautious about an increase in supply and potential increase in fiscal stimulus from incoming U.S. President Joe Biden's administration that is resulting in higher yields,"" said Mitul Kotecha, a senior EM strategist at TD Securities.
""Therefore, yield differential with some of the Asian currencies looks less attractive.""
Market participants were also worried about Asian central banks' resistance to currency gains, he added, pointing to the People's Bank of China expressing unease over the yuan's rapid rise. 
However, several analysts agreed this downturn in sentiment would be short-term, banking on vaccine rollouts and a rebound in exports to lead the recovery for trade-reliant Asian economies in 2021.
The low-yielding South Korean won saw bullish views being cut to their lowest in three months, with investors concerned about the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in the country after the third wave of infections last month nearly broke its healthcare system.
The won has been lagging its peers since, while stocks and bonds were sold heavily by foreign investors in December. 
Bullish bets on the Taiwanese dollar, Asia's best performing currency in 2020, and the yuan were unwound slightly after the central banks there took steps to rein in their soaring local currencies. 
Sources told Reuters that Taiwan's central bank asked banks dealing in foreign exchange transactions to exercise restraint a week after it intervened to keep the local currency in check.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China deployed measures to stem capital inflows to prevent the yuan from moving too fast after it blew past the crucial 6.50 per dollar mark earlier this year. 
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, continuing a rebound from near three-year lows against major peers as investors await U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s plans for further stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 90.373 by 11:11 PM ET (4:11 AM GMT). The index was little changed on Thursday after adding 0.3% during the previous session. It fell to as low as 89.206 for the first time since March 2018 on Jan. 6.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.17% to 104.03. The dollar remained little changed against the yen, after a previous 0.1% rise.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7747 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.24% to 0.7195.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4712. Chinese trade data released earlier in the day outperformed, with exports growing 18.1% year-on-year, imports growing 6.5% year-on-year and the trade balance at $78.17 billion in December.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3640.
Biden is scheduled to unveil plans for “trillions” of dollars in further COVID-19 stimulus measures later in the day. Investor expectancy that the measures will lead to faster economic recovery lifted U.S. Treasury yields, in turn giving the greenback a boost.
Investors continued to unwind bearish bets, which also helped the U.S. currency hold onto gains made on Wednesday. The prospect of more stimulus measures weighed in on U.S. government bonds and saw the benchmark Treasury yield top 1% for the first time since March 2020, in turn leading the dollar to ee gains in four of the past five trading sessions.
Bitcoin held onto its 10% gains from Wednesday, rallying after a slide of almost $12,000 from its all-time high of $42,000 seen during the previous week. The digital currency was 0.6% higher at $37,655 on Thursday, climbing up from the low of $30,261.13 seen on Jan. 11.
However, some investors were cautious and warned that the dollar’s bounce could be temporary, as a build-up of bearish positions are unwound. FOREX speculators have been net short the dollar since March 2020 as a surge in investors’ appetite for riskier assets turned them away from the dollar. More stimulus will also support risk sentiment in the long term, further dampening demand for the safe-haven dollar.
“I think positioning in risk assets is becoming a concern, so there could be a squeeze in the dollar near-term,” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) chief Japan FX strategist Shusuke Yamada told Reuters.
“I am focusing on gradual dollar weakness in 2021,” Yamada added."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar extended its rebound from near three-year lows versus major peers on Thursday, supported by higher U.S. yields, as President-elect Joe Biden prepared to outline his plans for massive fiscal stimulus.
The dollar index held onto gains made on Wednesday in early Asian trading as investors continued to unwind bearish bets. The dollar has risen in four of the past five trading sessions as the prospect of more stimulus has weighed on U.S. government bonds, sending the benchmark Treasury yield above 1% for the first time since March.
Bitcoin also held on to 10% gains made on Wednesday as it rebounded after sliding almost $12,000 from an all-time high of $42,000 hit last week.
Biden will give details on Thursday of a plan for ""trillions"" of dollars in pandemic relief. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up after CNN reported the package will be around $2 trillion, adding support for the dollar.
However many analysts expect the currency's bounce to be temporary, as a build up of bearish dollar positions are shaken out. 
Longer term, they expect more U.S. stimulus to support risk sentiment, weighing on the greenback, which is traditionally considered a safe-haven. 
""I think positioning in risk assets is becoming a concern, so there could be a squeeze in the dollar near-term,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in Tokyo.
""I am focusing on gradual dollar weakness in 2021."" 
FX speculators have been net short the dollar since mid-March, as investors' surging appetite for riskier assets hurt demand for the greenback.
The dollar index added 0.1% to 90.431 after gaining 0.3% overnight. It fell as low as 89.206 on Jan. 6 for the first time since March 2018.
The euro slipped 0.1% to $1.21405 after sliding 0.4% on Wednesday.
The greenback advanced 0.2% to 104.075 yen, adding to a 0.1% rise previously.
Bitcoin was little changed at $37,420 on Thursday, up from as low as $30,261.13 on Jan. 11.
Interest in the cryptocurrency has been soaring as institutional investors began buying heavily, viewing it as both an inflation hedge and as exposed to gains if it became more widely adopted.
""That precipitous sell-off we saw recently, a lot of it was driven by the futures markets,"" where positions became overextended and the resulting margin calls put downward pressure on the bitcoin price, said Seth Melamed, the Tokyo-based Chief Operating Officer of cryptocurrency exchange Liquid. 

""On the spot markets, you just see this consistent drumbeat of buying.""

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A rally in U.S. yields is clouding the outlook for one of the market’s most popular trades: betting against the dollar.
The U.S. currency is up more than 1% from its recent lows, shadowing a move that has taken the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level since March on expectations that a Democratic-controlled Congress will dish out more stimulus in 2021 as vaccines roll back the coronavirus pandemic.
Most of the factors that dragged the dollar to multi-year lows in 2020 - including expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep rates at rock-bottom levels - remain intact, and many believe the dollar's nascent rally is unlikely to last.
Still, the prospect that rising yields will continue burnishing the dollar's attractiveness has given pause to some investors betting on more declines in the greenback.
""For the majority of 2020, we were more negative on the dollar,"" said Thanos Bardas, managing director and co-head of global investment-grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman. ""From here we are looking for more two-way action.""
The U.S. 10-year note now has a 165 basis point yield advantage over its German counterpart, up from around 100 basis points in July.

Momentum for at least a short-term bounce could come if nervous dollar bears start unwinding short positions built up over the last several months, analysts said: nearly $30 billion was arrayed against the dollar in futures markets alone last week, CFTC data showed, while fund managers in the most recent BofA Research survey named shorting the dollar as the market’s second “most crowded” trade.
""It has become more risky to continue to be dollar bearish,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at FX payments firm Tempus Inc. ""The long-term weakness in the dollar may be overdone a touch.""
A bout of dollar strength may hurt trades that thrived during last year’s 7% drop in the U.S. currency, including bets on many global currencies and commodities such as gold.
Following a 25% gain in 2020, gold prices have slipped some 2% year-to-date.
The dollar, a popular safe haven, may also be benefiting from heightened uncertainty in Washington, as fears of further political unrest swirl amid reports of protests planned around President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20.
""I think that is exaggerating the strength in the dollar,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy and portfolio manager for Amundi Pioneer Asset Management.
The dollar's rise has weakened the technical picture for the euro, with the common currency falling below the 10- and 21-day moving averages, which had been acting as support since early November.
Darkening economic clouds across Europe amid new lockdown measures to fight a second COVID-19 wave have also undercut the case for a rising euro.
""We are skeptical about substantial further euro strength, particularly during a Eurozone recession that is more severe than in most of the rest of the world,"" said Athanasios Vamvakidis, global head of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Still, some investors believe a rise in U.S. yields can only go so far.
""We're not going to see U.S. yields moving up to a level where they are going to provide more yield-based support for the dollar,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC.
For investors looking to see if the recent dollar rally has staying power, real U.S. yields - which take inflation into account - may be key.
So far, U.S. Treasury real yields across the curve remain well in negative territory, making holding dollars less appealing to investors.
""The moment real yields start to move in the same direction as nominal yields, to me, is a signal that we could see a stronger dollar,"" Amundi Pioneer's Upadhyaya said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stabilising U.S. Treasury yields helped the dollar trade back in positive territory on Wednesday, though investors remained bearish on the currency's near-term prospects.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell more than 6 basis points from a 10-month high hit on Tuesday, briefly snuffing out a three-day winning streak for the dollar. They last traded 2 basis points lower at 1.12%, helping the currency trade 0.1% higher against its peers. [US/]
The euro, having earlier made its sharpest daily gain against the greenback, lost ground to trade 0.3% lower on the day at $1.2168.
Sterling bucked the trend and climbed over $1.37 against the dollar, having been boosted the previous day by the Bank of England governor talking down the prospect of negative interest rates. It last traded flat as the dollar gained ground. [GBP/]
The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell 0.4% and 0.6% respectively, with the Aussie hitting $0.7740 and the Kiwi at $0.7186. [AUD/]
The pullback in yields pushed the dollar below 104 Japanese yen to trade at 103.95 yen, up 0.2%.
Investors maintained their bearish stance on the greenback. 
""We continue to think the greenback's downtrend should remain intact as long as global recovery prospects stay intact,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
The dollar index was 0.3% higher at 90.279 after falling 0.5% on Tuesday and is not far above last week's close at a three-year low of 89.206.
""We think that there are really two main reasons for that (dollar not weakening now),"" said Calvin Tse, North America Head of G10 FX at CitiFX.
""U.S. yields, especially at the back end, have not only moved higher, they've shot higher. With U.S, yields shooting higher, it really does two things: 1) it encourages more inflow into the U.S. buying U.S. rate products and 2) very sharply moving yield levels tend to not be good for high beta EM FX.""
The bond-market sell-off that has driven U.S. yields sharply higher this year and stalled the dollar's decline was triggered by Democrats winning control of U.S. Congress at elections in Georgia last week.
Investors expect that result to usher in huge sums in government borrowing to fund big-spending stimulus plans and have figured that higher U.S. rates might make the dollar more attractive.
Mixed signals from some U.S. Federal Reserve members on how much longer policy can stay so accommodative also dragged on Treasuries.
However, strong demand at a $38 billion 10-year auction overnight and remarks from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George have allayed some of those concerns ahead of a busy schedule of Fed speakers.
December U.S. inflation figures are also due at 1330 GMT, with expectations for annual core CPI to hold steady at 1.6%.
Later on Wednesday Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard is due to participate in a discussion on monetary policy at a Reuters Next Virtual Forum at 1430 GMT.
Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard and Vice Chair Richard Clarida are also due to speak on Wednesday and the Fed issues its ""Beige Book"" of economic indicators at 1900 GMT. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak on Thursday.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened Wednesday as a drop in U.S. Treasury yields took the wind out of the greenback's sails.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 89.907, halting its three-day rebound after hitting its lowest level since April 2018.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 103.62, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to $1.2220. GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to $1.3697, boosted by the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talking down the prospect of negative rates, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7778.
Benchmark 10-Year Treasury yields fell nearly 7 basis points from a 10-month high hit on Tuesday following strong demand at a $38 billion 10-year auction and comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials reiterating that monetary policy is going to stay supportive.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Tuesday that she does not expect the Fed to react if inflation exceeds the central bank’s 2% goal.
“With the Fed’s rate expectations at rock bottom, any further rise in U.S. yields will remain a function of rising inflation expectations or term premium, which leaves us confident on our bearish dollar call,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The Democrats claiming the Senate after the runoff elections in Georgia earlier in the month had raised hopes for hefty stimulus measures, largely funded by government borrowing. This resulted in a bond-market selloff that drove U.S. yields sharply higher, helping to stall the dollar’s decline. 
Investors now await U.S. inflation figures for December, with the Consumer Price Index to be released later in the day. Consensus calls for a 0.4% bump from the previous month's 0.2%. The Fed's December Beige Book is also due Wednesday.
There are more Federal Reserve speakers scheduled Wednesday, and traders will be listening for more clues as to when the central bank will start reducing its asset-purchases from their current level of $120 billion a month.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with a retreat in U.S. Treasury yields sapping momentum from the U.S. currency’s recent rally and investors cautiously resumed bets on a continuous slide for the dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.08% to 89.940 by 9:51 PM ET (2:51 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 103.59.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7765, while the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7229.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.09% to 6.4549. The yuan also held onto gains, with offshore trade at a one-week high at the beginning of Wednesday’s Asian session.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 1.3681. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey played down the notion of negative interest rates to boost growth, saying that “there are a lot of issues” with them during his online speech to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday. Baily’s comments saw the dollar drop more than 1% against the pound.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell nearly 7 basis points from a 10-month high seen on Tuesday, in turn snuffing out the dollar’s three-day rally and pushing it back towards multi-year lows.
However, the greenback clung above those levels earlier in the session, with the rally tempering some investors’ confidence in the consensus view that U.S. trade and budget deficits will drive the dollar lower.
“The upward correction in the dollar index looks to be over and the downtrend has resumed,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
“But with U.S. asset markets in the driving seat, with equities setting the scene for risk appetite and U.S. bonds leading the way in interest rate markets, it’s worth asking if we can take dollar weakness for granted,” the note added.
The Democrat victory in Senate runoff elections in the state of Georgia earlier in the month sparked a bond-market selloff that drove U.S. yields sharply higher, in turn stalling the dollar’s decline. The victory also raised hopes for huge sums of government borrowing to fund the big stimulus measures promised by President-elect Joe Biden when he and his administration take office on Jan. 20.
However, the strong demand seen at a $38 billion 10-year auction overnight and comments from Federal Reserve officials reiterating that monetary policy is going to stay supportive could see the dollar back on a downward slide.
“The market hasn’t given up on the short dollar, lower real yields, long reflation assets trade just yet,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
Investors now await U.S. inflation figures for December, with the Consumer Price Index to be released later in the day. Further data, including the Producer Price Index, core retail sales and industrial production, are due on Friday.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said on Tuesday that she does not expect the Fed to react if inflation exceeds the central bank’s 2% goal, adding that it would take a large surprise to unnerve investors."

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held onto its recent gains on Tuesday after a spike in U.S. Treasury yields lifted demand for the currency.
The dollar had hit a more than 2-1/2-year low in January after sliding for months as ultra-dovish policy from the Federal Reserve encouraged investors to seek alternative currencies.
But expectations for a wave of spending under an incoming Joe Biden administration have pushed Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year yield reaching a 10-month high on Tuesday. The dollar has bounced 1.5% since last Wednesday. 
Not only have markets brought forward bets on Fed interest rate increases to 2023, many also reckon it could start withdrawing, or tapering, asset purchases earlier. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was unchanged at 90.438, above lows of 89.206 hit last week. 
Graphic: U.S. dollar index https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkqoogpm/dollar%20jan%2012.PNG
Against the euro, the dollar stood still at $1.2153.
The support from rising yields has so far trumped worries that the extra spending could trigger faster inflation. But many analysts expect the dollar to resume its decline as stimulus spending and vaccine rollouts brighten the global economic outlook.
ING analysts said Fed officials due to speak later on Tuesday were likely to pour cold water on any suggestion of slowing monetary stimulus support.
""Any policy-related comments should – in our view – go in the direction of ruling out any unwinding of monetary stimulus in the foreseeable future,"" they said. 
""With the Fed’s rate expectations firmly at the bottom, any further rise in U.S. yields will remain a function of rising inflation expectations or term premium, which leaves us confident on our bearish-dollar call.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), however, has recommended a neutral view on the dollar. It has closed a dollar-bearish trade versus the euro and the Canadian dollar and removed its bullish view on emerging market currencies, in part because U.S. real rates are likely ""troughing"".
Most emerging market currencies rose on Tuesday, including the offshore yuan, Mexican peso and South African rand.
With equity markets back in a bullish mood, riskier developed market currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars also rose. Both gained about 0.4%  
Bitcoin stabilised at around $35,500 after Monday's huge drop. The cryptocurrency's rally has faltered since it soared to a record high of $42,000 on Jan. 8.   
"
710,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound rallied as traders pushed back expectations for when the Bank of England might cut borrowing costs to the end of the year, after Governor Andrew Bailey said there were a lot of issues with negative rates.
Sterling broke above $1.36, gilt yields rose and money markets moved pricing for a 10-basis-point rate cut to December from August on Monday. The comments by Bailey, reported by Reuters, damped speculation that a rate move to 0% could come as soon as next month.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists had put those odds at 4-to-1.
“The pound is regaining ground as rates markets are paring back rate cut bets ahead of the February policy meeting,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange research and strategy at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA. “Any rebounds in the GBP represent a selling opportunity at current levels.”
The pound was up 0.5% to $1.3585 as of 10:53 a.m. in London. Against the euro it reached its strongest since the New Year at 89.38 pence. Ten-year U.K. bond yields rose three basis points to 0.34%.
With a Brexit deal reached, pound traders are shifting their focus to the outlook for the U.K. economy, which has returned to lockdown amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases. While Bailey said the economy was in a difficult period, Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said it could be stronger than output data suggest as consumers switched their spending in response to the pandemic.
That was a more positive take than policy maker Silvana Tenreyro’s comments on Monday signaling the central bank may need to provide additional easing, while maintaining the option of pushing rates into negative territory.
The European Central Bank has its benchmark rate at -0.5%, but there are concerns about the profitability of Britain’s banking sector should U.K. borrowing costs be cut further.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower Tuesday, consolidating after recent gains as the safe haven rebounded from recent lows on the back of rising Treasury yields.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.403, after rebounding for the last three sessions from a nearly three-year low seen during the previous week.
USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 104.14, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2169, after slipping to 1.2132 during the previous session for the first time since Dec. 21. GBP/USD climbed 0.4% to 1.3561, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.4% at 0.7729.
Despite today’s losses, the tone surrounding the greenback has changed over the last few days as the prospect of fiscal stimulus and hints that the Federal Reserve may start tapering its bond purchases by the end of the year has driven U.S. Treasury yields higher.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20 and has promised “trillions” in extra Covid-19 stimulus measures, largely funded by additional borrowing. This has resulted in 10-year Treasury yields climbing above 1% for the first time since March, rising as high as 1.158%.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has now abandoned their weak-dollar call as a result of the shift in U.S. rates.
“We turn neutral on the USD amid rising U.S. fiscal stimulus odds and crowded USD sentiment,” the bank’s strategists said, in a research note, adding that they were now looking “for signals on when to turn bullish.”
Traders will be keeping a wary eye on the release of the JOLTs job openings data for November, due out at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), as it will provide a glimpse at what is happening in the labor market with respect to hiring, especially after Friday’s disappointing payrolls release.
Also of interest will be a number of Federal Reserve speakers, starting with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Investors will be interested of their views of the strength of the U.S. economy, given the rising uncertainty over the length of time the central bank will keep interest rates at rock bottom levels.
Also scheduled to speak Tuesday are Governor Lael Brainard, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and, later, Kansas City's Esther George.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, seeing its fourth consecutive day of gains against major peers as the prospect of large stimulus measures drove U.S. Treasury yields higher.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who alongside his administration takes office on Jan. 20, has promised “trillions” in extra COVID-19 stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.16% to 90.588 by 11:37 PM ET (4:37 AM GMT). The index has rebounded from a nearly three-year low seen during the previous week after 10-year Treasury yields topped 1% for the first time since March, rising as high as 1.148% during the previous session.
Support from rising yields has allayed fears that extra spending on the stimulus measures could lead to faster inflation, in ordinary cases making the U.S. currency less attractive.
However, some investors expect that the dollar will continue a decline that saw the index lose close to 7% in 2020, once the stimulus spending and COVID-19 vaccination rollouts kickstart a global economic recovery and improve investor risk sentiment.
“It’s complicated because higher U.S. yields are giving the dollar a bounce, but stimulus could support U.S. equities, and the dollar would remain weak,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan head of G10 FX strategy Osamu Takashima told Reuters.
“In the medium-term, we remain bearish on the dollar. Dollar assets look expensive,” Takashima added. FX market speculators also remain extremely bearish on the dollar, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 104.31. Japanese markets returned from a holiday, with the dollar slipping 0.1% to the yen after its rise to a one-month high of 104.40 on Monday.
The AUD/USD inched down 0.07% to 0.7690, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.7161.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.4733, while the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3516.
The euro was largely steady at $1.2151, after slipping to 1.21320 during the previous session for the first time since Dec. 21. Meanwhile, bitcoin was trading below the $35,000 mark, a sign that the rally that saw the digital currency touch an all-time high of $42,000 on Jan. 8 may be over. Prices slid as much as 20% on Monday, with some investors saying that the recent gains defy logic and the U.K.’s financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, issuing a statement that consumers should “be prepared to lose all their money.”"

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher Monday, rebounding from recent lows on the back of rising Treasury yields.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 90.335, and is now over 1% higher than the almost three-year low it hit last week.
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 104.16, EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.2184, after climbing as high as 1.2349 last week. GBP/USD dropped 0.6% to 1.3487, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.8% at 0.7701.
After a prolonged period of dollar weakness, investors are now betting on economic recovery spurring an uptick in inflation and an end to extreme accommodation by the Federal Reserve toward the end of the year.  President-elect Joe Biden has promised “trillions” in extra coronavirus-relief spending, much of which will be financed by additional borrowing. 
The fact that the Democrats will be able to control both houses of Congress makes these promises more likely to be delivered, and this has resulted in the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. debt rising more than 20 basis points to 1.12% this year, topping 1% for the first time since March.
Also helping the dollar push higher is growing uncertainty over the length of time the Federal Reserve will keep its ultra-low interest rates policy in place.
Although the U.S. central bank has indicated that interest rates will remain on hold near zero through at least 2023, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday the U.S. economy was headed for an ""impressive"" year as the impact of coronavirus vaccines takes hold and with the potential for larger government spending.
He stated this view even after it was announced that the U.S. economy lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first negative print in the closely watched monthly employment report since April.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY pair was up 0.1% to 6.4786, after China’s producer price index contracted 0.4% year-on-year in December, falling at their slowest pace since February, suggesting the country's manufacturing sector continues its recovery."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar extended a rebound on Monday, as sharp gains in U.S. yields and hopes for more stimulus to boost the world's largest economy prompted some investors to temper bearish bets, pulling the currency further away from recent multi-year lows.
President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20 with Democrats able to control both houses of Congress, has promised ""trillions"" in extra pandemic-relief spending.
That has pushed the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. debt up more than 20 basis points to 1.1187% this year, which helped the dollar to a one-month high of 104.20 yen Monday as better rates gave pause to some dollar shorts.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell more than 0.6% against the greenback to one-week lows, while the euro and sterling lost 0.4% to touch two-week lows. 
The euro last traded as low as $1.2167 in Asia, after climbing as high as $1.2349 last week.
""The underlying source of the revival has been the aftermath of the Senate elections and markets anticipating that we might get substantially more fiscal support for the U.S. economy,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s head of FX strategy, Ray Attrill. 
""Everyone's asking whether this changes the weaker dollar narrative - that's why I think we're getting a bit of a continuation of what we're seeing on Thursday and Friday.""
Attrill said he was not buying a rebound yet, as shifts in relative yields tend to take a while to play out in currency markets, because extra stimulus is by no means certain and as other factors weighing on the dollar remain in place. 
But the surge in bond yields since the Democrats won control of the Senate last week has been enough to pause the dollar's steep and steady decline since last March. [US/]
Havens which pay no income also fell, with bitcoin slumping as much as 12% to a one-week low and gold down 1% at a one-month low.
RISK/REWARD
The dollar index has lost roughly 12% since a three-year peak in March. However, it is now more than 1.3% above the almost three-year low it hit last week. It rose 0.1% to 90.418 on Monday.
The hitherto soaring Australian dollar fell nearly 1% to $0.7693, unmoved by another solid month of local retail sales. The kiwi slipped 0.6% to $0.7194 and dollar gains were broad, if smaller, elsewhere in Asia. [AUD/]
""The market's been incredibly bearish and seen a short dollar position as a central driver of a reflation trade,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone in Melbourne.
""The risk of higher real yields suggests reducing tactically that short dollar exposure to a more neutral stance."" 
The dollar rose 0.2% to 6.4864 yuan and it rose 0.6% to two-week high of 1,099.58 South Korean won and hit a two-week peak against the Singapore dollar.[EMRG/FRX]
""The weaker dollar narrative and broad-based ebullience for emerging markets have been challenged earlier in the year than we forecast, which may lead to a rethink of consensus trades, at least in the week ahead,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
Elsewhere, China's factory gate prices fell last month at their slowest pace since February, suggesting the country's manufacturing sector continues to see a rapid recovery.

Chinese trade figures are due later in the week along with U.S. retail sales, sentiment and production data and markets have a wary eye on Washington as pressure grows to impeach President Donald Trump.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, continuing a rebound over big gains in U.S. yields and hopes for more U.S. stimulus measures that saw some investors tempering bearish bets and seeing the dollar move further away from the multi-year lows seen recently.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.41% to 90.388 by 9:25 PM ET (2:25 AM GMT), climbing above the 90 mark.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.22% to 104.16. Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.77% to 0.7700 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.73% to 0.7189. The dollar’s gain was the risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies’ loss, with even a second month of better-than-expected data in Australia failing to lift the AUD up. November’s retail sales were up 7.1% month-on-month, higher than October’s 7% reading.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.22% to 6.4890. Data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index (PPI)  contracted 0.4% year-on-year in December, higher than the -0.8% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s -1.5% reading. The data also showed that December’s consumer price index (CPI) also beat expectations, rising 0.7% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year.
Further Chinese data, including exports, imports and trade balance data, is due later in the week. Data from the U.S., including the PPI and retail sales, is also due later in the week.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.40% to 1.3508.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised “trillions” in extra COVID-19 relief spending as he and a Democrat-controlled Congress prepare to take office on Jan. 20.
Biden’s promise pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. debt up more than 20 basis points to 1.1187% in 2021 to date, in turn helping the dollar to a one-month high of 104.095 yen earlier in the day, with better rates giving pause to some dollar shorts.
“The underlying source of the revival has been the aftermath of the Senate elections and markets anticipating that we might get substantially more fiscal support for the U.S. economy … everyone’s asking whether this changes the weaker dollar narrative, that’s why I think we’re getting a bit of a continuation of what we’re seeing on Thursday and Friday,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
But Attrill is not buying a rebound yet, warning that shifts in relative yields tend to take time to play out in currency markets. The fact that extra stimulus is not yet guaranteed, as well as other factors weighing on the dollar, remain in place, he added.
However, a crowded trade in bets against the dollar, alongside the selloff in the bond market since the Democrats won control of the Senate during the previous week’s runoff elections in Georgia, has slowed the greenback’s steep and steady decline since March 2020.
“The weaker dollar narrative and broad-based ebullience for emerging markets have been challenged earlier in the year than we forecast, which may lead to a rethink of consensus trades, at least in the week ahead,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
“We stick to our non-consensus view that the dollar is likely to benefit from better growth and returns to capital over the remainder of the year,” the note added."

Investing.com – The pound looked set to snap a three-week winning streak on Friday, as data showed traders were beginning to unwind some of their bullish bets on growing expectations that the Bank of England may soon cut rates into negative territory to support the recovery.
GBP/USD fell 0.04% to $1.3557, and is on track to post a weekly drop for the first time in four weeks.
CFTC positioning data, released Friday, showed that speculators trimmed their net long position on sterling in the week ended Jan.5, by 1,000 contracts, to 4,000.
While the UK-EU trade deal has brought a semblance of visibility for the economy, the unrelenting spread of the virus has forced fresh lockdown measures that will set the recovery back.
""Harsh lockdown measures will continue for at least another month, which should make for a second consecutive pullback in GDP in Q1/21,"" RBC said in a note.
Faced with a slower than expected recovery, the Bank of England will emerge as one of the first major central banks to cut rates this year.
""Most central banks are in a holding pattern at the moment and will evaluate the need for any tweaks to their asset purchase programs this year. But with the UK economy facing a longer road to recovery, we think the BoE will increase stimulus this year with a move to negative rates,"" RBC said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's real will likely stay on pause in coming weeks around the mid-point of its recent wide trading range, as strategists focus on advances in vaccination efforts by President Jair Bolsonaro's government, a Reuters poll showed.
The Brazilian currency was quoted at 5.33 per U.S. dollar on Thursday, close to the medium value between its weakest levels of May 2020, when COVID-19 hit local markets with full force, and a short-lived high the following month.
After last year's volatility, ""while there is fundamentally space for upside in the real, we cannot rule out the possibility that it stays at current levels for a protracted time,"" said Felipe Sichel, chief strategist at Modalmais bank.
The currency is seen at 5.20 in 30 days, holding its ground before appreciating slowly to tentatively cross the 5.0 mark for the first time in 18 months at the end of 2021, according to the median estimate of 22 FX strategists polled Jan. 4-6.
Technical views supporting a relatively calm foreign exchange market contrast with some worrying signs on the coronavirus front, as Brazil falls behind its neighbors in the vaccination race.
The country has the world's second deadliest outbreak after the United States, and Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the severity of the health crisis, is facing criticism for not organizing an effective response to the pandemic.
On the other hand, the economic outlook keeps improving gradually, with positive indications even in Brazil's damaged public accounts, boosting hopes for a return to fiscal austerity this year.
""Favorable levels of commodity prices, international trade flows on the rise, fiscal expansion in advanced economies and compliance with the spending cap rule in Brazil should lead the BRL to strengthen in 2021,"" Santander (MC:SAN) analysts said.
Mexico's peso is expected to continue this year just below 20.0 per U.S. dollar, trading at pre-coronavirus levels it reached last month after a turbulent 2020, despite the still ravaging pandemic.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday, halting its recent downtrend as Treasury yields pushed higher. However, moves are small ahead of the release of the latest U.S. employment data.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.812, bouncing off a near three-year low following a slide of nearly 7% in 2020.
USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 103.90, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2262, after earlier reaching an almost three-year high of 1.2346. GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.3579, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7783.
The greenback has been on the slide for months, with the central drivers being hopes of a global recovery, backed by the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines, backed by deeply negative U.S. real rates. 
Adding to this overall trend this week has been the Democrats winning effective control of the Senate, giving President-elect Joe Biden scope to push through more spending.
That said, this trend has taken a breather Friday with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield topping 1% earlier this week for the first time since March amid the political turmoil in Washington DC.
That said, “expectations that the vaccine rollout will allow economies to reopen in the second quarter of the year should mean that if we do see any corrections in the dollar trend, they will be reasonably shallow,” said ING analyst Chris Turner, in a research note.
“We now expect EUR/USD and USD/JPY to be ending the year closer to 1.30 and 100, respectively.”
Trading ranges have been narrow Friday ahead of the much-watched monthly nonfarm payroll report, with traders looking for clues on whether significantly more stimulus will be needed to keep the jobs recovery alive. 
The December figure is expected to show a gain of 71,000 jobs, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), which would be far lower than the 245,000 jobs added in November. Earlier this week, a payroll report by ADP said private businesses cut 123,000 jobs in December, far worse than economists' had expected.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, holding onto the biggest gains in over two months as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields led to some unwinding of bearish bets on the U.S. currency. The market avoided big moves as investors finish the week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.14% to 89.907 by 9:07 PM ET (2:07 AM GMT). The dollar rose above the almost thee-year low of 89.206 seen on Wednesday, as investors took profits against the euro particularly. The index slid almost 7% in 2020, and as much as 0.9% in 2021 to date, over expectations of U.S. stimulus measures.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield topped 1% on Wednesday for the first time since March 2020, and the euro was at $1.22685 following a 0.5% drop seen on Thursday.
The rising yields and dollar prompted caution in some investors.
Dollar “positioning is stretched and the backup in U.S. yields has some investors nervous,” TD Securities analysts said in a note.
“The (dollar’s) move, however, is more consolidative in tone than it is a sign of a bigger correction,” the note warned.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.08% to 103.88, with Japan’s greater Tokyo area entering a state of emergency on Thursday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said earlier in the day that the government would liaise with other prefectures to see whether the state of emergency should be extended, with the Osaka and Aichi governors expected to request that the two areas be added to the emergency declaration.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7753, with Australia’s third-largest city of Brisbane entering a three-day lockdown from later in the day. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7250.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.4726 and the GBP/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 1.3552.
However, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock’s victory in the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia earlier in the week are expected to be negative for both bonds and the dollar. The pair’s sweep of the two available seats gives the Democrats a Senate majority, in turn giving President-elect Joe Biden scope to push through more fiscal stimulus when his administration takes office on Jan. 20.
On the data front, the U.S. will release employment data, including non-farm payrolls, later in the day. The data is expected to give investors clues to the need for more stimulus measures to keep the economic recovery going."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held on to its biggest gain in more than two months against major peers on Friday as a rise in U.S. yields triggered some unwinding of bearish bets on the currency.
The greenback bounced off a nearly three-year low, with traders taking profits against the euro in particular, following a slide in the dollar index of nearly 7% in 2020 and as much as 0.9% in the new year amid expectations of U.S. fiscal stimulus.
Democrats won effective control of the Senate this week, giving President-elect Joe Biden scope to push through more spending, which analysts say will be negative for bonds and the dollar.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield topped 1% on Wednesday for the first time since March.
Dollar ""positioning is stretched and the backup in U.S. yields has some investors nervous,"" TD Securities analysts wrote in a client note.
""The (dollar's) move, however, is more consolidative in tone than it is a sign of a bigger correction.""
Investors now await U.S. nonfarm payrolls later on Friday for clues on whether significantly more stimulus will be needed to keep the economic recovery alive.
The dollar index was little changed at 89.841 in early Asian trading, after dipping to an almost three-year low of 89.206 on Wednesday. It rose more than half a percent on Thursday, but remains on track for a weekly decline.
The euro was mostly flat at $1.22685 following Thursday's 0.5% drop.
The riskier Aussie dollar was also little changed at 77.695 U.S. cents after sliding 0.5% in the previous session.
The greenback bought 103.820 yen after gaining 0.7% to close at 103.830 in New York.
Bitcoin traded 0.2% lower at $39,418 after smashing through $40,000 for the first time on Thursday and soaring as high as $40,420. The digital currency crossed the $20,000 milestone less than a month ago, on Dec. 16, and has rallied more than 700% since March.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's weakening trend will last at least another year, longer than previously expected, according to a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters who cited a hunt for yields in emerging market currencies as the main reason.
After posting its first annual loss since 2017 last year - dropping around 7% - the dollar index has weakened as much as 1% since the new year. While on brief occasions the dollar has shown resilience, it has failed to sustain that as the factors underpinning its rally for years have largely abated.
The greenback has been pushed to multi-year lows by rock-bottom U.S. interest rates, massive budget and trade deficits, and expectations that rebounding world trade after a successful coronavirus vaccine rollout would drive non-dollar currencies higher.
That downward course of the dollar was expected to continue this year, according to the Jan. 4-7 poll of 70 strategists.
""We think the dollar is over-valued. We're at the point where that relative yield advantage is gone. So, you have to ask yourself, how far can the dollar fall and why can't it fall further when rates are about the same?,"" said Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
(GRAPHIC: Reuters Poll- U.S. dollar outlook FX - Jan 2021 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xklpyjwnavg/Reuters%20Poll-%20U.S.%20dollar%20outlook%20FX%20-%20Jan%202021.PNG) 
Currency speculators increased their bets against the dollar for the 40th week in a row, according to the latest positioning data, and 35 of 63 analysts - or around 55% - predicted the dollar's weakening trend would last more than a year.
The others expected it to end sometime before the end of 2021. That compared with a slim majority of analysts predicting the trend would end within a year in the December poll.
Much of that dim outlook for the greenback was down to investors chasing riskier assets, both within and outside the United States in search of better returns.
The blistering global stocks rally that propelled the benchmark S&P 500 index to rise more than 70% from its March depths and pushed the dollar down was anticipated to continue as analysts expect global capital to favour more volatile currencies.
A clear majority, or 47 of 57, analysts said in response to a separate question that emerging market currencies would perform better against the dollar this year. The other 10 chose developed market currencies. [EMRG/POLL]
""We are going to have movement into emerging markets looking for higher yields and out of the dollar,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""The dollar could remain soft during the first half of the year, but for the second half there is the possibility that could have changed, although it is equally possible right now it could be 2022 before we get that adjustment.""
Despite expectations that they would underperform against emerging market currencies, most major developed market currencies were predicted to post marginal gains against the greenback over the next 12 months.
The euro, which accounts for nearly 60% of the dollar basket, was forecast to gain around 1.9% to $1.25 by the end of this year. The common currency, which gained almost 9% last year and is up nearly 0.5% so far this year, was changing hands around $1.227 on Thursday.
Among the majors, only the safe-haven Swiss franc was forecast to weaken against the dollar, losing around 1.0%.
But not everyone was convinced about unabated dollar weakness.
A few analysts expected the continued spike in COVID-19 cases caused by a new strain of the coronavirus to unravel some of the heavy bets against the dollar.
""The dollar is moving in the right direction. The issue now is that it has definitely done more than you would have wanted it to in recent months in terms of the speed,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""You can already see some push-back... I wouldn't be surprised if the dollar weakening stalls at some point.""

Investing.com - The dollar remained trading near its weakest level in nearly three years Thursday as the projected Democrat victories in the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia pointed to two years of loose fiscal and monetary policy..
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.472, still close to its overnight low of 89.206, a level not seen since March 2018.
USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 103.29, with the yen underperforming with a fresh state of emergency for Tokyo and the neighboring Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures is due to be declared later in the day as Covid-19 cases rise.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2317, after earlier reaching an almost three-year high of 1.2346. The euro was supported by stronger-than-expected German factory orders for November, which were the latest sign of the global manufacturing sector performing relatively strongly toward the end of last year.
GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3581, below the almost three-year high of $1.3703 seen on Monday, as the U.K. went into another lockdown. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7786, after touching a nearly three-year high of 78.195 on Wednesday.
The Democrat pair of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are projected to have won the two Senate seats in Georgia, meaning their party is now set to have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.
This is raising expectations that President-elect Joe Biden will find it easier to push his agenda, including more stimulus measures, when his administration takes over in a couple of weeks.
“The outcome of the Georgia elections means a swifter and more aggressive spending package in 2021 that can help propel the recovery more rapidly, than would have been likely had the Republicans had retained their majority in the Senate,” said ING analyst James Knightley, in a research note, and “the dollar is likely to come under increasing downward pressure in this more reflationary scenario.”
The currency markets remained relatively calm overnight despite the violent disorder in Washington D.C., with supporters of President Donald Trump storming Capitol Hill to stop the certification of Biden’s win in the November presidential election. 
The main economic release on Thursday will be the weekly initial claims number, especially ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls release and after Wednesday’s ADP figure indicated that U.S. companies slashed jobs for the first time since April last month.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, hovering near its lowest level in nearly three years as Democrats cinched both U.S. Senate seats on offer in Georgia’s runoff elections.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 89.392 by 11:31 PM ET (4:31 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 103.12. A fresh state of emergency for Tokyo and the neighboring Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures is due to be declared in Japan later in the day.
The AUD/USD inched down 0.02% to 0.7800, as Australia’s national cabinet meets on Friday, a month earlier than planned. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7296.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.4572, after the State Administration of Foreign Exchange signaled a desire for a slower pace of gains on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair was steady at 1.3607, remaining below the almost three-year high of $1.3703 seen on Monday.
“With Brexit now behind us, we are starting to leg into short-GBP positions. With the USD still trading on a uniformly weak footing, however, ... we look to AUD and JPY to express GBP caution,” TD Securities strategists Mazen Issa and Ned Rumpeltin said in a note.
In Georgia, the Democrat pair of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are headed to the Senate after declaring victory over their Republican rivals David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. The victories clear the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through his legislative agenda, including more stimulus measures, when his administration takes office on Jan. 20.
A Democrat-controlled Senate is considered a net positive for economic growth globally and for most risk assets. However, it is negative for bonds and the dollar as the U.S. budget and trade deficits could widen further.
Lawmakers resumed their meeting to certify Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 elections, which were interrupted by supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed Capitol Hill to protest the certification.
However, currency markets remained relatively calm even amid the chaotic scenes in Washington D.C.
Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto sees the dollar’s fortunes split with Democrats controlling both Houses.
“The dollar will remain weaker against commodity currencies like the Aussie and emerging market currencies,” which benefit when risk sentiment is positive, he said.
At the same time, “higher Treasury yields should benefit the dollar against the euro and the yen, because the dollar has underpriced the potential for U.S economic recovery under Biden,” Yamamoto added.
Some investors predicted that with the dollar index falling nearly 7% in 2020 and as much as 0.9% in 2021 to date, the greenback could get a bit of respite from some unwinding of a crowded trade.
“People have been bearish on the dollar now for at least six or nine months Obviously you are going to have to take a little bit of a breather every now and then,” Silicon Valley Bank senior FX trader Minh Trang told Reuters."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar languished near its lowest level in nearly three years on Thursday after Democrats won control of the U.S. Senate, clearing the way for a larger fiscal stimulus under President-elect Joe Biden.
Currency markets were largely unperturbed by scenes of chaos in Washington as supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump stormed Capitol Hill.
Analysts generally assume a Democrat-controlled Senate would be a net positive for economic growth globally and thus for most risk assets, but negative for bonds and the dollar as the U.S. budget and trade deficits may widen further.
The dollar index rose 0.1% to 89.444 in Asian trade, but still lay close to its overnight low of 89.206, a level not seen since March 2018.
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, sees the dollar's fortunes split with Democrats controlling both Houses.
""The dollar will remain weaker against commodity currencies like the Aussie and emerging market currencies,"" which benefit when risk sentiment is positive, he said.
At the same time, ""higher Treasury yields should benefit the dollar against the euro and the yen, because the dollar has underpriced the potential for U.S economic recovery under Biden.""
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 1.0456% after climbing as high as 1.054% on Wednesday for the first time since the market mayhem of mid-March.
The riskier Australian dollar slipped 0.1% to 77.950 U.S. cents after touching a nearly three-year high of 78.195 on Wednesday.
The euro was mostly flat at $1.23260, after climbing to $1.2349 on Wednesday for the first time since April 2018.
The dollar fell 0.1% to 103.145 yen, after dipping to 102.595 on Wednesday for the first time since March.
But after a fall of nearly 7% in 2020 for the dollar index and a drop of as much as 0.9% in the new year, the U.S. currency may get a degree of respite from some unwinding of a crowded trade.
""People have been bearish on the dollar now for at least six or nine months,"" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
""Obviously you are going to have to take a little bit of a breather every now and then.""
The yuan was largely flat at 6.4596 per dollar after Chinese authorities signalled a desire for a slower pace of gains.
The remarks by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Wednesday follows an advance of around 10% on the greenback since last May as China's economic rebound has led the world's pandemic recovery.
The British pound slid 0.2% to $1.3589 as it continued to meander below the almost three-year high of $1.3703 touched on Monday.
""With Brexit now behind us, we are starting to leg into short-GBP positions,"" TD Securities strategists Mazen Issa and Ned Rumpeltin wrote in an update of their FX model portfolio dated Jan. 6.
""With the USD still trading on a uniformly weak footing, however, ... we look to AUD and JPY to express GBP caution.""
Bitcoin marked a fresh all-time high of $37,400 on Thursday, extending a surge of more the 800% since mid-March.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar slipped on Wednesday as Democrats took the lead in runoff votes that will determine control of the U.S. Senate and possibly pave the way for a big spending administration under President-elect Joe Biden.
The euro rose past major resistance to a new 32-month high and the greenback struck multi-year lows on the Swiss franc and the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Against a basket of currencies, it hit its lowest since April 2018.
Analysts generally assume a Democrat-controlled Senate would be positive for economic growth globally and thus for most riskier assets, but negative for bonds and the dollar as the U.S. budget and trade deficits swell even further.
[MKTS/GLOB]
""A Democratic-led government is expected to add more stimulus to help mitigate the virus crisis and...that means that there's going to be a weaker dollar,"" said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in Hong Kong.
The boost to the economy also makes investors more comfortable with risk and likely to seek assets outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets, Sandhu said.
Democrats will control both houses of Congress if they win both Senate seats up for contest in Georgia.
NBC television and election analytics firm Edison Research called one of the contests in favour of Democrat Raphael Warnock and Edison had Democrat Jon Ossoff leading in the other, but the latter race was still too close to call.
The euro rose 0.3% to $1.2335 in late Asia trade as the results became clearer, breaking past resistance at $1.2310. The Australian and New Zealand dollars each rose 0.5%, with the Aussie hitting $0.7798 and the kiwi $0.7289.
The dollar had on Tuesday fallen through a major support level against the yen and it extended lower to a new 10-month low of 102.60 in early Asia trade on Wednesday. It also hit an almost six-year trough of 0.8767 Swiss francs.

GEORGIA MORNING DUE
A decisive outcome in Georgia could arrive as soon as Wednesday morning in the United States, although the tightness of the count suggests an official result may take longer.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told CNN that he hoped to have a better idea around noon (1700 GMT). In any case the bond market is priced for more borrowing with benchmark 10-year Treasury yields above 1% for the first time since March.
The more modest moves in currencies reflect ambivalence over whether returns from higher yields will be eventually eroded by higher inflation or flattered by lower inflation.
""Rising taxes and regulation will not cure today's weak dollar,"" said Michael J. Kelly, PineBridge Investments' global head of multi assets in New York.
""The global rotation out of U.S.-based assets into Europe and emerging would continue...soon we'll be back to focusing on the vaccine roll outs.""
Rising currencies in Asia, where the economic recovery has been most impressive, have caught an added boost from China's soaring yuan, which increases China's purchasing power for commodities and other imports.
After a Tuesday surge, the yuan was steady at 6.4552 per dollar on Wednesday as profit taking and state-owned bank selling cooled excitement about a big jump in its onshore trading band. [CNY/]
The yuan has gained 12% on the dollar since last May as China's economic rebound has led the world's pandemic recovery.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened Wednesday with Democrat confidence growing of victories in the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia, potentially resulting in a more expansive fiscal policy. 
At 3:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 89.328 just off a new 2.5-year low that it hit earlier.
USD/JPY was largely flat at 102.72, just above a new 10-month low of 102.60 hit earlier Wednesday. EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.2328, its highest in 32 months.
GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.3655, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.5% at 0.7795, at levels last seen in January 2018.
U.S. news networks and election prediction services reported that Democratic Party candidate Raphael Warnock was set to win the runoff election for one of the two Georgia Senate seats in play.
The other race, between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican David Perdue, is also leaning towards Ossoff, who holds a lead of nearly 13,000  with over 99% of votes counted, according to Decision Desk HQ.
Traders are watching these runoffs closely as victory by the Democrats in both seats would see them gain control of the Senate, likely resulting in more stimulus and infrastructure spending. Results are due later in the day, but the likely small margins could see legal delays. Perdue in particular has said he will take legal recourse.
“While a possible Democratic victory could raise concerns about more regulation, at least over the coming months this might be outweighed by expectations of larger fiscal stimulus (which would precede possible tax hikes and regulatory measures) and thus keep risk assets supported and the dollar weak over the coming months,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
There are a number of important economic releases due Wednesday, including the monthly ADP private payrolls for December, the Markit composite PMI number for the same month, and the November factory orders release. Also of interest will be the release of the Federal Reserve minutes of its last meeting of 2020.
Elsewhere, the USD/CNY pair was flat at 6.4552, steadying after the pair fell to its lowest level since June 2018 on Tuesday in the wake of the People’s Bank of China lifted the midpoint of its trading band by 1%, the biggest one-day lifting since China abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar in 2005.
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index for December, released earlier in the day, read 56.3, which was lower than November’s 57.8 figure.
Among emerging currencies, the Israeli shekel surged again to its highest in 24 years, on perceptions that its public vaccination campaign is proceeding faster than any other in the world, giving it the best chances to return to normal economic life quickly. The Russian ruble and Kazakh tenge also both rose after the two countries emerged as the big winners from a meeting by the OPEC+ bloc to allow them to raise output in February while Saudi Arabia offsets the net increase in output with voluntary cuts of its own."

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, steadying as vote counting continues for a U.S. Senate runoff election in the state of Georgia and investors awaiting the results to determine market sentiment’s next move.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 89.547 by 11:16 PM ET (4:16 AM GMT), briefly falling to a fresh ten-month low earlier in the session. 
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 102.81.
TheAUD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.7755 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7251.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.4583, with the yuan steadying in offshore trade. The Chinese currency rose to its highest since June 2018 on Tuesday in the wake of the People’s Bank of China lifted the midpoint of its trading band by 1%, the biggest one-day lifting since China abandoned the yuan’s peg to the dollar in 2005.
The rising yuan boosted Asian currencies, which in turn boosted China’s purchasing power for commodities and other imports. Investors also seized the opportunity to keep buying ahead as profit taking and some selling by major state-owned Chinese banks cooled the rally.
On the data front, the Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December, released earlier in the day, read 56.3, which was lower than November’s 57.8 figure.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 1.3608. The euro also saw a high of $1.2328, its strongest since April 2018, earlier in the session. It slipped back to $1.2281 as results from the Georgia election flow in.
With around 78% of the expected vote in, Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue led their Democrat rivals Raphael Warnock Jon Ossoff by a percentage point and 1.6 percentage points respectively.
The winners of the two seats will determine which party controls the Senate, with a democrat victory smoothing the way for President-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda, which includes more stimulus measures. Results are due later in the day, but razor-thin margins could see a delay.
“The market reaction to the outcome will probably be dictated by what it is assumed to mean for fiscal policy, rightly or wrongly,” said RBC Capital Markets currency strategist Adam Cole.
“If the Democrats do manage to take both seats the assumption will be that Biden has more freedom to set policy and that likely means more fiscal easing,” he added, which would lift risk sentiment and weigh on the dollar.
While potential tax hikes are “not particularly market-friendly”, the extra spending would be broadly bullish for commodities and emerging markets, OCBC Bank investment strategy executive director Vasu Menon told Reuters."

LONDON (Reuters) - Currency markets are signalling a bumpy ride for the British pound as tighter lockdown measures are expected to offset Brexit deal optimism that propelled the currency above $1.37 on Monday.
The pound's rally to May 2018 highs is widely attributed to traders unwinding their short-term hedges, selling their protection against a weakening currency, rather than betting on further gains after Britain stuck a last-minute trade deal with the European Union.
Measures of implied volatility fell from the nine-month highs reached in December after the deal was struck as markets heaved a sign of relief. But some participants remain cautious about the near-term outlook.
On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a new national lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic..
""I am not convinced that there is much more upside yet,"" said John Goldie, an FX dealer at Argentex. ""At these levels, it may be difficult to continue to push higher with further escalations in the Covid numbers and the prospect of longer, more stringent lockdowns to come."" 
Indeed, volatility gauges have started creeping up again after initially falling when the Brexit deal was struck on Dec. 24. One-month Sterling-dollar volatility is up to nearly 9% compared to 7% for a broader basket of currencies.
Meanwhile, CFTC figures -- the closest proxy to real-time changes in investor positioning -- indicate hedge funds turned net bullish on the pound in early December, but the size of the overall net long bets are far smaller than they were in 2018, when the pound traded at these levels.
Kaspar Hense, a fund manager at BlueBay Asset Management, which runs $60 billion in assets, said he is more bearish on the pound in the short term, expecting some friction between the European Union and the UK, notably in services.
""The relief of a Brexit deal that was apparent in the markets will fade quickly despite broad U.S. dollar weakness,"" he said.
Still, the view on the currency is far from the bearishness seen during the rough phases of Brexit negotiations. 
For instance, the ratio of puts (right to sell) over calls (right to buy) has lessened considerably. Sterling-dollar three-month risk reversals were around -0.9 on Tuesday, a fraction of their -4.5 in early December, signalling bearish bets have declined. Expectations of a weak dollar has also helped. 
""If the dollar depreciation trend speeds up quite a bit over the next month or two, I could easily see there being some decent demand for topside cable, and that may just push the three-month risk reversal back up to positive territory again,"" said Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday after China lifted its official yuan exchange rate to its highest level in 30 months, helping support demand for other currencies.
China's central bank set the official yuan midpoint at 6.4760 per dollar before the market opened, up % from the previous fix, also the biggest change since 2005.
Graphic: China sets yuan mid-point at strongest in 30 months https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpejlbzvr/Pasted%20image%201609837840876.png
In the offshore market, the yuan strengthened as far as 6.4419 for the first time since June 2018. It started the week at 6.4944.
""If the Chinese currency is going up, it's providing a degree of support for Asian currencies in general, and I suspect that's why the U.S. dollar is partially reversing the gains that we saw from Wall Street time,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
""It's a very big move by any historical yardstick, and I don't think you can ignore that.""
While investor caution about the yuan's rally prompted some later selling of the Chinese currency on Tuesday, the PBOC's action nonetheless lifted risk sentiment in currency markets.
Among G10 currencies, the Australian dollar led gains as the move by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) encouraged broad dollar selling.
The dollar index weakened 0.2% to 89.731. It dropped as low as 89.415 on Monday for the first time since April 2018, but ended the day with a 0.1% gain after U.S. stocks slid.
Earlier, the dollar had found support as concern about surging COVID-19 cases and uncertainty about U.S. runoff elections in Georgia spurred a retreat in U.S. stocks from record highs to start the year and kindled demand for safer assets.
Still, strategists appear convinced of protracted weakness for the dollar.
""While rising COVID cases remain the key near-term risk, as has been the case in the latter part of 2020, the market continues to focus on the prospects of the vaccine and the eventual global economic recovery,"" ING Bank said in a note to clients.
""While a possible Democratic victory (in Georgia) could raise concerns about more regulation, at least over the coming months this might be outweighed by expectations of larger fiscal stimulus and thus keep risk assets supported and the dollar weak over the coming months.""
The Aussie dollar, a barometer of risk appetite that also tends to follow the yuan, jumped 0.7% to 77.18 U.S. cents during trade in London, approaching the 2-1/2-year high of 77.43 touched on the final day of 2020.
The dollar fell 0.3% to 102.86 yen. It dropped as low as 102.715 on Monday for the first time since March.
The euro rose 0.2% to $1.22765 after reaching $1.231 on Monday, its highest since April 2018.
The British pound gained 0.1% to $1.3573. 
Sterling has been swung by a surge in infections of a fast-spreading new coronavirus strain in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordering another nationwide lockdown.
It slid 0.73% on Monday, the most since Dec. 10, after earlier rising to $1.3703, a level not seen since May 2018.
Bitcoin traded at $31,367 following a roller-coaster ride to start the new year that took it to a record high of $34,800 on Sunday, followed by a tumble to as low as $27,734 the following session.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower Tuesday, but losses are small as uncertainty over the U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia provided some support to the safe-haven.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 89.733, but above Monday’s low of 89.415, seen for the first time since April 2018.
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 102.92, after dropping as low as 102.715 on Monday for the first time since March. EUR/USD rose 0.2% to $1.2271, after reaching $1.2310 on Monday, its highest since April 2018. 
GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.3602, recovering some of its losses after the announcement of a new six-week national lockdown in England, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.8% at 0.7721, approaching the 2-1/2-year high of 0.7743 touched on the final day of 2020.
Traders are watching the Senate runoffs in Georgia later Tuesday closely, as control of this branch of the U.S. government is potentially up for grabs. This could influence the economic policies incoming President Joe Biden will be able to introduce, including boosting stimulus and infrastructure spending.
Both contests are seen as being very tight and the outcomes may not be immediately known.
“We think a little caution is warranted ahead of one of the first major event risks of 2021 – the re-run of the Georgia Senate election. Whilst most analysts predict that Republicans hold onto the two seats in question, investors may want to see that result confirmed before pushing reflationary trades (and dollar weakness) much further,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The U.S. economic data calendar Tuesday includes the December ISM Manufacturing PMI release at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), while there will be a couple of officials from the Federal Reserve scheduled to speak, a day before the central bank issues the minutes of its last meeting of 2020.
Elsewhere, the USD/CNY pair rose 0.1% to 6.4646, after some late yuan selling. Earlier Tuesday, China set the official yuan exchange rate at the strongest since abandoning its peg in 2005, with the midpoint at 6.4760 per dollar prior to the market open, 1% firmer than the previous fix. That fpllowed the New York Stock Exchange's abrupt change of heart on delisting some of the country's biggest telecoms companies, a move that some interpreted as a hint of rapprochement between the U.S. and China after Donald Trump leaves the White House.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, but with investors turning to safe-haven assets as the number of COVID-19 cases and uncertainty about a U.S. runoff election in Georgia mount.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 89.812 by 8:49 PM ET (1:49 AM GMT), little changed and holding onto gains from the previous session.
Voting for the election in Georgia begins later in the day and will be watched closely. Two Senate seats, and control of the chamber, is up for grabs in the election. The election will also determine the ease with which President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda, including rewriting the tax code, boosting stimulus and infrastructure spending, will be implemented.
Some investors predicted that the greenback would continue to weaken amid expectations that risk sentiment will continue to improve in 2021.
“The dollar will continue to trade with the general risk sentiment,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.

The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3573. The pound came under pressure as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday ordered a new, tougher national lockdown to contain a surge of COVID-10 cases in the country.
Johnson was cautious about giving a firm lockdown timetable but said that if the vaccine rollout went as planned and the number of deaths decreased in response to the lockdown measures as expected, it could be possible to start moving out of lockdown by mid-February."

Investing.com – The pound fell sharply against the dollar Monday after the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a third national lockdown for England until mid-February to curb rising infections that threaten to overrun hospitals across the country.
GBP/USD fell 0.8% to $1.3556.
From midnight Monday, England will head into a third nationwide lockdown, with most schools and non-essential retailers are set to close, Johnson said after heeding a warning that health services could be overwhelmed in just 21 days without further restrictions.
""We must go into a lockdown which is tough enough to contain the new [coronavirus] variant,"" Johnson said.
The new coronavirus strain, forecast to be between 50% and 70% more infectious than the original strain, is starting to take its toll on the health services as infections rose by a record 58,784 on Monday from 55,157 a day earlier. That was the seventh-straight day of more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The move marked a blow to expectations that restrictions could be lifted by Easter, with experts predicting a further delay would slow the economic recovery, and prompt the Bank of England to ease monetary policy.
""(A) further imminent tightening and extension of English containment measures … [increases] risks of a contraction in U.K. GDP in Q1 and an easing of monetary policy in due course,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said.
Unlike the previous lockdown in the spring, the UK will be ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history,"" the prime minister said. ""By the middle February... we expect to offer first vaccine dose to everyone to top priority groups [including residents in care homes and their carers, for older adults over 70 and the vulnerablable],"" he added.
The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine distribution program got underway on Monday. The prime minister warned that while the vaccine would eventually lead to the lifting of many restrictions, there would be a time lag before the pressure alleviated on the National Health Service.
Ahead of this decision, the prime minister had faced calls from opposition leaders to impose a new national lockdown to allow vaccines to be delivered.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held near mid-2018 lows on Monday as bullish sentiment across global markets prompted investors to buy riskier currencies such as the Chinese yuan, despite a resurgent pandemic. 
Low U.S. interest rates, massive U.S. budget and trade deficits and a belief that rebounding world trade will drive non-dollar currencies higher have set the dollar on a downward course. 
""The U.S. dollar slipped further through the threshold of the new year as global risk sentiment stayed buoyant"", said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
The dollar index posted its first annual los9s since 2017 last year. It has fallen roughly 13% from a three-year peak at the height of the pandemic panic in March.
It was last 0.14% weaker at 89.640 and not far above last week's more than two-and-a-half-year low of 89.515. 
Manufacturing activity expanded in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, according to PMI surveys, the latest indication that manufacturers in the region continue to recover from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
The Chinese yuan rose over 0.9% to a 30-month high of 6.4693 per dollar.
Chinese factory activity continued to accelerate in December, though the PMI missed forecasts at 53.0.
The safe-haven yen rose 0.4% to 102.90 per dollar, and looked to test resistance at 102.55, after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said his government was mulling a state of emergency in Tokyo as coronavirus cases rise. 
The softening dollar boosted commodity prices and pushed bitcoin as well as several Asian currencies to milestone highs.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars each gained close to 0.4% to hold just below multi-year peaks. [AUD/] 
The euro, which had dipped on New Year's Eve profit-taking, rose 0.4% to $1.2270 while traders waited for a fresh batch of economic indicators throughout the region.
Sterling, still boosted by Britain's trade deal with the European Union, gained to $1.3678, levels last seen in early 2018. 
Investors are now focused on a runoff election in the U.S. state of Georgia on Tuesday that will determine control of the Senate.
Jeffrey Halley, a market analyst at Oanda warned his clients against sharp moves in the dollar after that election. 
""A Democrat win is likely to see a sharp correction higher by the US Dollar, exacerbated by the world being universally short the greenback"", he said. ""Investors should probably wait for the election dust to settle before committing heavily to new dollar short positions. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting due on Wednesday should offer more detail on discussions about making the Fed's forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying this year.
The data calendar includes manufacturing surveys across the globe, which will show how industry is coping with the spread of the coronavirus, and the closely watched ISM surveys of U.S. factories and services.
Bitcoin on Monday was off Sunday's record high of $34,800 at $32,340. An enormous rally has carried it up 800% since March as institutional investors seem to have turned buyers.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened Monday, remaining friendless amid expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain low for a prolonged period while hopes grow for a global economic recovery as Covid-19 vaccines are rolled out.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 89.597, not far above a more than 2-1/2 year low of 89.515 made last week. The index dropped more than 7% last year, its first annual loss since 2017.
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 102.95, after Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, said his government is mulling a state of emergency in Tokyo as infections rise.
EUR/USD rose 1% to 1.2262, GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.3693, at levels last seen in early 2018, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7721.
We “remain upbeat on EUR/USD, EM FX and risk assets in general into the start of this year and we don’t really want to question this narrative until the recovery is strong enough for both fiscal and monetary administrations to consider removing the foot from the QE/stimulus-pedal,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Early signs of the thinking of members of the U.S. Federal Reserve will come with the minutes of the December meeting on Wednesday. These should offer more detail on discussions about making the central bank’s forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying this year.
The data calendar includes the release of a number manufacturing surveys across the globe later Monday, but most eyes will be on Tuesday's Senate run-offs in Georgia, which will determine which party controls the Senate. A victory for either of the Republican incumbents would insure their party keeps a narrow majority in the Senate. But if the Democrat candidates win, the dollar could be further weakened by the expected higher stimulus spending pushed by their party and the associated improved market sentiment.
Friday’s official U.S. employment report.will also be present in traders' minds.
Meanwhile, Britain is set to become the first country to roll out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University, a cheaper and more easily stored alternative to the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, which is already in use. 
This will become another step forward in the global response to the pandemic, hopefully shortening the time before some form of herd immunity can be achieved and economies across the globe can reopen.
Elsewhere, the USD/CNY pair fell 1.1% to 6.4632, with the yuan climbing to a 2.5-year high, boosted by the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index coming in at 53 for December, indicating continued growth in the important manufacturing sector. The yuan is also now used as a favored vehicle for shorting the dollar as China’s economic recovery continues.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with investors continuing to put pressure on the safe-haven asset on the first trading day of 2021. Expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain low and hopes for an eventual global economic recovery from COVID-19 will likely continue to slow the dollar down against other major currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.25% to 89.677 by 8:56 PM ET (1:56 AM GMT), slightly below 89.766, where it ended 2020.
Trade is still thin as investors return from the holiday season, but some short sellers were already betting against the greenback and reversing the small bounce it enjoyed on the last trading day of 2020 when profit-taking lent support.
The Federal Reserve is due to release the minutes from its December meeting on Wednesday. Investors will be looking for more detail on the discussions about making their forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying in 2021.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.13% to 103.06. Japanese media reported that a state of emergency is being considered for Tokyo and could be declared within the week. With the city dealing with record levels of infections, investors will pay close attention to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s news conference to mark the start of 2021, due to take place later in the day.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 0.7716 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7199. The news from Japan saw the risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies steady after unwinding what would have been small earlier gains.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.10% to 6.5267. In China, the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was released earlier in the day, with a reading of 53 for December. The figure was lower than the 54.8 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 54.9 reading.
The yuan, now viewed as a favored vehicle for shorting the dollar as China’s economic recovery continues, climbed roughly 0.2 to 6.4927 per dollar in offshore trade, close to reaching a two-and-a-half-year low.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.3683. The pound also saw its gains capped as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase and U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Sunday that tougher restrictions were likely on the way to curb the surge.
Across the Atlantic, all eyes are on the Jan. 5 runoff vote in the U.S. state of Georgia, which will determine which party controls the Senate and how successfully President-elect Joe Biden can implement his agenda.
Georgia has not elected a Democrat senator in two decades, with a victory of either or both Republican incumbents sealing a narrow majority in the Senate for the Republicans. However, if the Democrat candidates win, the dollar could be further weakened by the expected higher stimulus spending pushed by their party and the improved market sentiment.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is also continuing an extraordinary rally, and was just below the record high of $34,800 seen on Sunday. It has gained more than 65% after crossing the $20,000-mark around two weeks ago and rose 300% in 2020."

Investing.com - The euro took a breather against the dollar Thursday, and while the single currency is set to close higher for the year, analysts call for a healthy dose of caution heading into 2021.
EUR/USD fell 0.68% to $1.2211, but remains on track to close up about 9% higher for the year.
The euro has benefitted from weakness in the dollar as the pandemic pushed the Federal Reserve to pull all the monetary policy stops including slashing rates to near zero to cushion the pandemic-led economic fallout.
But heading into 2021, the mass distribution of vaccines could steady the U.S. economy, helping it outperform its peers, giving the dollar a much-needed tailwind.
Yet, others suggest that the U.S. outperformance versus EU may not directly prompt a rebound in the greenback if the gap in growth is not significant.
""Relative financial conditions between the Euro area and the US are pointing to a substantial possibility of US outperformance of the Euro area in 2021 but as long as the global growth rebound is perceived as synchronized and broad-based, the USD smile is telling you to buy EUR vs. USD,""Nordea said.
In another ominous sign, the euro appears to be following the course of history, indulging in its post-election slump seen previously.
""(The) EUR/USD has behaved very much like after the presidential elections of 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. And if this history keeps rhyming, the pair may peak – surprisingly early – around New Year’s Eve,"" Nordea added."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar was ending 2020 in a downward spiral on Thursday with investors wagering a global economic recovery will suck money into riskier assets even as the U.S. has to borrow ever more to fund its swelling twin deficits.
The euro stood at $1.2291, having hit its highest since April 2018 with a gain of almost 10% for the year. The next stops for the bull train are $1.2413 and $1.2476, on the way to the 2018 peak at $1.2555.
The dollar was lying at 103.15 yen, but managed to hold above the December low of 102.86. 
It also fell against the Chinese yuan, breachingh 6.4900 for the first time since mid-2018, though Chinese banks were later reported to be buying dollars to limit the drop.
Sterling held gains after lawmakers approved a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union, stretching as far as $1.3641 a level unseen since May 2018.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar had sunk to 89.643, having touched it lowest since April 2018. That left it down 7.2% on the year, and no less than 13% on the 102.99 peak hit during the market mayhem of mid-March.
The next target is 89.277 and then 88.251, which was the absolute low in 2018.
The prospect of a brighter 2021 has lessened the need for the safe-haven dollar, while burnishing the attraction of riskier assets especially in emerging markets.
Bears have also resurrected the ""twin deficits"" excuse for shorting the dollar - that the explosion in the budget and trade deficits means more dollars being printed and moved abroad.
From this perspective the new U.S. stimulus bill is dollar negative as it adds to the nation's debt, and President-elect Joe Biden is promising a lot more next year.
The country is also haemorrhaging dollars on its trade account where the deficit on goods hit a record $84.8 billion in November as imports surged past pre-pandemic levels.
Likewise, the current account deficit widened to a 12-year high in the third quarter and there was a large shortfall in net financial transactions as Americans borrowed more from abroad.
In contrast, the European Union runs a huge current account surplus, largely thanks to Germany, so there is a natural inflow to euros through trade.
""The U.S. dependence on foreign savings is increasing and at 3.4% of GDP, it is approaching a danger zone where it will become increasingly difficult to attract savings without further dollar weakness, or higher interest rates,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX at Deutsche, in a note.

""The deterioration in the 'twin deficits' will do nothing to improve USD sentiment, even if it does not as yet justify extreme USD undershooting either.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia. It ended 2020 on a down note over bets that a global economic recovery in 2021 will pull money into riskier assets, even as the growing U.S. ‘twin deficits’ of a huge budget increase and trade deficits argue for an ever-cheaper greenback.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 89.498 by 8:54 PM ET (1:54 AM GMT). The dollar saw its lowest level since April 2018 and is down 7.2% on the year.
Hopes that 2021 will be better than 2020 have led to a retreat from the safe-haven dollar, with investors increasingly turning to the more attractive riskier assets, particularly in emerging markets. Bears have also been resurrecting the ‘twin deficits’ excuse to short the dollar, with the deficits meaning that more dollars are being printed and moved overseas.
The U.S. stimulus bill, passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate during the past week, also will be negative for the dollar as U.S. debt balloons and President-elect Joe Biden promises even more measures when his administration takes office in January.
Also dampening sentiment for the dollar is the U.S. trade account. The account has been bleeding dollars as the deficit on goods hit a record $84.8 billion in November, with imports soaring past pre-COVID-19 levels. The current account deficit also saw a 12-year high in the third quarter, with a large shortfall in net financial transactions as Americans borrowed more from abroad.
“The U.S. dependence on foreign savings is increasing and at 3.4% of GDP, it is approaching a danger zone where it will become increasingly difficult to attract savings without further dollar weakness, or higher interest rates,” Deutsche global head of G10 FX Alan Ruskin warned in a note.
“The deterioration in the ‘twin deficits’ will do nothing to improve dollar sentiment, even if it does not as yet justify extreme dollar undershooting either,” the note added.
Across the Atlantic, the European Union (EU) is ending 2020 with a huge current account surplus, thanks in large part to Germany. The surplus means that there is a natural inflow to euros through trade, and the euro is at $1.2305, after seeing its highest since April 2018 with a gain of almost 10% for the year. Bulls are looking to see if the euro will hit $1.2413 and $1.2476, two stops on the way to 2018’s peak of $1.2555.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.06% to 103.10. Japanese markets are closed ahead of the new year.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.31% to 0.7708 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.37% to 0.7230.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.03% to 6.5191. Data released earlier in the day in China showed December’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)  at 51.9, down from the reading of 52 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 52.1 figure. The data also showed December’s non-manufacturing PMI at 55.7, also down from November’s reading of 56.4.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3643, levels that have not been seen since May 2018. The pound was boosted by the post-Brexit trade deal struck between the U.K. and the EU becoming law after the Queen gave her approval earlier in the day. The House of Lords gave the bill to approve the deal an unopposed third reading late on Wednesday, after MPs had voted it through by 521 votes to 73."

Investing.com – The pound rose against the dollar to a nearly one-week high, shrugging off another surge in Covid-19 cases that forced further parts of England into further lockdown.
GBP/USD rose 0.8% to $1.3609, its highest level since Dec. 24.
Several areas of the country went into the toughest tier four restrictions on Wednesday after Covid-19 cases surged above 50,000 for the second day in a row.
The UK reported 50,023 cases on Wednesday, just below the record 53,275 seen a day earlier, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn that people should not ""in any way think that this is over.""
""We are continuing to see unprecedented levels of COVID-19 infection across the UK, which is of extreme concern particularly as our hospitals are at their most vulnerable,"" said Susan Hopkins, a senior medical advisor to Public Health England.
The lockdown measures are expected to lead to a larger decline in UK growth, an economic think tank warned.
""By Easter that could mean the economy being 6% smaller than what was hoped just a month ago,"" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of Resolution Foundation, according to the Guardian.
As the pandemic looks set to worsen by the day, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) offered a semblance of hope as its coronavirus vaccine was approved for emergency use in the UK. It could be distributed early in the New Year.
The bitter-sweet day in the UK arrived just as the post-Brexit agreement won the backing of parliament by 521-73 votes.
The deal has, however, came under fresh scrutiny for its lack of coverage for the UK's crucial financial services sector.
“In 2018 in Mansion house, I said that we wanted to work to get a financial services deal in the future treaty arrangement and that it would be truly groundbreaking,” former Prime Minister Theresa May said.
""It would have been, but sadly it has not been achieved. We have a deal in trade which benefits the EU, but not a deal in services that would have benefited the UK.""",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slid to its lowest in more than two years on Wednesday and riskier currencies gained, as investors looked past rising COVID-19 infections and the latest delay in U.S. fiscal stimulus talks to bet on an economic recovery in 2021.
Lockdown measures in England will be extended, and U.S. President-elect Joe Biden warned that it could take years for most Americans to be vaccinated against COVID-19 at current rates.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked a vote on increasing COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000, adding another delay to fractious negotiations over fiscal stimulus.
But market sentiment was upbeat as investors remained optimistic that a stimulus deal will be eventually reached and that COVID-19 vaccines will facilitate a global economic recovery, lessening demand for the safe-haven dollar.
The latest setback ""doesn’t really matter too much for investors, as they have been over the moon on the back of news that there is still plenty of fiscal support for the U.S. economy,"" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said in a note.
Analysts expect the dollar to weaken further in 2021 as U.S. President-elect Biden is expected to push for even more measures to support the U.S. economy.
The ""risk-on"" moves in currency markets saw major currencies reach record levels in the Asian session on Wednesday, ease off as European markets opened, then hit new records as the European session continued.
At 1159 GMT, the dollar was down around 0.3% versus a basket of currencies at 89.737, having dropped as low as 89.681 shortly before 1100 GMT. The euro was up at $1.22715.
The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for global risk appetite - was up 0.8% on the day at 0.7664 at 1202 GMT. The New Zealand dollar also hit two-year highs.
The dollar lost out to the Japanese yen, with dollar-yen down 0.4% at 103.13.
In Europe, sentiment was buoyed by Britain becoming the first country in the world to approve the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University.
The British pound was up against the dollar at $1.3607, but little changed against the euro, as traders returning from the Christmas break digested the Brexit deal struck on Dec. 24.
Although the agreement avoids a chaotic no-deal exit, it does not cover services, which make up 80% of the British economy.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) wrote in a note to clients that the lack of an equivalence framework for financial services in the deal and growing support for Scottish independence are new headwinds for the pound.
Euro zone government bond yields edged up by around one to two basis points, with Germany's benchmark 10-year yield at -0.562% at 1206 GMT.
There were some signs of increasing inflation expectations. Breakeven rates on 10-year TIPS, which measure expected annual inflation for the next decade, slipped to 1.962%.
""The rapid growth in U.S. money supply and rising commodity prices are stirring up fears about a return of inflation,"" wrote  Schroders  (LON:SDR) analysts in a note.
""These concerns are reflected in inflation-linked securities, with the 10-year breakeven inflation rate in the U.S. having risen from 0.5% in March to just under 2% today,"" they said.
The euro zone's five-year, five-year inflation forward reached its highest since February earlier in December.

Investing.com -- The dollar weakened further in early trade in Europe on Wednesday, as the effective rejection of higher stimulus checks to U.S. households by Republican Senators failed to interrupt the steady flow of money into higher-yielding currencies.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had refused to timetable a vote on raising the direct payments that are set to go to most U.S. households from $600 to $2,000.  Instead, McConnell introduced a bill that would bundle that measure with others – on liability protections for Internet companies and on alleged election irregularities - that are certain to be rejected by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.
By 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of half a dozen advanced economy currencies, was down another 0.1% at 89.840. The biggest gainers within that basket were the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which continued to enjoy support from rising prices for industrial and agricultural commodities.
AUD/USD rose as high as 0.7664 overnight, its highest since June 2018, while the kiwi traded as high as 1.3909 to the dollar, its highest since April 2018.
Both currencies have in recent years been heavily influenced by Chinese demand for raw materials and food, and they pared their gains moderately after China revised down its estimate for gross domestic product growth in 2019 by 0.1% to 6.1%.
The British pound also rose 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro, at the start of a day when the U.K.-EU trade deal is set to be voted through both chambers of parliament. There was additional support from the announcement that U.K. regulators have approved the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine, paving the way for inoculations to begin in the new year. U.K. Health Minister Matt Hancock said the breakthrough could lead to the end of lockdown measures by spring.
The U.K.’s economy has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, owing to the authorities’ failure to stop its spread in its first phase, and to the disproportionately high share of services in its GDP.
Among emerging currencies, the Turkish lira rose to its highest since August, extending the gains it has made since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan abandoned his previous economic policies and swapped out his finance minister and central bank governor.
After a lull over the holiday period, the data calendar in the U.S. returns to life later on Wednesday with the release of the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index at 9:45 AM ET and existing home sales  for November at 10 AM."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with investors looking past a Senate delay in U.S. stimulus checks and continuing to bet that additional financial aid is still likely.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.24% to 89.713 by 9:03 PM ET (2:03 AM GMT), near its lowest level in more than two years.
The House of Representatives approved increasing the amount of the stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 earlier in the week. With all eyes now on the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved on Tuesday to block the amount increase.
The greenback has seen steady losses ever since President Donald Trump signed a combined $2.3 trillion COVID-19 and spending bill on Sunday. Investors retreated from the dollar as the prospect of more U.S. stimulus reduced demand for safe-haven assets.
The last-minute infighting still did little to quench hopes of more fiscal stimulus measures, as the U.S. continues to see large numbers of COVID-19 cases that threatens the country’s economic recovery.
Although the size of the stimulus checks remains in question, some investors warned that the dollar is likely to continue falling in 2021 as they expect President-elect Joe Biden to roll out further stimulus measures. Biden and his administration are due to be sworn in on Jan. 20.
“Our weak dollar call remains intact as we move into 2021,” BBH analysts said in a note.
“What happens to the greenback... largely depends on how well the U.S. controls COVID-19 in 2021 as well as the outlook for further fiscal stimulus,” the note added.
Another factor dampening dollar sentiment is investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain low interest rates for an extremely long period of time.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.19% to 103.36.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.39% to 0.7635 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.41% to 0.7177. The dollar’s loss was the two Antipodean currencies’ gain, as the pair are considered barometers of risk appetite due to their ties to global commodities.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.5256. China is due to release data, including the manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), on Thursday.

743,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank reiterated its pledge to avoid a sudden shift in monetary policy while it maintains necessary support for the economy’s recovery.
The main priority is stability, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement late Tuesday after its quarterly policy meeting, vowing to “make no sharp turn” on policy. Monetary policy should be flexible, targeted, reasonable and appropriate, it said, reiterating comments from the Communist Party’s recent Central Economic Work Conference.
The PBOC has been signaling a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus as business activity returns to normal and debt levels soar. The recent statements from authorities suggest a “more moderate” stance compared with previous calls on stimulus exit, according to Huachuang Securities analysts, including Zhou Guannan.
The central bank said it will use various policy tools to keep liquidity reasonably ample and keep the growth of money supply and credit in line with nominal economic growth. The macro leverage ratio should also be kept stable, it said.
A key goal is to strike a balance between supporting the recovery and preventing financial risks, the PBOC said. The central bank will also deepen market-based reforms of the interest-rate and exchange-rate systems and guide financial institutions and other companies to stick with “risk-neutral” thinking, it said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest in more than two years against the euro on Wednesday as currency traders looked past a new delay in U.S. stimulus cheques and maintained bets additional financial aid was still likely.
The greenback was also pinned near two-year lows against the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked immediate consideration of a measure to increase COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000, adding another twist to fractious negotiations over fiscal stimulus.
The dollar has fallen steadily since President Donald Trump signed a coronavirus aid and spending bill on Sunday, because more stimulus for the world's largest economy reduces demand for the perceived safety of holding the greenback.
While the size of relief payments is still uncertain, many analysts say the dollar is likely to resume falling next year because President-elect Joe Biden is expected to push for even more economic support measures.
""Our weak dollar call remains intact as we move into 2021,"" analysts at BBH wrote in a research memo.
""What happens to the greenback... largely depends on how well the United States controls the virus in 2021 as well as the outlook for further fiscal stimulus."" 
The dollar fell to $1.2279 per euro on Wednesday in Asia, its weakest since April 2018
The British pound was steady at $1.3511.
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar bought 0.8839, close to the weakest in more than five years.
The dollar was little changed at 103.53 yen.
Market moves are likely to be subdued due to low liquidity with many investors away for year-end holidays.
A light data calendar in Asia is also likely to leave traders with little incentive to take out big positions.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 89.974, not far from the lowest in more than two years.
Last-minute infighting has cast doubt on some of the details of the U.S. aid package, but many analysts say the U.S. government will keep rolling out fiscal stimulus in some form because a second wave of coronavirus infections is becoming a big threat to the economy.
In addition, many investors are already looking ahead to a new government under Biden when he is sworn in on Jan. 20.
Another negative factor for the greenback is expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for an extremely long time, many analysts say.
Elsewhere, both the Australian dollar edged up slightly to $0.7615, while the New Zealand dollar bought $0.7157.
Both the Aussie and the kiwi are considered barometers of risk appetite because of their ties to global commodities.

Investing.com – The pound rose against the dollar Tuesday, clawing back some of its losses from a day earlier, though concerns the Brexit trade deal is too skinny as it fails to cover the crucial UK services sector kept gains in check.
GBP/USD rose 0.3% to $1.3493.
EU member states formally approved the post-Brexit deal on Tuesday, paving the way for the agreement to be signed into law on Wednesday ahead of the transition period deadline on Thursday.
The approval was largely expected, however, as chances were slim at best that EU members would veto the deal. With a no-deal Brexit scenario averted just days ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, the accord has come under scrutiny as market participants worry the exclusion of services from the deal, will stifle the UK's financial services sector.
From 1 January, UK financial firms will lose their ‘passporting’ rights, which have allowed them to do business freely across the EU.
After signing the agreement last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson conceded that on financial services the deal ""perhaps does not go as far as we would like.""
In a sign that the worries are not misplaced, shares of several UK banks closed sharply lower on Tuesday, with Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) closing 5% lower.
A quick-fix negotiation to reinstate passporting rights for UK financial services firms under the equivalence measure - a system used to grant domestic market access to foreign firms in certain areas of financial services - is unlikely, experts warn.
""The EU has not yet finished its equivalence assessments, and has expressed concern about the UK’s plans for its future regulatory framework and the degree of divergence from the EU regime this might entail. It is likely that the Commission will continue its assessments well into 2021,"" said Mark Simpson, a partner in Baker McKenzie’s financial services unit, according to City AM."

Investing.com -- The dollar slipped further on Tuesday as market participants continued to position themselves for a strong economic rebound across the globe in 2021 that is widely expected to benefit higher-yielding currencies and emerging market economies more than the greenback. 
By 4:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, was down 0.3% at 90.002, barely one-quarter of a percent above the 32-month low that it hit earlier in December.
The dollar also slid against emerging currencies, with the Turkish lira, the Russian ruble and the Indian rupee all rising by over 0.2%.  The rupee benefited from the Reserve Bank of India reaffirming its 4% inflation target, which appears to set limits to any further easing from the central bank, given that inflation is currently running at just under 7%.
The broad risk-on move was supported by the House of Representatives' vote approving an initiative by President Donald Trump to increase the size of direct payments to households under the new U.S. coronavirus relief package to $2,000 from the $600 originally foreseen. It isn't clear yet whether the Senate, which reconvenes on Tuesday, will schedule a vote on the measure. Republicans who have a majority in the upper chamber have traditionally opposed higher payments, but are under pressure on two fronts to go along with the measure, which would provide more effective near-term support for household spending. 
On the one hand, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has threatened to filibuster a vote that is already scheduled to overturn Trump's veto of a separate bill on defense spending, unless the chamber also makes time for a vote on higher stimulus checks. On the other, the GOP also faces two key runoff elections in Georgia on January 5th that will determine control of the Senate for the next two years. Some have already signaled that they're afraid that a refusal to increase the payments could tip the runoffs against them, giving the Democratic Party full control of Congress. 
Sterling and the euro both gained as EU ambassadors approved the free trade deal struck by the two sides before Christmas, something that paves the way for formal approval from EU member states' governments later on Tuesday. The pound rose 0.5% to $1.3512, recouping the losses it suffered on Monday, while the euro rose to $1.2252, on course for a new 32-month high.
""“Although the rally in the GBP in 2020 suggests the FX market anticipated that a deal was more likely than not, confirmation allows the FX market to price out whatever modest probability had been attached to a ‘no-deal’ outcome,"" analysts at HSBC wrote in a note to clients. ""In our view, the announcement should keep the GBP elevated over the near-term, but further upside will likely be limited, given the agreement looks largely priced in.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar languished near a 2-1/2-year low on Tuesday as investors were encouraged to take on more risk as U.S. lawmakers pushed forward with an enhanced COVID-19 relief package.
The House of Representatives voted on Monday to increase stimulus payments to qualified Americans to $2,000 from $600, sending the measure on to the Senate for a vote.
Last week's Brexit agreement, while bare bones, also supported the outlook for global growth, lifting Asian stocks on Tuesday following Wall Street gains.
""Optimism abounds, and it’s generally coming from equity markets,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch manager of  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank and Trust.
""The dollar is very heavy, and that will continue into next year.""
The dollar index declined 0.1% to 90.125 in holiday-thinned trading, wallowing near the 89.723 level reached on Dec. 17 for the first time since April 2018.
Short positions on the dollar swelled in the week ended Dec. 21 to $26.6 billion, the highest in three months, according to Reuters' calculations based on data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday.
The euro rose 0.2% to $1.22375 in the Asian session, hovering near the 2-1/2-year high of 1.22735 touched earlier this month.
The dollar bought 103.695 yen, little changed against another safe-haven currency.
Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.3484 following a two-day decline. It was as high as $1.3625 this month, a level unseen since May 2018, but investors have taken profits following the confirmation last week of a Brexit trade deal.
While the pact came as a relief, it leaves Britain far more detached from the EU, analysts say.
""People are still trying to figure out what this Brexit agreement means,"" weighing on the pound, said State Street's Wakabayashi. 
""Nothing has really been agreed on financial markets, and that’s a big negative for the UK.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, staying near two-and-a-half-year lows as progress on the latest U.S. stimulus measures increased risk appetite.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.24% to 90.058 by 11:28 PM ET (4:28 AM GMT). The dollar hovered near the 89.723 level reached on Dec. 17, a level last seen in April 2018.
The House of Representatives voted to increase the amount of stimulus checks to qualified Americans from $600 to $2,000 on Monday, with the Senate preparing to vote on the increased amount.
The post-Brexit trade deal reached between the European Union (EU) and the U.K. during the previous week also increased investors’ risk appetite. Although the agreement was lacking in detail, the improved outlook for global growth and economic recovery from COVID-19 saw gains in global shares.
Some investors expected the dollar’s decline to continue.
“Optimism abounds, and it’s generally coming from equity markets. The dollar is very heavy, and that will continue into next year,”  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank and Trust Tokyo Branch manager Bart Wakabayashi told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.09% to 103.69.
The AUD/USD pair was up x0.24% to 0.7595 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.28% to 0.7118. Both Antipodean markets re-opened after a holiday on Monday.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.5318.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.30% to 1.3489. The pound reversed two days of decline, and even saw a high of $1.3625 earlier in the month, a level it has not reached since May 2018.
Investors took profits in the U.K. currency as the Brexit deal, already widely expected, was confirmed just before the Christmas holidays.
Although investors breathed a sigh of relief as the agreement came before the end-of-year deadline, there were arguments that the deal leaves the U.K. more detached from the EU.
Investors are also still figuring out what the agreement means for the pound.
“People are still trying to figure out what this Brexit agreement means,” weighing on the pound, said State Street’s Wakabayashi.
The fact that the deal does not cover the financial markets is also a nagging concern.
“Nothing has really been agreed on financial markets, and that’s a big negative for the U.K.,” Wakabayashi added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The euro was boosted on Monday as risk sentiment improved in the wake of Britain's trade deal with the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to approve a new fiscal stimulus package.
Britain on Thursday clinched a narrow Brexit trade deal with the EU, just seven days before it exits one of the world's biggest trading blocs in its most significant global shift since the loss of its empire.
""What we are seeing is a continuation of the pricing out of hard Brexit risk,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Risk sentiment also improved after Trump on Sunday signed into law a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown.
The euro gained 0.43% to 126.77 yen. It reached a seven-month high of 1.0892 against the Swiss franc, before falling back to 1.0858, up 0.04% on the day.
The single currency was down 0.09% against the U.S. dollar at $1.2209.
It gained 1.00% against sterling to 0.9077.
Sterling has underperformed since the Brexit deal was reached, with traders saying the news was likely priced in.
Also ""I would argue that this is markets slowly but surely acknowledging that this is not an optimal deal for the UK,"" said Andreas Steno Larsen, global chief FX and rates strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
""This is rather a very slim deal that merely avoids the cliff edge, but there are still large gaps that will have to be dealt with in 2021, and frictionless trade is not secured,"" Larsen said.
The British pound dipped 0.66% against the U.S. dollar to $1.3447, and was holding below a two-and-a-half-year high of $1.3625 reached on Dec. 17.
Bitcoin climbed 2.74% to $26,695 but was below a record high $28,378 reached on Sunday.
""There is a lot of enthusiasm among (crypto) traders who truly believe in this asset class, and they know that the rally has only begun because we were only recovering losses for the past few years,"" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, said in a report.
The dollar gained 0.14% against a basket of currencies to 90.32.
Investors are betting the dollar will continue to decline - it fell more than 6% this year - on expectations the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates near zero and the U.S. economy will struggle to recover from coronavirus-related shutdowns.
Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, expects the dollar index to test its February 2018 low of 88.25. Then ""what happens to the greenback after that will largely depend on how well the U.S. controls the virus in 2021 as well as the outlook for further fiscal stimulus,"" Thin said in a report.
The dollar slipped 0.16% against the Canadian dollar to $1.2848.

Investing.com – The pound fell sharply against the dollar Monday, as market participants flagged concerns the post-Brexit trade accord will slow trade after the crucial services sector was largely excluded from the deal.
GBP/USD fell 0.7% to $1.3451.
""The agreement avoids chaos and a reversion to WTO [World Trade Origanization] rules …. But trade will be slowed in the future by non-tariff barriers…"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Services, meanwhile, ""were largely left out of the negotiations, even though they are much more important for the UK in particular than the exchange of goods,"" it added.
Market participants continue to parse the agreement, which received the backing of all European Union members on Monday, paving the way for the new agreement to come into effect on a provisional basis from Jan. 1.
The deal will require the backing of lawmakers in the UK, with a vote expected to get underway on Dec. 30.
The European Central Bank estimates that Brexit will shave about 2.1% from GDP in the UK and 0.4% in the 27 EU member states in the EU over the long term.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has indicated the UK can sign trade deals with numerous nations including the U.S. to boost growth. But trade between the EU and UK dwarfs that of the US and UK.
In 2019, the EU made up 43% of all UK exports and 53% of all UK imports, with value of exports to the EU valued at £294 billion (about  $400 billion) compared with U.S. imports of $63 billion.
A new U.S.-UK trade deal in the near-term is unlikely as president-elect Biden has suggested that domestic policies will take priority.
Despite the 4% rise in the pound against the dollar in the final quarter of the year, sterling still remains below its pre-Brexit level of $1.41 seen in June 2016, just before the outcome of the EU referendum."

Investing.com -- The dollar edged lower on Monday after President Donald Trump finally signed the government spending and coronavirus relief packages, after a bizarre intervention before the Christmas holiday in which he took issue with a number of spending proposals previously approved by his administration.
By 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, was down 0.3% at 89.953, only 0.3% above the two-year low that it posted earlier in December.
In a holiday-thinned market, the signing of the bill removes a lingering source of uncertainty, encouraging the embrace of riskier assets, as people position for a global recovery in 2021.
“Easy financial conditions, positive vaccine news and prospects of a big rebound in global trade growth has led to a benign environment for EM FX,” analysts at Nordea said in a weekly research note, highlighting the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and South African rand as particularly well placed to benefit from the rollout of anti-Covid-19 vaccines next year.
Also supporting risk sentiment is the agreement between the EU and U.K. over their trading arrangements in the new year, which appears to have averted the threat of chaos at the border from January 1st (even though the closure of the Channel Tunnel before Christmas due to the latest Covid-19 scare was just as effective in disrupting trade).
However, Sterling is showing signs of flagging after an initial boost. By 5 AM ET, it was flat against the dollar at $1.3551, while it was down 0.3% against the euro at 1.1071. Over the weekend, it became apparent that many key questions on the details of the new arrangements remain unanswered, including – crucially for the U.K. economy – the level of access to the single market allowed to Britain’s financial services sector.
""“We do not see this as any game-changer for markets,"" analysts at Toronto Dominion Securities said in a note to clients. ""A deal was in the price and the specifics are unlikely to have any bearing on the direction of markets from here. While GBP is very cheap across many of our valuation models and much of the negotiation-linked uncertainty can fade, there is still significant economic underperformance and disruptions to follow early in 2021.”
The EUR/USD benefited more, rising 0.3% to $1.2237, within touching distance of its highest level since April 2018. It also rose 0.5% against the Swiss franc to a six-month high of 1.0885, another cross that pointed to a general drop in fear. The only currency in Europe stronger than the euro was the Polish zloty, which resumed its upward trend after a week in which the central bank intervened on the currency markets to stop it appreciating.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound hovered below a 2-1/2-year high on Friday after Britain and the European Union struck a narrow Brexit trade deal, while overall sentiment in currency markets was tempered by a stalled U.S. coronavirus economic relief package.
The sterling last stood at $1.3549, having failed to rise above its 2-1/2-year high of $1.3625 hit last week Britain clinched a Brexit trade deal with the EU, just seven days before it exits the world's biggest trading bloc.
Against the euro, the pound fetched 89.80 pence per euro, after scaling a three-week high of 89.54 on Thursday.
The British currency also hit a 3-1/2-month high of 141.06 yen before easing to 140.22 on the Japanese currency, though trade was slow as many financial markets were shut for Christmas. 
While the Brexit deal will preserve Britain's zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market and avoid a damaging ""no-deal"" exit, it does not cover the nation's much larger and influential finance sector. And, Brussels has made no decision yet on whether to grant Britain access to the bloc's financial market. 
""It is important to recognise this is just the beginning of a new trading relationship that can be built on,"" wrote Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in London.
""We also have to stand by for both sides to spin the deal in their respective ways designed for domestic consumption. Invariably the national press will respectively talk of ‘wins’ versus the other side."" 
While the deal was a relief to every market player, the bare-bones nature of the pact leaves Britain far more detached from the EU, analysts say, suggesting the discount that has dogged UK assets since 2016 will not vanish soon. 
""Now the deal is done, over time, we are going to start to see economic impact of leaving the EU. And I think that's clearly negative for the UK economy,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank. 
""I would think the pound will slip after all things positive about a deal have already been priced in,"" he added.
Also hindering the UK economy in the near-term, the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in England jumped, with one in every 85 people infected in the latest week as a new infectious strain of virus rages in the south east of the country.
The U.S. dollar was hemmed in tight range as a standoff on a $2.3 trillion coronavirus in Washington continued and raised the prospect of a partial government shutdown.
The dollar traded at 103.55 yen, down 0.2% on the day while the euro traded almost flat at $1.2188. 
The dollar index stood at 90.285, off its 2 1/2-year low of 89.723 touched last week.
The offshore Chinese yuan was flat at 6.5185 per dollar.

753,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The ink is barely dry on the historic outline for a Brexit trade deal, yet pound prognosticators are delivering a reality check on the rally.
The general consensus is that much of the optimism is already priced in, with the currency up more than 9% since the end of June while the relative cost of hedging pound weakness over the next year at its lowest since March.
Investors are conscious of the limitations of any incoming accord and are looking ahead to the prospect of further coronavirus restrictions and the U.K.’s bleak economic outlook.
The pound will probably advance to $1.37 if the U.K. and European Union finalize a trade deal on Christmas Eve, according to Credit Agricole While that’s the highest level since May 2018, it’s just under a 1% gain from Thursday’s peak of $1.3586.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce says sterling could touch $1.3715, although it recommends selling the rally.
“The upside is pretty marginal now,” said Adam Cole, RBC Europe Ltd.‘s head of currency strategy. “Taking the bookies’ quotes as a proxy, the probability of a deal rose from 50% at the weekend to 90% yesterday, so I think the repricing is largely done.”
Any deal would conclude more than four years of fractious negotiations since the U.K.’s referendum on EU membership, setting up a new era of trade relations between Britain and the bloc. The uncertainty over the the country’s trading future and the expected economic damage from Brexit has held the pound captive below its pre-referendum range.
The caveat is that with liquidity diminishing during the Christmas period, the pound’s reaction to a decision over trade may be more volatile. Manuel Oliveri, a foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), said participation may be low because many clients have already closed their books for the year.
It’s one reason why an accord could send the pound soaring as much as 3%, before ending the day up 2%, Bob Stoutjesdijk, a Rotterdam-based fund manager at Robeco Institutional Asset Management, said on Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sterling extended gains on Thursday amid expectations a long-elusive Brexit deal was imminent, raising hopes the UK can avoid a turbulent economic rupture on New Year's Day.
The dollar was on the back foot in holiday-thinned trading as hopes for an agreement that would protect some $1 trillion in annual cross-channel trade from tariffs and quotas sapped demand for the safest assets.
The British pound strengthened 0.4% to $1.3546 in Asian hours after surging 0.9% in the previous session to snap a three-day losing streak.
The dollar index was at 90.233 following Wednesday's 0.3% slide. The euro strengthened 0.1% to $1.22030, adding to a 0.2% gain overnight.
While there has been no official confirmation from either side that the months of negotiations had reached a conclusion, a senior British government source said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was poised to do a trade deal with the EU, after media reports said the agreement had already been done.
A source at the EU's executive Commission said talks were still under way, and another British government source was also cautious, saying negotiations were ongoing.
""This time it really does appear that a deal will be struck just in time for Christmas,"" Westpac macro strategist Tim Riddell wrote in a client note dated Dec. 24.
""If a deal does transpire on 24th December, GBP is likely to make further gains"" toward $1.40, ""but potential for a more substantial move towards 1.4500 now seems unlikely given how positions exhaustion is so prevalent.""
The Brexit headlines overshadowed U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for changes to a coronavirus aid bill, effectively threatening a government shutdown next week.
The yen, another haven currency, was little changed at 103.56 per dollar. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Thursday the central bank is ready to take new steps to make its massive monetary easing more effective and sustainable.
The riskier Aussie dollar traded at 75.797 U.S. cents following the previous session's 0.8% jump.

The dollar index has lost more than 6% this year as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep its monetary policy ultra-accommodative and fiscal stimulus will speed an economic recovery in 2021. Expectations for further declines by the dollar are helping buoy stock markets and emerging-market currencies.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, with investors retreating from the safe-haven greenback and turning to the pound over expectations of an imminent Brexit deal that could help the U.K. avoid a turbulent economic rupture come Jan. 1.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.09% to 90.168 by 8:59 PM ET (1:59 AM GMT).
The index has lost more than 6% during 2020 over investor bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain an accommodative monetary policy and expectations of more fiscal stimulus in 2021 to aid economic recovery from COVID-19.
Some investors forecast that an expected further decline in the greenback will boost stock markets and emerging-market currencies.
“The fact that equity indices traded mostly in the green this morning reflects a consensus expectation that Trump will sign the budget into law, although he could wait until the eleventh hour,” Rabobank senior FX strategist Jane Foley said in a note.
“If this doesn’t happen the dollar could benefit from safe haven buying,” but longer term the dollar will weaken to $1.23 per euro over the course of next year, the note added.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 103.57.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.7587, while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7094.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to 6.5360.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.36% to 1.3540. The pound was up 0.2% earlier in the session after rising 0.9% during the previous session, ending three consecutive days of losses. The euro also strengthened 0.1% to $1.22025, adding to its 0.2% gain overnight.
A Brexit agreement will protect some $1 trillion in annual cross-channel trade between the U.K. and the European Union (EU) from tariffs and quotas. Although no official announcement of the deal has been issued by either side, with negotiations still “going through the details” and no final agreement confirmed yet, the agreement will reportedly be announced later in the day.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly ready to reach a deal with the EU, and there were reports that a deal had already been reached.
Some investors were positive about the prospects for a deal, even as warnings that talks were still under way were issued.
“This time it really does appear that a deal will be struck just in time for Christmas,” Westpac macro strategist Tim Riddell said in a note.
However, the note was cautious about the pound’s prospects even if a deal does transpire.
“If a deal does transpire on Dec. 24, the pound is likely to make further gains” toward $1.40, “but potential for a more substantial move towards 1.4500 now seems unlikely given how positions exhaustion is so prevalent,” it added.
Brexit expectations helped to overshadow U.S. President Donald Trump’s demands to a COVID-19 aid bill, which he termed “a disgrace”, that was passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate earlier in the week.
The bill needs to be signed by Trump in order to become law, and his reticence threatens a government shutdown after the Christmas holidays."

Investing.com – The pound surged on Wednesday on reports the UK and EU have clinched a Brexit deal after a nine months of negotiations.
GBP/USD rose 0.94% to $1.3485.
The UK and EU have reached an agreement on a post-Brexit trade deal and are in the process of finalizing the legal text of the accord to present to EU members.  
The Daily Mail's Jason Groves, citing sources, said a last-minute collapse was ""highly unlikely,"" with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said to be weighing up whether to announce a deal on Wednesday or Thursday. 
There is mounting pressure to wrap up the deal by Thursday to allow enough time to get it ratified before the end of the transition deadline on Dec. 31. 
But full ratification by Jan. 1 is unlikely amid a lack of time for EU members to scrutinize the deal. The accord, would, however, be applied on a provisional basis, with EU members voting later in the month, according to media reports.
The deal has been long in the making, with both sides choosing to kick the can down until the last minute.  The UK and EU started talks on a post-Brexit deal on Feb 1, a day after the UK officially withdrew from the EU. 
Market participants piled into sterling amid numerous reports that the announcement of a deal was imminent. 
""While headlines have oscillated back and forth between a deal has been struck and advising caution, it seems that at the point of publishing the headlines and guidance from officials lean toward a decent chance of striking a formal agreement today,"" Scotia Economics said."
757,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 06:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound’s reaction to a decision by the U.K. and European Union over trade will probably be more volatile now that liquidity across global currency markets has diminished ahead of Christmas.
If there’s a trade agreement, “there will be more demand for the pound than the market can absorb in such a thin market, so we’ll see spikes but it will level off over time,” said Bob Stoutjesdijk, a Rotterdam-based fund manager at Robeco Institutional Asset Management.
He sees the pound surging as much as 3% on a deal before ending the day up 2%, and tumbling up to 4% if talks collapse, because investors are long on sterling. The currency on Wednesday climbed 0.6% to $1.3434 as of 11:01 a.m. in London.
The pound is already trading in turbulent territory as the time for a deal runs out. Volatility over the past week is near the highest since March, when the coronavirus roiled global financial markets. At 14%, it’s nearly double that of the euro-dollar pair. And its implied volatility beats all other currencies, save Brazil’s real and Turkey’s lira.
The seasonal pattern adds fresh drama for traders already grappling with a year-end deadline for reaching a trade deal and the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Activity in options is also running well below recent averages, as interest for over-the-counter trades is next to zero while liquidity remains scarce, according to two Europe-based traders.
“Lower volumes equal higher volatility on any news,” said Luke Hickmore, a fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments who helps manage 35 billion pounds ($47 billion).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are counting on a weakening dollar to boost rallies in everything from U.S. stocks to emerging markets and industrial metals in 2021. 
Record-low U.S. interest rates, massive financial stimulus and a growing appetite for risk are among the catalysts that contributed to the dollar’s 6% drop against a basket of its peers year-to-date, putting it on track for its weakest year since 2017.
Over two-thirds of analysts in a recent Reuters poll said the dollar would keep falling until at least mid-2021, as investors continue shifting into comparatively riskier assets and seeking higher yields. 
“The table is set for continued dollar weakness,” said Michael Purves, chief executive officer at Tallbacken Capital Advisors, in a note to clients.
A weaker greenback is a boon to U.S. exporters as it makes their products more competitive abroad. It also makes it more profitable for U.S. multinationals to convert foreign earnings back into dollars. 
BofA Global Research estimates that every 10% drop in the U.S. dollar translates to a roughly 3% boost to S&P earnings.
At the same time, the S&P 500 has tended to rise an average of just over 22% following years when the broad trade-weighted dollar - which measures the U.S. currency against those of the country’s major trading partners - declined between zero and 3%, according to research from Bespoke Investment Group.
With that measure down just over 1.3% this year, ""things look very, very good for equity investors in 2021,” Bespoke’s analysts wrote earlier this month. 
That said, a steady decline in the dollar may be preferable to a bumpy ride lower. 
The negative impact of currency fluctuations on North American companies hit a four-quarter high of $14.16 billion in the second quarter of 2020, according to treasury and financial management firm Kyriba.
Declines in the dollar tend also to buoy prices for raw materials, which are priced in the U.S. currency and become more affordable to foreign investors when the greenback declines. 
""The dollar's decline is a double boost for commodities, not only because most commodities are priced in dollars, but also because periods of dollar weakness tend to coincide with greater growth,"" said Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at asset manager Robeco.
The S&P/Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is up about 74% since late April, fueled by rallies in everything from oil to gold. 
In fixed income markets, the classic way to play the dollar’s weakness is to increase exposure to inflation-sensitive assets such as the Treasury’s inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS, said Thanos Bardas, managing director and co-head of global investment-grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman.
Inflation tends to rise as a currency loses purchasing power.
Although inflation has consistently remained below the Fed’s 2% target throughout the last decade, trillions of dollars in government spending have recently revived discussions of its return. 
A weaker dollar is also a boon for emerging markets, making it easier for countries that borrowed in dollars to service their debt. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which measures stock performance, is up 13% year-to-date. 
Analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) have reduced the dollar’s weighting in their multi-asset portfolio to a record low while recommending increased exposure to emerging market equities, particularly those of Korean and Indonesian companies. 
Few expect betting against the dollar, however, to be a one-way street. Signs that the Fed may tighten monetary policy earlier than expected could also boost the greenback, analysts said. 
The currency has also tended to firm when market uncertainty rises and investors seek safe-haven assets. Such a move came earlier this week, when concerns over a coronavirus resurgence sent the currency higher. 

The episode illustrated that when risk appetite dries up, the dollar remains “the safest of safe havens,” wrote John Hardy of Saxo Bank.

Investing.com -- The dollar retreated slightly in early trading in Europe on Wednesday, as the reopening of the U.K.-French border for freight transport signalled a step back toward normality after the discovery of a new and highly contagious variant of the Covid-19 virus.
By 4:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, was down 0.3% at 90.400. The pound was the biggest gainer, rising 0.5% to $1.3424 and also rising back above 1.1000 against the euro. The euro was up 0.3% at $1.2195, helped at the margins by a better-than-expected reading for Italian business confidence.
The new coronavirus has in all likelihood established itself in the U.S. and continental Europe, various health officials said on Tuesday, which means that the issue shouldn’t burden sterling disproportionately in future, even though the U.K. was the first country to identify it.
However, inasmuch as it raises the likelihood of longer and tougher lockdowns, the variant is likely to weigh on riskier currencies and be dollar-supportive.
The sense of relief at the passage of the U.S. stimulus bill was tested late on Tuesday after President Donald Trump demanded changes to it, in a brief video that conflated provisions of the relief package with the broader government spending bill that was passed last week. Both bills passed with majorities big enough to override any presidential veto.
In meetings in the White House this week, Trump has reportedly raised the possibility of declaring martial law to force a rerun of the November election, after failing over 50 times to make claims of electoral fraud stick in the U.S. courts. He ended his video message by repeating that he may form the next administration.
The need for the relief package will be on show again later as the U.S. reports weekly jobless claims numbers. Initial claims are expected to have stayed at an elevated 885,000 last week.
Elsewhere, Israel faces its fourth election in two years after its governing coalition broke down, but the news didn’t stop the shekel’s relentless rise to a new 12-year high against the dollar. The shekel has risen 6.5% against the dollar this year, even more than the Chinese yuan has, as a sequence of deals normalizing diplomatic relations with traditional enemies have made it the best performing emerging market currency in the world."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, despite caution over the new B.1.1.7 strain of the COVID-19 virus pushing investors turn toward safe-haven assets.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.23% to 90.338 by 11:27 AM ET (4:27 AM GMT).
The discovery of the B.1.1.7 strain, first seen in the U.K., saw London and southeastern England put under Tier 4 lockdowns. The Philippines banned all U.K. flights from Dec. 24 earlier in the day, joining over 40 countries that have closed their borders to the U.K. and causing travel chaos just a few days before Christmas.
With the U.K. government also negotiating a post-Brexit deal with the European Union (EU), some investors expected dollar weakness to continue in the short term.
“People have some concerns about COVID-19 and about Brexit, but it’s not at the point where the positive sentiment has turned. Given how much the dollar has weakened, it’s feasible to see a retracement higher as people go for the holidays, but in the very near term we expect the dollar to remain weak,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
Demand for the dollar had been weakening as the rollout of vaccines and the possibility of more U.S. stimulus measures boosted hopes for a global economic recovery from COVID-19, sapping demand for the dollar and other safe-haven currencies.
The Senate also passed the COVID-19 aid package bill on Monday, following the House of Representatives passing the bill earlier. However, President Donald Trump's threat not to sign the bill seems to have a smaller-than-expected impact on investors.
“I don’t know how much of this is posturing by Trump or if he’s really demanding these changes … the muted reaction so far suggest the foreign-exchange market expects the bill to pass in some form,” said Kadota.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.16% to 103.47.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.43% to 0.7553. Australia continues to deal with a new outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Sydney’s Northern Beaches area. With the number of cases growing to 97, authorities said that the current lockdown will be extended over the Christmas holidays to curb the spread of the virus in the city. New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that decisions on the lockdown in terms of New Year’s Eve celebrations and upcoming sporting events will be made after Christmas.
The NZD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.7056 and the USD/CNY pair edged up 0.10% to 6.5492.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.37% to 1.3409, with the pound aiming to end a three-day slide as time runs out for the U.K. to reach a deal with the EU.
EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc is making a “final push” for a deal, although the two sides still disagree over the matter of fishing rights.
However, investor caution over the pound remained.
“The market is just waiting for the final result of Brexit talks, and in the meantime being swung by conflicting headlines … sterling will remain volatile,” Barclays’ Kadota said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held gains against major peers in holiday-thinned trading on Wednesday as caution about a fast-spreading coronavirus variant in the UK stoked demand for the safest assets.
The pound has fallen for three straight days as time runs out for London to reach a trade deal with Brussels before the UK completes its exit from the European Union at year-end.
The dollar index rose 0.1% to 90.561, extending its gain for the week to 0.7%. That still leaves it on track for a more than 6% decline this year.
Sterling rose 0.1% to $1.3384, seeking to end a three-day slide. 
""People have some concerns about COVID and about Brexit, but it's not at the point where the positive sentiment has turned,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital in Tokyo.
""Given how much the dollar has weakened, it's feasible to see a retracement higher as people go for the holidays, but in the very near term we expect the dollar to remain weak.""
The market has been positioned for a pandemic recovery that lifts global growth, sapping demand for the dollar and other haven currencies.
U.S. Congress passed an $892 billion COVID-19 aid package overnight, and vaccine rollouts are gaining momentum.
That development has since been clouded by President Donald Trump's threat not to approve the stimulus bill, saying it should be amended to increase the amount in the stimulus checks, though this has had little impact on markets so far.
""I don’t know how much of this is posturing by Trump or if he’s really demanding these changes,"" said Barclays' Kadota.
""The muted reaction so far suggest the foreign-exchange market expects the bill to pass in some form.""
At the same time, the new coronavirus variant has introduced new risks to that rosy scenario, even as medical experts have sought to allay people's fears.
The euro held Tuesday's 0.7% decline to trade at $1.2166.
The dollar was little changed at 103.63 yen, another traditional haven.
With only days left before the UK leaves the EU's trade orbit, the pound has vacillated as it awaits signs of progress in negotiations.
A deal is possible Wednesday, an  ITV  (LON:ITV) reporter tweeted.
Earlier, the EU's chief negotiator said the bloc is making a ""final push"" for a trade deal, although there are still deep rifts over fishing rights.
""The market is just waiting for the final result of Brexit talks, and in the meantime being swung by conflicting headlines,"" Barclays' Kadota said.

Investing.com – The pound fell Monday as investors continued to sweat over the prospect of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal amid ongoing differences on fishing quotas, with just nine days to go until the year-end transition deadline.
GBP/USD fell 0.81% to $1.3354.
Fishing quotas remain ""difficult to bridge,"" an EU diplomat said, according to Reuters. Most issues, however, are ""preliminarily closed or close to being agreed,"" the diplomat added.
The stalemate on fishing quotas comes after the EU rejected the UK's improved offer on fisheries. Under the amended proposal on fishing quotas, the EU would get to keep about 66% of its catch in UK waters, well above the previous offer of just 40% tabled last week.
""The UK went all the way from insisting that the EU reduce its catch in UK waters by 60% over three years down to 30% over five years with yesterday’s proposal. The EU still rejected that offer this morning because it was higher than their demand that no more than a 25% reduction be imposed over seven years (down from 10 previously),"" Scotia Economics said.
Without a deal by year-end, trade between the UK and EU will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, which some argue could see both sides increase levies, leading to higher prices.
The weakness in the pound comes as data showed the UK economy rebounded by more than expected in the third quarter as the country emerged from the spring lockdown.
Still, the Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said the economy remains under pressure and called on the government to continue supporting the labor market until the pandemic is over.
""We are still in a hole and the hole is still deep. We need to keep climbing out that hole through policy measures and the vaccine. But once we have climbed out – and we will – we mustn’t forget about long-term structural issues: what will give us good work at good pay,"" Haldane told the Guardian."
763,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- There isn’t a currency in the world that’s worrying traders more than the pound.
The relative cost to hedge against sterling’s decline over the next couple of weeks is the highest among global peers, as measured by risk reversals, beating the likes of Turkey’s lira, which topped the list for most of 2020. It’s a sign that traders are on edge for a dramatic finish to the four-and-a-half year Brexit process.
Sterling on Tuesday fell as much as 0.8% after the European Union rejected the U.K.’s latest concessions on fishing, the last main sticking point. Liquidity, however, is low, as is typical of trading days leading up to Christmas.
Sterling has been weighed down this week by a combination of the uncertainty over Brexit talks and concern about a new variant of the coronavirus, which has seen about 40 countries restricting flights and effectively isolating the U.K. It’s reignited fears of a deeper economic slowdown before vaccines are rolled out to a significant proportion of the population.
“It will almost certainly be choppy,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank International, who expects a “skinny” trade deal.
The pound fell 0.3% to $1.3325 as of 10:50 a.m. in London, having dropped as much as 2.5% Monday. It declined 0.2% to 91.13 pence per euro. A gauge of volatility over the coming week remains elevated and is the highest in the world after Turkey’s lira and Brazil’s real.
If a trade agreement isn’t struck by the end of the month, decades of free movement of goods, services, people and capital will come to an abrupt end. British firms would revert to trading with the EU under rules established by the World Trade Organization. EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to brief the bloc’s envoys at around 4 p.m. central European time.
At this point, however, “the market is reluctant to price much in the way of no deal,” said Derek Halpenny, head of global market research at MUFG. While an agreement is well-priced by the market, the pound could still climb as high as $1.39, a level not seen since 2018, depending on the shape of any accord, he added.
“The devil is in the detail in terms of how much higher the pound can go.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, but jitters over a new COVID-19 strain left the greenback trading well below the peaks seen during a rollercoaster session overnight.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.20% to 90.132 by 11:13 PM ET (4:13 AM GMT). However, the dollar is headed for a third consecutive quarterly loss and is down 12.5% from a three-year peak in March.
Recent hopes for a global economic recovery from COVID-19 that would boost trade and commodity prices, and the resultant bets on a falling dollar, saw export-driven economies and their currencies become an increasingly crowded trade as momentum funds pile in.
Positioning data showed that the value of overall bets against the dollar eased a little during the previous week but remained near the nine-year highs struck in September. Dollar gains in other currencies were also exaggerated due to low liquidity as short sellers bailed out. However, these moves largely unwound as investors seized the opportunity to buy into the dollar’s downtrend.
The discovery of a new strain of the COVID-19 virus, also referred to as the B.1.1.7 strain, in the U.K. saw the pound fall as much as 2.5%, with countries including Canada and Hong Kong shutting their borders to the U.K. to keep the strain out.
A full Tier 4 lockdown has been imposed on London and southeastern England, with the ensuing travel chaos and the possibility of food shortages coming days before Christmas.
Although there is no evidence that recently rolled out vaccines would not protect against the B.1.1.7 strain, the U.K.’s chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned that the increased transmissibility of the strain was now confirmed and this “likely means that measures will be increased in some areas and not reduced” during a press conference on Monday.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.11% to 103.41.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.28% to 0.7563 and the NZD/USD pair fell 0.56% to 0.7063. Sydney continues to deal with its own new outbreak of COVID-19 cases.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.5503.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.46% to 1.3401. With just days left until the U.K. leaves the European Union (EU), Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that there are still “problems” in securing a post-Brexit trade deal. However, some investors still remained hopeful that a deal could be struck before the U.K.’s exemption from tariffs expires on Dec. 31.
The hopes were based on a report that the EU was considering a compromise on fishing rights, which have been a stumbling block to a deal. The pound continues to remain on edge as negotiations continue.
The euro recovered to $1.2229 on Tuesday, after falling to $1.2130.
“The euro found an abundance of buyers on the deep dip. The ‘short dollar’ clear-out is probably nothing more nefarious than stretched positioning getting taken out to the woodshed on Brexit scares. However, it shows the potential dangers of universally bearish dollar sentiment,” Axi chief strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an $892 billion coronavirus aid package on Monday, alongside a $1.4 trillion measure to keep the government funded for another year. The relief bill is currently under review by the Senate and will become law once signed by President Donald Trump.
Data, including the U.S. GDP and Germany’s GfK Consumer Climate index, are due later in the day."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was firm on Tuesday but traded well below peaks hit on a wild ride higher overnight, as a new coronavirus strain in Britain sent jitters through holiday-thinned currency markets.
Sterling fell as much as 2.5% to $1.3190 as countries from Europe to Asia sealed off travel links with Britain to try and contain the highly-infectious mutation.
Low liquidity exaggerated dollar gains in other currencies, too, as short sellers bailed out. But moves largely unwound as investors took their chance to buy in to the dollar's downtrend.
The pound, helped by a Bloomberg report which said the European Union was considering a compromise on fishing rights - a stumbling block to a trade deal - recovered to trade at $1.3418 in Asia, though it remained on edge as talks progress.
The euro recovered to sit at $1.2229 on Tuesday after falling a cent to $1.2130. The yen was steady at 103.30 per dollar and the Australian and New Zealand dollars a little soft with the nervous mood, but well above overnight lows. 
""The euro found an abundance of buyers on the deep dip,"" said Stephen Innes, Bangkok-based chief strategist at currency broker Axi.
""The 'short dollar' clear-out is probably nothing more nefarious than stretched positioning getting taken out to the woodshed on Brexit scares. However, it shows the potential dangers of universally bearish dollar sentiment,"" he said.
Wagers on a falling dollar as the global COVID-19 recovery lifts world trade and commodity prices, tending to benefit export-driven economies and their currencies, is becoming an increasingly crowded trade as momentum funds pile in.
The value of overall bets against the dollar eased a fraction last week, positioning data showed, but remains near nine-year highs struck in September.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar is headed for a third quarterly loss in a row and is down 12.5% from a three-year peak in March.
The dollar index was last at 90.145 having been as high as 91.022 overnight. Nerves over the new strain of coronavirus are keeping it above last week's 2-1/2 year trough of 89.723.
Together with a new outbreak in Sydney, that held the Australian dollar at $0.7566, 0.3% lower for the session, despite roaring retail sales figures. 
Experts said there was no evidence that vaccines would not protect against the new virus variant, but Britain's chief scientific adviser said that in the meantime tighter restrictions on public life in Britain were likely.
Investors are looking ahead to confidence data in the U.S. and Germany later on Tuesday and have been cheered by the expectation that stimulus checks could go out to Americans next week.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that there are still ""problems"" in securing a trade deal with Europe, but financial markets remain hopeful that something can be struck before Britain's exemption from tariffs expires on Dec. 31.

Investing.com – The pound recovered some losses Monday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly adopted a friendlier stance on talks concerning fishing quotas, sparking hopes of a Brexit deal.
GBP/USD fell 0.29% to $1.3481, but had fallen more than 2% early-Monday morning.
Johnson made an amended proposal on fishing quotas allowing the EU to keep about 66% of its catch in UK waters, well above a previous of just 40% tabled last week, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Talks still hang in the balance, however, as there remain differences on how to enforce any quotas, the report added, citing unnamed officials.
The report of an improved offer from the UK comes just a day after the UK and EU missed yet another deadline to wrap up talks, with just days to go until the year-end transition deadline. 
The news helped the pound cut its losses following earlier pressure as a mutant strain of Covid-19 prompted fresh lockdown in parts of England.
More than 40 countries including Canada, Spain, India and Hong Kong banned incoming UK flights, while France has temporarily shuttered its borders with Britain, sparking disruption to supply chains and fresh worries about the UK economic recovery.
The general sentiment on sterling, however, is one of cautious optimism as the speculators cut some of their bullish bets on the currency, according to FX positioning data for the week ending Dec. 15. The latest data showed speculators cut their long positions on sterling by 2,000 contracts."

Investing.com -- The dollar surged and sterling slumped on Monday as the U.K. lurched towards a near-total lockdown for much of the country, warning that it had discovered a new variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus whose transmission was 'out of control', according to the government's top scientific advisors. 
In response to the news, many EU countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium banned arrivals from the U.K., while the Channel tunnel, through which thousands of trucks pass every day was closed for 48 hours. As such, the economic disruption that many feared due to a disorderly end to the Brexit transition period has, in some respects, arrived 10 days early. 
By 4:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the pound was down 2.0% against the dollar at $1.3251, losing all its gains of the last month, and down 1.5% against the euro at 1.0859. 
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning note that the impact on trade from the fresh disruptions may not be that great, given that retailers go into the Christmas season with high levels of inventory. 
""As a signal of fear of the virus, this might be more serious. It's fear of the virus that does the most economic damage, and this does suggest a relatively cautious approach on the part of European policymakers,"" Donovan said, adding that the developments could add downside risks for first-quarter growth in both the U.K. and EU.
However, the dollar's strength wasn't confined to cable. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, corrected after an extended slide on bets that a weak dollar will favor growth in emerging economies next year. The trigger for the reversal came from a story arguing that Janet Yellen, who is set to be the next Treasury Secretary, may return to defending the U.S.'s traditional policy of a strong dollar, after four years of unvarnished attempts by the Trump administration to weaken it. 
The dollar snapped back over 2% against the South African rand and 1.8% against the Mexican peso, both of which had looked over-extended after vigorous rallies. The dollar also rose 2% against the ruble, as oil prices also corrected downward and fears grew that the U.S. may plan serious retaliation against the country for what anonymous intelligence sources have branded as a Russian-sponsored hacking attack on U.S. government institutions. 
Elsewhere, the euro rose over 1.0% against the Polish zloty after the Polish central bank confirmed that it had been selling zloty in the market in response to what it saw as an excessive appreciation since late October. EUR/PLN rose to a seven-week high of 4.5191.

768,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s ruble fell the most since March as oil tumbled on concern the pandemic is worsening and a report suggested the U.S. may impose sanctions on the country in response to cyber attacks.
The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter led its emerging-market peers lower as Brent crude slumped after a faster-spreading mutation of the Covid-19 virus was detected in the U.K. Russian bond yields climbed to the highest level since early November after Reuters said U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden was weighing sanctions and other measures in response to an alleged Russian hacking campaign.
“The Russian ruble is the main victim of rapidly escalating risk aversion,” said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. “In addition to rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia over allegations of a cyber attack, the markets are also concerned about the latest developments in the U.K.”
The ruble was 2.2% weaker at 75.0075 per dollar as of 11:38 a.m. in Moscow after tumbling as much as 3.3%. Monday’s losses trimmed the currency’s advance this month to 2.1%. MSCI Inc.’s gauge of emerging-market currencies fell 0.3%, set for the biggest one-day loss since Nov. 19. Ten-year bond yields climbed two basis points to 5.87%.
The ruble had rallied since the U.S. election in early November as concern about possible penalties from the incoming Biden administration eased. However, the market mood shifted last week as the hacking reports brought the prospect of tougher sanctions back to the fore.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British pound and the euro fell on Monday as investors sought refuge in the dollar, after a fast-spreading new coronavirus strain shut down much of the United Kingdom and disrupted international freight amid Brexit talks uncertainties.
Sterling fell close to 2% against the dollar in morning trading before Prime Minister Boris Johnson chairs an emergency response meeting to discuss international travel and the flow of freight in and out of Britain.
Much of Europe has cut off transport with the UK sowing chaos for families and companies just days before Britain exits the European Union.
""The British horror stories of a shortage of goods after a hard Brexit are taking on a whole new drive - for a completely different reason,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann.
Adding to the transport crisis caused by the virus were fears the UK will crash out of the EU without a trade deal on Jan. 1. 
Britain insisted on Sunday that the EU should shift position to open the way to a post-Brexit trade deal, but there was so far no sign a breakthrough. 
At 0756 GMT, the pound was down 1.85% at $1.3277. 
The euro also sustained losses against the dollar, down 0.74% at $1.2169, but rose 1.26% at 0.9170 pence against the pound.
The pandemic stress in Europe overshadowed a weekend deal among U.S. congressional leaders for a $900 billion coronavirus aid package.
The dollar climbed against major peers on Monday with investors seeking its relative safety as many countries tightened COVID-19 lockdowns.
The dollar's rebound comes after it sank to two-and-a-half-year lows last week, driven by optimism that vaccines would help revive global growth.
The dollar index gained 0.38% to 90.625, after touching 89.723 on Thursday for the first time since April 2018. 
The riskier Antipodean currencies weakened at the start of the holiday-shortened trading week as investors rushed for haven assets.
The Aussie dollar dropped 1.24% to 75.295 U.S. cents. 

The U.S. dollar gained 0.32% to 103.62 yen, another safe haven.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with investors turning to the safe-haven asset as many countries tightened restrictive measures against the COVID-19 virus.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.40% to 90.190 by 9:06 PM ET (2:06 AM GMT). The dollar rebounded from the two-and-a-half year lows seen during the previous week, when it touched 89.729 on Thursday for the first time since April 2018.
The U.K. was the latest country to imposed fresh, strict lockdowns in order to curb a new strain of the virus. This led to European neighbors, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium closing their borders to travelers, and in some cases freight from the U.K. Other countries are also mulling similar bans.
“The lockdown news and the stalemate on Brexit is keeping the market nervous … dollar strength is largely being driven by the move lower in the pound,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
The rapidly spreading strain is causing alarm, overshadowing the news that the U.S. Congress reached a deal for a $900 billion COVID-19 aid package, with the House of Representatives to vote on the package later in day, followed by the Senate.
The Food and Drug Administration also granted emergency use approval for  Moderna  Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine mRNA-1273 over the weekend.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 103.28.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.40% to 0.7593 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.34% to 0.7101. The riskier Antipodean currencies weakened at the start of the week as investors rushed towards safe-haven assets. Australia’s largest city of Sydney is also battling a fresh COVID-19 outbreak.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.22% to 6.5495.
The GBP/USD pair slid down 1.05% to 1.3377 over the U.K. lockdown news.
Meanwhile, talks for a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union (EU) will continue later in the day, but both sides failed to reach an agreement. The EU’s fishing rights in British waters continues to be a particular sticking point, with U.K. Health Minister Matt Hancock on Sunday calling them “unreasonable demands” that should be dropped by the bloc.
With the clock ticking towards the end-of-year deadline, the risk of the U.K. exiting the EU with no deal is rising.
However, NAB’s Catril remained cautious about the greenback, although he forecasted that the pound could climb to $1.50 in 2021 should a last-minute Brexit agreement emerge.
“We still can’t get our heads around the fact that a trade deal will collapse because of fisheries … overall I would say that risk positivity driven by vaccines and stimulus, plus the fact that fiscal stimulus needs to be funded by a lot of borrowing in the U.S., still paints a picture of dollar weakness for 2021,” Catril added."

Investing.com – The pound fell Friday on cooling optimism over the post-Brexit deal, but remains on track for weekly win as investors bet a deal will ultimately prevail as reports that talks are set to continue into the weekend. 
GBP/USD fell 0.54% to $1.3510.


UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said European Union negotiators must ""bring something to the table"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister added, however, the UK was willing to ""keep talking"", but conceded that differences remain. ""Things are looking difficult and there is a gap that needs to be bridged,"" Johnson said.
Still, the pound remains on track for a weekly win, suggesting that market participants are still betting on a last-minute deal as talks look set to continue over the weekend.
""We maintain expectation that Brexit deal is likely to be near despite UK statement that negotiations are now “in a serious situation”, which smacks of tactics as talks turn to fish,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said.
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier upped-the-ante earlier in the day, saying that while there was still a change of deal, the path had narrowed with just ""just a few hours left"" for both sides to strike a deal.
Barnier said the UK would ultimately be responsible for a no-deal scenario as the country had decided against extending the Dec. 31, Brexit transition deadline.
""If they should leave with an agreement or without, it is nevertheless the Brits that decided on that deadline,"" he told the European Parliament.
Without a deal by year-end, trade between the UK and EU will default to World Trade Organization rules, which some argue could see both sides increase levies on each other's, leading to higher prices."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher Friday, rebounded to a degree after recent sharp selling, but this safe haven remains largely friendless as risk appetite grows.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 89.820, just above the 2-1/2-year low hit on Thursday. The index is down 1.2% for the week so far, on course for its worst week in a month, and has fallen 6.5% this year to date.
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 103.35, after falling as far as 102.88 Thursday, with the Bank of Japan keeping its key interest rates and asset purchases unchanged, and extending its special support programs for pandemic-hit businesses by six months.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2253, suffering minor profit-taking, after reaching 1.2272 earlier Friday, levels not seen since March 2018. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7608, yet is on course for its seventh consecutive weekly gain.
“With Fed policy still to translate into negative real rates and the odds of U.S. fiscal stimulus rising, there is more downside to USD,” said ING analysts, in a research note. 
U.S. congressional negotiators still haven’t come to an agreement over a new coronavirus-relief bill, but pressure is growing as the whole government could be shut down unless a spending bill, to which a pandemic relief measure can be attached, is passed before Friday ends.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday a bipartisan deal “appears to be close at hand.”
Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve vowed to keep its monetary funding ongoing until the U.S. economic recovery is secure.
The weekly initial jobless claims rose to 885,000 on Thursday, reflecting the escalating economic toll from the Covid-19 pandemic. This suggests the central bank will have to keep its policies extremely accommodative for quite some time to come.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.5% to 1.3515, coming off a 31-month high overnight, as Britain and the European Union struck a downbeat tone about the likelihood of an agreement.
U.K. retail sales dropped by 3.8% on the month in November, their biggest decline since the first lockdown in April.
The Bank of Russia is likely to keep interest rates at 4.25% for the third consecutive policy meeting later Friday as inflation continued to increase above target. 
Annual inflation will reach 4.5% by year end and is unlikely to exceed 5% at the peak in February, according to Governor Elvira Nabiullina, above the central bank’s target of 4%.
USD/RUB rose 0.7% to 73.356, with this pair up over 18% so far this year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia but slid through major support levels and was headed towards its worst week in a month.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.15% to 89.817 by 9:24 PM ET (2:24 AM GMT).
The dollar was down 1.2% for the week so far and has fallen 12.7% from a three-year peak in March, falling to 89.862, just above a two-and-a-half year low seen on Thursday, earlier in the session. With investors turning to risky assets throughout the week, the dollar saw multi-year lows against the euro, pound, AUD, NZD and Canadian dollar.
News about vaccine rollouts, as well as progress on both Brexit trade talks and the latest U.S. stimulus measures only increased bearish sentiment over the past week, after short positions in the dollar shot up to just below nine-year highs during the previous week.
Some investors remained pessimistic about the dollar’s prospects.
“It’s a perfect combination that is besieging the dollar at the moment,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters, with U.S. rates anchored low and better returns expected elsewhere.
“For now, the narrative of global growth and broadening of the recovery favors risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD and the NZD, and more of the same is to be expected in 2021,” he said.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.18% to 103.29. The Bank of Japan will hand down its policy decision during the day, which is widely expected to leave rates steady but announce an extension of a package of steps aimed at easing corporate funding strains.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7611.
The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 0.7144. The NZD rose to a two-and-a-half year high of $0.7170 Thursday after New Zealand released better-than-expected national growth data. The country’s GDP grew 14% quarter-on-quarter during the third quarter, exceeding the 13.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 11% contraction reported for the second quarter.
Some investors remained optimistic as the NZD recorded an eighth consecutive week of growth, the longest run of weekly rises in three years.
“If we get a U.S. fiscal deal and a Brexit deal before Christmas, there will be nothing stopping the NZD,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.12% to 6.5397.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.24% to 1.3550. The pound was slightly down from the 31-month high overnight as both the U.K. and European Union expressed doubt that an agreement could be reached for their post-Brexit trade deal. However, some investors were betting that the warnings are just more brinkmanship on the way to a deal.
The euro was headed towards a high of $1.2556 not seen since 2018 and was trading at $1.2254 after minor profit taking on Friday.The common currency has added nearly 3% in the three weeks after pushing through stiff resistance at $1.2000.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar has sunk through major support levels and looked set for its worst week in a month on Friday, as its accelerating slide sucked in more short sellers keen to make an easy buck.
It has slumped to a nine-month low against the safe-haven yen, even though investors have been gobbling up risky assets all week, and fallen to multi-year lows against the euro, pound, Aussie, kiwi and Canadian dollar.
The euro has added nearly 3% in the three weeks since it burst through stiff resistance at $1.2000. At $1.2254, after minor profit taking on Friday, there is clear sky ahead until the common currency's 2018 top of $1.2556.
The Australian dollar, which also saw some small profit taking, is set for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, a streak that has carried it 9% higher since early November. 
""It's a perfect combination that is besieging the dollar at the moment,"" said Rodrigo Catril, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s senior currency strategist in Sydney, since U.S. rates are anchored low and better returns are expected elsewhere.
""For now the narrative of global growth, and broadening of the recovery, favours risk-sensitive currencies like the Aussie and the kiwi, and more of the same is to be expected in 2021.""
The New Zealand dollar, popped to a two-and-a-half year high of $0.7170 Thursday after better-than-expected national growth data, and has gained for eight weeks straight - its longest run of weekly rises in three years.

The greenback last traded at 103.28 yen after falling as far as 102.88 yen overnight.
Short positions in the dollar stood not far below nine-year highs last week and news in recent days of vaccine rollouts, progress in Brexit trade talks and U.S. stimulus negotiations has only strengthened dollar bears' resolve.
""If we get a U.S. fiscal deal and a Brexit deal before Christmas, there will be nothing stopping kiwi,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Friday.
Britain and the European Union struck a downbeat tone about the likelihood of an agreement on Thursday, but investors are betting that is yet more brinkmanship and the pound sat comfortably at $1.3554 after hitting a 31-month high overnight.
Elsewhere the Norwegian crown zoomed 1.4% higher on Thursday after Norway's central bank said a vaccine-driven recovery could prompt rate hikes early in 2022 or sooner - a move U.S. policymakers are not even beginning to consider yet.

Forex – The pound pared some gains Thursday after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was likely a deal wouldn't be reached unless the European Union eased its stance over key sticking issues including fishing quotas.
GBP/USD was up 0.51% to $1.3576 though had been as high as $1.3624
Johnson poured cold water on the prospect of the deal, saying it looked very likely agreement won't be reached unless European Union shifts its position subst.antially. The update arrived following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen over the progress in the trade deal negotiations.


Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove earlier in the day was quick to quell any optimism a deal could be reached by the end of the week, saying the odds of agreeing a deal were below 50%.
Gove also confirmed that there was no wiggle room to push talks out into next year, insisting that Dec. 31 was a ""fixed point in law"" when the transition must end. ""That would be it. We would have left on WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms,"" he added.
EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, earlier in the day tweeted about progress in talks, but conceded that ""stumbling blocks remain,"" with just days to go until the deadline.


The European Parliament has given Brexit negotiators until Dec, 20 to strike a deal to allow enough time to ratify a potential agreement before the end of the transition period."

Investing.com - The dollar slumped to multi-year lows in early European trade Thursday, as growing confidence of both a new U.S. stimulus package and a Brexit deal boosted risk appetite at the expense of the world's safe haven.

U.S. congressional negotiators still haven’t come to an agreement over a new coronavirus-relief bill, but senior members of both parties sounded more positive than they have in months on Wednesday.
Talks seem to be about the small details surrounding a $900 billion Covid-19 aid bill, which is expected to include $600-$700 stimulus checks and extended unemployment benefits.
While fiscal stimulus seems to be arriving shortly to help the country’s battered economy, the Federal Reserve vowed to keep its monetary funding ongoing until the U.S. economic recovery is secure.
“Even with a growing prospect of a new fiscal support package and news on a vaccine the Fed continues to suggest they see little chance of higher interest rates before 2024,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.5% to 1.3571, climbing to levels not seen since April 2018, as optimism over a Brexit trade deal climbs.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday that the two sides were closer to a deal, although she warned that success was not guaranteed with differences over fishing rights still causing problems.
The Bank of England holds its last policy-setting meeting of the year later Thursday, but is widely expected to keep policy unchanged amid the uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations as well as the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
The Swiss National Bank also holds its last scheduled policy decision of 2020 later Thursday, the day after the U.S. labelled Switzerland as a currency manipulator in the Treasury’s foreign-exchange policy report.
Still, the SNB is expected to keep its main policy rate at a record-low -0.75%  The SNB already on Wednesday that it remained ready to intervene in currency markets, at even greater scale if needed.

777,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 10:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The offshore yuan quickly erased an advance after hitting 6.5 per dollar, suggesting that the level could be a new line in the sand for a currency that’s set to climb for a third quarter.
The yuan traded in the overseas market erased a gain of as much as 0.2% within 30 minutes, after the currency hit 6.5 in Thursday morning trade. The swings followed a similar pattern seen last week, when the offshore yuan briefly breached 6.5 -- touching the strongest level in more than two years -- and then started to depreciate.
The offshore currency has advanced 4.2% since the end of September, on pace for the longest run of quarterly gains since early 2018, due to China’s economic recovery from the pandemic and its yield advantage over the rest of the world. While the appreciation opens a window for Beijing to carry out financial reforms, it risks hurting exporters and stoking speculative capital inflows.
In October, policy makers sought to slow the rally by allowing more outflows and lowering the cost of shorting, but the measures barely made a dent on investors’ confidence in the yuan.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, with investors continuing a retreat from the safe-haven asset after progress in U.S. stimulus measures and Brexit talks boosted risk appetite.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 90.102 by 9:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT). Although temporarily boosted after the U.S. Federal Reserve handed down its policy decision on Wednesday, the index dropped below a new low of 90.126, a level that has not been seen since April 2018.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress were reportedly “closing in on” approving a $900 billion stimulus bill on Wednesday, the most positive note seen in months. They are also working to pass a $1.4 trillion spending bill for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1. by Friday to prevent a government shutdown.
Some investors said that the growing optimism in the market will lead to a weaker dollar.
“As the world gets more optimistic about the outlook for growth in 2021, the dollar has softened … further weakening of the dollar is on the cards,” CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 103.33.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7579 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.25% to 0.7128.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.5358.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.16% to 1.3529. The pound was boosted by the progress in Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union, rising to $1.3553, a level not seen since May 2018, during the previous session.
Although European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the two sides were closer to a deal, she warned that success was not guaranteed.
“I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not. But I can tell you that there is a path to an agreement now. The path may be very narrow, but it is there,” von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday.
The euro was trading at $1.21945 earlier in the session after reaching $1.22120 overnight, its strongest level since April 2018.
As it concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed vowed to keep pumping cash into financial markets until the U.S. economic recovery is secure. However, this promise of long-term help disappointed expectations for more immediate help as a second wave of COVID-19 cases in the country leads to an economic slide.
Other central banks are also handing down policy decisions before the end of the week. The Bank of England and the Mexican, Swiss and Indonesian central bank will hand down their policy decisions later in the day, with the Bank of Japan and the Bank of Russia handing down their decisions on Friday.

The dollar index jerked higher after the Fed's announcement, but then sank back towards the day's low of 90.126, a level not seen since April 2018.

Forex – The pound pared gains against the dollar Wednesday, but remained supported on reports a Brexit deal is within reach after the UK and EU made a breakthrough on a key sticking point amid ongoing talks.
GBP/USD rose 0.24% to $1.3493, hitting its highest level since Nov. 29.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said there is a ""narrow"" path to an agreement on a post-Brexit deal following talks with the UK. The UK acknowledged that ""some progress"" had been made, but continued to suggest a no-deal was the most likely outcome as significant differences remain.
Progress has reportedly be made on level playing rules, but differences on fishing quotas continue to pose a challenge in negotiations.
The UK, however, is believed to have softened its stance on fisheries in a bid to get a deal over the line. Britain ditched demands for fishing vessels operating under the UK flag to be majority British-owned in the post-Brexit era, the Guardian reported, citing an unnamed source.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, however, continued to take a hardline approach on fisheries in a speech on Wednesday.
""All it takes is for them [the EU] to realize that – like every other country – the UK has a right to control its own land and waters,"" Johnson said.


The recent progress on talks comes as both sides are coming under increasing pressure to seal a deal before the transition period on Dec. 31."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will keep dollar ""swap"" lines open for nine mid-sized foreign central banks until Sept. 30, 2021, extending a program established early in the coronavirus pandemic to help ease global financial stress.
The ability to trade foreign currency for dollars at the U.S. central bank is permanently available to the European Central Bank and a handful of other major central banks. 
In March, with the pandemic raising concerns about the need for dollar financing across the globe, the Fed set up $60 billion swap arrangements with the central banks of Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore and Sweden, and $30 billion lines with the central banks of Denmark, Norway and New Zealand.
The Fed also allowed an even longer list of central banks to get dollar loans provided they could post U.S. Treasury bonds as collateral.
The swap lines were among the initial tools the Fed deployed in March amid a series of emergency steps to battle the pandemic.

Unlike some of its lending programs for companies, which required approval and financing from the U.S. Treasury, swap lines fall under the Fed's core powers to keep financial markets stable. Because so much world trade and corporate borrowing is done in the U.S. currency, access to dollars is important to keep temporary crises from forcing companies out of business, and driving nations or regions into recession.

LONDON/ZURICH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Being named a currency manipulator by the U.S. Treasury may be an embarrassment for Switzerland, but the tag will likely have little effect on the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy.
The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators, saying they had both intervened heavily in currency markets with at least part of Switzerland's action aimed at pushing down the Swiss franc to prevent effective balance of payments adjustments.
There would be no automatic punishment with a label, though U.S. law requires Washington to demand negotiations with designated countries. 
“The subtle implication of being put on this list is that you eventually could come under sanctions, and that puts pressure on these countries not to weaken their currencies so much,” said Win Thin, global head of Currency Strategy at BBH, ahead of the report. 
But he said that in Switzerland’s case, as the exchange rate is its main tool for fighting deflation, ""they may say, ‘Well, tough’”. 
The Swiss central bank is firmly under the Treasury's focus after spending 90 billion Swiss francs ($101.50 billion) on foreign currency intervention in the first half of 2020 amid pandemic-driven safe-haven inflows. 
The SNB has long argued it is not trying to weaken the franc to gain a trade advantage. Instead, it aims only to stem the appreciation of its currency to head off the threat of deflation, which runs contrary to its goal of price stability.
“Switzerland has always been treated as a special case when it comes to exchange-rate policy and even the U.S. Treasury has conceded in the past that Switzerland’s economic situation is 'distinctive' and that its monetary policy options are limited by its small stock of domestic assets,” said David Oxley, a senior European economist at Capital Economics, ahead of the report.
Latest data shows the SNB has dialed back on its interventionist approach. Despite the interventions, the franc is considered among the most over-valued major currencies in the world, according to various trade-weighted indexes.
International Monetary Fund staff estimated https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/ESR/Issues/2020/07/28/2020-external-sector-report in August that the franc was over-valued by 13.5% to 19.7% during 2019.
The Swiss franc jumped to a five-year high versus the U.S. dollar after the report was released. Analysts said it could, on balance, cause the Swiss franc to be more attractive.
Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said that over the medium term ""it's probably likely to lead to Swiss appreciation because they'll probably feel under the gun as a result of this finding and less likely and willing to intervene to stifle franc strength."" 
The Treasury's three manipulation criteria are: a $20 billion-plus bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of GDP and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP.
Switzerland and Vietnam were the first to get the tag since China in 2019, at the height of U.S.-China trade tensions. That tag was removed in January as Washington and Beijing signed a trade agreement, citing a rebound in the yuan.
The SNB, which is to give its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday, said on Wednesday that it would not alter its monetary policy and remained willing to act aggressively on forex markets. 
NOT BIDEN'S PROBLEM 
    The SNB's readiness to intervene in currency markets remains central to its approach under Chairman Thomas Jordan.
    SNB officials have long tried to explain their situation to Washington, noting that the franc rises because of global pressures. As a small, open economy, Switzerland can do little about that. 
They will be hoping for a more sympathetic hearing under the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.
""Switzerland being named as a currency manipulator by the U.S. Treasury will not gather the same market attention under the new Biden administration as compared to a Trump one,"" said Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management in London, ahead of the report.
Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton, London, agreed, highlighting the upcoming changes to the U.S. administration and the SNB seeming set in its ways. 
That confidence is also reflected in the currency markets.
Short term,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s position tracker, which measures currency flows on its trading platforms, shows hedge funds remain broadly bullish on the Swiss franc.
But medium term, currency derivative markets appear to be neutral about its prospects. Risk reversals, which show the ratio of calls to puts on the franc, show bets on further franc gains over three to six months broadly subdued.
    BBH's Thin said any decision under the current U.S. administration may not matter. The new Treasury secretary ""can come in and say ‘I don’t even believe in this,'” he said.

783,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 10:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators on Wednesday and added three new names to a watch list of countries it suspects of taking measures to devalue their currencies against the dollar.
In what may be one of the final broadsides to international trading partners delivered by the departing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the Treasury said that through June 2020 both Switzerland and Vietnam had intervened in currency markets to prevent effective balance of payments adjustments.
Furthermore, in its semi-annual currency manipulation report, the Treasury said Vietnam had acted to gain ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade as well.""
Foreign exchange analysts had broadly anticipated the U.S. Treasury designation for the two countries. 
The action comes as the global coronavirus pandemic skews trade flows and widens U.S. deficits with trading partners, an irritant to Trump, who won office four years ago partly on a promise to close the U.S. trade gap.
To be labeled a manipulator, countries must at least have a $20 billion-plus bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP.
The U.S. Treasury also said its ""monitoring list"" of countries that meet some of the criteria has grown to 10 with the additions of Taiwan, Thailand and India. 
Others on the list include China, Japan, Korea, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Malaysia.

The U.S. Treasury report also said that India and Singapore had intervened in the foreign exchange market in a ""sustained, asymmetric manner"" but did not meet other requirements to warrant designation as manipulators.

784,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Swiss National Bank pledged to push ahead with interventions to rein in the franc, defying a U.S. decision to designate the nation a currency manipulator.
The central bank said it doesn’t engage “in any form” of currency manipulation, and its actions are aimed at helping it ensure price stability. It has been intervening on and off for more than a decade to keep the franc -- which tends to attract investors in times of market stress -- from strengthening too much.
The decision by the U.S. comes at the end of a particularly intense year in which the franc strengthened because of the coronavirus pandemic, forcing the SNB to step up its battle.
The U.S. Treasury also labeled Vietnam a manipulator. It said it will follow up with both countries “to work toward eliminating practices that create unfair advantages for foreign competitors.”

Europe’s shared currency climbed as much as 0.5% to $1.2212, a level unseen since April 2018, after a report showed that the euro area’s manufacturing output expanded faster than economists estimated. The services sector contracted less than anticipated. The euro’s strength also reflected broad dollar weakness ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on Wednesday.
The improved figures helped the currency extend gains from earlier in the week, which were fueled by hopes that the U.K. and the European Union are close to a Brexit trade deal. The euro has surged almost 9% this year, on track for its best performance since 2017 amid expectations that the monetary union will achieve greater fiscal integration as it implements a landmark recovery fund aimed at steering the region’s rebound from the coronavirus crisis.
“It was just a matter of time” before the euro broke through $1.22, said Thu Lan Nguyen, a foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “And now, with the strong purchasing managers’ indexes, this was a perfect reason to try out how much higher euro-dollar can be pushed until the ECB does comment on the exchange rate again after all.”
Gathering Optimism
Economic optimism in the euro area is building following the EU recovery fund deal, which for the first time will mean the bloc jointly issues debt, alleviating some of the strain from national balance sheets and damping any risk of a breakup. At the same time, an interest-rate cut by the ECB in the immediate future is seen as unlikely, further supporting the currency.
The euro was up 0.4% at $1.2200 as of 10:09 a.m. in London. It was little changed versus the pound at 90.28 pence. It’s risen 1% since the European Central Bank refrained from any verbal pushback against the exchange-rate’s gains at its meeting last week, even though the currency’s advance threatens to damp inflation in the region.
“There is little in the way of resistance for EUR/USD until 1.24-1.25,” said Lee Hardman, a strategist at MUFG.

LONDON/ZURICH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The threat of being named a currency manipulator by the U.S. Treasury may be an embarrassment for Switzerland, but even if the country does get the tag, it likely will have little effect on the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy.

Investing.com - The dollar continued to head lower in early European trade Wednesday, with traders deserting the safe haven as U.S. lawmakers make progress toward a Covid-19 relief package ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.317, falling to levels last seen in April 2018.
USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 103.44, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2170, trading near a 2 1/2-year high of 1.2177 touched on Monday, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.1% at 0.7564, near the June 2018 high of at 0.7580 seen on Monday.
Support appears to be growing in Congress for a slimmed down proposal to help ailing businesses and households during this surge in Covid-19 cases.
A bipartisan group had originally proposed a $908 billion stimulus bill, but this has now been split into two parts. The first part, which includes a $748 billion proposal, including aid for vaccine distribution and unemployed benefits, appears to be gaining traction, and could be passed by the end of the week.
The second part, a $160 billion bill for state and local support and temporary Covid-19 liability protection, appears to be having more difficulty in gathering the necessary support.
Adding to the positive risk sentiment is progress towards another Covid-19 vaccine, with  Moderna 's  (NASDAQ:MRNA) candidate looking likely to receive U.S. regulatory authorization within the week. This comes after the U.S. expanded its roll-out program for Pfizer’s rival vaccine.
The Federal Reserve concludes its final policy-setting meeting of the year later Wednesday, with market participants looking to see if the central bank increases its bond-buying program as the recent surge in the Covid-19 pandemic prompts more lockdowns.
“The Federal Reserve will likely steer clear of more stimulus, but ramp up its dovish rhetoric and emphasize the need for more fiscal support as Covid-19 containment measures increasingly weigh on economic activity,” analysts at ING said, in a research note.
Ahead of the Fed decision, EUR/USD has the potential to be moved either by Eurozone purchasing managers indices and, at 8:30 AM ET, U.S. retail sales for November.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3488, climbing towards the 1.3540 level seen earlier this month, a level not seen since mid-2018, amid optimism that a Brexit trade deal can be agreed.
If a trade agreement isn’t struck by the end of the year, free movement of goods and services between the two zones will come to an end, potentially affecting around $1 trillion in annual trade.
Earlier Wednesday, British inflation fell by much more than expected in November, as consumer prices rose 0.3% in annual terms, below the 0.6% expected, after a 0.7% rise in October.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury could label several countries currency manipulators before President Donald Trump leaves office, analysts say, as the coronavirus pandemic skews trade flows and widens U.S. deficits with trading partners.
Currency experts say Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and Switzerland all risk being found in violation of the three U.S. criteria for currency manipulation in the Treasury Department's long-delayed report on the foreign exchange practices of major trading partners. They expect the report within days.
While President-elect Joe Biden is expected to be less confrontational with U.S. allies on matters of trade, a new White House could find it politically difficult to immediately walk back designations of currency manipulation by the current administration.
To be labeled a manipulator, countries must at least have a $20 billion-plus bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of GDP and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP.
Brad Setser, a former U.S. Treasury economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has replicated data used by Treasury to analyze these criteria, constructing a quarterly tracker that shows Vietnam, Switzerland and Thailand exceeded the department's thresholds during the first and second quarters of 2020.
Taiwan met all three thresholds in the second quarter, but barely missed on the foreign exchange intervention in the first quarter in the data compiled by Setser, who now serves on Biden's transition team for trade issues.
However, Treasury's actual data may differ and it has some discretion in applying the label, and mitigating circumstances such as the coronavirus pandemic may factor into its decisions.
Trade surpluses for Asian economies exporting personal protective equipment and other supplies needed to fight the pandemic have jumped, while capital has surged into safe haven currencies such as the Swiss franc, driving them higher.
The Swiss National Bank has spent 90 billion francs ($101 billion) to tame the franc's rise in the first half of 2020, putting it squarely in the Treasury's focus.
The Treasury has often treated Switzerland differently because it views Switzerland's intervention as not trade-driven, but that could change this time, said Mark Sobel, another former Treasury and International Monetary Fund official.
""If the Treasury is going to go after a few Asian countries and Switzerland trips all three criteria, how do you not go after them?"" said Sobel, now with the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum think-tank.
VIETNAM TARGETED
Vietnam's currency practices have been in the Trump administration's crosshairs for months, as the U.S. Trade Representative's office investigates the undervaluation of the dong.
Business groups are concerned the administration could make moves, such as punitive tariffs, on these soon. 
The Treasury already declared Vietnam's currency undervalued by 4.7% in 2019 in a Commerce Department anti-subsidy case, which led to punitive duties on Vietnamese light vehicle tire imports.
Taiwan, like Vietnam, has seen its trade surplus with the United States grow as companies moved supply chains from China to these countries in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Taiwan spent $3.9 billion buy U.S. dollars in the first half of 2020, to tame a 5% rise in the Taiwan dollar against the greenback, exceeding its 2019 purchases. 
China, declared a manipulator in August 2019 at the height of U.S.-China trade tensions, has been a fixture on Treasury's monitoring list for years due to its massive trade surplus with the United States. Treasury removed the label in January as the two countries signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal and China's foreign exchange interventions and global current account surplus remain below the thresholds.
Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at BBH in New York downplayed the report as ""totally politicized"" under Trump.
""Any sort of move this current Treasury secretary makes can be easily reversed when the new Treasury secretary comes in,"" Thin said.

There is no automatic punishment with a currency manipulator label, though U.S. law requires Washington to demand negotiations with designated countries.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, after progress towards passing the latest U.S. stimulus measures increased risk appetite and turned investors away from the safe-haven dollar.

The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.5421.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3462. The pound held onto its gains from Tuesday as hopes for a post-Brexit deal between the U.K. and the European Union (EU) increased.
Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Tuesday that he sees a “narrow path” towards a deal, if both sides resolve their differences. However, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated that the most likely outcome of talks was no deal.
The greenback changed hands at $1.21540 per euro, near a two-and-a-half year low of $1.2177 seen on Monday.
In the U.S., hopes are also rising for another deal, a $748 billion bipartisan proposal for COVID-19 relief. Before tackling the proposal, Congress began a second meeting on Tuesday to finalize a $1.4 trillion spending bill for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1. The spending bill must be passed by Friday, ahead of the measures to avert a government shutdown.
The Federal Reserve will also conclude its two-day policy meeting later in the day. The central bank is widely expected to keep the key overnight interest rate pinned near zero and signal it will stay there for years to come, a decision that some investors say will further boost investor risk sentiment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the U.S. government on Tuesday not to impose tariffs on Vietnam over the alleged undervaluation of its currency, saying Vietnam did not meet the U.S. Treasury's three-part test for unfair currency practices.
In a blog post and an interview, U.S. Chamber officials said any move by the United States to slap tariffs on Vietnam ahead of a late December hearing would ignore established procedures.
""It would send a bad message to Vietnam and it would have a real and consequential impact on the bilateral relationship,"" John Goyer, the chamber's executive director for Southeast Asia, said in an interview. ""Rash tariff action will be damaging to the overall relationship.""
Currency experts expect U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to issue a report on the foreign currency practices of major trading partners within days. Industry sources say Washington could slap tariffs on Vietnam afterwards.
The U.S. Treasury earlier this year determined that the Vietnamese currency was undervalued in 2019 by about 4.7% against the dollar due in part to government intervention, according to an assessment sent to the U.S. Commerce Department.
In October, it set in process a motion that could result in U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from Vietnam.
Vietnam, already on Washington's watch list of alleged currency manipulators, has come under scrutiny for its trade surplus with the United States, a highly positive current account balance and a perception that its central bank has been active in terms of net foreign exchange purchases.
In a blog post, John Murphy, the U.S. Chamber's senior vice president for international policy, said Vietnam had not met two of the U.S. Treasury's three tests for assessing whether a country was engaging in unfair currency practices.
Vietnam did meet the third test due to its trade surplus, but that was largely due to U.S. imposition of Section 301 tariffs on more than $350 billion of Chinese imports and a scramble by U.S. firms to find other suppliers, Murphy said.

Investing.com – The dollar slipped to a more than two-year low on Tuesday on mixed economic data and expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to suggest that the liquidity spigot remain wide open to support the economy amid a bleak outlook.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.21% to 90.468, hitting its lowest level since April 2018, as investors digested a regional manufacturing report that undershot forecasts and better-than-expected factory data.
The Empire State manufacturing index fell 2 points in December to a reading of 4.90, the New York Federal Reserve said Tuesday, missing expectations for a 6.90 reading.
Industrial production—a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities—rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in November from the prior month. This was slightly ahead of the 0.3% rise forecast by economists.
""We have no reason to expect that the inventory restocking cycle will subside any time soon; it will fuel manufacturing activity for months to come,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The mixed data had a muted impact on the dollar as investor focus shifted to the two-day Federal Reserve meeting that gets underway on Tuesday.
The two-day meeting is expected to culminate in an unchanged decision on interest rates, and analysts expect the Fed to remain cautious on the economic outlook and signal a willingness to pump out further liquidity should conditions deteriorate.
Still, any reaction to the dollar is expected to be fleeting at best as the central bank policy measures are unlikely to change. But a ""surprise QE maturity lengthening announcement could on the day weigh on the USD via a move lower in longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields,"" National Bank Australia said in a note.
The Fed's policy statement will be accompanied by a fresh set of economic projections that will likely confirm expectations that the ultra-low interest rate environment will persist for at least another year.
""The FOMC’s ultra-easy policy looks set to be a USD headwind for at least the next year if not even longer,"" the bank added.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) agreed, pointing to expectations for further liquidity from central banks over the next year.
""But, if our economists are right and the global economy outperforms expectations, we think the ample liquidity environment will support riskier investments to the detriment of risk-less ones,"" Morgan Stanley said. ""That means the U.S. dollar has further to fall against a host of G10 and EM currencies next year, and the safest investment of all – U.S. Treasuries – will struggle to make ends meet."".
Others, however, are not sure. Pantheon Macroeconomics suggested that a faster recovery in the U.S. economy in the post-Covid era versus other major economics will set the dollar up for a rebound.
""[W]e expect the dollar to rebound next year as the post-Covid recovery likely will outstrip that of other major economies,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note."

Investing.com - The dollar remained near multi-year lows in early European trade Tuesday, with little news to challenge a dominant narrative that sees loose U.S. policy underpinning a broad global recovery next year.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was largely flat at 90.688, after sinking as low as 90.419 on Monday, a level unseen since April 2018.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.06, EUR/USD edged lower to 1.2140, trading near a 2 1/2-year low of 1.2177 touched on Monday, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7523, after touching the highest since June 2018 at 0.7578 on Monday.
New coronavirus stimulus to help ailing businesses and households is still struggling to get through Congress, but lawmakers are now talking about splitting the $908 billion stimulus bill into two parts, in order to make it easier in theory for some of it to get through. 
The first part will include a $748 billion proposal that has bipartisan support including aid for vaccine distribution and unemployed benefits, and the other, more controversial, is a $160 billion bill for state and local support and temporary Covid-19 liability protection.
Congress goes on recess on Friday, so time is limited.
The Federal Reserve starts its final policy-setting meeting of the year later Tuesday, to be concluded Wednesday, with expectations growing that the central bank will increase its bond-buying program as Congress dithers and Covid-19 cases increase, prompting more lockdowns.
Additionally, “the Fed is annoyed with Steve Mnuchin’s decision to veto against the prolongation of the crisis measures and this is maybe the best reason to expect the Fed to add stimulus via a Twist operation despite several FOMC-members acknowledging a brighter medium-term outlook,” said Nordea analyst Andreas Steno Larsen, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3331, retaining some strength after better than expected unemployment data.
Additionally, European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said that sealing a trade pact with Britain was still possible, after talks were extending past Sunday’s self-imposed deadline in order to try and strike a Brexit deal.
If a trade agreement isn’t struck by the end of the year, free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the two zones will come to an abrupt end, potentially affecting around $1 trillion in annual trade.
“FX positioning data shows a substantial trimming of GBP net shorts, but it doesn't reflect the shift to a more pessimistic market situation on Brexit. Even if some GBP shorts have been rebuilt in the last few days, the positioning will hardly provide a buffer in the case of no-deal,” said ING’s Francesco Pesole, in a research note.
The Times of London reported that the two sides had made progress on the issue of the 'level playing field' as regards regulatory standards, leaving fishing rights as the biggest obstacle to a deal.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar traded near 2 1/2-year lows against major peers on Tuesday as demand for the safest assets flagged amid progress toward agreeing U.S. fiscal stimulus and optimism for a Brexit deal.
The greenback was near its weakest since mid-2018 against the euro and UK pound with U.S. lawmakers scurrying to ready $1.4 trillion in spending.
A $908 billion bipartisan COVID-19 relief plan will be split into two packages, a person briefed on the matter said, raising hopes that at least a large part of the plan that already has bipartisan support will be approved.
""The big picture is that 2021 looks increasingly promising for global growth, and while the U.S. will certainly be a part of that, the global reflation trade is going to support the risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian dollar,"" said Westpac currency analyst Sean Callow.
""The dollar is likely to be in the group of laggards, along with the likes of the yen.""
Across the Atlantic, European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that sealing a trade pact with Britain was still possible, sowing hope that a deal can be reached with just days to avert a turbulent exit for the UK from the trade bloc at the end of the month. 
The British pound rose 0.1% against the dollar to $1.3332, after jumping 0.8% on Monday. It reached a 2 1/2-year high of $1.3540 earlier this month.
The greenback slipped 0.1% to $1.2150 per euro, trading near a 2 1/2-year low of $1.2177 touched again on Monday.
COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs in the United States and Britain also buoyed risk sentiment, but optimism was tempered by spikes in infection and death rates. London will go into a tighter lockdown amid the discovery of a new variant of the virus.
The dollar index was little changed at 90.705 after Monday sinking as low as 90.419, a level unseen since April 2018.
The currency added 0.1% to 104.125 yen, another traditional safe-haven asset.
""With the roll‑out of vaccines starting in the U.S. and the UK, we expect shutdowns to reduce in frequency and intensity, allowing the USD to resume its downtrend,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso wrote in a client note.
An agreement on fiscal stimulus would also ""undermine"" the U.S. dollar, he wrote.
The offshore Chinese yuan weakened 0.2% to 6.5444 per dollar. It reached 6.4975 earlier this month for the first time since June 2018. 
The onshore yuan traded at 6.5549.
A Chinese official said Tuesday that the country could make targeted policy adjustments as the economy improves. 
The Aussie slipped 0.2% to 75.130 U.S. cents after touching the highest since June 2018 at 75.780 on Monday. 

The New Zealand dollar lost 0.1% to 70.72 U.S. cents after reaching 71.20 the previous session for the first time since April 2018.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, with demand for safe assets falling as negotiations for both the latest U.S. stimulus measures and a post-Brexit trade deal continue.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 90.648 by 13:10 AM ET (5:10 AM GMT). It was little changed, after trading near lows not seen since April 2018 during the previous session.
Hopes were raised that a $908 billion bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill will be passed after it will reportedly be split into two separate packages.
Vaccine optimism increased as the U.S. and the U.K. began inoculation programs for BNT162b2, the COVID-19 vaccine co-developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy). Singapore's Health Sciences Authority also gave approved BNT162b2 on Monday, with the first shipments due in the city by the end of December, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
“With the roll‑out of vaccines starting in the U.S. and the UK, we expect shutdowns to reduce in frequency and intensity, allowing the USD to resume its downtrend,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso said in a note.
An agreement on fiscal stimulus would also “undermine” the dollar, the note added.
However, the optimism was tempered by surging numbers of COVID-19 cases globally. New York City is bracing for its second full shutdown, with other parts of the country also facing possible tightened restrictions. European governments are also tightening measures, with London possibly seeing England’s toughest COVID-19 rules from Wednesday onwards as a new variant of the virus was discovered in the city.
The USD/JPY pair was inched up 0.09% to 104.12.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.31% to 0.7513 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7074.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.5544. Data released in China earlier in the day showed that industrial production growing 7% year-on-year, against the 7% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 6.9% growth. Retail sales grew 5% year-on-year in November, down from the forecast 5.2% growth but up from October’s 4.3% growth.
The People’s Bank of China is likely to inject cash into the financial system for a fifth straight month on Tuesday via the medium-term lending facility. With some CNY600 billion ($91.66 billion) of one-year loans maturing in December, the central bank is widely expected to offer up to CNY800 billion in funding to banks

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve leads a slew of central banks handing down policy decisions as it convenes later in the day and on Wednesday. The Bank of England and the Mexican, Swiss and Indonesian central banks will release their policy decisions on Thursday, with the Bank of Japan and the Bank of Russia handing down their decisions on Friday.

Investing.com – The pound gave up some gains Monday as a report about a lack of progress on post-Brexit talks cooled renewed investor optimism that a deal can still be reached with just 17 days to go until the end of the Brexit transition period.
GBP/USD rose 0.78% to $1.3325 after hitting a high of $1.3445.
The latest update on Brexit negotiations suggests that the early-day optimism may have been misplaced as talks remain ""difficult"" amid a lack of significant progress in recent days, Sky News reporter Adam Parsons (NYSE:PSN) said in tweet, citing an unnamed source.


The pound had made a strong start to the week early Monday after the UK and EU kicked the Brexit can down the road, extending the deadline once again after claiming that enough progress had been made to continue talks.
A new deadline for talks, which will continue in Brussels on Tuesday, has not been set but the clock continues to tick down on the final Dec. 31 deadline, the end of the transition period.
In the absence of a trade deal, the two sides would begin trading on World Trade Organization terms that could lead to a rise in cost for both sides to do business with each other.
Talks have been held back for months as negotiators on both sides have struggled to break the impasse amid key sticking points including fishing quotas and ""level playing field"" rules.
As it stands, both sides are leaning toward a no-deal scenario. Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday suggested there was a ""narrow path"" to an agreement, while Boris Johnson said reiterated the ""most likely"" is a no-deal Brexit scenario.
The dire impact of a no-deal Brexit on the economy has been well documented, but it could also mark the end of Johnson's reign as prime minister.
The independent quoted senior Conservative lawmaker Sir Roger Gale as saying that Johnson would have ""failed the people of the United Kingdom,"" in the event of a no-deal scenario and the prime minister's position would be untenable."

Investing.com - The dollar headed lower in early European trade Monday, as traders deserted the safe haven on hopes that Congress will finally agree a fiscal stimulus package ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. 
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.4% at 90.562, trading near a two-and-a-half year low.
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 103.98, EUR/USD rose 0.4% to 1.2155, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.4% at 0.7564, ahead of the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia‘s minutes from its latest policy meeting, due on Tuesday.
The dollar has been under pressure on hopes for a global economic recovery from Covid-19 grew over positive vaccine news and hopes for the latest U.S. stimulus measures increasing investors’ risk appetite.
A bipartisan bill for a $908 billion Covid-19 relief package is set to be introduced in Congress later in the day, which could be split into two separate packages in order to maximize the chances of something getting throughhough differences between Republicans and Democrats. 
Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended approval on Friday of  Pfizer  's  (NYSE:PFE) Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, paving the way for vaccinations to get underway in America this week.
Also on the agenda this week is the last Federal Reserve meeting of the year, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates low for an extended period.
“Our team expect a dovish message to be maintained as well as perhaps some forward guidance on the Fed’s asset purchases. The Fed is an experienced communicator and we doubt it will make any mistakes over misconstrued words on premature removal of stimulus,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 1.2% to 1.3386, soaring after Britain and the European Union extended talks past Sunday’s self-imposed deadline in order to try and strike a Brexit trade deal.
If a trade agreement isn’t struck by the end of the year, free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the two zones will come to an abrupt end. However, the extension of the negotiating time frame suggests increased political interest in avoiding that outcome.
“We see an asymmetric GBP reaction function to the UK-EU trade negotiation outcome, with modest upside in the case of a deal but profound downside in the event of no deal as fairly limited risk premium is currently priced into GBP,” ING added.
ING sees a deal as more likely than not, adding this should push GBP/USD above the 1.35 level, towards 1.37.
The Bank of England also holds a policy meeting later this week, but the central bank is not expected to move while the Brexit negotiations continue. It has already extended its QE program.by 150 billion pounds in November.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The British pound rose against the dollar and euro on hopes that Britain and the European Union will secure a free trade agreement after their decision to extend negotiations beyond the Sunday deadline.
The dollar traded near a 2 1/2-year low against major peers ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending Wednesday where policymakers are expected to increase purchases of longer-dated Treasuries to contain a rise in yields.
The rally in sterling may not last, some analysts warn, because Britain and the EU have repeatedly struggled to narrow their differences and there is still a risk that trade and business will be thrown into chaos without an agreement.
""This is a temporary move higher in the pound, but it is still not clear that a no-deal scenario can be avoided,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""A partial deal with an agreement to negotiate further next year might save the pound, but anything less would lead to renewed selling. I would not buy sterling from here.""
The British pound jumped by 0.7% to $1.3317, its biggest one-day gain since Dec. 1.
Against the euro, sterling rose by 0.5% to 91.07 pence, the largest daily gain since Dec. 9.
The euro edged up 0.2% to $1.2129.
The dollar was little changed at 103.995 yen.
London and Brussels agreed on Sunday to ""go the extra mile"" in coming days to try to reach an elusive trade agreement despite missing their latest deadline to avert a turbulent exit for Britain from the European Union at the end of the month.
Britain formally left the EU in January, but has since been in a transition period during which it remains in the EU single market and customs union, meaning that rules on trade, travel and business have stayed the same.
That all ends on Dec. 31, and if by then there is no agreement to protect around $1 trillion in annual trade from tariffs and quotas, businesses on both sides would be hit hard, but the British pound is more vulnerable to selling than the euro, analysts warn.
The dollar, which has also been under selling pressure recently, faces a big week because of the Fed's policy meeting.
U.S. dollar net short positioning in the latest week climbed to its highest since late September, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 90.793, close to a 2 1/2-year low.
Investors have sold the dollar on expectations of a global recovery, buoyed by positive coronavirus vaccine news and hopes for further U.S. stimulus that should lift the market's risk appetite.
The dollar is also under pressure due to expectations that U.S. interest rates will remain low for an extended period. 
""The secular trend remains overwhelmingly of U.S. dollar weakness,"" Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney, wrote in a research note. 
Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan traded at 6.5370 in the onshore market, little changed on the day. In the offshore market, the dollar slipped 0.2% to 6.5237 yuan.
The Aussie dollar was little changed at 75.342 U.S. cents. Australian central bank minutes on Tuesday could prompt investors to scale back bets for additional monetary easing.

Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar edged higher ahead of data later in the week forecast to show a sharp rebound in the country's gross domestic product.

The dollar is also under pressure with investors expectant that the Fed will keep interest rates low for an extended period at its last policy meeting of 2020.

The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.13% to 6.5359.
The GBP/USD pair rose 0.73% to 1.3320, seeing its biggest one-day gain since Dec. 1 over increased hopes that the U.K. and the European Union (EU) would reach a Brexit trade deal. Hopes were raided after both parties agreed to extend talks beyond a Sunday deadline set by both parties during the previous week.
Negotiators for both sides will “go the extra mile” in coming days to try to reach an agreement before the end-of-the-year deadline to avert a chaotic divorce between the U.K. and the EU, despite missing the latest deadline.
The U.K. has been in a transition period since it formally left the EU in January, during which rules on trade, travel and business remained unchanged as the country remained in the EU single market and customs union. However, should both sides fail to reach an agreement before the end of the month, around $1 trillion in annual trade from tariffs and quotas, businesses on both sides would be left unprotected and at risk.
Some investors said that the pound is more vulnerable to selling than the euro, warning that the pound’s rally is not likely to last. Both sides have yet to narrow their differences on a variety of issues, including fishing rights, and the risk that they will not reach a deal before the deadline remains.

Investing.com – The pound moved off session lows Friday despite the EU warning that a no-deal Brexit would be the most likely outcome as both sides are unlikely to reach a post-Brexit trade agreement by the Sunday deadline.
GBP/USD fell 0.52% to $1.3222, though had been as low as $1.3135.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a no-deal Brexit was the most likely outcome following ""difficult"" talks. The dour sentiment was echoed by the U.K., with Prime Minister Boris Johnson conceding that a no-deal Brexit was now a ""very, very likely"" outcome after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to ease his stance on fishing quotas.
The prime minister earlier this week failed in his bid to break the deadlock in negotiations during a dinner meeting with the EU's von der Leyen.
Johnson has floated the idea of the U.K. adopting an Australian-styled trade relationship with the EU in a no-deal Brexit scenario, leading Britain to trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms. This would at the ""very least, a lack of a cohesive agreement would wreak havoc on supply chains, borders and markets, and trade worth close to $900B a year,"" Stifel Economics warned.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), drawing a parallel from the aftershock of the EU referendum in 2016, said that a steep drop in the pound on the initial reaction of a no-deal Brexit could be followed up by correction on profit taking as some may want to wait to see the fall-out from a hard-Brexit on the economy.
If the market takes longer to “assess the implications of a no-deal Brexit for the pound, then “the currency could drop significantly in the first moment … but a correction could quickly set in due to profit-taking and because many market participants want to wait for the actual economic effect,” Commerzbank said.
“Something similar had happened after the EU referendum. Here, many had expected a recession due to the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit, but it failed to materialize. The pound recovered from its initial crash, albeit not completely,” it added."

HAVANA (Reuters) - The Cuban government announced on Thursday it would start a long-awaited monetary reform in January, unifying its dual currency and multiple exchange rate system in a bid to bring more dynamism to its centrally planned economy.
The reforms were first adopted by the Communist Party a decade ago as it moved toward a more market driven system and closer links with the international economy but foundered thanks to bureaucracy and internal divisions. 
HOW DOES CUBA’S MONETARY SYSTEM WORK?
For nearly three decades, two currencies have circulated in Cuba: the peso and the convertible peso (CUC), both officially valued at one-to-one with the dollar. Neither are tradable outside the country. 
The currencies are exchanged at various rates: one-to-one for state-owned businesses, 24 pesos for 1 CUC for the public and others for joint ventures, wages in the island’s special development zone and transactions between farmers and hotels.
Cuba created the system as part of a package of measures to open up its economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
While the system helped Cuba get through the shock of the Soviet collapse, it ended up also hiding the real economic situation.
WHAT CHANGES NOW?
The CUC will be eliminated. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said it would leave the peso at a single fixed rate of 24 to the dollar, scrapping other more favorable rates in the first official devaluation of the peso since Cuba's 1959 revolution.
GOODBYE CUC, HELLO DOLLAR!
The government has also begun opening stores that sell consumer goods for dollars and other traded currencies, though only with a bank card.
Havana says this is a temporary measure but the partial dollarization will also provide some stability, especially for families who receive remittances.
Meanwhile, state and private companies can now keep tradable currency accounts with up to 80% of their export earnings instead of handing them over to the state.
SHOCK THERAPY?
Devaluation is inflationary, while ending subsidies leads to layoffs, yet the Cuban government says it expects to avoid any ""shock therapy"" in the economy where the state sets most prices and wages.
Economists expect triple digit inflation, and the government has said the initial devaluation will be accompanied by a five-fold increase in average state wages and pensions even as many state-controlled prices also may rise.
But the wage increase does not apply to around 2 million of the 7 million plus labor force in the private sector, informal sector or who simply do not work.
Meanwhile the government says state-run companies, as a rule, will no longer be subsidized.
Cuban economists estimate around 40% of state companies operate at a loss and though some will benefit with the reform, others will go under.
Still, the government says some companies will be given a year to get their books in order before ending subsidies.
The government says residents will be given 180 days to exchange convertible pesos once they are taken out of circulation.
WHY NOW?
Cuba is seeking to reverse its worst crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, with growth seen plummeting more than 8% this year by boosting business conditions and productivity.
The country is dependent on imports for more than 50% of food and fuel, plus inputs for agriculture and pharmaceuticals. Yet a combination of U.S. sanctions, local economic blunders and the COVID-19 pandemic have gutted Cuba’s ability to earn tradable currency. 

Cuba has been rapidly piling up debt in recent years, while still being plagued by a scarcity of basic goods, from food and personal hygiene products to medicine and fuel.

This comes as Covid-19 cases spike in the U.S., recording daily records for new infections and deaths. The surge has hit business across the country, pushing initial jobless claims to their highest level since September, pointing to the economic damage caused by this surge in cases.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3287, continuing the sharp losses seen overnight after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said late Thursday there was ""a strong possibility"" Britain and the European Union would fail to strike a Brexit trade deal.
Sterling has shed just short of 1% so far this week as negotiations between the U.K. and the EU to agree a trade deal over some $1 trillion in annual trade have proved fruitless to date.
“There is currently a stalemate in Brexit-negotiations and it is hard to imagine a deal being struck without an exogenous trigger,” said Nordea’s Andreas Steno Larsen, in a research note.
Additionally, EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.2129, dropping a touch but remaining not far off the previous week’s 2 1/2-year high of $1.2177.
The European Central Bank also deployed another round of monetary stimulus totaling EUR500 billion ($605 billion) on Thursday as widely expected, in order to help the fight against the second wave of Covid-19 cases hitting the region.
ECB President Christine Lagarde added that the euro’s exchange rate had not been targeted during the central bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. 
“In sum, the ECB did not over-deliver and the new set of measures is not strong enough to outweigh the strong bearish USD dynamics in place,” said ING’s Petr Krpata, in a research note. “There is more upside to EUR/USD. We target 1.25 in 2021, with strong upside risks to 1.30.”
USD/TRY rose 1% to 7.9661, with the lira weakening after Turkey posted another current account deficit, its 11th month in a row, while its 12-month rolling deficit reached $33.8 billion from $30.8 billion in the previous month.",,,,,

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said late on Thursday it would start its long-awaited monetary reform in January, eliminating its dual currency and labyrinthine multiple exchange rate system in a bid to improve business conditions in the crisis-stricken economy.
In a televised address to the nation, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said the Cuban peso would be left, fixed at a single exchange rate of 24 per dollar, scrapping other more favorable rates in what amounted to the first devaluation of the peso since the country's 1959 revolution.
""We consider the conditions have been created to enable us to announce the start of the task of (monetary) ordering from Jan. 1,"" said Diaz-Canel, sitting next to Cuban Communist Party chief Raul Castro.
For nearly three decades, two currencies have circulated in Cuba's state-run economy: the peso and the convertible peso (CUC), pegged to the dollar.
These have been exchanged at various rates: 1 to 1 for state-owned businesses, 24 pesos for 1 CUC for the public and others for joint ventures, wages in island’s special development zone and transactions between farmers and hotels.
The government has said it will eliminate the CUC as part of the currency reform, although Diaz-Canel did not refer explicitly to it on Thursday, simply saying there would be just one exchange rate from January.
Economists say the reform spells short-term pain for Cubans but is important in the long-term as varying exchange rates have effectively subsidized some sectors and distorted the way economy works.
Diaz-Canel said it was no ""magic solution"" to the cash-strapped country's economic problems.
""However it will favor the creation of the necessary conditions to advance in a more solid manner,"" he said.
Economists expect triple-digit inflation, and government announcements in recent months suggest it does too. It has said the initial devaluation will be accompanied by a five-fold increase in average state wages and pensions even as many state-controlled prices are increased or allowed to respond to demand.
But the wage increase does not apply to around two million of the seven million-plus labor force in the private sector, informal sector or who simply do not work.
""The task is not void of risks,"" said Diaz-Canel, saying it was one of the most complex challenges Cuba had faced but promising that ""no one will be left destitute"".
Those who raised prices unduly would face severe sanctions, he said.
The government has said some companies will be given a year to get their books in order before ending subsidies, and it will continue to provide universal and free healthcare and education, some subsidized food and other social gratuities.
Cuban economists estimate around 40% of state companies operate at a loss and though some will benefit from the monetary reform, such as those tied to the export sector, others will fail.
Some Cubans complain that multiple currencies will still be in use on the island given the government has been opening stores over the past year that sell consumer goods for dollars and other internationally traded currencies, though only with a bank card.
The government says this is a temporary measure needed to earn tradable currency to purchase more consumer goods amid dire scarcity as it is all but bankrupt.

But the partial dollarization will also provide some stability, especially for families who receive remittances, as devaluation occurs.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, after investors retreated from the safe-haven asset amid growing hopes of a COVID-19 recovery and caused markets to be heavily short dollars.The pound was up despite doubts on both sides about a resolution to the Brexit trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union (EU).
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.18% to 90.653 by 12:02 AM ET (4:02 AM GMT). The dollar was pinned near a two-and-a-half year low, barely a third of one percent above the previous week’s 31-month trough.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 104.06.
Although moves in Friday’s Asian session were modest, the riskier AUD and the NZD saw new multi-year highs.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.35% to 0.7560. The AUD pushed past the 75 U.S. cents mark, the first time since mid-2018, as iron ore, Australia’s biggest export commodity, saw prices surge to a two-and-a-half year high.
“With the iron ore price on a bull run, the Aussie is largely ignoring ‘bad’ news,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.7103, while the USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.5389.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.21% to 1.3321, with U.K. and EU negotiators taking a final stab at reaching a Brexit trade deal.
The pound fell 0.8% during the previous session after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Thursday there was “a strong possibility” that the U.K. and the EU would fail to strike a deal. It has shed 1% so far during the week, with efforts to strike a deal with the EU before protections on around $1 trillion in annual trade expire at the end of December showing little progress up to now.
Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has described the talks as “difficult,” have set a deadline for Sunday for the talks. This gives investors the weekend to make any last-minute adjustments to their sterling positions ahead of the deadline.
The widely-expected volatile ride to the finish line has sent pound volatility gauges soaring. One-week volatility saw a new eight-month high, with the premium of puts to calls is near its highest since April as investors coughed up cash for downside protection.
“There has been a greater tendency for more jittery sterling longs to hit the sell button, although (the) market view remains that a deal is slightly more likely than not,” Axi chief strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
The euro rose to $1.2158, keeping within range of the previous week’s two-and-a-half year high of $1.2177. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said that the euro’s exchange rate had not been targeted during the central bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. However, she also added, “But clearly [the] exchange rate, and in particular the appreciation of the euro, plays an important role and exercises downward pressure on prices, so we monitor it, we will continue to monitor it very carefully going forward.”
ECB also deployed another round of monetary stimulus totaling EUR500 billion ($605.19 billion) during its policy meeting, conforming to expectations as Europe continues to fight a second wave of COVID-19 cases. EBC will continue its ongoing bond purchase stimulus by EUR500 billion euros to EUR1.85 trillion and will extend its support program until at least March 2022 from the current earliest end date of mid 2021.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sterling was set to snap five weeks of gains with a slump on Friday, as leaders on both sides of Brexit trade talks sounded doubtful about finding a resolution, while the Australian dollar soared along with iron ore prices to hit a 2-1/2 year high.
The greenback was pinned near a two-and-a-half year low, with markets heavily short dollars as investors bet on better returns in other currencies as the pandemic recovery takes hold.
The euro rose to $1.2158 even after the European Central Bank expanded its bond buying scheme, given the move was widely expected. The central bank also lifted growth forecasts but lowered inflation projections for 2022.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar drifted lower to 90.662, which is barely a third of one percent above last week's 31-month trough.
Moves in morning trade were modest, but enough to push the Australian and New Zealand dollars to new multi-year highs and keep the euro within range of last week's two-and-a-half year high of $1.2177. 
The yen rose 0.3% to 103.04 per dollar and the New Zealand dollar rose 0.1% to $0.7104.
The Australian dollar has broken past 75 U.S. cents for the first time since mid-2018 overnight as prices surged for Australia's biggest export commodity, iron ore. [AUD/][IRONORE/]
It last traded at $0.7547 and is set for a sixth consecutive weekly rise. Over that time, it has gained five cents, or 7% against the dollar.
The Australian dollar also hit a one-and-a-half year high of 78.58 yen and a six-month peak of A$1.6083 per euro overnight and even leapt against the yuan despite worsening trade tensions between China and Australia. 
""With the iron ore price on a bull run, the Aussie is largely ignoring 'bad' news,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso.
FINAL COUNTDOWN
Investors have until the weekend to make last-minute adjustments to their sterling positions as Brexit trade talks enter their final lap. [GBP/]
The pound slipped 0.8% overnight after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday there was ""a strong possibility"" Britain and the European Union would fail to strike a deal and it changed hands at $1.3306 in Asian morning trade.
The British pound has shed 1% so far this week as efforts to seal a trade deal with the EU before protections on some $1 trillion in annual trade expire at the end of the month have yielded little thus far.
Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has said talks are ""difficult,"" have set Sunday as the deadline for finding a way forward.
Sterling volatility gauges are soaring as markets expect a wild ride to the finish line.

Significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance, and fisheries.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, with traders keeping a wary eye on the ongoing negotiations over Brexit trade in Europe and a Covid-19 relief package in the U.S., ahead of key central bank meetings.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.050, only slightly above the recent 2 1/2-year low of 90.471.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 104.50, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.2% at 0.7461.
Democrat and Republican negotiators have been unable to solve disagreements over aid to state and local governments, meaning that a broader stimulus package to help the U.S. economy recover from the Covid-19 hit remains a pipe dream, for now.
However, the two sides managed to get together to approve a stopgap government funding bill on Wednesday, proving that compromises can be made.
“The proactiveness shown by the parties involved is proving enough to keep markets upbeat, and this should limit the ability of the dollar to recover,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.6% to 1.3322, after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to come to an agreement in a dinner meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen late Wednesday over a Brexit trade agreement.
The pair agreed they have until Sunday to take a ""firm decision"" about the future of trade talks, but remain ""far apart"" on a deal.
The outcome disappointed some investors, who hoped that the dinner would bring some resolution to the stalemate between the two parties before the end-of-year deadline. The slowdown in U.K. growth, with October's GDP growth figure coming in at 0.4%, a drop from 1.1% in September, didn't help.
“Sterling remains highly exposed to the downside if the prospect of no deal becomes even more realistic,” ING added.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD edged 0.1% higher to 1.2096, but this follows four straight days of losses, with the pair down almost a cent from its 2 1/2-year high of $1.2177 touched on Friday.
The European Central Bank is widely expected to increase the size and scope of its bond-buying program at its final policy-making meeting of the year later Thursday, against a background of a downward revision to its growth and inflation forecasts due to the latest wave of the pandemic.
“Our base case remains for a EUR500bn step up in the PEPP in December,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a research note. “In addition, we think the ECB will signal net asset purchases will continue for a very long time. The duration of PEPP will be expanded through to at least the end of 2021 and possibly into 2022.”"

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, as the U.S. and the U.K. both scramble to meet deadlines for the latest stimulus measures and Brexit trade talks with the European Union (EU) respectively
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 91.075 by 9:44 PM ET (1:44 AM GMT), just above the two-and-a-half-year low of 90.471 seen on Friday.
Investors turned to the dollar, viewed as a safe-haven asset, as doubts begin to mount on whether the Republicans and Democrats can reach a consensus over the latest stimulus measures. The two sides have until Dec. 11 to do so, in order to avert a government shutdown. However, it remains to be seen whether the two parties can agree on one of the proposals and counter proposals currently flying around Congress.
The Federal Reserve will convene for its last policy meeting of 2020 later in the day.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.24% to 1.3364, staying above the week’s low of $1.3225 seen on Monday after falling around 0.5% on Thursday. This was after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to delay a “firm decision” about the future of Brexit talks during their meeting.
Despite a “lively” dinner with Johnson, von der Leyen warned afterwards that the European Commission and the U.K. remain “far apart” on the trade deal.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey issued a warning of his own, saying that a no-deal Brexit would cause longer-term damage to the U.K.’s economy than even the COVID-19 pandemic, with the impact of the change potentially felt for decades.
The outcome disappointed some investors, who hoped that the dinner to bring some resolution to the stalemate between the two parties before the end-of-year deadline.
“It looks like there won’t be any agreement to present to the EU summit starting today. Markets have been quite optimistic about a deal. I’m a bit surprised,” Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank senior market economist Ayako Sera told Reuters.
Sera was referring to the European Council, which will meet from Dec. 10 to 11 in Brussels. The European Central Bank (ECB) is also convening for its last policy meeting of 2020 later in the day, where it is widely expected to expand stimulus measures to support the COVID-19-stricken EU economy.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has already made it clear in recent weeks that an expanded Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and more subsidized long-term loans for banks will form the basis of the ECB’s policy measures.
The euro fell to $1.2082, a fourth consecutive day of losses and slightly below the two-and-a-half year high of $1.2177 seen on Friday. Lagarde’s comments have also reduced investor appetite for the euro.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.05% to 104.27.

The British pound dropped to as low as $1.3311 and last stood at $1.3345, down 0.4% on the day, though it stayed above this week's low of $1.3225 set on Monday.
The U.S. dollar, which tends to fall when risk appetite is strong, held firm against other major currencies as an agreement on U.S. stimulus remains elusive as proposals and counterproposals on COVID-19 aid have flown around the U.S. Capitol.
The dollar index stood at 91.029, off Friday's 2 1/2-year low of 90.471.

The euro slipped to $1.2082, after four straight days of losses and down about a cent from its 2 1/2-year high of $1.2177 touched on Friday.
Also curbing appetite for the common currency, the European Central Bank is widely expected to expand its stimulus measures to prop up the recession-hit currency bloc at its policy meeting later on Thursday.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has made clear in recent weeks that a bigger Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and more subsidised long-term loans for banks will form the backbone of its policy measures.

Investing.com – The pound eased two-month highs Wednesday but remained supported as investors seemingly bet the UK-EU will find a way out from their Brexit talks quagmire as both sides are keen to avoid a no-deal Brexit.   
GBP/USD rose  0.30% to $1.3392, but had jumped to a session high of $1.3478 earlier in the day. 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Brussels on Wednesday seeking to find common ground on ""significant differences"" that have stifled talks for eight months. A dinner meeting between Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been billed as the final showdown for talks, but European leaders have conceded a quick resolution is unlikely. 
""An agreement in principle has been found in the following areas, amongst others: border control posts/entry points specifically for checks on animals, plants and derived products, export declarations, the supply of medicines, the supply of chilled meats, and other food products to supermarkets, and a clarification on the application of State aid under the terms of the Protocol,"" according to a joint EU statement. 
The intervention by chief negotiators on both sides has been hastened somewhat by the narrowing window of opportunity to clinch a deal ahead of the year-end deadline. Without a deal, both sides would have to adopt World Trade Organization trade terms that could see higher them impose higher levies on each other's products.     "
813,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Option traders haven’t been this cautious about the pound since the aftermath of the Brexit referendum four-and-a-half years ago.
The relative cost of hedging losses in sterling against the euro through the end of December is trading near the highest level since June 2016. Over the week ahead, that premium is the steepest among major currencies and nearly four times its nearest peer, the Norwegian krone.
The increasingly bearish positioning in the market comes ahead of crunch Brexit trade talks later Wednesday. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission’s Ursula von der Leyen are due to meet in Brussels to break the deadlock before Britain’s transition period to leave the bloc ends on Dec. 31.
With time to strike a deal running out though and after positioning for a breakthrough last weekend, some investors are bracing for a more negative turn.
“It remains highly uncertain whether there will be a deal or not, and the market is unlikely to have priced in the one or the other end result entirely,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, a foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “It might well be that the market takes some time to assess how good or bad the result actually is, which could see more muted movements or quick corrections of sharp moves.”
For now at least, the pessimism isn’t spilling over into the spot market. The pound rose as much as 0.8% on Wednesday to $1.3459, its highest level since Friday, helped by broad dollar weakness.
The U.K. currency has gained more than 8% against the dollar since June amid speculation a deal will eventually be reached and on a resumption of global risk appetite. The pound fell 8% against the dollar on the day after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, its largest fall on record.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Wednesday, with growing confidence surrounding U.S. fiscal stimulus and the vaccine rollout prompting traders to seek out riskier currencies.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.812, still only slightly above the recent 2 1/2-year low of 90.471.
EUR/USD edged 0.3% higher to 1.2132, but off the Friday’s high of 1.2177, a level last seen in April 2018, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 104.23, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was up 0.5% at 0.7445.
On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin proposed a package of relief measures with a sticker price of $916 billion, fractionally more than the $908 billion package proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers last week. That increases the pressure on Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who continues to reject any bill that includes help specifically for state and municipal governments, to drop his opposition.
Adding to the general air of optimism, hitting the safe haven dollar, was a Food and Drug Administration data dump flagging no new safety or efficacy concerns over the Pfixer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, implying it will be approved for use in America when the administration meets on Thursday. The U.K. has already started vaccinating its population with this drug.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3382, with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set to have dinner with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later Wednesday, to try and find solutions to the remaining issues stopping holding up a post-Brexit trade agreement.
News on Tuesday that the U.K. government has dropped controversial clauses in its U.K. Internal Market Bill has helped the tone, being seen as a sign that the U.K. wants a deal more than Johnson is admitting. 
The focus is also on the European Central Bank, as it’s widely expected to increase the size and scope of its bond-buying program when its governing council gets together for the final policy-making meeting of the year on Thursday. 
Investors will also be looking to see what the central bank will do or say about the euro, which has already gained 8% in 2020 and remains well above the $1.20 level which had previously been seen as a form of pain threshold.
“Given non-negligible market expectations of further ECB easing and the structural USD decline in place, it will be difficult for the ECB to lean against the wind and tame the euro upside,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with investors taking stock of the risks ahead ranging from Brexit trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union (EU) to the U.S. Congress’ debate over the latest COVID-19 stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 90.898 by 10:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT). The dollar is around half a percent above the two-and-a-half-year low seen on Friday as short sellers jumped in.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 104.14.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7417, with the AUD receiving a boost from December's Westpac Consumer Sentiment (WCS). The WCS’s jump to 4.1%, against November’s 2.5% jump, was the highest in a decade.
Meanwhile, the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7039.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.5333. China's November consumer price index (CPI) came in below expectation, with data showing that CPI contracted 0.6% month-on-month and contracted 0.5% year-on-year, while the producer price index (PPI) contracted 1.5% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 1.3367. The pound whipsawed before steadying above recent lows earlier, with Brexit talks currently deadlocked. It remains to be seen whether a dinner between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels will achieve what negotiators could not. Should the dinner fail, the U.K. faces a chaotic split from the EU should a deal not be reached before the end-of-year deadline.
In anticipation of the wild ride ahead, volatility gauges for the pound have surged. One-week sterling implied volatility saw a fresh eight-month high on Wednesday alongside an elevated premium of puts to calls.
“Put a gun to my head and I’d be a buyer of sterling, as I see the risk skewed that Johnson would come back with some sort of agreement,” Pepperstone’s Chris Weston told Reuters, although he added rewards for such a bet might be limited.
“Broad positioning is short sterling, but not at extremes by any means. This limits the prospect we get an exaggerated short-covering rally to say $1.3800 or $1.4000.”
Across the Atlantic, all eyes are on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after his statement on Twitter on Tuesday that he had spoken to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi about a $916 billion offer for a COVID-19 relief bill. The amount is slightly higher than the $908 billion package proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers during the previous week.
The focus is also on the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Fed, both due to hand down their last policy decisions for 2020 on Thursday. For the ECB in particular, investors are looking to see what the central bank will do or say about the euro, which has already gained 8% in 2020.
“It will be a very difficult task for the central bank to weaken the euro,” ING strategists said in a note.
“There is a risk is that the press conference bias pushes the euro higher, particularly if the forward guidance beyond the December easing package is not overly strong,” the note added.
Other investors remained cautious about the dollar’s short-term prospects.
“Things are just stalled at the moment, but they haven’t changed,” Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
Uncertainty around Brexit, around the progress of a fiscal spending package through U.S. Congress and around the outcome of Thursday’s ECB meeting have traders temporarily cautious. “We think risk sentiment is going to stay strong … but there’s a few potential spanners in the works, so people are thinking ‘Let’s just hold off pushing the market even higher,’ and that’s why everything’s just stopped where it is,” Speizer added."

Investing.com – The pound pared losses on Tuesday as the U.K. dropped parts of its controversial internal market bill, paving the way for both sides to meet in Brussels on Wednesday to clinch an agreement.
GBP/USD fell 0.09% to $1.3364, but had slumped to a session low of $1.3291 earlier in the day.  
The U.K. government reached a post-Brexit arrangement in principle over the Irish border with the European Union after agreeing to ditch the most controversial parts of its internal markets bill. 
""An agreement in principle has been found in the following areas, amongst others: border control posts/entry points specifically for checks on animals, plants and derived products, export declarations, the supply of medicines, the supply of chilled meats, and other food products to supermarkets, and a clarification on the application of State aid under the terms of the Protocol,"" according to a joint EU statement. 
But the bill -- a source of contention among EU leaders as it clashes with key terms of the withdrawal agreement requiring that Northern Ireland, in the post-Brexit period, follow EU rules in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland -- is not one of the key sticking points that have held negotiations hostage. 
Market participants appear hopeful, however, that Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will reach a consensus on sticking points that have held negotiations hostage so far.
The ""fact that both sides are unwilling to end the negotiations and to expose themselves to the accusation of not having done everything to reach an agreement is indeed a GBP-positive signal,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. 
Both sides on Monday admitted that significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance, and fisheries.
Britain reiterated hat talks would not be dragged on into the new year.
The U.K. and EU have until the end of the year to reach a deal, or run the risk of having to impose taxes on each other's goods. "
817,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Pound traders who were jolted by the reality that the U.K. could leave the European Union without a trade deal are rethinking their positions ahead of crisis talks in Brussels.
The relative cost of hedging against a weaker pound over the next week is now the highest among the world’s major currencies. Over the next month, it’s second only to the Turkish lira. And the jump in the currency’s one-week implied volatility this quarter is almost triple its nearest contender.
Investors were largely pricing in a bare-bones trade pact before the weekend. They were taken by surprise when the rhetoric suddenly turned negative, and the prospect of a deal seemed less likely. The pound fell as much as 1.6% against the dollar on Monday, and 1.3% versus the euro, the most since September.
RBC Europe Ltd. now puts the odds of a deal at 50-50, down from a 70% chance just a week ago, and sees the pound falling as much as 6% against the dollar within days if there’s no agreement. MUFG warns of an 8% plunge within a week.
“Currency traders and anyone investing in the pound at the moment is quite punch drunk after four years of trying to second-guess it,” Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “Any deal at this point would be good for sterling.”
Sell the Rally
Lait sees a 5% to 6% advance in the pound on a deal, and a similar move down if the U.K. crashes out. RBC expects sterling to rise 2% to 3%, but recommends selling the pound if it rallies. It fell 0.2% to $1.3352 as of 9:59 a.m. on Tuesday, and weakened to 90.85 pence per euro.
For now, the surprise is that the spot market isn’t reacting more to the news, explains Kit Juckes, a London-based chief currency strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA.
“Such a binary outcome as we are now facing, with Boris Johnson heading to Brussels for last-ditch talks and both sides urging the other to give ground, is bound to trigger a significant move,” he wrote in a note to clients. “That the outcome is coming in mid-December as markets dry up before us, just adds to the jeopardy.”
He sees the euro-pound cross rising to 95 pence if the deal is called off, and falling to 85 if there’s a breakthrough. “The only thing I don’t know, is how to place odds on these two outcomes,” Juckes said.
Here are the possible outcomes to watch out for as events unfold.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher from weak levels in early European trade Tuesday, with traders balancing rising Covid-19 cases and expanding lockdowns with likely fiscal stimulus and a vaccine rollout.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 90.907, only slightly above the 2 1/2-year low of 90.471 on Friday.
EUR/USD edged 0.1% higher to 1.2112, but off Friday’s high of 1.2177, a level last seen in April 2018, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was down 0.2% at 0.7409.
The U.S. Congress is poised to vote this week on a stopgap funding measure. This is likely to pass, allowing the lawmakers more time to negotiate an emergency coronavirus stimulus plan, with a deal of around $908 billion already on the table.
The need for such a package is beyond dispute, with many states posting new records for deaths and hospitalizations following the Thanksgiving holiday. This has prompted new restrictions, with California shutting all but critical infrastructure and retail operations in its worst-hit areas, while a ban on indoor restaurant dining is also looming in New York City.
That said, ING kept its bearish dollar call, expecting the greenback to fall a further 5%-10% against most currencies in 2021.
“Central to this bearish dollar call is: (i) continued good news on vaccine approvals and roll outs such that economic growth can accelerate (probably from 2Q onwards) and (ii) the Fed keeping the punchbowl of cheap liquidity in place and not blinking when inflation starts to rise,” ING analysts wrote in a research note.
The U.K. starts to vaccinate its public Tuesday with the Pfizer/BioNTech injection, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration meets to potentially authorize the use of this vaccine on Thursday. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.3336, continuing to retreat from the two-and-a-half year high of $1.3540 seen on Friday, amid uncertainty over the outcome of a post-Brexit trade deal.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to travel to Brussels later Tuesday in a last-ditch effort to broker a deal with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as difficulties remain over issues such as fishing rights waters around the UK, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes.
The relatively small losses in sterling suggest that most traders still expect a deal to be agreed at the last minute, but time is running short.
“A deal would unlock some modest upside for sterling, but a lack of risk premium means there is potential for plenty more downside should talks end without an agreement,” ING analysts said.

Investing.com – The dollar edged a little higher on Tuesday morning in Asia, keeping the momentum from overnight. The surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. boosted hopes for more fiscal support, which actually provided some stimulus to the greenback.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies rose 0.09% to 90.868 by 11:22 PM ET (3:22 AM GMT). The U.S. Congress is poised to vote this week on a stopgap funding measure to give lawmakers more time to negotiate an emergency coronavirus stimulus plan. The U.S. government is likely to hammer out a new stimulus deal that could be worth around $908 billion.
“We have seen some hopeful signs of engagement from our Democratic colleagues. But we have no reason to think the underlying disagreements about policy are going to evaporate overnight,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.
“Markets are focusing more on the prospects of more fiscal stimulus,” Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at Barclays Capital, told Reuters on Monday.
The new stimulus deal is urgently needed as California imposed new COVID-19 restrictions, under which all but critical infrastructure and retail operations in its worst-hit areas were ordered to shut. A ban on indoor restaurant dining also loomed in New York City.
That said, the greenback still hovered at a two and half year low, dragged down by disappointing U.S. jobs data released last Friday.
In Asia, the USD/JPY pair added 0.02% to 104.04. Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday his adminstration will compile a new COVID-19 economic stimulus package worth JPY73.6 trillion ($708 billion), with fiscal measures at JPY 40 trillion ($385 billion).
The USD/CNY pair also inched up 0.11% to 6.5368. Chinese foreign trade saw a strong recovery, as data released Monday suggested exports jumped more than 21% from the same month in 2019. Market watchers also paid close attention to renewed U.S.-China tensions, after the U.S. announced sanctions on 14 Chinese officials for the crackdown on Hong Kong.
Down under, the AUD/USD pair edged up 0.08% to 0.7426, while the NZD/USD pair was down 0.16% to 0.7031."

Investing.com – The pound recovered some of its losses on Monday as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to travel to Brussels in a last-ditch effort to broker a post-Brexit deal.
GBP/USD fell 0.28% to $1.3399, but had been down more than 1% intraday.
Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will iron out the remaining differences on a post-Brexit trade deal in the coming days, the pair announced in a joint statement.
""We agreed that the conditions for finalizing an agreement are not there due to the remaining significant differences on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries,"" the statement said. ""We asked our Chief Negotiators and their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days.”
In an apparent olive branch to the EU, Johnson is said to have offered to drop the UK's controversial internal markets bill in exchange for a deal. The legislation has drawn strong criticism from the EU as it seeks to undermine parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
The early-day slump in the pound arrived after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly admitted in an update to EU leaders that a deal continues to hang in the balance and set a new deadline of Wednesday to conclude talks.
Both sides have upped the mixed messages on post-Brexit deal progress casting doubt among investors on whether any progress has been made.
""It is very difficult to work out how much of the toing and froing is stage-managed theatrics and how much represents genuine differences between the UK and EU. The market just wants to know one way or another if a no-deal outcome is on the agenda,"" said AJ Bell, a financial services firm in London, according to the Telegraph."

LONDON (Reuters) - A stronger U.S. dollar will increasingly weigh on emerging- market economic prospects, since developing countries have taken on so much dollar-denominated debt in the past decade, the Bank of International Settlements said on Monday.
The dollar has fallen by more than 12% from March highs after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to record lows. But the BIS said the dollar remains prone to big swings and any reversal in risk sentiment could see it rise -- hurting the growth outlook for emerging markets. 
Using data from 21 emerging-market economies between 1990 and 2019, BIS researchers found that an increase of 1 percentage point in the dollar's value against a basket of currencies led to a 0.3% drop in the growth outlook for those countries.
That was evident in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic this year, when a near 10% rise in the value of the dollar index in the first three months of 2020 resulted in record bond outflows from emerging markets and wider spreads. 
""Emerging market economies (EMEs) are particularly vulnerable to changes in the value of the dollar through these channels, making the broad dollar exchange rate an EME-specific risk factor,"" the BIS said.
Emerging-market U.S. dollar-denominated debt as a percentage of gross domestic product has tripled to nearly 10% from around 3.5% during the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, foreign ownership in their domestic bond markets stands at nearly 20%.
A negative correlation between broad-based dollar strength and global growth occurs through various channels.
When investor risk appetite declines, flight to safety may both push up the dollar and weaken global economic activity through capital outflows and tighter financial conditions, as investors and lenders retrench from risky investments and borrowers.
A stronger dollar also weakens the balance sheets of those dollar borrowers, whose liabilities rise relative to their assets.

And tighter dollar credit can encourage global investors to cut their local currency bond holdings, including from countries whose currencies have not weakened sharply.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Monday, rebounding from multi-year lows as Covid-19 cases continue to mount and lockdowns expand, weighing on the U.S. economic recovery.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 90.993, rebounding a touch having hit a 2 1/2-year low of 90.471 on Friday.
EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2117, having climbed on Friday as high as 1.2177, a level last seen in April 2018. USD/JPY was largely unchanged at 104.11, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD was flat at 0.7420, not far off its highest level in more than two years.
On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered large parts of the most populous U.S. state to close down again as Covid-19 cases spiked to record levels.
California reported more than 30,000 new cases on Sunday, exceeding the state's previous high, and marked a new record for hospitalized Covid-19 patients. New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia also announced record one-day rises in new infections.
This wave of cases is likely hitting the U.S. economic recovery, as evidenced by Friday’s non-farm payrolls growing by 245,000 in November, much lower than October’s rise of 610,000, and the smallest gain recorded since May.
However, the gains to the safe haven dollar from this backdrop have been limited, amid growing confidence there will be new fiscal stimulus to boost the U.S. economy as a bipartisan group of lawmakers look to get through a $908 billion bill this week.
Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meet this week to set policy, with the ECB seen as more likely to ramp up stimulus.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.9% to 1.3314, retreating from the two-and-a-half year high of $1.3540 seen on Friday, after talks over the weekend stalled over issues such as fishing rights waters around the U.K., fair competition and ways to solve future disputes.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are due to hold a call on Monday evening, but these negotiations appear to be going right to the edge amid reports Johnson is prepared to walk away.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar started the week on the back foot on Monday after soft U.S. jobs data only solidified expectations of a fresh economic package, while the British pound eyed last-ditch trade talks between the United Kingdom and European Union.
The dollar index stood little changed at 90.726, having hit a 2 1/2-year low of 90.471 on Friday. The euro changed hands at $1.2133, having climbed on Friday to as high as $1.2177, a level last seen in April 2018.
Friday's U.S. jobs data showed non-farm payrolls increased by 245,000 last month, the smallest gain since May, in a sign the jobs recovery is losing momentum on the third wave of coronavirus infections.
Yet traders perceived the data as putting pressure on Washington to pass a new round of stimulus to help the coronavirus-battered economy, keeping overall risk appetite intact and capping the U.S. dollar against riskier currencies.
""When risk appetite is in a good place, like it is now, demand for the U.S. dollar is going to be weaker,"" said Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney. ""Further dollar depreciation is baked in the cake.""
Talks aimed at delivering a fresh infusion of coronavirus relief gathered momentum in the U.S. Congress on Friday, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers worked to put the finishing touches on a $908 billion bill they hope to get through this week.
The spectre of fresh borrowing boosted the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield to an 8 1/2-month high of 0.986% on Friday, helping lift the dollar against the yen to 104.20 yen.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to rush to ramp up stimulus at its meeting next week, with Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Friday saying it would take until springtime to see the effects of a vaccine roll-out and gauge the economic trajectory.
The European Central Bank sets policy on Thursday.
The offshore yuan stood at 6.5184 per dollar, just shy of its 2 1/2-year high of 6.5070 set on Friday.
Chinese policymakers are comfortable with the yuan's rise as the country's economic rebound accelerates and the central bank gives the market greater leeway in setting the currency's value, sources told Reuters.
The yuan, also known as the renminbi, moved little after data showing China's exports rose at the fastest pace in nearly three years in November.
Sterling traded little changed at $1.3422, stepping back from 2 1/2-year high of $1.3540 touched on Friday as investors looked to talks between Britain and the EU this week to avert a chaotic parting of ways at the end of the year.
Earlier it fell to as low as $1.3360 after weekend talks stalled on three thorny issues.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyden are due to hold a call on Monday evening in the hope that, by then, differences over fishing rights waters around the United Kingdom, fair competition and ways to solve future disputes will have narrowed.

""While it is hard to predict how the negotiations will go, I suspect sterling will be well-supported unless we have a complete breakdown in the talks,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital in Tokyo.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, starting the week on a down note as disappointing U.S. jobs data raised expectations of fresh economic stimulus measures, and pound investors monitored Brexit trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union (EU).
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 90.767 by 9:43 PM ET (1:43 AM GMT). The dollar hit a two and half year low, while the Euro climbed to its highest level since April 2018, during Friday’s session.
U.S. jobs data released on Friday disappointed, with manufacturing payrolls increasing by 27,000 in November, lower than both the 43,000 reading in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 33,000 increase.
Non-farm payrolls grew by 245,000, much lower than the forecasted 469,000 and October’s rise of 610,000. It was also the smallest gain recorded since May. The unemployment rate fell to 6.7%, below the forecast 6.8% and October’s 6.9% rate.
The data suggested that job recovery is losing speed as the U.S. continues to battle a third wave of COVID-19 cases. However, investors are hopeful that the disappointing data will be a catalyst for Congress to pass the latest round of stimulus measures to aid the economic recovery.
“There was limited reaction to the soft number. Markets are focusing more on the prospects of more fiscal stimulus,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital, senior currency strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
Talks over the stimulus measures seemed to gather momentum on Friday, with a bipartisan group of lawmakers working on perfecting their $908 billion bill, which they hope will be passed within the week. Congress has until Dec. 11 to pass the measures to avoid a government shutdown.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 104.06.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 0.7428, while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.7038.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.10% to 6.5367. The offshore yuan hovered just shy of its two-and-a-half year high of 6.5070 seen on Friday. Meanwhile, Chinese trade data, including exports, imports and the trade balance, is due to be released later in the day.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.06% to 1.3429. The pound retreated from the two-and-a-half year high of $1.3540 seen on Friday, as all eyes are on the talks between the U.K. and the EU as the end-of-year deadline to reach a deal draws closer.
It had seen a fall to $1.3360 earlier, after talks over the weekend stalled over issues such as fishing rights waters around the U.K., fair competition and ways to solve future disputes.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyden are due to speak over the phone later in the day, with hopes that the differences over the issues will have narrowed by then.

GBP/USD rose 0.11% to $1.3437.
After one week of intensive negotiations in London, the U.K. and EU agreed to pause talks as the conditions for a post-Brexit agreement are not met, Michel Barnier said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will attempt to make progress on a deal in talks set for Saturday.
The update comes on the heels of a report from the U.K. conceding that talks were at a “very difficult stage.""
That cooled some earlier optimism that a deal was “imminent” and could be reached before the end of the week.
“(T)time is in very short supply and we are at a very difficult point in the talks,"" Johnson’s spokesman said. “What is certain is that we will not be able to agree a deal which doesn’t respect our fundamental principles on sovereignty and taking back control.”
The pound surged earlier Friday after Reuters reported an EU official as saying that a trade deal was “imminent” and could be expected this weekend.
Talks have been held up by several issues including fishing quotas, level playing field rules, and governance.
Both sides are reported to have reached a compromise on fishing quotas.
Under the reported proposal, the U.K. would hold onto increased stocks of fish that are sold in the U.K., while the EU will keep similar quotes of stock that are popular in the EU but not in the U.K.
The spotlight on the progress of Brexit talks has intensified recently as both sides attempt to get a deal over the line before end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31.
If the U.K. and EU fail to reach an agreement by the December-end deadline, then the U.K. will be forced to trade with the EU under World Trade Organization terms."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira briefly slipped on Friday after U.S. lawmakers included mandatory Turkish sanctions in a defence spending bill that moves Washington a step closer to punishing its NATO ally for buying Russian S-400 missile defences last year. 
The final version of the $740 billion annual U.S. defence spending legislation would oblige the White House to select from a list of sanctions over the S-400s, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO operations. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who is set to step down next month, has said he will veto the bill over separate provisions. But he may need some support in Congress and it would be the first such veto in nearly 60 years. 
Turkey's foreign ministry was not immediately available to comment. 
Russia delivered the ground-to-air S-400s last year and Turkey tested them as recently as October. Ankara says they would not be integrated into NATO systems and pose no threat, and has called for a joint working group. 
The threat of Western sanctions has weighed on the lira currency, which hit a series of record lows this year and weakened nearly 1% before recovering to 7.76 versus the dollar at 1019 GMT. 
Sanctions could harm a Turkish economy already struggling with a coronavirus-induced slowdown, double-digit inflation and badly depleted foreign reserves.
BIDEN TO BE TOUGHER? 
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is expected to be tougher on Turkey than Trump, who had warm ties with President Tayyip Erdogan despite growing hostility among U.S. lawmakers towards Turkey's more aggressive foreign policy.
The defence bill includes sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which are designed in part to deter cooperation with Russia. The U.S. president would select from a list of mild to harsh possible sanctions.
""If Trump chooses from among the lighter sanctions I think given the global risk appetite we still can see a benign performance in the lira,"" said one Turkish trader.
The bill is the result of months of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. Once the House and Senate vote on it as soon as early next week, Trump, a Republican, has 10 days to veto or it becomes law.
Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen said in a statement that Congress did what Trump would not: ""show President Erdogan that we will not back down when it comes to protecting our security and that of our faithful NATO allies.""

Last year, Washington suspended Turkey from its F-35 jet programme over the S-400s.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The outlook for the Canadian dollar has improved on expectations the currency will benefit from domestic economic stimulus and the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine, a Reuters poll showed, with the loonie already gaining in recent months.
Canada's dollar has strengthened 14% against its U.S. counterpart since March, reaching a two-year high on Thursday at 1.2848 per U.S. dollar, or 77.83 U.S. cents.
It is expected to pull back about 1% to 1.30 in one month, before strengthening to 1.2739 in a year, the poll of 30 currency strategists showed. Last month, strategists projected 1.32 in one month and 1.2938 in a year.
""We see several tailwinds for the Canadian dollar,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics. ""For a start, we think the consensus is far underestimating the outlook for the Canadian recovery, which we think is poised to outperform many other economies given the much greater policy support provided this year.""
On Monday, Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland forecast the budget deficit hitting an historic C$382 billion ($297 billion) on COVID-19 emergency aid, adding that C$100 billion in stimulus would be rolled out once the virus is under control.
An additional tailwind for the loonie could be higher oil prices, Brown said.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, has soared nearly 30% since the start of November and Wall Street has climbed to a record high on hopes a speedy approval of COVID-19 vaccines would boost global economic growth.
""An improvement in risk appetite will help the loonie rally in 2021 due to the currency's high beta,"" said Simon Harvey, an FX market analyst at Monex Europe and Monex Canada.
High-beta currencies tend to be more sensitive to changes in risk appetite than the broader market. Canada runs a current account deficit, so it depends on foreign investment, including portfolio flows.
A second wave of the pandemic has led to increasing efforts from Canadian provinces to clamp down on businesses and curb gatherings.
Still, Harvey expects a high savings rate and strong vaccination orders, along with fiscal stimulus, to support economic recovery.
Canada has made deals to buy more vaccine doses per capita than any other nation, and Canadian health authorities could approve  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s coronavirus vaccine within the next week, allowing distribution to start in early 2021.
Canada's savings rate has climbed to 14.6% in the third quarter from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, which could help boost consumer spending when restrictions ease.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's weakening is likely to last at least another six months as investors continue to shift to risky assets and higher returns, a Reuters poll of currency strategists found.
Following a stocks rally in November, the dollar - which thrives in a risk-off environment - weakened around 3.0% last month and is down almost 6% this year, putting the currency en route for its worst yearly performance since 2017.
Despite around 14 million people infected in the U.S. by the coronavirus, hopes for fresh fiscal stimulus and a vaccine will keep global stocks well bid and the dollar weak over the medium term.
The Federal Reserve is expected to give markets a better steer soon on how long it will continue to buy bonds to provide support to the U.S. economy, which could hurt the dollar.
Over two-thirds of analysts - 51 of 72 - who answered a separate question expected the downward dollar trend to last at least until mid-2021. The remaining 21 said it would reverse before that.

Those results match findings from a November global stocks poll where a majority of analysts said the current equity bull run would continue for six months or more.
""You can't have such an over-valued dollar, it's as simple as that. The dollar had become and still is significantly over-valued on pretty much any measure that I can think of as a result of monetary policy divergence, and convergence takes away all reasons for that,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""The market reacting to that monetary policy adjustment is accelerating because that seems to bring reasons to look for better investment opportunities abroad.""
Despite the dim outlook, the dollar's role in the global payments system will limit the currency from slipping too much. Most currencies that strengthened significantly against the dollar in 2020 were not expected to repeat their performances next year.
The euro, which has risen over 8% this year, is forecast to give up some of its gains and trade around $1.20 over the next three months. The currency was trading around $1.21 on Thursday.
""There's a lot of good news in the price right now. Markets, with respect to the vaccine news, have behaved as if we're already there, but the reality is that we've got a quarter or two of really nasty economic news before we get there,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""With so much good news in the price, I think perhaps there is the possibility we will see a little bit of a retrenchment. I'm not looking for the euro to totally fade away but I do think there is a possibility we have some sort of pullback in the euro in the next few months.""
The euro was forecast to gain nearly 2% in a year to trade at $1.23, the highest 12-month prediction in nearly two and a half years.
Emerging-market currencies have taken a beating this year, but saw a turnaround in November as foreign investors returned, a trend expected to help those currencies post some gains against the dollar over the next 12 months.
""We knew all the issues of dollar weakness, we just didn't see any currencies that looked attractive. But right now, with the rebound in China and the pick-up in commodity prices, all of a sudden there are places to put your money,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).

Investing.com - The dollar slipped lower in early European trade Friday, on course for a loss of nearly 2% for the week, as increased optimism that U.S. lawmakers will come together to agree a new coronavirus relief package boosts risk sentiment.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 90.638, just above the two-and-a-half year low of 90.504 seen on Thursday. 
EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2155, at its highest level since 2018, having climbed over 8% this year, the single currency’s biggest gain since 2007.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 103.92, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD edged 0.1% lower to 0.7431, not far off its highest level in more than two years.
The Covid-19 surge continues to hit the U.S. hard, with this week seeing 14 million recorded, including the highest number of daily deaths, new infections and hospitalizations since the pandemic began.
However, the safe haven dollar hasn’t seen any benefit from these worries amid optimism over the successful roll-out of vaccines and new fiscal stimulus to boost the U.S. economy.
A $908 billion Covid-19 aid package was gaining traction in Congress, with senior Democrat officials backing the proposal and Republican hardliner Mitch McConnell stating that a deal was “within reach” as he proposed a smaller package.
The monthly official employment report, due for release later Friday, may be the catalyst to push the two sides together. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 469,000 jobs in November, a sharp slowdown from 638,000 jobs added in October. This follows on from a disappointing ADP jobs release, which showed private payrolls grew at their slowest pace since July. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3443, having climbed as high as $1.35 on Thursday on a report the U.K. and EU have made progress on fishing quotas, raising hopes that a post-Brexit deal is within sight.
However, some of this optimism has retreated after U.K. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said Friday that these trade talks are in a “difficult phase”,  and after France threatened to veto any deal it didn’t approve of, suggesting there was still plenty of negotiation to take place.
“Markets are still assessing how much this is simply part of the negotiating strategy,” said analysts at ING, in a research note, “but with any deal having to be agreed within the next few days it is no surprise investors (who have retained an optimistic tone on Brexit so far) are getting increasingly nervous.”
The new deal on OPEC+ output policy supported oil currencies, with Russia's ruble gaining 0.3% to hit a three-month high against the dollar of 74.175.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets' euphoric reaction to the recent COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs and U.S. election results is pushing some currencies up so fast that rumblings have begun about a potential new FX war.
Almost a decade after Brazil's finance minister likened Western central bank money-printing to economic warfare, some of the conditions that led countries to weaken their currencies then look to be forming again.
Investors' growing eagerness to buy into risky assets gave emerging market currencies their best month in nearly two years in November, stretching a run of gains that started in June.
A further extension -- seen as likely after the dollar hit a two-year low on Thursday -- would mark be their longest uninterrupted climb since 2012.
South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand are already worried enough that they have either intervened in their foreign exchange markets or taken other steps to try to prevent fragile economic recoveries being snuffed out.
In Sweden, whose crown is this year's best-performing currency, the central bank unexpectedly increased its money-printing programme last week.
""I think currency war would be a bit of a dramatic term to use right now, but you could say there have been some early warning shots,"" said UBS's head of emerging market strategy Manik Narain. ""And if this currency strength continues, these countries could start to push back harder.""
Competitive currency devaluations are blamed by economists for exacerbating the 1930s Great Depression and dragging for decades on world trade by fostering protectionism.
The cycle usually starts with tit-for-tat interest rate cuts and interventions, but can quickly escalate into capital controls or investment taxes to ward off hot foreign money like that now flooding into emerging markets.
Institute of International Finance data on Tuesday showed investors splurged a record $40 billion on stocks and $37 billion on bonds in emerging markets last month, a spree that was more than the previous three months combined.
The Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Turkish Lira, South African rand, Russian rouble and Polish zloty all jumped between 5% and 10%, adding to 5%-12% leaps in China, Taiwan and Korea's currencies since June.

ROOM TO BOOM
It is not only the expectation that COVID-19 vaccines will normalise trade, travel and commodity prices driving the trend.
Low global interest rates mean developing countries are among the few places left where investors make positive returns on bonds, while the boom in electric cars and automation has seen money pour into Asia's big microchip makers.
Global trade is expected to see the first expansion next year in three years, with the hope too that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's government will be more predictable on that front.
""If you look at the areas in which potential currency wars could break out it would be the areas which have attracted the most capital flows or the most equity flows,"" PIMCO's head of emerging markets portfolio management Pramol Dhawan said.
He cited Taiwan, South Korea and China as the main hotspots, and potentially India going forward. It has already stacked up $85 billion worth of dollar reserves this year, Narain at UBS added, helping keep the rupee on the leash.

DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY
It is usually the pace rather than the extent of FX moves that lead countries to act.
When Brazil's Guido Mantega declared a currency war had broken out in September 2010, the dollar had lost more than 10% in around three months. And it didn't stop there, falling 17% by June 2011.
This time around the greenback is down 11% in eight months. But U.S. investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) thinks it is still 10% overvalued and Citi forecasts a record 20% drop next year as economies recover and the Federal Reserve continues stimulus.
For a graphic on MSCI EM FX index 2012 and 2020:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvybwkypg/EM%20FX.PNG
IIF chief economist Robin Brooks doubts even that kind of move would trigger a full-blown currency war.
Taking away the 8% leap in China's yuan, EM currencies are still down 5% this year, and some of the hardest hit, like Brazil's real and Turkey's lira, are down 25% and worth a fraction of what they were a decade ago.
""Honestly, if I were an EM policymaker, every day where my currency was strengthening I would be happy,"" Brooks said, noting that a stronger currency also makes it cheaper to repay the dollar-denominated debt that has been piling up.
Nevertheless, he thinks the euro and the yen will be shoved higher, requiring the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan to respond. China's reaction will also be watched closely, while Thailand's statement that it is watching the baht's rise ""24 hours a day"" highlights the building tensions.
""Our concern is the speed of the adjustment,"" Thailand's central bank governor, Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, said last week. ""It has been largely nothing to do with us"".

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, with investors continuing to bet on further declines as optimism that the COVID-19 pandemic is slowly starting to come to an end. The euro, on the other hand, benefitted from the dollar’s weakness and looked set to close its best week in a month.
“The euro is holding above the $1.21 level for the first time since spring 2018, despite the fact that there is only a week to go before the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to add more policy stimulus,” Rabobank strategist Jane Foley told Reuters.
“There is no doubt that the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve have been hugely successful at weakening the value of the dollar since the spring this year,” she added.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 90.688 by 9:38 PM ET (1:38 AM GMT).
The index has slid around 12% from a three-year high of 102.990 in March to a two-and-a-half year low of 90.504 seen on Thursday. Investors have a heavily short dollar stance recently, over bets that rates in the U.S. will stay low for a long time and being forcing yield-seekers to search for better returns elsewhere.
Even the ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases and lockdowns in the U.S. failed to turn investors to the safe-haven asset. Investors continue to place their bets on more government support, either through further monetary easing or fiscal spending.
A $908 billion COVID-19 aid package was gaining traction in Congress on Thursday, and the Fed is widely expected to expand its bond buying program. Both would see the dollar continue its downward trend, with bond buying keeping yields anchored and spending increasing appetite for riskier currencies.
Both the Fed and ECB will convene for their respective policy meetings during the following week.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.02% to 103.81. The euro was also headed for its best week in six months against the yen, but the yen rose a little against the weakened dollar during the previous session.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7428 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 0.7062.
“Call it December seasonality come early, call it what you will, but the market’s appetite for the NZD is insatiable at the moment,” ANZ Bank chief economist Sharon Zollner and strategist David Croy said in a note.
“And while the rubber bands of momentum and valuation are starting to get stretched, technically it looks very solid; commodity prices are rising; and nobody wants to own dollars ... a break of 0.7160 would be extremely bullish,” the note added.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.5467.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3450. Although the pound saw a one-year high, investors continue to await the outcome of Brexit trade deal talks between the U.K. and the European Union (EU).
“Traders need to assess their sterling exposures into the weekend … if I were running long exposures, I wouldn’t be adding ... but questioning, if we see a deal, how punchy the gapping risk will be … if we don’t get a deal and the rhetoric from (Chief EU negotiator Michel) Barnier or the British camp shows limited progress then we could see GBP/USD gap lower on Monday,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
Investors now look to U.S. jobs data, including November’s manufacturing payrolls and non-farm payrolls and due later in the day, for further clues to the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19."

Forex – The pound surged Thursday on a report the U.K. and EU have made progress on fishing quotas, stoking hopes that a post-Brexit deal is within sight.
GBP/USD rose 0.63% to $1.3447, though had been as high as $1.35 intraday.
The U.K. and EU have reportedly found a compromise on fishing quotas. Under the reported proposal, the U.K. would hold onto increased stocks of fish that are sold in the U.K., while the EU will keep similar quotes of stock that are popular in the EU but not in the U.K.


The report of a compromise comes less than a week after EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's proposal - to return about 15% to 18% of the fish caught by European fleets in British waters to the U.K. under a free trade agreement - was rejected by the U.K.
As the clock counts down toward the end of the transition period on Dec. 31, market participants have had to contend with mixed messages of the progress on Brexit talks that have dominated direction in the pound.
The progress on fisheries marked progress after a months-long stalemate, but there remain other issues that continued to stifle the prospect of a deal including a level playing field and governance."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In Monserrat Casanovas' small grocery store in downtown Buenos Aires, a hand-written sign reads ""sale of imported drinks suspended,"" highlighting the devaluation fears that are jamming up trade in the South American country.
It is a road Argentina, no stranger to currency woes, has been down many times before. But it poses one of the biggest challenges yet to the year-old government of center-left President Alberto Fernandez.
Argentina desperately needs to rev up trade flows. But they have been gummed up by tough capital controls keeping the peso artificially strong, sparking fierce demand for black market dollars and prompting widespread angst about devaluation.
Traders and producers alike, especially the country's important grains farmers, have been holding off on selling produce, anticipating a new official exchange rate that would make the dollar value of their exports worth more in pesos.
""If you are an importer, you import at the official exchange rate but you don't know the rate you will get to replace the merchandise,"" said Guido Lorenzo, an economist at consultancy LCG, adding this could stoke inflation or hit availability.
""The exporter does the same, evaluates whether it is convenient for him to sell or hoard the product.""
That hoarding has seen exports dip since a peak in May, with Argentina's trade surplus dropping sharply in September and October to around $600 million, from above $1.4 billion before.
The country needs dollars from exports to bulk up depleted reserves and ensure it can make future payments after restructuring over $100 billion in foreign currency debt. It is now facing crunch talks with the International Monetary Fund over $44 billion it cannot repay.
(Graphic: Argentina: Trade winds ebb https://graphics.reuters.com/ARGENTINA-CURRENCY/TRADE/qmyvmxlgkpr/chart.png) 
Exports to China particularly tumbled in recent months, with a large drop in sales of soy beans, indicating farmers in Argentina's fertile Pampas grasslands are sitting on their crops. That has also hit crushing volumes at the huge processing plants along the country's Parana river.
Behind the fear of devaluation is a wide gap between the official peso-dollar spot rate and informal currency trades, where greenbacks have cost more than twice the price.
Argentina's peso was trading at 81.49 per dollar on Wednesday, compared to 154 in the black market and 148 per dollar in the legal but unofficial 'blue-chip swap' market. Net reserves meanwhile have dipped near to zero.
(Graphic: Argentina's diverging peso https://graphics.reuters.com/ARGENTINA-CURRENCY/RESERVES/nmovaddlkpa/chart.png) 
Argentina, caught in recession since 2018, defaulted on its debt for the ninth time earlier this year. It needs to revive the economy and bolster reserves to reassure markets and investors it will not simply slide into default again.
Casanovas, the shopkeeper, said uncertainty over prices meant some ""some suppliers had suspended sales.""
""I set my prices in pesos, but when I have to replace it, then yes it's in dollars,"" she said, explaining why she had pulled imported drinks off the shelves at the neighborhood store. ""I cannot be setting a different sale price every day.""
Glass company owner Rodrigo Gomez said the COVID-19 pandemic and currency gap had both affected business.
""The pandemic caused a serious problem, which is that many factories are at 50% of available personnel,"" he said.
""The other problem is not the exchange rate but the gap between one and the other. There were weeks without sales, when the black-market dollar began to climb,"" he added.
Some analysts and investors said the central bank will have to choose between further tightening already strict capital controls or allowing the peso to devalue more quickly.
In the key grains sector, farmers and industry officials say many growers are waiting to make sales, hoping for a weaker peso with their products priced in dollars. That is stalling exports and hitting the inflow of foreign currency.
The government is also pushing exporters to convert their dollars into local currency, with the threat of an export ban for those who do not comply. 
""Farmers trust in grain. Not in pesos,"" said Santiago del Solar, a corn and soy farmer in the bread-basket province of Buenos Aires. ""They won't sell grain just to get pesos and keep them in the bank.""

Investing.com - The dollar continues to lack friends in early European trade Thursday, with optimism over the rollout of vaccines and talk of new U.S. fiscal stimulus prompting risk-on trades.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 90.925, trading around levels last seen well over two years ago.
EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2124, at levels not seen since April 2018, even with the European Central Bank widely expected to enhance its quantitative easing next week. 
USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.38, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7428, its highest level in more than two years.
Optimism over U.S. stimulus talks and bets on a successful roll-out of vaccines are leading traders to take bets on global growth and thus riskier currencies at the expense of the safe haven dollar, the world’s reserve currency, particularly with the Federal Reserve committed to keeping rates low for years.
This move lower in the dollar has occurred despite the latest employment data showing a slowdown in the jobs recovery, with Wednesday’s monthly ADP report showing private payrolls grew at their slowest pace since July in November.
Weekly initial jobless claims data will be studied later Thursday to see if they provide a similar picture ahead of Friday’s official employment report.
“Data is clearly playing second fiddle to vaccine and stimulus news. Markets may retain an upbeat stance on the latter for now as bipartisan talks resume, providing further support to risk assets and reinforcing the bearish dollar argument,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD gained 0.2% to $1.3385, remaining close to a three-month high. Sterling received a boost Wednesday as the U.K. approved a Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech and said it would start vaccinating those most at risk early next week. However, the focus remains on the Brexit trade deal talks.
France warned Wednesday it could veto a trade deal between the U.K. and the European Union if it doesn’t like the terms of the deal, an intervention that puts pressure on EU negotiator Michel Barnier not to give too much ground.
Over the past month, the number of short bets against sterling has increased, according to data by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggesting the downside potential is quite large, should the two sides fail to agree a deal.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, reversing its earlier downward trend even as the possibility of U.S. economic stimulus measures and the first approval of a COVID-19 vaccine increased investors’ risk appetites.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.04% to 91.037 by 9:58 PM ET (1:58 AM GMT).
Although Republicans and Democrats in Congress have yet to reach agreement over the latest stimulus measures’ price tag, investors remained optimistic that a $908 billion bipartisan proposal is slowly gaining traction.
Congress has until Dec. 11 to pass the $1.4 trillion budget or risk a government shutdown, adding a big incentive to reach a deal before the deadline.
Across the Atlantic, the U.K. became the first country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162b2 candidate jointly developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), on Wednesday. Inoculation of those most as risk is expected to begin early in the following week.
The news helped to give the euro a boost, despite expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) will enhance its quantitative easing when it convenes for its monetary policy meeting on Dec. 10.
""On the whole, the new U.S. economic team under President Biden will be dovish, if not directly pursing a weaker dollar per se … the next target for the euro should be its February 2018 peak of $1.2555. When the ECB eases its policy next week as expected, I bet the euro will gain rather than fall,"" Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.10% to 104.50. Japan’s services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 47.8 in November, little changed from October’s figure of 47.7.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 0.7402. The AUD saw a 26-month high overnight as investors digested Wednesday’s positive data, including GDP, that showed that the Australian economy saw a stronger-than-expected bounce back in the third quarter. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.7061.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.12% to 6.5547. China released November’s Caixin services PMI which beat expectations by coming in at 57.8.
Investors are also looking at the offshore yuan, which saw a two and a half year high in November and continues to maintain its strength over expectations that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s administration will be more conducive to Chinese economic growth.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3367. The pound was hovering near a three-month high, after trading unevenly during the previous session as Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union (EU) reach ""a make-or-break moment"", according to chief EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Envoys from EU member states also urged Barnier not to be rushed into an unsatisfactory agreement, even as the year-end deadline to reach a consensus looms closer.
The talks reportedly remain stalled, as they have been for the past few months, over issues such as fishing rights in U.K. waters, ensuring fair competition guarantees and ways to solve future disputes.",,,,,

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar licked wounds near a 2 1/2-year low against a basket of major currencies on Thursday as investors wagered that more economic stimulus from Washington and the expected start of COVID-19 vaccinations would support riskier assets.
Although Republicans and Democrats in U.S. Congress remained unable to reach agreement on fresh relief for a pandemic-hit U.S. economy, there were early signs that a $908 billion bipartisan proposal could be gaining traction.
Investors expect lawmakers to reach a deal eventually with the two parties also facing a Dec. 11 deadline to pass a $1.4 trillion budget or risk a shutdown of the government.
Britain on Wednesday approved a COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech and said it would start vaccinating those most at risk early next week.
The optimism helped to boost the euro despite widespread expectations the European Central Bank will enhance its quantitative easing next week.
The common currency fetched $1.2113, having reached its loftiest level since late April 2018 in the previous day's trade.
The dollar index slipped to 2 1/2-year low of 90.987 on Wednesday and last stood at 91.040.

The U.S. currency was on back foot against most other currencies, apart from the safe-haven yen, against which the dollar held firmer at 104.46 yen.
The Australian dollar traded at $0.7418, having hit a 26-month high in the previous session after data showed Australia's economy rebounded more than expected in the third quarter.
The offshore Chinese yuan changed hands at 6.5468 per dollar, near its 2 1/2-year high touched last month, as it maintained its strength on expectations a Biden White House would be more conducive for China's economic growth.
The British pound held near a three-month high, last traded flat at $1.3370 after a choppy Wednesday trade as markets looked to whether Britain and the European Union can clinch a trade deal.
The negotiators may have enough progress to agree on a deal in the next few days, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, giving the pound a slight lift.
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator told member states' envoys on Wednesday negotiations were reaching ""a make-or-break moment"", and they urged him not to be rushed into an unsatisfactory agreement.
Four diplomats told Reuters after a briefing by Michel Barnier the talks remained snagged - as they have been for months - on fishing rights in British waters, ensuring fair competition guarantees and ways to solve future disputes.

Bitcoin held firm at $19,215, staying near its record high of $19,918 hit earlier this week.

Investing.com - The pound erased gains and slipped to a three-week low Wednesday after the EU's chief Brexit negotiator said progress had stalled, cooling expectations that a deal was near.
GBP/USD fell 0.45% to 1.3354.
The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal wasn't guaranteed, signaling that differences over key issues including access to UK fishing territory and level playing field rules remain a stumbling block.
The news comes a day after the reports suggesting that post-Brexit trade talks had reached the so-called 'tunnel' - a media blackout period - stoking hopes both sides were set to reach a consensus on a deal.
Ahead of the update, there were signs the ongoing stalemate was starting to unnerve some members, who have called on the EU to ramp-up preparation for a no deal scenario.
There likely could be another twist to come in Brexit talks in the days ahead as the UK's proposal for a new finance bill - that undermines parts of the Brexit Withdrawal agreement - could dent the little progress in negotiations seen so far, Daiwa Capital Markets warned.
""(i)f the UK government presses ahead next week with draft clauses in the Finance Bill that were inconsistent with the Withdrawal Agreement, Barnier judged that the talks would be 'in crisis'.""
Time is running out for a post-Brexit deal just under a month to go until the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31, when the UK, without a deal, will trade with the EU under economically-burdensome World Trade Organization terms."

Pound traders are positioning for a choppy ride as trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union reach a watershed moment.
The currency suffered its biggest drop in close to three weeks after the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal wasn’t guaranteed, while the relative cost of hedging against a weaker sterling climbed to a nearly seven-month high.
Traders are getting jumpy as the Dec. 31 deadline to reach an agreement nears. Many investors expect the two sides to strike a deal, which leaves the currency vulnerable to any setbacks that could upend that assumption.
“We haven’t seen a move like that in the pound-dollar pair thus far, with the market ignoring most negative comments in recent weeks,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura International Plc. “I don’t think this leads to a sustained selloff in the pound but it’s definitely going to be choppy from here.”
Barnier told EU ambassadors that the three main obstacles to a trade deal with the U.K. remain unresolved: a level playing field for business, access to British fishing waters and the way in which the overall agreement is enforced.
The pound fell as much as 0.6%, it’s biggest drop since Nov. 12, to $1.3339. It briefly matched a three-month high earlier in the session, with officials racing to strike a deal before the start of next week.

At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 91.157, hitting its lowest levels since April 2018.
EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.2081, its highest in over two-years, helped by a strong German retail sales for October. Sales rose 2.6% on the month after an upwardly revised drop of 1.9% in September. 
USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 104.47, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7381.
Optimism about promising vaccine trials has driven the buying of riskier currencies at the expense of the greenback. The U.K. Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use, potentially rolling it out next week. However, it has been commodity-currencies that have profited most, the Canadian dollar hitting a new 52-week high in early trading.
Additionally, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators and House members proposed $908 billion worth of coronavirus relief measures on Tuesday.
This bill was kiboshed by Senate leader Mitch McConnell, but with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi talking again for the first time since the election, expectations are growing that a package can be agreed in the lame-duck period of the Trump administration.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the U.S. economy remains in a fragile state, in Tuesday’s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, putting the pressure on Congress to provide more fiscal help.
Powell is due to testify before Congress again later in the day, and the Fed meets for its policy meeting on Dec. 15 to 16. The ADP employment release will also be watched later Wednesday, ahead of Friday's official jobs data.
“CFTC FX positioning data ending 24 November highlights new USD selling pressure as all but one of the G10 currencies saw an increase in long positioning vs the US dollar,” said ING’s Francesco Pesole, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD gained 0.2% to $1.3438, close to a three-month high, with the focus remaining on the Brexit trade deal talks.
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is due to brief leaders that there may end up being no deal by the end of the year, newswires reported early Wednesday.
“We could see a short-squeeze if a deal is reached in the coming week, but the net short positioning displayed in CFTC data does not alter the fact that the downside impact would likely be asymmetrically stronger in a no-deal scenario,” Pesole added."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, hovering near its lowest levels in two and a half years as cautious optimism that the U.S will restart stimulus talks improved risk appetite.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.16% to 91.148 by 11:31 PM ET (3:31 AM GMT). The index hit 91.263, its lowest level since April 2018, overnight.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi held their first talks for the latest stimulus measures since the Nov. 3 presidential elections. Mnuchin will also review the proposed $908 billion worth of measures laid out by a bipartisan group of senators and House members, Pelosi said.
Meanwhile, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress should include a fresh wave of measures in a $1.4 trillion spending bill, aimed at heading off a government shutdown amid COVID-19. McConnell also teased a revised version of his own plan to fellow Republicans on the same day.
However, some investors were unconvinced that the talks will lead to a consensus on the measures.
“The currency market is skeptical whether these proposals could be agreed in a swift manner, since hopes were shattered once already when a stimulus package didn’t come into fruition before the presidential election … traders are closely eyeing for convincing clues that the agreement is actually reached,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution during Tuesday’s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, warning that the U.S. economy remains in a damaged and uncertain state.
Powell and Mnuchin also urged Congress to provide more help for small businesses amid a surging coronavirus pandemic and concern that relief from a vaccine may not arrive in time to keep them from failing.
Powell is due to testify before Congress again later in the day, and the Fed meets for its policy meeting on Dec. 15 to 16.
Weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity data for November, including the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), alongside speculation on whether the Fed will move to support the U.S. economy before COVID-19 vaccinations are made available, weighed on the dollar.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 104.39.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7382. The AUD got a boost from data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day showing that GDP grew 3.3% quarter-on-quarter, above the 2.6% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the second quarter’s 7% contraction. The GDP shrank 3.8% year-on-year, above the forecast 4.4% contraction and the 6.3% contraction reported in the second quarter.
The Reserve Bank of Australia kept its December interest rate unchanged at 0.10%, as widely expected, on Tuesday.
The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.7068, hovering near the highest level since April 2018 seen overnight.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.24% to 6.5546. Investors await the Caixin services PMI, due on Thursday.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3422. The pound remained near a three-month high, with U.K. and European Union (EU) negotiators work to reach a Brexit trade deal before the following week. Although the talks have reportedly entered the “tunnel” stage, there were warnings on Tuesday that the talks remained deadlocked over issues such as fishing, governance rules and dispute resolution."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stayed near a 2 1/2-year low on Wednesday as investors cautiously eyed developments in talks about further fiscal stimulus from the United States, while risk currencies held onto gains on improving risk appetite.
Against major currencies, the dollar index fell 0.7% to 91.318, having hit its lowest level since late April 2018 of 91.263 overnight.
The Euro and the Kiwi steadied after an overnight jump to their 2 1/2-year highs as the dollar broadly weakened.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi held stimulus talks for the first time since the election, while a bipartisan group of senators and House members proposed $908 billion worth of coronavirus relief measures.
Pelosi said in a statement after the talks that Mnuchin would review coronavirus relief proposals.
U.S. Senate leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Congress should include a fresh wave of coronavirus stimulus in a must-pass $1.4 trillion spending bill aimed at heading off a government shutdown in the midst of a pandemic.
""The currency market is sceptical whether these proposals could be agreed in a swift manner, since hopes were shattered once already when a stimulus package didn’t come into fruition before the presidential election,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. 
""Traders are closely eyeing for convincing clues that the agreement is actually reached,"" he said.
Also weighing the safe-haven dollar was weaker-than-expected U.S. manufacturing activity data and speculation that the Federal Reserve will act to support the economy before vaccinations become available.

Sterling also remained near a three-month peak against the greenback after Times Radio said Brexit trade deal talks have entered the ""tunnel"" stage of negotiations.
Separately, a senior British minister said on Tuesday there was still a chance of a no-trade deal Brexit as talks with the European Union had snagged on fishing, governance rules and dispute resolution.
The pound was little changed at $1.3421.
The risk-sensitive Aussie firmed to 0.7389 per dollar after the Australian GDP data was released, while the New Zealand dollar changed hands at $0.7071, holding steady near the highest level since April 2018 hit overnight..

843,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Credit traders may be the luckiest lot on Wall Street as banks set bonuses after a banner year for trading.
Desk jockeys who make their living matching buyers with sellers of company bonds are poised for a 16% jump in total compensation, on average, the biggest gain among Wall Street trading desks, according to a compensation report from recruiting firm Options Group. Managing directors in credit trading will typically pull in over $1 million in 2020, said the firm’s chief executive officer, Michael Karp.
“Expectations of people in the credit business are quite high,” Karp said in an interview, a hint that not everyone will be happy with what they get. “Credit was obviously the outperformer in fixed-income products.”
Predicting individual awards for traders is a bit tougher this year after banks saw their performance diverge in 2020’s wild markets and as industry leaders weigh how much to lavish on well-paid staff amid a pandemic that’s left millions unemployed and taken a toll on businesses such as lending. Odds are that -- averages aside -- pockets of traders won’t get what they think they deserve for boosting revenue to the highest levels in years.
“In a pandemic and with regulators and politicians and everybody, it makes it complicated,” said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation consultant Johnson Associates. He broadly predicts the biggest bonus increases will go to fixed-income desks, which includes credit trading. But generally, “traders will probably be disappointed.”
Hiring in Credit
Desks focused on a variety of markets benefited as prices plunged in response to the pandemic, but then rebounded, setting off surges in client activity that generated billions of dollars in additional revenue. That left the five biggest U.S. investment banks on pace for their first $100 billion year for trading revenue in more than a decade.
Options Group predicts rates traders will see the second-highest gain, with a 14% increase in total compensation this year. That compares with a 9% jump for fixed-income traders more broadly and a 7% increase for their counterparts on equities desks.
Credit desks benefited in particular from the Federal Reserve’s low rates and unprecedented efforts to support corporate-debt markets. With investor activity expected to remain strong, banks will probably beef up their credit desks over the next 12 to 18 months, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. said in a report last month.
Even so, payouts probably won’t keep pace with rising revenue as firms focus on costs ahead of an uncertain 2021, including an expected surge in loan defaults. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), for example, may increase traders’ annual bonuses 15% to 20% -- far short of the 48% surge in revenue in the firm’s markets businesses in the first three quarters. At Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., where the jump in trading revenue wasn’t as strong, senior executives are floating plans to keep the bonus pool for sales and trading flat with 2019.
“Even though the trading revenue growth was incredible, it won’t correlate to a similar jump in bonus,” Karp said. “Banks are not making their compensation decisions based on one spectacular year.”

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Tuesday, as positive Covid-19 vaccine news and the expectation of more monetary easing sends traders towards riskier currencies.
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.748, after suffering its worst month in November since July.
EUR/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.1965, just below the 1.20 resistance level, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 104.33, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7366 after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its key interest rate and three-year yield target at 0.10%, as expected.
Optimism about promising vaccine trials has driven the buying of riskier currencies at the expense of the greenback. This has continued after biotech  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) requested clearance for its coronavirus vaccine in both the U.S. and Europe on Monday, after late-stage trial results showed the vaccine was highly effective in preventing Covid-19, with no serious safety problems.
“While there are clouds on the horizon, they should not be enough to derail the generally positive risk environment, which is keeping the dollar under pressure,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The major concern remains the accelerating number of Covid-19 cases throughout the U.S. For example, in California, Governor Gavin Newsom said the state was at a ""tipping point"", and he may have to introduce new ""stay-at-home"" orders on the state's roughly 40 million residents as the pandemic threatens to soon overwhelm hospitals.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before Congress later in the day and on Wednesday, ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting on Dec. 15 and 16. 
Given the absence of new fiscal stimulus from U.S. lawmakers, investors now expect the Fed to step in with more bond buying at its December meeting, and thus his testimony will be listened to carefully.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD gained 0.5% to $1.3388, helped by U.K. house prices rising at the fastest pace in almost six years in November, up 0.9% from a month earlier and up 6.5% from a year earlier, as the property market defied a wider economic slump.
That said, the state of the Brexit talks remain the dominant influence, and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to stay in London for two or three more days. 
The overall tone has been helped by comments from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who said the negotiators have the options in front of them to conclude a Brexit free-trade deal this week.
USD/CNY dropped 0.2% to 6.5633, after activity in China's factory sector accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade in November, showing the world's second-largest economy is recovering strongly.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, starting the new month on a lower note even after closing its worst month since July in November. Giving the dollar a boost, however, was the expectation of more monetary easing measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.12% to 91.903 by 9:27 PM ET (1:27 AM GMT).
Promising data from COVID-19 vaccine developers have driven investors towards riskier currencies and higher-yielding assets outside the U.S., leading to a shortage of dollars.  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) plans to request clearance for its candidate mRNA-1273 in the U.S. and Europe after announcing that the vaccine was 94.1% effective.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) are also awaiting word on their own approval request for its candidate BNT162b2, which will be reviewed before Moderna’s application.
The rising number of COVID-19 cases globally has also not provided much support to the dollar, with expectations growing that the Fed will step in to boost the economy ahead of the vaccines.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before Congress later in the day and on Wednesday, ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting on Dec. 15 and 16. Both events will be closely watched by investors for clues on next moves.
Some investors remained hopeful.
“There’s a general view that there’ll be something in the December meeting...given there’s no real fiscal development in the last few months,” BNZ senior markets strategist Jason Wong told Reuters.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan also said on Monday that difficult months lie ahead. “We’re bracing ourselves here,” he said.
Kaplan added that the central bank is open-minded about shifting or even expanding its bond buying program, but “we are going to have to figure out whether it’s in the December meeting or a future meeting.”
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 104.34.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7358. The Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its last policy decision for 2020 later in the day, although it is widely expected that no changes will be made. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7023. The Antipodean risk currencies were reversing some of Monday’s losses but remained just below the milestone peaks seen on Monday.

The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 1.3343, with hopes that the U.K. and the European Union (EU) will reach a Brexit deal before the end of the month boosting the pound.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar was under pressure on Tuesday, after closing out its worst month since July with a little bounce and as investors reckon on even more U.S. monetary easing.
The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars clawed back some of Monday's losses, each rising roughly 0.2% early in the Asia session, although both remained just below milestone peaks hit a day ago. 
The euro rose 0.1% but kept shy of $1.20, while sterling held on to gains made against the dollar as traders cling to hopes for a Brexit trade deal before the year's end.
Investors are heavily short dollars as optimism about promising vaccine trials drives buying of riskier currencies and higher yielding assets outside the United States.
Even worries about rising coronavirus cases have not offered too much support to the greenback, as speculation grows that the Federal Reserve might act to support the economy through a tough winter before vaccinations can turn the tide on the pandemic.
""There's a general view that there'll be something in the December meeting...given there's no real fiscal development in the last few months,"" said BNZ senior markets strategist Jason Wong.
The Fed meets to set policy on Dec. 15 and 16, though before then - on Tuesday and Wednesday - Fed Chair Jerome Powell will appear before Congress and his remarks will be closely watched for any clues as to the next moves.
The policymakers gather as authorities mull approving two effective vaccines, developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for distribution, but as surging virus cases put the brakes on the U.S. economic recovery.

""We are going to have to figure out whether it's in the December meeting or a future meeting,"" he said.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar was steady at 91.942. The safe-haven Japanese yen held its ground at 104.33 per dollar.
Elsewhere in Asia, the South Korean won, which is up more than 7% on the dollar since September, recouped half of a 0.4% drop made on Monday. The Chinese yuan was firm in offshore trade following solid economic data on Monday. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia announces the outcome of its final policy meeting for the year at 0330 GMT, though traders expect no changes and few surprises. European inflation figures and U.S. manufacturing data is due later on Tuesday.
Britain and the European Union also warned each other on Monday that time was running out to reach a Brexit trade deal, though investors remain hopeful and have kept the pound at $1.3337 and 89.48 pence per euro.
Talks between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and British chief negotiator David Frost are ongoing and the EU team are expected to stay in London for two or three more days.

847,"<span>Nov 30, 2020 04:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is cautioning lawmakers that the U.S. economy remains in a damaged and uncertain state, despite progress made in the development of Covid-19 vaccines.
“Recent news on the vaccine front is very positive for the medium term,” Powell said in testimony released Monday ahead of a Tuesday hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. “For now, significant challenges and uncertainties remain, including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups.”
The hearing will be the first appearance of the Fed chair and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin together since they disagreed over the expiration of several emergency loan programs set up after the pandemic hit in March.
Fed officials including Powell said the central bank’s lending facilities should continue because they have served as critical backstops and restored market confidence. Most of the funds are scheduled to expire on Dec. 31.
But some of of the programs have been sparsely used. These include the Main Street facility, which supports bank lending to mid-sized companies, as well as facilities to aid the corporate bond market and the debt of cash-strapped municipalities.
Mnuchin announced earlier this month that those Fed programs must sunset at the end of December, and asked the central bank to return unused funding authorized for the programs by Congress.
The Treasury also said it plans to move that unspent money into its general account, over which Congress has authority.
Mnuchin said the programs are no longer needed, and the money should be returned to Congress and put to better use elsewhere.The Fed responded -- in a rare public fracture between the two institutions -- that it “would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities” remain as a backstop “for our still-strained and vulnerable economy.”

Forex – The pound continued to hang onto gains Monday as traders continue to bet on a Brexit deal despite little progress on U.K.-European Union trade talks to resolve differences on several issues including fishing quotas. 
GBP/USD rose 0.24% to $1.3346, though had been as high as $1.3385.
The EU is reportedly ready to launch no-deal contingency plans as soon as Thursday, should crunch talks this week not resolve key sticking issues including quotas on fishing, Reuters reported, citing an EU senior diplomat.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier last week offered to return about 15% to 18% of the fish caught by European fleets in British waters to the U.K. under a free trade agreement.  But the U.K. views the proposal as unacceptable as it falls well short of the 80% demanded, according to U.K. media reports.
While many expect both sides to break the deadlock on fishing quotes, other sticking points including a level playing field and governance are of far more importance and there is uncertainty over whether an agreement will be reached this week.
""While the EU’s first offer on fish was rejected by the UK as derisory, some reports suggest that an agreement on that political sensitivity could be reached this week,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said. ""But there are, of course, far more important issues than fish to resolve – the level playing-field and governance being key – and it remains to be seen still whether an agreement on those fundamentals can be achieved this week.""
Time is running out for both sides to strike a deal with just about one month to go until the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31. If the U.K. and EU fail to reach an agreement by the December-end deadline, then the U.K. will be forced to trade with the EU under economically-burdensome World Trade Organization terms.
""Sometime this week is thought to be the deadline to have a deal in order to give enough time for lawyers to finalize the text and translation into the EU’s 24 official languages ahead of the New Year’s Day leave deadline,"" Scotia Economics said.
The game of brinkmanship between both sides added to the uncertainty over the prospect of a deal, with Germany reiterating the economic bloc's stance that while a deal is in the best interests of both sides, the EU will not cave in to the U.K.'s demands.
""We don't need a deal at any price and we have made this clear,"" Germany chancellor Angela Merkel said. ""A deal is in everyone's interest."""

Investing.com - The dollar drifted lower in early European trade Monday, as lingering vaccine optimism and expectations of more Federal Reserve largesse see traders desert this safe haven.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.705, having fallen to its lowest level since April 2018 and set to record its largest monthly fall since July, down 2.5%.
EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1968, close to a three-month high, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.03. 
“We expect USD to stay on a gentle downtrend as the prospect of the Fed adding more liquidity if needed should keep a floor below risk assets and the U.S. data-flow may remain mixed,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Largely promising trial results for three major vaccine candidates have prompted investors to seek out riskier assets, with the dollar being hit hard as a consequence, even with the wave of new infections, and fresh lockdowns,  across Europe and the United States.
Given the absence of new fiscal stimulus from U.S. lawmakers to help the economy during the second Covid wave, investors now expect the Federal Reserve to step in with more bond buying, when it next meets in December.
With this in mind, Fed head Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday will be studied carefully for clues as to the central bank's thinking, as well as the monthly jobs report at the end of the week.
GBP/USD gained 0.3% to $1.3348, not far off a three-month high of $1.3399 seen late last week, as investors wagered a Brexit deal would be brokered in the near future.
The two sides are running out of time to clinch a Brexit trade deal, Environment Secretary George Eustice said on Monday.
""This is the crucial week, we need to get a breakthrough,"" Eustice told Sky News.
“The levels at which GBP is trading is still telling us that very little of the worst-case scenario is being priced in,” added ING. “Accordingly, should negotiations definitively collapse, the downside reaction should still be asymmetrical.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, heading towards its larges fall since July as lingering vaccine optimism and the possibility of further monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve saw investors retreat from the safe-haven asset.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.15% to 91.688 by 9:56 AM ET (1:56 AM GMT), down some 2.4% for November.
Recent positive news from developers, including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), regarding their COVID-19 vaccine candidates, had boosted investor sentiment and seen the dollar fall. Even worries about developing and delivering the vaccines failed to significantly curb hopes for an end to the COVID-19 pandemic that has been raging for almost a year now.
However, the ever-rising numbers of new cases globally, alongside fresh lockdowns, helped stem the dollar’s losses as safe-haven currencies received some support.
With the U.S. election and the ensuing confusion over the results distracting Congress from passing the latest stimulus measures, it is now widely expected that the Fed will step in to fill the gap, mostly likely through bond purchases.
“The themes remain familiar: broad dollar weakness amid improving risk appetite … this sentiment is likely to continue into December and the U.S. Fed meeting, at which some further action is likely, given the near-term virus risks in the United States,” ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.18% to 103.88. Data released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 3.8% month-on-month in October, slightly lower than the 3.9% growth seen in September.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.24% to 0.7401. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.30% to 0.7044, seeing a two-and-a-half year high and headed towards its best monthly percentage gain in seven years.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.08% to 6.5791. China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) grew 52.1% in November, higher than the 51.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 51.4% reading. The non-manufacturing PMI also exceed expectations, growing 56.4% in November against the forecast 56% and October’s 56.2% figure.
The yuan saw a sixth consecutive month of gains, soaring some 9% from its lowest point in May. Although the yuan saw a similar run of monthly gains in 2013, the recent run exceeds the former in scope as China’s PMIs indicate a continuous economic recovery from COVID-19.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.3340. The pound had climbed steadily throughout the month to its highest level since September as investors bet that the U.K. and the European Union would reach consensus on their Brexit deal before the deadline.
Investors will be looking to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for further clues into the central bank’s reasoning and the direction of the economic recovery. U.S. labor market data, including the Markit composite PMI, is also due later in the week.
“The dollar is gently drifting to the lows of the year as investors re-allocate portfolios to recovery trades in the rest of the world … while more lockdown restrictions may stand to curb U.S. equity markets, the prospect of the Fed being prepared to add more liquidity should limit any dollar upside. And given that the dollar index has fallen in seven of the last ten Decembers, we do favor gentle dollar downside into the end of the year,” ING strategists Chris Turner and Francesco Pesole said in a note.",,,,,

The dollar index is down some 2.4% for November as promising trial results for three major vaccine candidates excited investors about an eventual end to the coronavirus pandemic. It is nearly 11% below a March peak of 102.990.
Nervousness about a wave of new infections across Europe and the United States, and fresh lockdowns, have provided some support to safe-haven currencies and a slight brake on the dropping dollar.
However, as the drawn-out U.S. election has distracted lawmakers from passing any sort of fiscal spending package, investors have begun to expect that the Fed will step in, probably with more bond buying, when it next meets in December.
Testimony from Fed chair Jerome Powell before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as U.S. labour market data this week will be closely watched for clues as to the central bank's thinking and the broad shape of the economy recovery.
The Japanese yen was a fraction firmer at 104.07 per dollar on Monday and has gained a little over half a percent through November as the death toll from the pandemic climbed towards 1.5 million people.
""The dollar is gently drifting to the lows of the year as investors re-allocate portfolios to recovery trades in the rest of the world,"" ING strategists Chris Turner and Francesco Pesole said in a note to clients. 
""While more lockdown restrictions may stand to curb U.S. equity markets, the prospect of the Fed being prepared to add more liquidity should limit any dollar upside. And given that the dollar index has fallen in seven of the last ten Decembers, we do favour gentle dollar downside into the end of the year.""
November also marks a sixth consecutive monthly gain for the Chinese yuan, which has soared some 9% from a low in May.
That equals a similar run of monthly gains in 2013, but it is far larger in magnitude as China leads the world out of the coronavirus pandemic and capital inflows push the currency to new heights.
It last sat at 6.5743 per dollar in offshore trade, more or less steady as investors await the November purchasing managers' index due at 0100 GMT.

""These month on month reads are all expected to show expansion across the Chinese economy,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at stockbroker CMC Markets in Sydney.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Friday, set to post weekly losses with traders expecting large-scale stimulus from the new administration to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.892, near the three-month low since late Thursday. Volumes are likely to remain limited after Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., with many traders set to enjoy a long weekend.
EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1926, close to a two-month high, while USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 104.06. Additionally, AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7372, near a three-month high, while NZD/USD gained 0.2% to 0.7021, near its strongest level in over two years. 
“The dollar is back at its 2018 lows with DXY [the Dollar Index] breaking below the key 92.00 support,” said analysts at ING, in a research note, stating that the pandemic “appears particularly concerning as major U.S. cities are experiencing large spikes in cases which may fuel further speculation that President-elect Joe Biden will opt for tougher restrictions once he takes office.”
Outgoing President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will leave office if the Electoral College votes for Biden, the closest he has come to conceding the Nov. 3 election and another sign of the returning normalcy in U.S. political circles.
Biden has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his first priority, and has called on U.S. lawmakers to pass a new stimulus bill before he officially takes office in January. His nomination of Janet Yellen, former head of the Federal Reserve who is credited with helping steer the economic recovery after the 2007 financial crisis and ensuing recession, has also played into the underlying belief that more fiscal help is on its way, likely pressurising the dollar.
GBP/USD gained 0.1% to $1.3369, near a three-month high of $1.3399 it touched on Thursday, as market participants look for progress on Brexit talks.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, holding steady amid small market moves. However, it looks set to see weekly losses as improved risk appetite continue to apply pressure.
The U.S.Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 91.983by 9:49 PM ET (1:49 AM GMT), hovering near a three-month low seen overnight.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.23% to 104.02.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7360, after climbing to a near three-month high on Thursday. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 0.7013.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.04% to 6.5770.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3359. The pound saw a near three-month high as well on Thursday, with investors look towards progress on Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union (EU). EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reportedly due to speak with some EU fisheries ministers later in the day to discuss the current state of the trade discussions.
Volume and moves were thin overall, with the U.S. market closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.
“Today will be another quiet day, with almost no catalyst to move the market. The dollar, however, is broadly pressured on month-end selling,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
Optimism over several COVID-19 vaccine developers, including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), announcing positive results for their offerings over the last two weeks, put the dollar under pressure as investors sought risker assets. Also boosting the trend was the beginnings of a transition from incumbent President Donald Trump's administration to that of President-elect Joe Biden.
Although Barclay’s Kadota saw the dollar remaining under pressure in the short-term as vaccine hope linger, market expectations see it firming in mid-term.
“When looking at how economies have rebounded in the July quarter, the United States grew and made a strong rebound. In a scenario where vaccines become gradually available next year and economies return to normal, the U.S. will probably be one of the most resilient among developed countries. And I think that will create a dollar-favorable environment,” he added.
Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank (ECB) chief economist Philip Lane and the minutes from the ECB’s October meeting further confirmed the expected announcement of stimulus measures when the central bank meets in December.
The minutes showed policymakers in agreement that complacency is not an option as Europe continues to struggle through a second wave of COVID-19 cases and beginning to prepare for more stimulus measures.
Lane also warned that tolerating “a longer phase of even lower inflation” would hurt consumption and investment as well as cementing expectations for low price growth in the long run.
The euro saw little change against the dollar but did reach a more than two-months high on Thursday in the wake of the minutes’ release."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady in thin trade on Friday but was on track for weekly losses against a basket of major currencies as it remained under pressure on improving risk appetite.
U.S. markets were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.
""Today will be another quiet day, with almost no catalyst to move the market. The dollar, however, is broadly pressured on month-end selling,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The U.S. dollar index was steady at 92.03 against a basket of major currencies, treading water around a near three-month low of 91.84 it hit overnight.
The dollar has been under pressure this week, as riskier currencies benefited from increased optimism over a string of COVID-19 vaccines news reports and hopes for a more stable period in U.S. politics.
While the greenback will remain under pressure in near term due to prolonged ""risk-on"" sentiment led by vaccine hopes, Barclay's Kadota said the market expects the currency to firm in mid-term.
""When looking at how economies have rebounded in the July quarter, the United States grew and made a strong rebound. In a scenario where vaccines becomes gradually available next year and economies return to normal, the U.S. will probably be one of the most resilient among developed countries. And I think that will create a dollar-favourable environment,"" he said.
Dovish messaging from the European Central Bank's chief economist and the minutes from last month's meeting provided further confirmation of widely expected stimulus at its December gathering.
The central bank's minutes from its October meeting showed policymakers agreed they could not afford to seem complacent during the second wave of the coronavirus, opting instead to lay the groundwork for more stimulus.
The ECB's chief economist Philip Lane had also warned that tolerating ""a longer phase of even lower inflation"" would hurt consumption and investment as well as cementing expectations for low price growth in the future.
The euro was little changed against the greenback at $1.1905, away from a more than two months-high of $1.1941 it marked on Thursday.
Sterling fetched $1.3349, trading near a three-month high of $1.3399 it touched on Thursday, as market participants look for progress on Brexit talks.
The European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier will talk on Friday with some of the bloc's ministers responsible for fisheries to discuss the state of play in the trade discussions with Britain, EU official said. 
The Australian dollar firmed at 0.73605, having climbed to a near three-month high of 0.7374 on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Kiwi changed hands at 0.7006 against the greenback.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, last fetched $17,271.86 in a volatile trade. Overnight, the cryptocurrency plunged as much as 13% to its lowest since Nov. 16, having rallied close to its all-time high of $19,666.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower in early European trade Thursday, weighed by downbeat U.S. data while optimism over coronavirus vaccines prompted traders to seek out riskier currencies.
At 2:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 91.892, falling to its lowest level in more than two months. Volumes are limited with the U.S. on holiday to celebrate Thanksgiving.
EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.1931, close to a two-month high, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3366, close to its highest level in more than two months, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.34.
Additionally, AUD/USD inched up to 0.73664, near its highest since September, while NZD/USD edged up to 0.70036, near its strongest level in over two years. Both currencies are considered guides to risk sentiment due to their close ties with the global commodities trade.
“The benign risk environment and positive outlook for the 2021 post Covid-19 recovery is inducing further flows out of the dollar into cyclical FX,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Optimism surrounding the likelihood of the prompt delivery of multiple Covid-19 vaccines has been added to by expectation of more fiscal stimulus from the incoming Biden administration, particularly after the weekly initial jobless claims data on Wednesday showed unemployment rising again.
The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its last monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and they showed Fed members debated a range of options on bond purchases to support the recovery, including pivoting to purchases of longer-term securities, which could put more pressure on the dollar by keeping long-term yields unattractively low.
“Meeting minutes showed that Fed is debating how to change the asset purchases in December, which makes an Operation Twist highly likely. We still think that a Twist operation can only dampen the latent steepening pressure in the USD curve,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3390, which is near its strongest level since the beginning of September, while EUR/GBP edged up to 0.8917, with traders looking for details on the Brexit trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union this week.
Sterling remains bid despite U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak stating Wednesday in his one-year spending plan that Britain's economy is likely to shrink by just over 11%, with the country having to borrow almost 400 billion pounds this year to pay for the massive coronavirus hit to its economy. This means the budget deficit will jump to its highest level since World War Two.
“In terms of the GBP's main driving factor, the currency still awaits the conclusion of the UK-EU trade negotiations – where a successful outcome should bring EUR/GBP to the 0.88 level,” ING added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on Thursday as downbeat U.S. economic data and optimism about coronavirus vaccines prompted investors to seek out riskier assets tied to global commodities and emerging markets.
The British pound traded near a more than two-month high against the dollar as investors awaited details on trade talks between Britain and the European Union this week.
The dollar's fall has been so rapid that it could rebound in the short term, market watchers said, but some investors still expect a decline over the longer term as they shift positions in expectation that the coronavirus outbreak will wane next year.
""A China-led recovery in the global economy and commodities should benefit commodities currencies,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The outlook is good, but we are reaching levels where authorities might feel some concern. Other emerging market currencies with good fundamentals should benefit."" 
Against the euro, the dollar stood at $1.1926, close to its weakest in more than two months.
Sterling bought $1.3392, which is near its strongest level since Sept. 2. The pound held steady at 89.02 pence per euro.
The dollar was little changed at 104.32 yen.
Investors have rushed to riskier currencies and emerging-market assets in recent weeks after positive data on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and signs of stability in U.S. politics, which has weighed broadly on the dollar.
Sentiment for the greenback took a hit after data on Wednesday showed weekly U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected and personal incomes fell.
Some economists said more job losses are likely as many U.S. states reinforce restrictions on businesses to curb a spread of coronavirus infections.
The dollar index against a basket of six other currencies was near the lowest in more than two months.
In Asia, trading in the dollar was subdued because U.S. financial markets are closed later on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
The onshore yuan rose to 6.5688 per dollar, resuming its advance toward a 29-month high set last week.
The Australian dollar traded near its highest since September, supported by improving risk appetite and strong Chinese demand for the commodities that Australia exports.
The New Zealand dollar traded near its strongest level in more than two years.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, subdued by weak U.S. economic data but with lingering optimism over the development of a COVID-19 vaccine leading investors to riskier assets tied to global commodities and emerging markets.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.09% to 91.918 by 10:05 PM ET (2:05 AM GMT), its lowest level in more than two months. It was also close to its weakest in more than two months against the euro.
The dollar also took a hit after data released on Wednesday showed that the U.S.’s GDP grew 33.1% quarter-on-quarter during the third quarter, just missing the 33.1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but unchanged from the second quarter.
The data also showed 778,000 jobless claims for the past week, higher than the forecast 730,000 claims and the 748,000 claims submitted during the previous week. There were grim warnings that even more job losses could be on the way, with many states imposing restrictive measures to curb the spiking number of COVID-19 cases.
The number of global COVID-19 cases has surpassed 60 million as of Nov. 26, of which over 12.7 million are U.S. cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Positive data for three vaccine candidates’ efficacies, and a smoother transition to the Joe Biden administration in the U.S than appeared to be likely, saw a recent turn towards riskier currencies and emerging market assets. Although the dollar’s subsequent fall was rapid enough to open the possibility of a rebound in the short term, some investors warned that a longer-term decline could be possible and are already shifting their positions in anticipation of the COVID-19 outbreak waning in 2021.
“A China-led recovery in the global economy and commodities should benefit commodities currencies … the outlook is good, but we are reaching levels where authorities might feel some concern. Other emerging market currencies with good fundamentals should benefit,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 104.33.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7366, while the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7003. The AUD traded near its highest since September, boosted by improved risk appetite and strong demand in China for Australian commodities exports. Meanwhile, the NZD was trading near its strongest level in over two years.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.11% to 6.5674. Investors will monitor the onshore yuan to see if the yuan moves towards the 29-month high seen during the previous week.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.09% to 1.3394. The pound was near its strongest level against the dollar since Sep. 2, while holding steady against the euro. Investors await details on the Brexit trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union this week.

Investing.com – The dollar fell to nearly three-month lows on Wednesday, as signs the Federal Reserve is shaping up to tweak its bond-buying policy and weaker than expected jobs data did little to drum up safe-haven support for the world's reserve currency, suggesting a further drop is on the horizon.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.31% to 91.93.
Federal Reserve policymakers debated a range of options on bond purchases to support the recovery, including increasing the pace of purchases or shifting focus to longer duration bonds, the minutes of the Fed's Nov. 4-5 meeting showed.
For now, it appears the central bank will keep its asset purchases on autopilot, though will likely lay out its plan in coming meetings.
""Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon,"" the minutes said.
The willingness to persist with current ultra-loose monetary policy comes in the wake of data showing a back to back rise in weekly jobless claims for the first time since July.
But the sign of weakness in the labor market – ahead of the next week's monthly jobs report –  and the impact of the Covid-19 cases on the economy is unlikely to spur demand for the dollar as the optimism over the vaccine-led outlook is likely to persist.
""The dollar continues its fall from grace, with the benign risk environment (the Dow Jones hit 30,000 for the first time) and the positive outlook for the 2021 post Covid-19 recovery inducing further flows out of the dollar into cyclical FX, with the trade weighted dollar continuing to dip lower,"" ING said in a note."
859,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro advance to its highest level since early September as a floundering dollar encouraged flows into the common currency.
It climbed as much as 0.3% to $1.1930, buoyed by the momentum of buy stops layered above the $1.1920 Nov. 9 high, according to traders familiar with the transactions.
The next big marker for the euro is $1.20, a level that was breached on Sept. 1 for the first time since May 2018. The last time it happened, European Central Bank officials’ verbal interventions helped weaken the euro.
“Euro bulls remain in control as it trades around the $1.19 resistance, with coronavirus-vaccine optimism and easing U.S. political uncertainty keeping risk assets better bid,” said Rony Nehme, market analyst at Squared Financial. “The path of least resistance remains to the upside.”
Optimism over a Brexit trade deal, conflicting Covid-19 infection trends between Europe and the U.S., and a European joint debt breakthrough are among reasons for a stronger euro. It’s also benefiting from the dollar’s decline, as the prospect of an extended period of loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve weighs on the greenback.
The euro was little changed as of 9:42 a.m. in London, as was the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which earlier fell as much as 0.2% to its weakest level since April 2018.
“$1.1900 is clearly a major hurdle to overcome on a daily close for an assault on $1.2000 and beyond,” said John Hardy, the head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. “Forward optimism on the global growth outlook would likely reward the euro more than the U.S. dollar.”
Currency options traders don’t see a risk of large euro swings in the coming months, with implied volatility near the lowest since March.

860,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China stocks fell by the most this month on concern that liquidity conditions in the financial system are not strong enough to support recent gains.
The CSI 300 Index lost 1.3% just two sessions after closing at its highest level in five years. The liquidity-sensitive Chinext Index retreated 2.2% to its lowest since Oct. 23.
Investors have been worried the central bank will tighten monetary policy as the economy rebounds from the virus pandemic. Those concerns were compounded by recent corporate credit defaults at firms linked to the state, worsening a selloff in government debt last week.
“Neither the economic recovery nor liquidity conditions are strong enough to support a one-way uptrend so we’re seeing some selling in the year’s big gainers, like medical shares,” said Dai Ming, a fund manager at Hengsheng Asset Management Co. “We need to see where domestic monetary policy goes next and what inflation is going to be like before we can see a new direction for stocks.”
Chinese equities have been among the best performers globally this year, with the CSI 300 still up 20%. Most of its gains came over the summer, when the benchmark first touched five-year highs.
Sub-gauges of materials, consumer staples and health-care stocks were the worst performers among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups on Wednesday, each retreating at least 2.1%. All of those gauges have surged at least 31% this year.

Investing.com - The dollar continued to weaken in early European trade Wednesday, with riskier currencies more in vogue as investors look to the new administration in the U.S. for additional stimulus amid solid progress towards Covid-19 vaccines.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.052. 
EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.1908, close to a two-month high, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3376, close to its highest level in more than two months, while USD/JPY was largely flat at 104.44.
The greenback is also close to a two-month low against the Australian dollar and a two-year low against the New Zealand dollar, both considered barometers of risk sentiment due to their close ties with the global commodities trade.
Risk appetite has improved after the outgoing President Donald Trump's administration began cooperating with the transition to a Joe Biden presidency, and after reports that former Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen, an advocate of bigger fiscal stimulus, is set to become Treasury Secretary.
This has added to the general optimism surrounding the likelihood of the prompt delivery of multiple Covid-19 vaccines, with positive news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) of their trials over the last couple of weeks.
“2021 will be the year that FX markets, diverted by two years of President Trump’s protectionism and then by one year of the Covid-19 crisis, get back on track as the gravitational pull of the dollar fades,” said ING’s Chris Turner, in a research note. “We forecast the dollar to broadly decline in 2021 - generally by 5-10% against most currencies.”
There is an abundance of U.S. economic data due for release later in the session, ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, including the Federal Reserve’s minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, U.S. jobless claims and GDP data.
Sterling will remain in focus Wednesday, remaining bid as traders expect a trade deal to be agreed between the U.K. and the European Union in the near future given the end of year deadline and recent optimistic noises emerging from the talks.
On Tuesday, influential U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised its odds of a Brexit trade deal to 80%, up from two-thirds.
""Since the summer we have put the odds of a deal at about two-thirds, and no-deal at a third,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients. ""Given the recent newsflow, the likelihood of a deal is clearly growing, and hence we shift our assessment to 80-20 in favour of a deal.""

862,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest year ever for U.K. bond sales may top out just shy of half-a-trillion pounds, as the government pushes ahead with a borrowing spree to spend its way out of the coronavirus pandemic.
Britain’s Debt Management Office will announce on Wednesday almost 100 billion pounds ($133 billion) of extra issuance for the December-March period, taking the full fiscal-year amount to 482.8 billion pounds, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 primary gilt dealers. That’s more than twice the previous record set during the financial crisis.
The borrowing target is seen shifting higher with Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak set to announce a spending increase on public services. The nation’s debt load has already climbed above 2 trillion pounds -- an amount bigger than the economy for the first time since the 1960s.
Still, the surge in debt sales hasn’t pushed borrowing costs higher, thanks to the Bank of England’s bond-buying program. The central bank’s purchases have helped soak up the increased issuance, easing pressure on the market and helping to lower the yield on 10-Year bonds by about 50 basis points this year to 0.33%.
The BOE expanded the so-called quantitative easing program this month by 150 billion pounds.
“The U.K. economy is on a large amount of life support right now,” said Liam O’Donnell, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “A modest rise in yield is fine, anything else is effectively a short circuit to activity while the economy still reels from the crisis.”
Inflation Gauge
With a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc found to be highly effective -- along with those from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. -- and a Brexit trade deal getting closer, economic prospects for 2021 could be in for a boost. The nation’s deficit grew less than expected in October, data showed last week.
Alongside the DMO’s remit, traders will also be focusing Wednesday on a long-awaited report on replacing the maligned Retail Price Index with the CPIH as the main inflation gauge. With around 500 billion pounds of index-linked gilts tied to the former, the main risk for markets is an earlier shift to the new benchmark, say by 2025, rather than than the widely expected 2030.
“An earlier move to CPIH would come with some modest fiscal benefits,” wrote  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists led by Benjamin Nabarro. It has “the greatest potential to move the market, although short positioning may curtail any re-pricing lower.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, after increasing optimism over a global economic recovery saw investors turn towards riskier assets. However, markets saw small moves overall.
The optimism, prompted by the possibility of a COVID-19 vaccine becoming available soon and clarity over the incoming U.S. presidential administration, saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 30,000 for the first time during the previous session. Asia Pacific shares were up on Wednesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.17% to 92.067 by 11:55 PM ET (3:55 AM GMT). The dollar slumped to a near two-month low against the riskier AUD and NZD, and close to a two-week low against the euro.
With AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) reporting positive results for its candidate AZD 1222 on Monday, and candidates from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) also reporting positive results over the past two weeks, hope is rising that a vaccine will be available soon.
Incumbent President Donald Trump's administration has reluctantly starting to co-operate with President-elect Joe Biden’s administration for a smooth transition, adding to the optimism. However, Trump has given no indication that he will stop the legal challenges he has mounted against the presidential election results.
With a vaccine and the likely nomination of former Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, a vocal advocate for more fiscal spending, as Biden’s Secretary of the Treasury removing two large uncertainties for investors, the dollar’s decline only looks likely to continue in the short term as its appeal as a safe harbor currency is diminished.
“Rising yields may lend the dollar some support, but the overall direction is it will head lower,” said IG Securities senior foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters.
“The trend has shifted to favor risk assets. Yellen will team up with the Fed and support the economy. U.S. rates will remain low for a long time,” Ishikawa added.
Another indication of the increased risk appetite was cryptocurrency bitcoin, associated with extreme volatility, trading near an all-time high.
The USD/JPY pair inched 0.10% to 104.54.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.7359, giving up earlier gains, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.6985. Investors unwound bets for additional monetary easing in both Australia and New Zealand, giving an added boost to the Antipodean currencies. The AUD was moving towards a high of $0.7413 last seen on Sep. 1, while the NZD was trading slightly just below its strongest level since June 2018 and has rose 5.6% so far in November.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.18% to 6.5779. The onshore yuan rose over hopes of better U.S.-China relations under the Biden administration.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Wednesday as progress in developing a novel coronavirus vaccine and expectations for a fiscal boost from a new U.S. government triggered a shift of funds from the greenback to riskier assets.
The U.S. currency teetered near a two-month low against the Australian dollar and a two-year low against the New Zealand dollar, both considered barometers of risk sentiment due to their close ties with the global commodities trade.
Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for extreme volatility, also traded near an all-time high, in a further sign that investors are growing more comfortable taking on riskier positions.
The U.S. dollar's declines are likely to continue because a vaccine and the expected choice of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's next Treasury secretary relieve two big uncertainties for investors.
""Rising yields may lend the dollar some support, but the overall direction is it will head lower,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The trend has shifted to favour risk assets. Yellen will team up with the Fed and support the economy. U.S. rates will remain low for a long time.""
The dollar stood at $1.1903 against the euro on Wednesday in Asia, close to a two-week low.
The British pound bought $1.3359, close to its highest in more than two months.
Against the yen, the dollar held steady at 104.54.
Research suggesting that a COVID-19 vaccine could be available before year end has sent U.S. stocks surging to record highs and reduced the appeal of holding the dollar as a safe-harbour currency.
Risk appetite has also improved after the outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's administration began cooperating with the Biden transition, and after reports that Yellen, an advocate of more fiscal spending, will take the top job at Treasury.
The dollar index, pitting the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was at 92.109 after falling 0.4% on Tuesday.
The onshore yuan rose to 6.5818 per dollar on hopes for better Sino-U.S. ties under Biden. Other Asian currencies also edged higher.
The Antipodean currencies were already on the front foot as investors unwound bets for additional monetary easing in both countries.
Improving risk appetite means the Australian dollar's next target is its high of $0.7413 on Sept. 1.
The New Zealand dollar, which has rallied 5.6% so far this month, is trading just shy of its strongest since June 2018.
Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, eased slightly to $19,046 but was still close to its record of $19,666 from December 2017.

The New Zealand Dollar rose as much as 1.1% to 0.70 as of 8:47 a.m. in London.

Investing.com - The dollar saw selling in early European trade Tuesday, as clarity over the U.S. political transition emerged and the tapping of Janet Yellen to be the next Treasury Secretary strengthened expectations of an expansive fiscal policy under President-elect Joe Biden.
At 3:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 92.252, after seeing its lowest level since Sep. 1 overnight. 
EUR/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.1873, helped by an upward revision to German third-quarter GDP growth to 8.5% from an initially reported 8.2%, while USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 104.30. The risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.9% to 0.7353.
A lot of the uncertainty surrounding the transition of power in the U.S. was lifted Monday when Emily Murphy, the General Services Administration head, effectively acknowledged Biden as the winner of the presidential election, saying he could have briefings and funding to ease his transition into the role.
President Donald Trump tweeted his approval of the move, even though he vowed to continue fighting to try and overturn the vote in several states.
Murphy, a Trump appointee, had withheld her decision for weeks after the Nov. 3 election, resulting in the markets being unsure whether there would be a prolonged political vacuum. The removal of these fears has led to traders seeking out more risk, to the detriment of the safe haven dollar.
Helping the positive risk sentiment was the appointment of former U.S. Fed Chair Janet Yellen to be Treasury Secretary in the upcoming Biden administration.
Yellen has recently called for more federal spending from Congress to tackle the economic devastation caused by the virus, and is widely seen as encouraging the low interest rate policy the Federal Reserve has adopted to battle the pandemic.  
Adding to the reasons to veer towards riskier currencies has been the recent promising news on vaccines, and this continued on Monday as data pointed to AstraZeneca’s candidate, produced in conjunction with the University of Oxford, being up to 90% effective in preventing the Covid-19 virus. This adds to earlier positive news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.4% to 1.3371, close to a near 12-week high as traders expect the U.K. and the European Union to finally seal a post-Brexit trade deal. 
“What remains a solid conviction in our view,” said analysts at ING, in a research note, “is that GBP would face an asymmetrically negative reaction if negotiations ultimately collapse.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, with riskier currencies boosted by the news that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is set to nominate Janet Yellen as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 92.487 by 10:02 PM ET (2:02 AM GMT). The dollar saw its lowest level since Sep. 1 overnight, as clarity from November’s U.S. presidential election begins to emerge.
However, analysts warned of a potential fresh downturn for the dollar should a conclusive break on the dollar index below support at around 92 occur.
Yellen, a former Federal Reserve Chairman, will be the latest nomination to the Biden cabinet. Already hinting at how she will tackle her role, she called for increased government spending to boost the COVID-19-ravaged U.S. economy. She has also often cited growing U.S. economic inequality as a threat to U.S. values and the country’s future.
Some investors welcomed the news.
“One thing is for sure, and that is there are unlikely to be as many Fed-Treasury spats … those Fed lending facilities for municipal funding, the corporate bond market and Main Street will be coming back quickly after the December 31 expiration date,” MUFG Union Bank chief financial economist Chris Rupkey told Reuters.
Rupkey was referring to incumbent Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s shock decision during the previous week to let some Fed lending programs expire at the end of the year. The decision sparked a feud with the Fed, led by incumbent Chairman Jerome Powell, who argued that the programs were vital in supporting the economy.
Incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump’s go-ahead to General Services Administration head Emily Murphy to proceed with assisting the Biden administration's transition to government also increased risk appetite as the first steps towards acknowledging the election results. However, Trump is still planning to continue his legal challenges over the same results.
On the COVID-19 front, AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) in conjunction with the University of Oxford, is the latest company to report positive news for a vaccine candidate. The candidate, AZD122, met its primary endpoint in clinical trials that took place in the U.K and Brazil, the company said on Monday. Preparations are now underway to submit the data to authorities globally for conditional or early approvals.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 104.56 as Japanese markets reopened after national holiday on Monday. The safe-haven yen is slowing reversing a slip of around 0.6% seen during the previous session.
Both Antipodean risk currencies benefitted from the increased risk appetite. The AUD/USD pair was up 0.25% to 0.7304 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.65% to 0.6966.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.11% to 6.5777.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.3330. The pound was staying close to a near 12-week high against the dollar thanks to investor bets that the U.K. and the European Union will finally seal a Brexit trade deal soon. Negotiations between the two parties continue this week, racing to beat the end-of-year deadline for a deal."

Investing.com – The pound gave up some gains against the dollar after hitting a 10-week high as analysts suggest the low U.K. rates will keep a lid on sterling's path higher even as Brexit deal looks likely.
GBP/USD rose 0.2%  to $1.3312 after hitting a high of $1.3398 intraday.
""GBP gets a Brexit boost to $1.36, but then weakens as UK real yields are low,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.  
The optimism over a Brexit deal comes as the European Commission reportedly told EU ambassadors on Friday that 95% of a post-Brexit deal had been agreed.
""Recent days brought media reports of optimism that a deal might be announced over coming days, which would allow sufficient time for ratification by the European Parliament before year-end – albeit perhaps just the week after Christmas,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
The wave of positive reports has raised expectations that a deal could be reached in the coming days, though given the range of politically sensitive issues that remain outstanding, a final agreement will likely need to be ""brokered personally between [European Commission President] Von Der Leyen and UK Prime Minster Johnson,"" the bank added.
Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would be worse for the economy than the long-term impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
“It is in the best interests of both sides… for there to be a trade agreement and for that trade agreement to have a strong element of goodwill around it in terms of how it is implemented,” Bailey told the Treasury committee.
PM Johnson confirmed that the England lockdown would be lifted on Dec. 2, though regional restrictions would be kept in place to stop the spread of Covid-19.
The second lockdown dealt a blow to business activity, with some warning the U.K. economy is set to slip into a double-dip recession.
""A double-dip is indicated by the November survey data, with lockdown measures once again causing business activity to collapse across large swathes of the economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit."
869,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish currency fell the most among emerging-market currencies as locals took advantage of recent lira strength to buy dollars.
The impact of local demand was more visible due to thin trading on Monday, according to traders. The lira fell as much as 2.6% to 7.8400 against the dollar and was down 1.9% at 7.7830 as of 11:51a.m in Istanbul.
Dollar appetite among local companies and individuals barely slowed last week, even as the lira soared more than 10% on bets President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wouldn’t stand in the way of a long-awaited interest-rate hike. As predicted by most economists, the central bank increased rates by 475 basis points on Thursday.
At the same time, some traders question Erdogan’s apparent shift toward more market-friendly policies and whether the central bank’s monetary policy can remain independent given the president’s opposition to high interest rates.

870,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) --
The pound rallied the most among major peers as signs the U.K. and European Union are close to agreeing a trade deal, and the latest progress in the development of a coronavirus vaccine added to optimism over the currency’s prospects.
Sterling rose as much as 0.8% to $1.3381, extending an advance that sent the currency to the highest level since early September. The pound climbed as much as 0.6% against the euro.
While results of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc published Monday showed it was less effective than those by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc., it has some advantages when it comes to distribution. Not only is it cheaper, but it can also be stored at refrigerator temperature.
Sterling has been one of the main beneficiaries of the growing optimism for a vaccine, which would boost the services-driven U.K. economy stifled by lockdowns. It’s also been spurred by hopes the U.K. and EU will sign a trade deal, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s pledge to shore up growth with further borrowing.
The U.K. is facing a “long list of potential positives,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura International Plc. Fresh fiscal stimulus, the news of Oxford’s vaccine trials “plus the potential for progress in Brexit talks should keep GBP-USD cross supported,” he said.
Officials from the U.K. and EU sounded upbeat about the prospect of trade deal, with face-to-face talks set to resume in London around the middle of this week. And Sunak will announce an increase in spending on infrastructure and public services on Wednesday.
Priced In
A Brexit deal is largely priced in to the pound, options show. With the market expecting an accord to materialize, a breakdown in talks would see a much larger move lower in the cash market than any rally off of news of a deal.
One-week risk reversals, a measure of sentiment, rallied to 73 basis points in favor of pound gains, a premium only seen twice since late September, before easing to 47 basis points.
“The market is currently pricing in a lot of good news for the pound, but we think it still may have some room to run,” said Ned Rumpeltin, head of FX strategy at TD Securities. “It looks a little early to start fading this move, especially as market liquidity will start to diminish ahead of the U.S. holiday later this week.”

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Monday, with optimism over a potential early rollout of Covid-19 vaccines prompting demand for riskier assets.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.248, just above the month’s low of 92.129. 
EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1870, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 103.81, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7317.
Promising news on vaccines have been weighing on the safe-haven dollar over the last week. This continued on Sunday, when the chief scientific adviser for “Operation Warp Speed” Moncef Slaoui said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant approval of Pfizer’s candidate in mid-December, with the first people in the United States potentially receiving a vaccine the day after.
The good news continued Monday as it was announced that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), in conjunction with the University of Oxford, was up to 90% effective in preventing the Covid-19 virus if patients were given an initial half dose, followed by a full dose. AstraZeneca's drug is reportedly capable of being stored without specialist refrigeration, which makes it especially important for emerging markets with less developed healthcare systems.
This news comes just before this week’s Thanksgiving holiday, when millions of Americans are expected to travel to visit family and friends, with all that that implies for heightened transmission risks.
Also weighing on the dollar is the idea that the Federal Reserve might have to ease monetary policy further to cope with the increased shutdowns on the back of the rising number of Covid-19 cases, particularly with no fiscal stimulus deal in sight and after last week's surprise move by the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to end some emergency lending programs.
“Mnuchin has vetoed against prolongations of some of Fed’s crisis programs, but he may instead end up incentivizing the Fed towards a big Operation Twist and more asset purchases,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Key forward-looking U.S. manufacturing and services PMI data will be in focus later in the session to try and gauge the extent of the economic hit from the restrictions caused by the latest Covid-19 outbreak.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.4% to 1.3329, helped by the AstraZeneca vaccine news. Addiitionally, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said Sunday that he is optimistic that a Brexit trade agreement with the European Union will be reached soon.
Still, even if the UK-EU trade deal is reached, “the lack of risk premia priced into GBP suggests only a limited upside,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“However, with politics and the U.K.-EU relationship uncertainty taking a less prominent role next year, this should allow GBP to benefit from the weak USD dynamics, sending GBP/USD above 1.40 in 2021.”
The pound was also edging higher against the euro, testing the five-month high it notched earlier this month.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased on Monday as the prospect of an early rollout of coronavirus vaccines offset concerns about economic restrictions to control the spread of the virus, favouring risk assets for the moment.
A holiday in Japan kept most majors contained, though the New Zealand dollar stormed to a two-year top of $0.6962 as super-strong retail sales data quashed the risk of further policy easing and left yields attractively high. [AUD/]
The euro edged up to $1.1872, having repeatedly failed to break above $1.1893 resistance last week. It needs to clear the November top of $1.1919 to extend its uptrend.
Analysts at Capital Economics are bullish on the single currency's longer-term outlook.
""We think that the exchange rate will rise further over the next few years against a backdrop of lower euro-zone stability risks; an increased real yield gap between the euro-zone and the U.S.; and a continued recovery in the global economy,"" they wrote in a note.
They lifted their forecasts for the euro and now see it at $1.2500 by the end of 2021 and $1.3000 at the close of 2022, up from $1.2000 and $1.2500 previously.
The dollar has also been drifting slowly lower on the Japanese yen and last stood at 103.74, just above chart support at 103.62. A break there would see a re-test of the November trough of 103.16, which was the lowest since the market turmoil of March.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a shade softer at 92.266 and again uncomfortably close to support at 92.129 and 91.373.
Promising news on vaccines have been weighing on the safe-haven dollar. The first people in the United States could receive a COVID-19 vaccine a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration grants approval in mid-December.
And Britain could give regulatory approval to Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine this week.
On the other hand, millions of Americans are expected to ignore warnings to stay home for the Thanksgiving holiday, while Germany might have to extend its lockdown until mid-December.
The rash of coronavirus restrictions across the United States has stoked speculation the Federal Reserve might have to ease monetary policy further, particularly with no fiscal stimulus deal in sight.
Last week's surprise move by the U.S. Treasury Department to end some emergency lending programs only added to the speculation.
That will heighten the focus on the minutes of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting, which are due to be released on Wednesday. The minutes are expected to confirm Fed policymakers discussed adding to the bank's asset-buying plans.

""The minutes should help gauge whether our call for a lengthening of the maturity mix as soon as the December meeting remains on track,"" analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell as much as 0.2% to an April 2018 low after U.S. officials said vaccinations may start in less than three weeks. New Zealand’s dollar, the pound and the Norwegian krone led gains against the greenback in Asia trading Monday.
“The vaccine news is favoring the view of a sooner-rather-than-later global economic recovery with the USD losing its safe haven appeal along the way,” said Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. in Sydney. “This is a risk-positive, USD-negative backdrop, especially with the Fed likely to remain ultra-dovish for some time.”

Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) recommends selling the dollar in favor of stocks and credit, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). prefers shorting the U.S. currency against developing nation peers including the Mexican peso and South African rand.

BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina's net currency reserves are at or near zero, according to analysts and investors, forcing the central bank into a tough choice: double down on controls that have failed to stem the currency's decline or allow the peso to devalue further.
Downward pressure on the peso has been steady all year and intensified of late as the government continues to print its way out of a budget deficit, while inflation rising to near 40% and a lack of confidence in economic and monetary policies further weigh on the currency.
""If the population does not trust the price of the dollar where it is, if it considers that it is going to rise and is scared by the fall in reserves, there will be no choice but to devalue,"" said Gabriel Torres, the country's analyst at credit ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
Graphic: Argentina's diverging peso - https://graphics.reuters.com/ARGENTINA-CURRENCY/RESERVES/nmovaddlkpa/chart.png
Argentina is on track for a 12% economic contraction this year partly due to measures taken to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and output is still some 30% below pre-pandemic levels. The official, controlled peso exchange rate has fallen 25% this year, closing Thursday at just over 80 per dollar. The unofficial rate is near 160.   
""Argentina is now at a worse starting point and a more difficult path to accumulate sufficient liquidity to repay future debt liabilities,"" said in a note Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York.
""The stock of assets is now negative - net liquid FX reserves - against more than $150 billion in future USD debt payments.""
Gross reserves have fallen to some $39 billion from near $43 billion a year ago and a $77 billion recent peak in April 2019, while net reserves - subtracting central bank liabilities not in pesos - are much lower depending on the source.
""It is impossible for a government with the limited resources that Argentina has to fight against the macroeconomic fundamentals,"" said Moody's' Torres, who sees tighter currency controls ""because the reserves continue to fall, and depending on the measure that one uses of net reserves, they are approaching zero or they are not far from that.""
Graphic: Argentina's dollar drain - https://graphics.reuters.com/ARGENTINA-CURRENCY/RESERVES/jznvnnnekvl/chart.png
Finance Minister Martin Guzman earlier this month said Argentina, in the midst of repackaging its $44 billion debt with the International Monetary Fund, will seek a type of agreement with the IMF that will require commitment to stringent economic reforms.
The reforms could include softening capital controls and letting the peso float at least more freely, which could slow the rush to dollarize.

""It would take an overhaul of the monetary policy setup, probably under the guise of a new IMF agreement, to prevent a more disorderly adjustment of the currency in the medium term,"" said Capital Economics' emerging markets economist Nikhil Sanghani in a note.

876,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey’s main objective is to reduce interest rates as inflation slows to official medium-term targets.
Thursday’s interest rate hike by the nation’s central bank is part of “bitter pill policies” that Turkey must follow, Erdogan told a group of businessmen in televised remarks from Istanbul on Friday.
While the Turkish leader renewed his tacit approval for the recent return to more orthodox monetary policies, he also repeated his widely discredited belief that higher interest rates fuel inflation. Most economists and central bankers around the world say the opposite is true.

877,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Record Covid-19 cases in Japan and overseas are increasing the risk of the economy losing recovery momentum and even shrinking again as the spread of infections complicates the government’s plans to support growth.
Lockdowns overseas and renewed concerns over the virus at home already appear to be impacting activity in Japan’s economy, according to PMI data released Friday. The figures showed a faster rate of contraction in both the manufacturing and service sectors.
While the likelihood of a double-dip contraction in Japan still isn’t the main scenario for economists, the outside risk of one is growing as the near-term outlook continues to look far from clear even after encouraging vaccine test results.
The surge in infection cases makes Shinichiro Kobayashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research & Consulting Co., wonder if he needs to cut his current forecast for zero growth in the first quarter of 2021.
“Just a little push will be enough to bring Japan into a double dip,” Kobayashi said Friday, a day after Tokyo raised its virus alert to the highest level and nationwide cases hit another daily record. “It’s becoming acutely clear that the government isn’t able to contain virus cases while boosting economic activity.”
On Friday, the capital reported 522 new cases, topping 500 for a second straight day. Local media reported daily cases remained high in other areas, including a fresh record in Hokkaido.
Just as growing infections in Japan present a double-dip tail risk for Japan, soaring case numbers overseas could also bode ill for the world economy.
“A second wave of infections is slowing down the recovery; it is losing momentum,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said of the global economy at Bloomberg New Economy Forum.
IMF, G-20 Warn Recovery May Be Derailed, Risks Still Very High
Most economists still expect Japan’s growth to continue, but at a much slower pace. The economy surged an annualized 21.4% in the previous quarter after a record slump during a nationwide state of emergency in April and May.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government and the Tokyo metropolitan authorities have so far held back from any major tightening of voluntary restrictions, despite the uptick in infections. While there seems to be very little appetite for calling another state of emergency, the possibility is growing that some measures will need to be taken.
Suga has called for a third extra budget to keep the economy on a growth path, but the spread of infections makes it difficult for him to simply rely on his Go-To-Travel campaign.
The domestic travel subsidies have been one of the government’s most successful stimulus tools, but they could end up contributing to the spread of the virus if they are extended or expanded or if guidelines aren’t observed.
The program is also weighing on inflation. Figures out Friday showed key consumer prices falling at the fastest pace in more than nine years, driven down partly by the travel discounts.
Mitsumaru Kumagai, chief economist at Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. and an adviser to Suga, estimates the impact of the campaign at 3.6 times the initial cost, resulting in a 4.9 trillion yen boost to the economy over time. That growth prop could have less impact if the program needs to be downsized or withdrawn.
Japan Needs New Green Fund in Extra Budget, Suga Adviser Says

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, in tight ranges as traders digest a potential rift between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Federal Reserve.
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.325, just above the month’s low of 92.129. The dollar has lost ground against riskier currencies for over a week as drug manufacturers continue to report progress towards a Covid-19 vaccine.
EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1870, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 103.86, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7286.
The dollar has had a couple of competing influences overnight, resulting in traders taking a cautious stance. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called an end to some of the Federal Reserve's pandemic lending, as he asked for $455 billion allocated to the Treasury under the CARES Act to be re-appropriated for other spending. The central bank openly disagreed with the move. 
This was the first sign of a rift between these two essential bodies and sparked concern from some investors who had counted on central bank support, helping the safe-haven dollar.
This move overturned the earlier weakness in the greenback after earlier reports that U.S. Senate Republican and Democrat leaders had agreed to resume negotiations on another coronavirus stimulus package.
Weekly initial claims numbers had risen on Thursday for the first time in five weeks as the restrictions caused by the surge in Covid-19 cases halted the recovery in the employment market. 
California ordered a curfew placed on all indoor social gatherings and non-essential outside activities, while the country’s top public health agency pleaded with Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3270 after U.K. retail sales rose 1.2% in October, and were 5.8% higher than a year earlier, bucking forecasts for growth to slow to 4.2% as consumers started their Christmas shopping early.
However, news about a potential trade deal between the U.K. and the European Union continues to be the main driver for sterling, meaning moves on economic data tend to be limited.
“Some EU countries have reportedly urged the European Commission to report its no-deal Brexit plans, which are adding some doubts about the effective state of any advances in the negotiations,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “These days will be crucial for Brexit, and we might expect a large move in GBP at any time now.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar halted its slide on Friday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called an end to some of the Federal Reserve's pandemic lending, derailing a risk rally and surprising investors who had counted on central bank support.
The announcement damped a previously positive mood after reports that U.S. Senate Republican and Democrat leaders had agreed to resume negotiations on another coronavirus stimulus package.
While Mnuchin's move was aimed at re-appropriating some $455 billion allocated to Treasury under the CARES Act in the spring for other spending, some investors were concerned about ending programmes that they think have played a vital role in reassuring markets.
The Fed also said it ""would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop,"" a rare open confrontation with the government.
""Investors have banked on the MLF (Municipal Liquidity Facility) being a reliable, emergency lender to our (municipal bond) market’s core borrowers. It has taken the idea of a payment default or catastrophic budget problem off the table,"" said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics at Westport, Connecticut, in the United States.
""Without the MLF, the market won’t collapse, but it will lack some resilience if its tested by a selloff or more pronounced credit fears.""
Also souring risk appetite, California ordered a curfew placed on all indoor social gatherings and non-essential activities outside the home across most of the state in a major escalation of measures to curb an alarming surge in coronavirus infection. 
For over a week, the dollar has lost ground against riskier currencies due to coronavirus vaccine breakthroughs and hopes of reduced political uncertainty after the U.S. election.
The dollar index stood at 92.306 (=USD), off Thursday's low of 92.236, though it is still down 0.3% on the week.
The euro fetched $1.1874 (EUR=), flat on the day but not far from this week's high of $1.18935 touched on Tuesday and up 0.3% on week.
The yen stood at 103.80 per dollar , retaining its weekly gain of 0.8%.
The reaction in currency markets, however, has been limited compared with the U.S. stocks and bond markets.
""There is a feeling that, at the end of the day, financial markets will remain solid and detached from the troubles in the real economy. A correction in stock prices was natural given their recent gains,"" said Tatsuya Chiba, manager of forex at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Trust Bank.
""For now we have to see whether stocks markets' retreat will prove to be a temporary one,"" he said.
The British pound was on the defensive after the Times newspaper reported that European leaders will urge the European Commission to publish no-deal Brexit plans as the year-end deadline approaches.
The currency changed hands at $1.3258 . Against the euro, it stood at 0.8955 pound per euro (EURGBP=D4), wiping its gains made over the past two days.
Outside the dollar index basket currencies, the Australian dollar, which is sensitive to economic sentiment, stood little changed at $0.7284 , having erased most of its gains this week.
The offshore Chinese yuan was flat at 6.5716 to the dollar  after hitting a 2 1/2-year high of 6.5318 on Wednesday.
The Turkish lira held firm following a 2.3% jump on Thursday after the central bank, under new governor Naci Agbal, delivered a big rate hike as expected and pledged to remain tough on inflation.
The lira changed hands at 7.5450 to the dollar , near its highest level in almost two months. The lira is the best performing currency so far this month.
Elsewhere, bitcoin retained its bullish tone, trading at $17,971 (BTC=BTSP), near a three-year high touched on Wednesday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, with investors digesting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin request on Thursday for the Federal Reserve to return funds earmarked for COVID-19 lending to businesses, nonprofits and local governments. Markets continued to avoid big moves overall, however.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.01% to 92.295 by 9:34 PM ET (1:34 AM GMT). The dollar has lost ground against riskier currencies for over a week as the uncertainty from the U.S. presidential election dies down and vaccine developers continue to report progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine.
Mnuchin’s move seeks to re-appropriate some $455 billion allocated to Treasury under the CARES Act earlier in the year, and sparked concern from some investors that programs that are viewed to have played a vital role in cushioning the COVID-19 blow will be suspended.
“Investors have banked on the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) being a reliable, emergency lender to the municipal bond market’s core borrowers. It has taken the idea of a payment default or catastrophic budget problem off the table,” Municipal Market Analytics partner Matt Fabian told Reuters.
“Without the MLF, the market won’t collapse, but it would lack some resilience if it is tested by a selloff or more pronounced credit fears,” he added.
The move also stopped the dollar’s slide after U.S. Senate Republicans reportedly agreed to resume negotiations with the Democrats on the latest COVID-19 stimulus package.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 103.84. “The dollar/yen appears to have recovered strong correlation with U.S. bond yields over the past two weeks. This points to risk of further downside in the currency pair, should U.S. bond yields fall further,” J.P. Morgan head of Japan market research Tohru Sasaki told Reuters.
The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 0.6917. Across the Tasman Sea, the AUD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.7286. Reverberations from Australia-China tensions continue a day after China presented Australia with a dossier of 14 disputes issued by the Chinese embassy in Australia, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has read.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.5760. The yuan eased after hitting a two and half year high against the dollar on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 1.3259. The pound was down after reports that European leaders will urge the European Commission to publish no-deal Brexit plans as the deadline to reach a deal, set for the end of the year, rapidly approaches."

Investing.com – The lira surged against the dollar Thursday after the central bank of Turkey hiked rates and ended its controversial rate corridor operations, prompting analysts to cut their bearish bets on the Turkish currency following months of weakness.
USD/TRY fell 1.88% to TRY 7.5592, its lowest level in nearly two months.
Turkey’s central bank raised its main benchmark repo rate by 475bps today, in line with expectations, and removed the one-week repo rate in favor of the overnight lending rate as the key policy rate, ending its rate corridor operations.
The move to increase monetary policy transparency was hailed by analysts as they reined in their bearish forecasts for the lira.
""We no longer forecast USD-TRY to overshoot in coming months, rather we forecast consolidation in the 7.50 range during H1 2021,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Yet, with many aware the central bank of Turkey is kept on a short leash somewhat by President Erdogan, the jury is still out on the bank's independence.  
""Still, given the President’s earlier remarks this week, markets will want more clarification on how patient he is willing to be and whether or not CBT will fully target inflation,"" Commerzbank added.
For now, there appears to be consensus among market participants that in the absence of external shocks – likely triggering pressure from Erdogan to cut rates again – the central bank can make progress in tackling runaway inflation that has dogged its economy."
882,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said fiscal policy support, not additional monetary-policy action, is what the U.S. needs most as surging Covid-19 infection rates threaten to smother economic activity.
“The virus case increase is very concerning and the fact that we don’t have a fiscal package is very concerning,” Mester said Thursday in an interview with on Bloomberg Television with Michael McKee and Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE).
Mester, a voter this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, noted that some sectors of the economy are doing fine while others remain severely damaged.
“With the disparate impact, that’s where fiscal policy plays a role because fiscal policy can be really targeted,” she said, whereas monetary policy is a much more blunt tool for stimulating the economy. “We’re in a good place with our monetary policy because we are very accommodative.”
At its Nov. 4-5 meeting, the FOMC discussed its options for altering large-scale asset purchases as a way to further lower borrowing costs for businesses and households. The Fed is currently buying about $120 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds every month, partly aimed at lowering borrowing costs for businesses and households. The Fed’s next meeting is Dec. 15-16.
Asked if she supported a move to adjust or increase the purchases, Mester was noncommittal but didn’t lean in favor of a change.
“It’s not clear to me that monetary policy necessarily is the right tool,” she said. “To my mind when you have such disparity across sectors it’s the fiscal policy that’s the right tool to address those things.”
That bodes poorly for the economy because Congress does not appear poised to act, she added.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar strengthened on Thursday as broad optimism about COVID-19 vaccines ran into worries about rising infection numbers and risks to the fragile global economic recovery.
The dollar was also caught between two opposing forces, with a safety bid supporting it while fresh speculation over monetary easing to boost the economy held it back somewhat.
Euro/dollar shed 0.2% to last trade at $1.1833 (EUR=EBS).
With fiscal stimulus plans falling by the wayside as President Donald Trump's refusal to concede electoral defeat consumes lawmakers' attention, speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve may further loosen monetary policy in December.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, helped by its safe haven status as concerns about the impact of the coronavirus remain.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.517, but just above the month’s low of 92.129. EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1842, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 103.89, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7286.
Traders are having to balance the two competing forces impacting the dollar, a safety bid supporting it and the idea of additional monetary easing to support the coronavirus-hit economy, which weighs on the greenback.
The number of Covid-19 deaths in the United States crossed 250,000 on Wednesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with the number of people hospitalized with the virus rising above 78,000, the highest ever for a single day during the pandemic.
This has prompted further restrictions around the country, with New York City, for example, shutting schools from Thursday and switching to fully remote learning.  
The likely impact of these new restrictions, coupled with the lack of progress on a fiscal stimulus bill, is fuelling speculation the Federal Reserve will have to expand its asset-buying campaign at a December policy meeting.
Meanwhile, the weekly unemployment numbers will be closely watched later Thursday for guidance on the Fed's next moves.
That said, the euro isn’t in that great a spot either. Large parts of the euro-zone economy are shut down to combat the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, while EU leaders quibble about the ability to disperse the available funds to bolster the region.
Additionally, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde appears at a European Parliament Committee hearing in Frankfurt later Thursday.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.4% to 1.3220 after The Times newspaper reported Europe's leaders would demand the European Commission publish no-deal plans as the year-end deadline for a trade deal between the U.K. and the European Union neared.
While there is a growing expectation that the two sides will come to an agreement, “the technical time for ratification in the EU and UK is dangerously shrinking,” said ING analyst Francesco Pesole, in a research note.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, clawing back gains from earlier losses. The market saw small moves as the number of COVID-19 cases globally continues to rise incessantly, and expectations of further monetary stimulus from the U.S. Federal Reserve begin to grow.
“Central bankers continue to offer promises of almost endlessly easy money. That, when U.S. COVID-19 infection rates are causing enough concern about growth prospects to offset vaccine news, has kept the dollar on the back foot, even as equities soften,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) currency strategist Kit Juckes told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.09% to 92.472 by 10:07 PM ET (2:07 AM GMT). It has been on a downward trend in general, despite stocks also slipping, as the recently released industrial production and retail sales data highlighted the fragility of the U.S. economic recovery.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 103.81.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7295. The AUD saw a slight lag as South Australia imposed a lockdown to curb a fresh COVID-19 outbreak in the state, which overshadowed positive labor data released earlier in the day. The country’s employment change grew by 178,800 in October, beating the expected 30,000 contraction and the 29,500 contraction in September. The unemployment rate for the month was 7%, also beating the forecast 7.2% reading.

The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.5659, with the yuan near a 29-month high in offshore trade.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.22% to 1.3239. The pound had been boosted by hopes of the U.K. and the European Union reaching a post-Brexit trade deal ahead of the end-of-year deadline.
COVID-19 continues its global rampage, and the increasing number of global cases continues to concern investors. The U.S. remains in a “severe recession” and growth is vulnerable to swings in infection rates, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) warned on Wednesday. Williams also reiterated that the central bank would use all its tools to help in the economic recovery.

Investing.com – The pound moved to a two-and-a-half-month high against the dollar on Wednesday, on growing hopes a Brexit deal could be within reach.
GBP/USD rose 0.31% to $1.3281.
Hopes for Brexit a deal were given a boost on Wednesday amid reports that French President Emmanuel Macron is ready to cave in on demands from the U.K. for full sovereignty over its waters that will likely rein in access for French fisherman.
Irish Minister Micheál Martin on Tuesday said a ""landing zones"" for an agreement were within sight just a day ahead of the European Union Summit, when EU Brexit negotiation Michel Barnier is set to brief EU leaders following two weeks of talks with the UK.
An agreement could be made as soon as Monday, the Telegraph reported, and be approved within weeks, most likely at the next EU Summit on Dec. 10. The European Parliament would then need to rubberstamp the agreement to ensure a deal is in place before the end of the transition period on Dec, 31.
As well as Brexit hopes, higher-than-expected inflation lifted the pound, but analysts said inflation is likely to slow in the months ahead.
U.K. consumer prices rose 0.7% in the year through October, after a 0.5% rise in September, the Office for National Statistics reported. That was ahead of the 0.6% growth expected.
""Looking ahead, we expect UK inflation to fall back close to 0.5% year-on-year in November and December, not least reflecting the intensification of the pandemic, although the closure of non-essential retailing and many services will mean that prices of many items will need to be imputed by the Office of National Statistics,"" Daiwa Capital Market said."

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, weighed by signs the surge in coronavirus vases is hitting the U.S. consumer while the country’s political scene remains divided.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.245. EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.1883, USD/JPY fell 0.3% to 103.91, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7304.
U.S. retail sales rose by just 0.3% in October, at the slowest pace in six months, while the previous month saw a downwardly revised 1.6% gain. This suggests consumers, who have driven the economic rebound, are becoming more cautious given the surging numbers of coronavirus cases in the country.
At the same time, the political partisanship in the U.S. shows few signs of changing after outgoing President Donald Trump fired Chris Krebs, who heads the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, accusing him without evidence of making a ""highly inaccurate"" statement that affirmed the security of the U.S. election. 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to resume talks on a multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package for the U.S. economy. However, it’s debatable what common ground can be found given the febrile nature of U.S. politics.
“Given the challenges Europe faces – in the middle of a second lockdown – EUR certainly won’t lead the rally against the USD, but we think the dollar decline is broad enough to drag EUR/USD back to 1.1920,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.3276 after the Sun newspaper reported that a trade deal between the EU and the U.K. could arrive ""early next week.""
“GBP seems a little tired of the stop-start nature of this news,” ING added, “but we would back cable on the soft dollar story and favor a rally back to recent highs at 1.3310.”
The currency could strengthen to $1.35 by mid-2021 if the two sides negotiate a free trade agreement, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts, a level not seen since December 2019.
USD/CNY dropped 0.2% to 6.5442, with the yuan climbing to an almost 29-month high, helped by recent strong economic data, pointing to a robust economic recovery by the world’s second largest economy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen sat near a one-week high and a steady U.S. dollar held commodity currencies in check on Wednesday, as worries about rising coronavirus cases tempered optimism around promising vaccine trials.
At 104.14 per dollar, the yen  has recouped more than half of the steep losses it suffered last week after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) announced it had developed a working COVID-19 vaccine. 
Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), sometimes regarded as a haven asset or at least a hedge against inflation, has surged to a three-year high against the dollar and the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars were a fraction softer, along with stocks.
""The slight cooling of equity sentiment has put a cap on currencies,"" said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer.
""We know we've got a vaccine. Now it's about distribution and how quickly it can start to make a difference, which is going to be quite a few months away.""
Before then, a tough winter looms.
Surging cases have driven record hospitalisations and fresh restrictions on gathering in the United States, while new outbreaks vex authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that there was ""a long way to go"" to economic recovery.
The Australian dollar  slipped 0.3% on Tuesday and was a shade weaker still on Wednesday at $0.7288. The New Zealand dollar  was 0.1% softer at $0.6889. [AUD/]
The euro (EUR=) was steady at $1.1862 and against a basket of currencies the dollar (=USD) held at 92.439 - a little softer than earlier in the week as a slight bond rally has knocked the shine off U.S. Treasury yields. [US/]
""It's back to pondering short-term negatives vs longer-term vaccine positives, and that's creating volatility,"" ANZ analysts said in a note. ""Vaccine deployment isn't an immediate fix ... expect things to remain mixed and messy.""
Elsewhere sterling edged higher as traders hoped for a Brexit trade deal breakthrough. [GBP/]
Britain's chief negotiator David Frost has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson to expect a Brussels trade deal ""early next week"", The Sun newspaper reported, with ""a possible landing zone"" as soon as next Tuesday.
As soft economic data in the United States weighed on dollar sentiment, strong industrial output in China kept the yuan's barnstorming run alive, sending it to an almost 29-month high of 6.5457 per dollar in offshore trade . [CNY/]
The Chinese yuan has gained nearly 9% against the dollar since late May, despite the central bank taking various actions to temper its strength.

The past few weeks have seen the yen hit multi-month highs as news broke of a Biden presidency and a possible COVID-19 vaccine, which is at odds with its tendency to weaken when investors seek risk and growth prospects.
Analysts cite two big reasons driving a wave of money into yen markets. As a net creditor nation in a world of fiscal profligacy, the yen has retained some of its safe-haven credentials.
In addition, as interest rates in Europe and the United States plunge, Japanese government bonds (JGBs) offer comparatively higher returns, in particular, on an inflation-adjusted basis.
""Investing in the U.S., outside of the equity market, is less attractive than what they can engineer in the JGB market,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.
The change in the yen's fortunes was brought about by the U.S. Federal Reserve's sharp monetary easing, which wiped out returns in dollar-based assets. Japanese investors lost their big appetite for overseas investments as domestic yields became higher than those available abroad. 
""The Fed has changed the dynamics,"" Weston said. 
At levels around 104 per dollar, the yen is up 4% this year. Analysts reckon it could steadily reach the 100-level last seen in 2016.
""REAL"" HIGH YIELD
Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near zero. U.S. long-term yields (US10YT=RR) have fallen below 1%, compared to 2-3% prior to 2019.
Investors who hedge for currency risk have no yield advantage buying U.S. Treasuries over JGBs, whose 10-year nominal yields are stuck around the BOJ's zero percent policy target. 
Most euro zone government debt also yield less than JGBs, with exception of a few southern countries.
""BOJ policy has become less extraordinary now that many central banks have cut to their lower bounds,"" said Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in New York. 
U.S. yields are even more unattractive, if adjusted for inflation expectations, with real yields (US10YTIP=RR) down sharply at minus 0.83%. In contrast, Japanese real yields  have been steady around 0%.

""Narrower yield differentials should mean that Japanese private investors should have less incentive to expand unhedged foreign assets,"" Pandl said.
Goldman sees the yen rising to 100 in the next 12 months.
YEN-SELLING ABATES
Japanese investments in foreign bonds have already slowed, with the country's biggest pension fund GPIF, by far the biggest buyer of overseas bonds, thought to have limited leeway to boost foreign bonds, given its allocation is close to its targets.
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) say their model suggests Japanese portfolio allocations to overseas assets will slow further through year-end and into 2021, helping to support the yen over time.
Japanese investors' net buying of foreign equities has also dwindled to about 400 billion yen ($3.83 billion)so far this year, compared to 2.6 trillion yen last year, 7.8 trillion yen in 2018 and 10.0 trillion yen in 2017.
In addition, corporate Japan has cut back on a foreign acquisitions binge due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign direct investments during the first three quarters of this year were down 30% from a year earlier.

Whether Japanese outflows will resume depends on the extent of the U.S. recovery after the pandemic and whether the U.S. turns into a low-inflation, low-growth economy like Japan's, said Masayuki Murata, general manager of balanced portfolio investment at Sumitomo Life Insurance. ""I think it will take a few years to make that call,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, as the surge in Covid-19 cases in the U.S. prompted more restrictions and as worries about a smooth transfer of presidential power mount.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.532. EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1854, USD/JPY fell less than 0.1% to 104.54, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7313.
News from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) of positive results from trials of its Covid-19 vaccine, the second U.S. pharmaceutical company in a week to do so, gave the risk currencies an initial boost on Monday. But this hasn’t lasted long as the United States struggles to contain a second wave of infections, and with vaccine distribution not expected any time soon.
The World Health Organization warned that ""many questions"" remained about the delivery and storage of a vaccine, and there was no time for complacency. Moderna said, however, that its vaccine can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures for up to 30 days, something that should help ease distribution problems.
The U.S. recorded more than 1 million new coronavirus cases last week, according to Reuters data, and several states, including Michigan, North Dakota and Washington, imposed new restrictions on public gatherings and indoor dining to try to slow the spread of the virus.
At the same time, worries have grown about the prompt transition of power in Washington, with President-elect Joe Biden saying on Monday ""more people may die"" from the pandemic if outgoing President Donald Trump continues to block the move.
Trump has still refused to officially concede the election, two weeks after the event, withholding cooperation with Biden’s transition team.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3199, following reports that the U.K. and the European Union could reach a Brexit divorce agreement by the beginning of next week.
Recent gains for sterling tend to suggest that some form of a deal is largely priced into the foreign exchange market.
That said, “the core set of issues remains largely unresolved,” said Francesco Pesole at ING, in a research note, and the “time for a deal is running out and while we see officials suggesting more than one week may still be needed, the technical time for ratification in the EU and UK is dangerously shrinking.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against most currencies on Tuesday as a return of coronavirus restrictions in some U.S. states and worries about a smooth transition for President-elect Joe Biden offset optimism about a coronavirus vaccine.
The British pound edged higher on media reports the UK could reach a post-Brexit trade agreement with the European Union by early next week.
 Moderna  (O:MRNA) became the second U.S. pharmaceutical company in a week to report positive results from trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, considered necessary to eradicate the pandemic.
Last week, encouraging progress in coronavirus vaccine testing helped the dollar rise against the safe-harbour yen and the Swiss franc.
However, reaction in the currency market to subsequent developments has been subdued as the United States struggles to contain a second wave of infections, and with vaccine distribution not expected any time soon.
There is also some uncertainty about Biden's plans to tackle the coronavirus and stimulate the economy as the Trump administration resists cooperation with Biden's transition team.
""The market reaction has been limited because it will take time to distribute the vaccine, and there is uncertainty about U.S. politics,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""Unless we clear that hurdle, the dollar won't rise. The dollar looks particularly weak against the yuan.""
The dollar was quoted at $1.1858 per euro (EUR=D3), on course for its fourth straight session of declines.
Sterling edged up to $1.3221 and also gained to 89.71 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The greenback held steady at 104.52 yen 
Investors in the dollar are looking ahead to the release of U.S. retail sales and industrial production later on Tuesday to gauge the health of the economic recovery.
However, policymakers' response to a record number of coronavirus cases, hospitalisations, and deaths in several U.S. states is likely to remain of greater concern.
The dollar index (=USD) against a basket of major currencies stood at 92.503, close to a one-week low.
New infections are also increasing in Britain, Europe, and Japan, which further clouds the economic outlook.
The Australian dollar  held onto overnight gains against the greenback, while the New Zealand dollar  hit its strongest in more than a year as investors scaled back bets for additional interest rate cuts.
Minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's most recent policy meeting showed the central bank was ready to provide yet more policy stimulus if needed after cutting rates to record lows.

The onshore yuan  edged up to 6.5678 per dollar, approaching a 28-month high set last week, as positive economic data continues to support the currency.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, despite optimism over the latest positive news on the COVID-19 vaccine front. This is as more U.S. states introduce restrictive measures to curb the virus and as worries about a smooth transfer of presidential power in the U.S. in January mount up.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 92.502 by 10:13 PM ET (2:13 AM GMT).
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported a 94.5% efficacy rate for its candidate mRNA-1273 on Monday on the back of its large, late-stage phase III COVE study. The news follows  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's (F:22UAy) announcement during the previous week that their jointly developed candidate, BNT162b2, prevented more than 90% of symptomatic infections.
The Pfizer news saw the dollar rise against safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc. However, the logistics of producing and distributing the vaccine, distributing the vaccine, which suggests it is not likely to be available anytime soon, curbed the initial enthusiasm and subdued market reactions.
Also dampening the enthusiasm is the continual rise in COVID-19 cases globally. Several U.S. states reported a record number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, with officials’ response to these figures of more concern to investors. The U.K., Europe and Japan reported an increased number of cases, with over 54.8 million cases globally as of Nov.17, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Concerns are also growing about the smooth transition of power from incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to that of President-elect Joe Biden, with the Trump administration recalcitrant to pass over the control of government, and thus hampering the Biden administration’s ability to handle ability to handle the COVID-19 situation and stimulate economic recovery.
Some investors remained pessimistic about the dollar’s short-term prospects.
“The market reaction has been limited because it will take time to distribute the vaccine, and there is uncertainty about U.S. politics. Unless we clear that hurdle, the dollar won’t rise. The dollar looks particularly weak against the yuan,” Mizuho Securities chief foreign exchange strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 104.53.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7320. The AUD held onto its overnight gains against the dollar after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) released the minutes from its latest policy meeting. The minutes indicated that the RBA was ready to provide even more policy stimulus if necessary, in the wake of cutting interest rates to record lows during the meeting.
The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.04% to 0.6905. The NZD was at its strongest in more than a year with investors easing bets for additional monetary easing.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.20% to 6.5697. The onshore yuan will be under scrutiny as investors see whether it will reach a record 28-month high.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.3216. The pound saw gains over reports that the U.K. and the European Union could reach a Brexit divorce agreement by the beginning of the following week.

Investing.com – The pound pared gains to trade roughly unchanged Monday as investor jitters about the prospect of a Brexit deal lingered on increasing signs that little progress is expected in crunch UK-EU talks this week.
GBP/USD rose 0.06% to $1.3192 after rising to a session a high of $1.3242.
UK-EU trade talks resumed on Monday, but some are warning that a deal is unlikely this week in the wake of turmoil in the UK government as two of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pro-Brexit advisors were ousted last week.
""(G)iven Johnson’s personnel problems back in Downing Street, it seems highly unlikely that this will be the week for him to seek a deal, for risk of being perceived too soft on Brussels now that Cummings and Cain have departed,"" Daiwa Capital markets said in a note.
Yet, failure to make some progress on a deal this week may not signal doom and gloom for the prospect of an agreement as some suggest the deadline could stretch into the final weeks before end of the transition period on Dec. 31.
""Reports Friday however were that this [Nov. 19] might not be the ‘drop dead’ date for an in-principle post-Brexit EU-U trade deal, with negotiations potentially stretching into December and a deal still able to be ratified by year-end,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. ""We view Friday’s news of the exit stage left of PM Johnson’s key adviser Dominic Cummings as a positive development in this respect.""
In a further sign that both sides may kick the can down the road, Ireland’s foreign minister initially warned of trouble should a breakthrough fail to be reached within the next week to 10 days, but later added that talks could continue for a further two weeks.
The lack of progress on a deal this week could also trigger fresh attempts from those at the ""highest political level"" to reach a compromise on key sticking points including the level playing field, governance and fisheries, Daiwa added.
Control over fsheries, in particular, has been highlighted as one of the main hindrances as French President Emmanuel Macron has been reluctant to give in to Britain's demand for full sovereignty over access to its waters amid concerns French fishermen could lose out.
The subdued move in sterling comes as data showed speculators turned more bearish on the pound in the week ended Nov. 10, according to weekly CFTC positioning data."

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Monday, with positive economic data out of Asia increasing optimism of a global recovery even given the continuing rise of new Covid-19 cases.
 At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.597. EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1848, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.53, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.3% to 0.7287.
Economic numbers from Japan saw the world’s third-largest economy moving out of recession, with its economy growing an annualized 21.4% in the third quarter, gradually recovering from the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Additionally, China’s industrial output rose at a faster-than-expected pace in October, while retail sales continued to recover.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.4% to 6.5764.
Staying in Asia, fifteen countries signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade deal on Sunday, adding to risk appetite amid hopes for an improvement in global trade, which had been hit by U.S.-China tensions.
However, this optimism has to be weighed against the ever growing number of Covid-19 cases. There were over 54 million cases worldwide and over 1.3 million deaths as of Nov. 16, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with over 11 million cases in the U.S. alone. 
“The medium-term outlook has obviously brightened due to the vaccine news, but a surging case count over the coming 6-8 weeks and a potential nationwide lock-down in the U.S. surely can’t be seen as good news,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
“Central banks will simply have to ease again in December on both sides of the pond to mitigate the economic damage from the virus.” 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.3215 while EUR/GBP fell 0.1% to 0.8968. Investors continue to focus on the ongoing Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union, particularly after the resignation of Dominic Cummings, adviser to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a proponent of a ""hard"" Brexit.
“On the margin, this should swing the pendulum of probabilities towards a UK-EU trade agreement and help EUR/GBP to head closer to or below the 0.8900 level again,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
In emerging markets, meanwhile, the Turkish lira and Russian ruble continue their respective recoveries against the dollar, with USD/TRY falling 0.2% to 7.6470 and USD/RUB falling 0.8% to 76.80. Analysts at MUFG say the ruble is still undervalued, seeing near-term potential for it to rise to 74.20."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases counterbalancing hopes that a working vaccine will become available soon and kickstart the economic recovery from the virus.
In Asia, fifteen countries signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade deal on Sunday. The agreement whet investors’ risk appetite over hopes for an improvement in trade hit by U.S.-China tension.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.14% to 92.588 by 10:05 PM ET (2:05 AM GMT).
However, the previous week’s optimism, which boosted the greenback, was subdued as the number of COVID-19 cases increased globally, decreasing risk appetite.

There are over 11 million cases in the U.S. alone, according to the data.
“Currency moves which were prompted by positive vaccine news have taken a pause. With no additional, positive news on the vaccine, U.S. interest rates and stocks went into correction mode at the end of the week, and USD/JPY fell,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto said.
Incumbent U.S. president Donald Trump was active on Twitter over the weekend, briefly acknowledging losing the election to Joe Biden on Sunday in a morning Twitter post but backtracking later in the day, tweeting that he concedes “nothing” and vowing to keep up a court fight that is deemed unlikely to succeed by experts. Meanwhile, Biden continues preparations to take office in January and tackling COVID-19. Biden is due to meet with pharmaceutical companies developing COVID-19 vaccines.
“Over the weekend, uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election has declined as it became more certain that Joe Biden secured more votes, and it’s easier for traders to take risks on hopes that the next administration would soon take measures against COVID-19,” Yamamoto said. The dollar could strengthen against the yen should U.S. bonds and stocks maintain their upward moment, he added.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.07% to 104.55, with the yen seeing its worst weekly performance since early June during the previous week.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.27% to 6.5859. China’s industrial production rose 6.9% year-on-year in October, above the forecast 6.5% growth but remaining on par with September’s reading. The unemployment rate fell to 5.3% from September’s 5.4%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was hemmed into a narrow range on Monday, as traders weighed the economic impact from a resurgence of global coronavirus cases against prospects for a working vaccine that could help reignite global growth.
Global markets surged last week after on vaccine optimism, with the dollar rising as traders quit their long-yen positions. But the currency market had turned risk averse towards the end of the week as global infections spread.
More than 54.01 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally, with death toll exceeding 1.3 million, according to a Reuters tally.
Meanwhile, the total virus cases in the U.S. surpassed 11 million on Sunday as the pace of the pandemic quickened. 
Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was roughly near where it ended last week, fetching 92.68 (=USD).

Australian dollar traders awaited upcoming events by the Reserve Bank of Australia, with RBA governor Philip Lowe scheduled to speak later in the day, while the central bank’s November meeting minutes are due on Tuesday.
Analysts also said the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) deal signed by 15 Asia-Pacific economies on Sunday partly helped risk appetite, as investors hoped trades that have been hit by Sino-U.S. tensions would improve.
The Aussie firmed marginally at $0.7288 in early Asian trade , and the kiwi was at $0.6871 .

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Friday, as investors' enthusiasm about a possible COVID-19 vaccine was tempered by the second wave of the virus in the United States and Europe and the world's top central bankers remained cautious about an economic recovery.
Global markets surged on Monday after  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in trails. The news saw the dollar rise as traders quit their long-yen positions.
But currency market traders became more risk-averse on Thursday and Friday, after the heads of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) stressed that the economic outlook remains uncertain.
The prospect of a vaccine is a source of relief but the euro zone will still suffer as a result of new lockdown measures, two ECB policymakers also said.
Jeremy Stretch, an FX analyst at CIBC, said that the market was caught between hopes for the vaccine in the future and the reality of the current COVID-19 numbers.
""It was the case that the negative news flow in terms of the number of COVID cases was causing a little bit of a 'risk-off' dynamic, but it seems now as if the market still wants to try and end the week on a slightly more risk-orientated bias,"" he said.
Stretch said he was waiting to hear about progress in the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and the University of Oxford - another advanced candidate in the vaccine race.
The dollar slipped in the European session, down around 0.1% on the day at 1224 GMT at 92.882 versus a basket of currencies (=USD).
The safe-haven yen, which dropped around 2% versus the dollar on Monday, continued to claw back some of these losses, up around 0.2% on the day at 104.88 .
Despite the pullback, the yen was still on track for its worst week since June.
But the Australian dollar - a liquid proxy for risk - picked up. It was up 0.3% on the day at 0.7251 versus the dollar at 1227 GMT .
""The prospect of the Fed staying super-easy through the winter and beyond, while vaccine optimism, builds is dollar bearish,"" Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), wrote in a note.
""The big winners in the longer-run are the higher-beta, growth and trade-sensitive currencies,"" he said.
The New Zealand dollar was down 0.2% versus the dollar at 0.6827 , but still up on the week after jumping to its highest since March 2019 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's meeting on Wednesday.
The euro was slightly up on the day at $1.18155 at 0824 GMT.
European shares have dropped from their eight-month highs as European countries' lockdown measures to limit the spread of the virus challenge the narrative of a global economic recovery.
Germany's health minister said on Friday that it was too early to say how long the latest lockdown would last, while the French prime minister said France's measures would not be eased for at least two weeks.
Versus the safe-haven Swiss franc, the euro extended its gains from earlier in the week, up more than 1% on the week as a whole, at 1.0813 at 1228 GMT (EURCHF=EBS).

Elsewhere, President-elect Joe Biden won the battleground state of Arizona late on Thursday, but President Donald Trump still refuses to accept defeat.

“It is time for China to study an orderly exit of loose monetary policies,” Caixin quoted Lou Jiwei, who was finance minister from 2013 to 2016, as saying at the Caixin Summit in Beijing Friday. That doesn’t mean it would be an immediate exit, he added.
The challenge is to carefully manage the pace of the exit, Lou said, given high debt levels in the economy. If liquidity is withdrawn too soon it could trigger debt crises, he said.
On fiscal policy, Lou said stimulus should be maintained at its current pace and be made less expansionary next year. Fiscal policies are usually medium-term and it takes a longer time to exit them compared to monetary policies, he said.
China’s economy has staged a steady recovery, benefiting from a rapid resumption in industrial production and robust exports. With virus cases under control and household income improving, consumption has also started to catch up.
Liu Guoqiang, vice governor of the People’s Bank of China, said last week that policy makers globally are discussing the timing of stimulus withdrawal and that an exit was a “matter of time.”
Lou also said at the Caixin Summit that U.S.-China relations are unlikely to get much better in the near term under a Joe Biden presidency. The U.S.’s curbs on China’s development is inevitable, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has been warned not to tinker with the dollar's standing in world markets given the parlous state of the country's finances - but his new Treasury chief may be equally advised against talking up the currency too much.
In an open letter to the as-yet unknown next Treasury Secretary this week, Larry Summers - a former holder of the job and a Harvard professor - said the need for expansionary economic policies meant it would be ""unwise to appear actively devaluationist or indifferent to the dollar.""
""Favoring a strong dollar based on a strong economy or some such seems prudent,"" Summers wrote. ""Within the councils of the Administration it is your vital role to emphasize that if the United States over-exploits the central role of the dollar in the international financial system to pursue parochial objectives, it puts that central role at risk.""
The thrust of the letter, via Washington's Peterson Institute for International Economics, was that Biden's team should repair America's multilateral economic relations in forums such as the G20 and at the International Monetary Fund after four years of protectionism and either unilateral or bilateral actions.
As ambitious domestic tax changes would be difficult with a gridlocked Congress, and with financial stability already covered by the Federal Reserve, Summers insisted Treasury's energy should be directed towards urging the rest of the world to lift demand. He advocated a new policy mix of investment spending not undercut by bouts of demand-sapping austerity.
His caution about the dollar, however, was partly a sideswipe at four years in which President Donald Trump, even if not his Treasury head Steven Mnuchin, publicly complained about an overly strong dollar and often lambasted the Fed for not matching the easy-money policies of other central banks.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Summers advocates an approach taken by himself and his predecessor Robert Rubin in the 1990s - one that answered every question about the exchange rate with anodyne mantras such as ""a strong dollar is in America's interest"".
""An oft-repeated phrase will promote more financial stability than any amount of thoughtful theorizing,"" he said in the letter.
POLICY RESERVE
But the timing of his concern about the dollar's valuable reserve currency status is well noted by markets who, on balance, remain bearish on the dollar due to bloated trade and budget deficits, mounting national debt and expectations of zero Fed interest rates and bond-buying for years to come.
Europe's largest asset manager Amundi, for example, said on Thursday the dollar was overvalued by about 5% against most major developed world currencies given the United States has lost its growth and real yield advantages against those countries.
And some feel this precarious position - exaggerated by the pandemic slump and massive government rescue - justifies more caution about dollar stability than has been shown for years.
""Larry Summers' comments, we believe, do serve to illustrate where the risks currently lie,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research at Japan's MUFG.
""The 'twin deficit' risk coupled with loose monetary policy will likely mean whoever becomes Biden's Treasury Secretary will be far more cautious on U.S. dollar rhetoric than President Trump has been during his term in office,"" said Halpenny, adding Treasury would do well to be cautious of central banks in China and elsewhere gradually diversifying dollar reserve holdings.
Goodbody's global strategic advisor, Joe Prendergast, points out that a ""strong dollar"" mantra could also be helpful to the Fed in keeping both policy and long-term interest rates down by subduing inflation expectations - especially as the central bank carries a bigger burden of economic support if a sizeable fiscal lift is gridlocked in Congress.

DON'T OVERDO IT
But calibrating a stance toward the exchange rate can be tricky, and there are also risks to sustaining an overvalued dollar or giving the impression of a hard-currency zealot, who seeks persistently low inflation, tight money supply and a strong currency.
As played out again this year, the weight of dollar-denominated debts among global companies and emerging economies often leads to funding stress in a shock, or when the dollar rises. That dollar cash scramble often compounds the issue by lifting the exchange rate further.
And global stress exaggerated by a rising greenback - why the Bank for International Settlements dubbed the dollar ""the new VIX"" - could in itself cut across the sort of overseas growth that Summers insists the new Treasury Secretary needs to pursue.
If anything, the dollar tends to weaken when non-U.S. economies pick up steam, and that weakness loosens financial conditions around the globe.
Conversely a post-pandemic U.S. recovery before the rest of the world could balloon U.S. trade deficits - especially if a Fed rethink of zero rates sooner than others lifted the buck too. In that light, an explicit ""strong dollar"" policy may be unhelpful.
Perhaps the wisest approach would be to avoid any overt exchange-rate policy whatsoever - absent some new crisis.
For all Trump's fast-and-loose dollar talk, the currency actually remained fairly stable over the four years of his administration. After a period of initial weakness and then a rebound, the Fed's broad dollar index is within 1% of where it was when Trump won the election in 2016.
Keeping mum may be Summers' best advice.
""You will almost certainly find with respect to dollar talk, that less is more.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged marginally lower in early European trade Friday, but the continuing rise of new Covid-19 cases throughout Europe and the U.S. is making traders nervous of buying riskier currencies despite the positive news of  a potential vaccine.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.898. GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3155, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 105.00, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.7233.
In Europe and the United States, a second wave of infections has prompted the re-imposition of restrictions to stop the virus' spread. This has prompted caution within the foreign exchange markets despite a slew of positive news during the week of potential Covid vaccines.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) announced strong results for their vaccine candidate on Monday, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said it expected to make an announcement on its vaccine's efficacy by the end of the month.
“The big risk rally has lost some steam but failed to convert this into any market correction. In FX this has been mirrored by a halt in the dollar decline while high-beta currencies have largely held on to early-week gains,” said ING analyst Francesco Pesole, in a research note.
“The background story for markets remains the contrast between vaccine-related hopes and sharply rising infections, while investors stay on the lookout for more hints from Presiden-elect Biden around his plans for virus response, fiscal stimulus and foreign policy.”
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1814, ahead of the latest eurozone growth numbers later in the session, after the ‘flash’ release showed seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 12.7% in the euro area and by 12.1% in the EU, compared with the previous quarter.
However, the markets will likely discount any good news given the new restrictions across the continent suggest a double-dip recession is now likely. 
The European Central Bank is widely expected to add more stimulus at its meeting in December, and President Christine Lagarde cautioned Thursday about expecting too much from a potential vaccine.
""From a huge river of uncertainty, we see the other side now,"" Lagarde said. ""But I don't want to be exuberant about this vaccination because there is still uncertainty"" about production and distribution issues.
Elsewhere, Sterling was lifted by the departure of two hard-line Brexiteers from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's inner circle, with senior adviser Dominic Cummings telling the BBC he expected to leave his job by the end of the year. Johnson's director of communications Lee Cain has also left his job this week after a power struggle. The departures arguably reduce the risk of the U.K. pursuing a radical break with the EU at the end of the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year.",,,,,

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, headed towards its best week against the yen since March. Although hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine continued to whet investors’ risk appetite, a worsening of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the U.S. meant that riskier currencies made little headway.
As the week draws to an end, investors took stock of a slew of positive news on the vaccine front, with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (F:22UAy) announcing positive results for their candidate BNT-162b2 on Monday, Russia saying on Wednesday that its Sputnik V vaccine candidate showed 92% efficacy, and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) saying on the same day that the accumulation of data for a first analysis of its vaccine mRNA-1273 is complete, with an announcement on the vaccine's efficacy expected by the end of the month.
However, logistical issues in mass-producing and transporting these vaccines, the unceasing uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the U.S. and fears that more countries will re-impose lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus.
These fears would outweigh any positive developments in eurozone industrial production numbers, due later in the day.
“There are reasons to be optimistic about the global economic recovery, and eventual pandemic submission over the coming year, but we are not out woods yet,” National Australia bank’s senior currency strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01 % to 92.968 by 9:58 PM ET (1:58 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.19% to 104.92. The yen remained around 1.7% lower for the week, its sharpest weekly drop since a 2.4% drop in March.
TheAUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7226, as “the AUD continues to find the air thinning above 73 cents,” according to Catril. The NZD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.6826.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.18% to 6.6236.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.3118. The pound was sitting near a one-week low after a slew of data, including GDP data, released on Thursday missed forecasts. The U.K.’s third quarter GDP contracted 9.6% year-on-year against the forecast 9.4% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. It grew 15.5% quarter-on-quarter and 1.1% month-on-month, against the forecast 15.8% and 1.5% respectively.
Central bank heads sounded a warning note that the pandemic is far from over, although the vaccine developments show that an end is in sight, during Thursday's European Central Bank (ECB)’s “Central Banks in a Shifting World” forum.
“From a huge river of uncertainty, we see the other side now,” ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a panel discussion alongside U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey.
“But I don’t want to be exuberant about this vaccination because there is still uncertainty” over its production and distribution, Lagarde was quick to add.",,,,,

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, with traders shying away from riskier currencies as they readjusted their expectations surrounding a potential Covid-19 vaccine.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.073, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 105.28, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7262.
Pfizer’s announcement of positive results for the vaccine candidate that it is co-developing with BioNTech earlier in the week saw the dollar fall to a 10-week low that was more than 10% off its March peak. However, the enthusiasm has since waned and the dollar has rebounded by almost 1%, as traders readjusted their positions.
EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1770, continuing to fall after dropping around 0.4% late Wednesday after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that Europe could still see an acceleration of virus transmission and tighter restrictions, hinting at further easing in the near future.
“While all options are on the table, the pandemic emergency purchase program and targeted longer-term refinancing operations have proven their effectiveness,"" ECB governor Christine Lagarde said at the ECB forum on central banking in Frankfurt on Wednesday. ""They are therefore likely to remain the main tools for adjusting our monetary policy.""
Her comments were taken as suggesting that the ECB won't cut its deposit rate any further.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 0.3% lower at $1.3186, after the release of the latest U.K. growth data. This showed Britain's economy grew by a slower than expected 1.1% in September from August, even before the latest restrictions on businesses.
In the July-September period, gross domestic product grew by a record 15.5% compared with the previous three months, a strong rebound but still not enough to make up for the 19.8% crash in the second quarter when the country was in the grip of its first coronavirus lockdown.
“We expect a 6-7% decline in UK GDP through November, rendering the unprecedented bounce-back we saw in the third quarter 'old news',” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Additionally, USD/TRY rose 1.2% to 7.8923, with the lira handing back some of Wednesday’s near 5% gain against the dollar.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday committed to contain inflation while putting Turkey on a sustainable growth path, and comes after he removed the central bank chief and his son-in-law as economy czar in recent days.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, with investors adjusting earlier bullish expectations for a COVID-19 vaccine. This adjustment tempered the risk assets rally triggered by the vaccine expectations while maintaining enough confidence to support the greenback against other safe-haven assets.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 92.972 by 10:10 PM ET (2:10 AM GMT).  Pfizer  Inc's (NYSE:PFE) announcement of positive results for the vaccine candidate that it is co-developing with BioNTech (F:22UAy) earlier in the week saw the dollar fall more than 10% from a March peak to a 10-week low. A selloff of safe-haven assets since then boosted the dollar’s nearly-1% rally to just below the one-week high hit during the previous session.
However, a sharp decline in U.S. bond yields, as well as the Federal Reserve’s policy of an extended period of low rates and hopes for a global economic recovery from COVID-19 that would boost other currencies could contribute to further decline in the dollar.
This means that new drivers might now need to be sought to prevent the dollar falling any lower, OCBC strategist Terence Wu said in a note.
“With the broad dollar in a consolidative mode, the posture for the USD/CNH pair may also be sideways in the near-term. These factors play into limited downside for USD-Asian pairs in the near-term,” the note added.
Other investors espoused a more optimistic view.
“I think we had a speculative market that was increasingly comfortable being short on U.S. dollars. Then we had the vaccine news and a big spike in U.S. bond yields, which I think just acted as a little bit of a check on unbridled U.S. dollar bearishness. A lot of positions probably got squeezed. I think it was a condition of the market rather than a strong fundamental response or a change of thinking about the dollar,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attril told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.13% to 105.28. The yen was around 2% below the eight-month high it saw against the dollar during the previous week, after U.S. president-elect Joe Biden took the lead in the presidential election, spurring a dollar sell-off.
The USD/CNY edged down 0.17% to 6.6190. Tensions between the U.S. and China rose over the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC)’s Wednesday resolution disqualifying any lawmakers in Hong Kong's Legislative Council deemed insufficiently patriotic without going through the city’s courts. The immediate removal of four opposition legislators triggered the resignation of the fifteen remaining opposition legislators later in the day. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien warned that the U.S. would “continue to utilize all the powers granted” under various laws and “identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom.”
The NZD/USD pair was up 0.23% to 0.6897. The NZD saw gains as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) adjusted its “unconstrained” cash rate projection upwards due to a better-than-expected economic performance and tempering expectations of negative rates.
""Less stimulus is required than we thought in August, but still a substantial amount of stimulus,"" RBNZ Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby told Bloomberg.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7282. The AUD also saw a six-month low against the NZD after the RBNZ adjustment. “The pair looks heavy and at risk of further downside,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar held broad gains on Thursday as investors adjusted some of their bullish expectations about a COVID-19 vaccine, tempering a recent rally in risk assets but keeping enough confidence to support the greenback against other safe-havens.
The dollar index  sat just below a one-week high hit overnight and the dollar stood close to a one-week top against the Swiss franc  and a three-week peak against the yen.
The yen, a popular vehicle for bets against the dollar, is now at 105.41 per dollar, some 2% below an eight-month high it hit against the greenback last week, when Joe Biden's lead in the U.S. election spurred a wave of dollar selling.
The euro (EUR=) slipped 0.3% overnight after the European Central Bank said it would focus on bond buying and cheap loans to boost pandemic-wrecked economies, while the British pound  was lower as Brexit trade talks dragged on. [GBP/]
Only in the Antipodes was the dollar weaker or steady, after the kiwi leapt following an upward adjustment in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's ""unconstrained"" cash rate projection, which prompted traders to trim expectations for negative rates.
""I think we had a speculative market that was increasingly comfortable being short U.S. dollars,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attril.

""A lot of positions probably got squeezed. I think it was a condition of the market rather than a strong fundamental response or a change of thinking about the U.S. dollar.""
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell more than 10% from a March peak to the 10-week low hit on Monday. It has since rallied nearly 1%, mostly thanks to safe-haven selling after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) announced it had a working virus vaccine.
The dollar's decline had been predicated on crumbling U.S. bond yields, as the Federal Reserve promises low rates for a long time, and hopes for a global recovery that would lift other currencies.
OCBC strategist Terence Wu in Singapore said that new drivers might now need to be found to send the dollar any lower.
""With the broad dollar in a consolidative mode, the posture for USD/CNH may also be sideways in the near-term. These factors play into limited downside for USD-Asian pairs in the near-term,"" he said in a note.
In early Asia trade, the Chinese yuan  was a fraction firmer offshore at 6.6121 per dollar and other majors hung on where they left off the New York session.
The Australian dollar  was steady at $0.7281 and sterling  nursed a 0.4% overnight loss at $1.3220.
The New Zealand dollar  gained a fraction to re-test its Wednesday highs after Bloomberg reported that improved economic performance had changed the central bank's thinking. ""Less stimulus is required than we thought in August, butstill a substantial amount of stimulus,"" RBNZ Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby told Bloomberg in an interview.

Investing.com – The euro slipped against the dollar on Wednesday as European Central Bank policymakers continued to tout further easing on the horizon, though downplayed the prospect of further interest rate cuts.

""While all options are on the table, the pandemic emergency purchase program and targeted longer-term refinancing operations have proven their effectiveness,"" ECB governor Christine Lagarde said at the ECB forum on central banking in Frankfurt. ""They are therefore likely to remain the main tools for adjusting our monetary policy.""
Further insight into the central bank's thinking on monetary policy comes just weeks after the Lagarde said all members agreed that it ""was necessary to take action and recalibrate our instruments at our next Governing Council meeting.""
Lagarde, however, downplayed the optimism on a recovery in the wake of recent positive vaccine news, cautioning that it is unlikely to be linear across the European Union.
""While the latest news on a vaccine looks encouraging, we could still face recurring cycles of accelerating viral spread and tightening restrictions until widespread immunity is achieved,"" she added. ""The recovery may not be linear, but rather unsteady, stop-start and contingent on the pace of vaccine roll-out.""
Some analysts agree, citing the continued surge in Covid-19 cases, which has prompted France and Germany, two of Europe's largest economies, into further lockdowns.
""None of this [positive vaccine news] unfortunately changes the near-term fact that the global economy faces a challenging winter. Renewed lockdowns across the eurozone are likely to shave roughly 2% off GDP in the fourth quarter, according to our latest forecasts, while the risk of further restrictions in the US will put a considerable brake on activity,"" ING said in a note.""With covid numbers still rising and containment measures taking their toll, the near term downside risks are still dominating and elicit still cautious messaging."""

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday in thin volumes, as traders continued to digest the implications of Pfizer’s potential Covid-19 vaccine.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up just 0.04% at 92.775.
EUR/USD fell 0.02% to 1.1812, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 105.39, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7295.
It's Veterans Day in the U.S., and the Treasury market is closed, limiting activity in the foreign exchange markets severely.
“The U.S. data calendar is light today and it looks as though FX markets want to consolidate after some big moves (especially in emerging markets), but favour DXY drifting to the 92.00/92.15 range lows,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and its partner BioNTech, that data from their phase III trial suggests their vaccine is “90% effective in preventing Covid-19” prompted a rush into riskier currencies on Monday, but this momentum is starting to fade because there are still several obstacles to clear before a vaccine can be distributed.
Some focus Wednesday may be on the European Central Bank's annual two-day forum, an occasion that has previously been used to signal changes in monetary policy.
That is unlikely this year as the ECB has already signaled new monetary policy measures for December, but traders will be listening to President Christine Lagarde’s views about the European economic outlook and stimulus prospects.
“Today should also see some welcome progress of the EU Recovery fund in Brussels, which can drag EUR/USD back to the 1.1920 area,” ING added.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded at $1.3274, close to a two-month high due to growing optimism that Britain and the European Union will agree a long-sought-after trade deal.
This view was helped by the news that the House of Lords has rejected the government’s controversial Internal Markets bill, which would breach the Withdrawal Agreement that is governing the post-Brexit transition and undermine the basis for a free trade agreement after the transition.
Additionally, NZD/USD rose 0.9% to 0.6887, climbing to its strongest level in more than a year as traders scaled back bets that the central bank would move to negative interest rates.
New Zealand’s central bank instead agreed to begin a new Funding for Lending Program in December, offering cheap loans to lenders to further reduce borrowing costs and stimulate the economy as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
The central bank reiterated it is prepared to use additional tools such as negative rates if required, but the country’s successful containment of Covid-19 has buoyed confidence that this measure won’t be needed.
 "
909,"<span>Nov 11, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira erased losses against the dollar after the country’s banking regulator eased trading restrictions, a move that could help slow the capital flight that’s made the currency the worst performer in emerging markets this year.
The lira gained as much as 1% to 8.0787 against dollar after the watchdog increased the amount of currency swaps and derivative deals that local banks can carry out with foreign counterparts. It had earlier weakened as much as 0.6%.
When selling liras, the lenders’ limit was increased to 5% of their equity from 2% for transactions that will mature in seven days. It was lifted to 10% from 5% for those maturing in 30 days and to 30% from 20% for those that will mature in one year, the regulator said in a statement published on Wednesday.
The move came after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sacked central bank Governor Murat Uysal and accepted the resignation of Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who was the architect of policies to limit foreigner investors’ involvement in Turkey’s money markets.
The regulator said the decision is another move toward “normalization” of the market. Since September, policy makers have been unwinding a range of trading caps that have made it virtually impossible for foreign traders to hedge and finance their positions in Turkish assets.
The limits were first introduced after a currency crisis in 2018 and were designed to stand in the way of investors betting against the lira. But they’ve resulted in periodic liquidity crunches that drove overnight borrowing costs as high as 1,000%, and forced overseas investors to dump their bond and equity holdings.
Faced with an unpredictable trading environment, non-resident investors have pulled more than $13 billion out of the bond and stock markets this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday as optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine was offset by worries about how the drug will be delivered and by a surge of new infections in the United States.
The New Zealand dollar recovered from an early dip to hit its strongest level in more than a year as traders scaled back bets that the central bank would move to negative interest rates.
Initial optimism about coronavirus vaccine testing pushed the dollar up against the safe-harbour yen and the Swiss franc, but this momentum is starting to fade because there are still several obstacles to clear before a vaccine can be distributed.
""The dollar recovery is on hold for now because, when you look at the details, there are still a lot of hurdles to clear before any vaccine is rolled out,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""However, the dollar is supported by rising Treasury yields, which should help the dollar make another push higher before year's end.""
The dollar fell 0.15% to 105.07 yen , pulling back from a three-week high.
Against the euro (EUR=D3), the dollar eased slightly to $1.1829.
The British pound  traded at $1.3273, close to a two-month high due to growing optimism that Britain and the European Union will agree a long-sought-after trade deal.
Sterling, however, surrendered some of its overnight gains against the euro (EURGBP=).
Sentiment for the dollar got a boost after  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and BioNTech (DE:22UAy) said on Monday their experimental coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective.
However, the reaction across financial markets has become more tempered because there are several logistical hurdles to making the drug available, including that it has to be shipped at extremely cold temperatures.
Several U.S. states on Tuesday imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus as hospitalizations soared, highlighting the difficulty in containing the virus as winter in the Northern Hemisphere approaches.
The dollar index (=USD) against a basket of six major currencies fell slightly to 92.633.
The onshore yuan  capitalised on the dollar's weakness and rose to 6.5926.
Other Asian currencies, such as the Korean won  and the Singapore dollar , also gained against the greenback. 
The New Zealand dollar  hit $0.6868, its strongest since March 2019.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept interest rates on hold at 0.25% and introduced a new monetary policy tool to encourage more loans by reducing borrowing costs for banks, which matched market expectations.
RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr also said domestic economic activity since August has been more resilient than previously assumed, which many traders took as a sign that the chance of negative interest rates has receded.

Across the Tasman Sea, the Australian dollar  also rose against its U.S. counterpart.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia, with a new surge of U.S. COVID-19 cases and questions over how a COVID-19 vaccine will be delivered tempering optimism from earlier in the week that a vaccine would become available quickly.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.06% to 92.648 by 10:03 PM ET (2:03 AM GMT).
The dollar saw gains after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (F:22UAy) released positive interim phase III results from their COVID-19 vaccine candidate BNT-162b2 on Monday, with the results suggesting that the vaccine was 90% effective in preventing infection.
Although the news saw the dollar gain against safe-harbor currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc, and prompted a rise in global shares, concerns about logistical hurdles such as shipping the vaccine at extremely cold temperatures and other hurdles, such as the vaccine’s efficacy and longevity, curbed investors’ enthusiasm.
However, some investors remained cautiously optimistic over the dollar’s long-term prospects.
“The dollar recovery is on hold for now because, when you look at the details, there are still a lot of hurdles to clear before any vaccine is rolled out … however, the dollar is supported by rising Treasury yields, which should help the dollar make another push higher before year’s end,” IG Securities senior foreign exchange strategist Junichi Ishikawa told Reuters.
A continuing second wave of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. saw some states impose restrictions with the advent of winter in the Northern Hemisphere bringing colder weather and worries over soaring hospitalizations. Of the over 51 million global cases recorded as of Nov. 11, over 10.2 million cases are U.S. cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.18% to 105.09.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 0.7288. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair was up 0.51% to 0.6863. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand left its interest rate unchanged at 0.25%, conforming to expectations as it met earlier in the day. Investors’ focus had been on whether the central bank would adopt negative rates.

(Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, retreating from the more than 2-year high hit in the previous session after a promising coronavirus vaccine development boosted demand for riskier currencies.
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.2% lower at 1.3024 to the greenback, or 76.76 U.S. cents, pulling back from its strongest intraday level in more than two years on Monday at 1.2928. 
The U.S. dollar edged up on Tuesday and the yen stayed low, as investors remained optimistic about progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine, although the moves were more tempered than in the previous session.
""The Canadian dollar rallied to its highest level against the U.S. dollar in a little over two years yesterday before the pro-risk rally stalled,"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
""But the fact that the Canadian dollar is down, if only modestly, on the session so far, suggests markets are recalibrating after yesterday’s failed CAD rally,"" Osborne said.
The loonie found some support from continued strength in the price of oil, one of Canada's major exports.
Oil prices rose on Tuesday as hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be on the horizon outweighed the expected negative impact on fuel demand of new lockdowns to curb the virus.

Canadian government bond yields were higher across the curve, with the 10-year (CA10YT=RR) up 4.8 basis points at 0.795%.

913,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged down slightly on Tuesday and the Japanese yen recovered some of the previous session's losses after news of progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine boosted risk appetite in global markets.
U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (O:BNTX) said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.
The dollar -- which is considered to be a safe haven and so typically falls on positive news -- rose after the announcement, as investors quit their long positions in safe currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc.
The safe-haven Japanese yen tumbled to a 20-day low versus the dollar.
But these moves eased on Tuesday, with the yen and franc clawing back some of their losses  , as market participants tempered their initial pro-risk reaction, in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out.
""Following a euphoric market reaction such as that the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,"" wrote Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients.
""Even if the news of a vaccine could be a game changer, we urge caution, as the massive euphoria could be followed by some disenchantment,"" she said.
But Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said that despite the uncertainties ""it is still an important step forward to exit the COVID crisis and provides a reminder not to bet against human ingenuity"".
""It supports our baseline assumption behind our FX Outlook that effective vaccines will be implemented next year,"" he added. ""Further positive progress on vaccines will allow currencies which have been hit hard by the COVID crisis to continue to rebound.""
At 0813 GMT, the dollar index was at 92.730, broadly flat on the day and up around 0.3% since Pfizer's announcement on Monday (=USD).
The dollar has lost around 1.4% this month as Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election provided a major boost to market sentiment.
Euro-dollar was up around 0.1% at $1.18315, having fallen as the dollar strengthened in the previous session (EUR=EBS).
The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - was up just 0.1% versus the U.S. dollar as the boost from the vaccine news proved short-lived.
The New Zealand dollar was up 0.2%, in its seventh consecutive session of gains .
The Norwegian crown, which also benefited from the vaccine news, extended its gains versus the euro on Tuesday, up 0.3% on the day at 10.652 (EURNOK=D3).
China's offshore yuan, which has been gradually strengthening since May, hit new 2.5-year highs versus the U.S. dollar on Monday but eased some gains on Tuesday, up 0.3% on the day at 6.5970 at 0827 GMT .

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to push ahead with legal challenges to the presidential election results and will hold a series of campaign-style rallies to build support.

Investing.com - The dollar steadied in early European trade Tuesday, as traders looked again at the impact of the Covid-19 surge after Monday’s euphoric turn away from safe havens in the wake of Pfizer’s vaccine news.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.778, above Monday's 10-week low of 92.12.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1816, just off a two-month high ahead of the release of the German ZEW index at  5 AM ET (1000 GMT).
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.3171, near a nine-week high despite data showing record high redundancies in October, and USD/JPY fell 0.3% to 105.03, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.1% to 0.7278, near Monday’s seven-week high.
The news from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and its partner BioNTech, that data from their phase III trial suggests their vaccine is “90% effective in preventing Covid-19” prompted a rush into risker currencies Monday as traders saw this as the first step towards the global economy returning to normalcy.
However, a degree of caution has returned to the foreign exchange market in the course of 16 hours of reflection.
“None of this unfortunately changes the near-term fact that the global economy faces a challenging winter,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“There are also still some important questions surrounding the vaccines that will be key to the economic outlook. How effective will the vaccine prove when rolled out to the wider population? What share of the population will be vaccinated? And how long will it take to roll-out - particularly given complexities in transporting/storing some of the vaccines at the necessary sub-zero temperatures, but also because it will likely require two shots.”
There also remain key questions over the U.S. presidential election, with incumbent Donald Trump showing no signs of conceding.
Trump is completely within his rights to look into “irregularities” from the election, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday, while again voicing his resistance to the Democrats' plan for a large coronavirus relief package.
Just over 59,000 Covid-19 patients were in hospitals across the United States on Monday, according to Reuters data. This is the country's highest number ever of in-patients being treated for the disease, as new infections remained above 100,000 for the sixth consecutive day.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rose 2.4% to 8.2604 after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accepted the resignation of his son-in-law Berat Albayrak from his role as treasury and finance minister.
This represents more turmoil in a country which has seen its currency losing about 30% against the dollar in 2020.
Additionally, USD/CNY edged down 0.2% to 6.6119. Data released earlier in the day showed that China’s October consumer and producer price indices both saw smaller-than-expected growth year-on-year, and the CPI also saw smaller-than-expected growth month-on-month.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia over Monday’s news that a COVID-19 vaccine could become available relatively soon and raising optimism over the global economic recovery.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was down 0.22% to 92.632 by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT).
U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Monday that its vaccine candidate, which is being developed in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech (F:22UAy), was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. The claim was based on data from the first 94 people to be infected with the virus in Pfizer's large-scale clinical trial.
Coming as the number of global COVID-19 cases surpassed the 50.8 million mark on Nov. 10, with over 10 million cases in the U.S. alone, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, the news increased hopes that a COVID-19 cure would become available soon.
However, some investors cautioned against popping the champagne too soon, with questions about the vaccine’s efficacy and the length of immunity provided still to be answered.
“Perhaps the market did over-react to the vaccine, given there’s still some way to go prove that it’s safe. What they’ve shown is that it’s reasonably effective, safety is another stage. Once the market looked into the finer print of what these results were, maybe they backed off the trade a bit,” Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.44% to 104.90. The safe-haven Japanese yen clawed back some of its losses against the greenback, after seeing its biggest loss since March during the previous session.
“What’s important about the overnight movement is that it overturned the current trend of the U.S. dollar falling, instead of the yen, when the market turns risk-on. The yuan and euro have been rising against the dollar as equities jumped on Joe Biden’s election win ... but the overnight movement flipped things back to the way it is when markets usually turn risk-on, U.S. Treasury yields rise and the yen depreciates more than the dollar,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.19% to 6.6157. Data released earlier in the day showed that October’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index both saw smaller-than-expected growth year-on-year, and the CPI also saw smaller-than-expected growth month-on-month.
On the vaccines front, a final stage trial in Brazil for  Sinovac Biotech  Ltd (NASDAQ:SVA) vaccine candidate Coronavac was halted in Brazil due to a serious adverse event that occurred on Oct. 29.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7283. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair was up 0.26% to 0.6835, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand scheduled to meet on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 1.3188.
Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden continues to face challenges from incumbent Donald Trump, who shows no signs of conceding. Trump is also planning rallies to boost support for his legal challenges to the presidential election results.

LONDON (Reuters) - Joe Biden will be the next U.S. president but for the $6.6 trillion-a-day currency trading world, the undisputed victor is China's yuan, as investors bet trade tensions with Washington will recede and Beijing will let its exchange rate rise.
Major investment banks have rushed to upgrade their forecasts, predicting the yuan could hit the highs of early-2018, touched before current U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his tit-for-tat trade war. 
The offshore-traded yuan rose 0.6% on Monday to a new 2-1/2-year high of 6.547 yuan per dollar , partly on weaker dollar positioning but also due to China's containment of the coronavirus pandemic and an economic recovery.

On a trade-weighted basis, the yuan notched its highest since March (RXYY).
Fears for the world's mightiest export machine were soothed by data showing exports grew in October at the fastest pace in 19 months, even as the offshore yuan firmed for the fifth straight month in October.

""We used to obsess about 7-per-dollar. I wouldn't be surprised if we break below 6 over the next 12 months,"" said Savvas Savouri, chief economist at Toscafund Asset Management. 
Behind that reasoning is the belief that authorities will be less hands-on in holding down the yuan, given exports' declining share of the economy -- World Bank data shows exports comprised 18.4% of GDP last year, versus 27% in 2010.
""You can argue the Chinese economy has been growing due to mercantilism at the expense of domestic consumption. That handbrake will be taken off,"" Savvouri added.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Citi were among those advising buying the yuan against a fast-falling dollar. Goldman forecasts the yuan at 6.30 per dollar in the next 12 months -- a 4% move from current levels. 
Morgan Stanley named three reasons to go ""long"" yuan -- China's improved balance of payments position, a likely decline in trade tensions with Washington and dollar weakness.
Citi advised buying the yuan versus a euro/dollar basket.
Yuan bulls have also flocked to options.
The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation reported more than $23 billion in trades last week on dollar 'puts' -- options allowing holders to sell an asset -- against yuan calls, which confer the right to buy at a pre-agreed price.
Strike prices -- the level where options can be exercised -- are mostly in the 6.5-6.35 per dollar region, DTCC data showed.

Chinese equities too saw one of the biggest daily investment inflows of 2020 the day after the election, according to the International Institute of Finance.
TOLERANT PBOC
The People's Bank of China has been calm about recent yuan strength, although it appears to have tried slowing the appreciation via state banks' dollar purchases.
Morgan Stanley reckons the trade-weighted yuan will be allowed to reach 98 from around 95.65 currently, as long as moves are ""orderly and fundamentally driven"".
Economists note yuan strength, aside from increasing Chinese consumers' purchasing power, will help lure more capital to its financial markets, playing into Beijing's desire to boost the yuan's global role.
It may not all be one-way though. Washington has long accused Beijing of keeping its currency artificially low, benefiting its exports at the expense of American goods. Those views may not disappear under a Biden presidency.
But the stance may be less volatile, especially if Beijing is seen as permitting some currency appreciation.

""The kind of more multilateral approach that we would expect Biden to take will obviously take time to come together,"" said TS Lombard strategist Jon Harrison, who is backing a stronger yuan. ""For China's part, they will be happy to wait and see how the situation turns out.""

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Monday, as traders looked to riskier currencies to play Joe Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential election amid hope for more fiscal largesse and continued easy monetary policy.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.172, falling to its lowest level since early September.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1889, a two-month high, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 103.50, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.5% to 0.7290, a seven-week high.
Democrat candidate Joe Biden won the state of Pennsylvania over the weekend, thereby obtaining the 270 electoral votes needed to win the U.S. presidential election against incumbent president Donald Trump. While Trump has refused to concede so far, his remaining hope of overturning the result through recounts and legal actions is a slim one, judging by historical precedent.
Price action suggests “investors are positioning for a post-Trump era, which, with a Fed keeping rates near zero, is seen as a dollar negative,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Analysts at Nordea point to the likelihood of the Senate remaining in Republican hands, as opposed to the Democrats also claiming a united Congress, the so-called ‘Blue Wave’.
“Compared to a Blue Wave outcome, we should expect less fiscal stimulus, a smaller current account deficit, less inflationary stimulus, meaning the Fed should be even more aggressive,” Nordea wrote, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3184, hitting its highest in more than two months, helped by the Bank of England not introducing negative rates while it increased its quantitative easing last week.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and chief economist Andy Haldane are due to speak later in the day, with the focus remaining squarely on negative rates.
That said, the ongoing Brexit negotiations will also be of keen interest as the Nov. 15 deadline for a trade deal to be agreed between the EU and Britain draws ever closer. The change of control in the White House means that the Brexit project has lost its most vocal international supporter.
Additionally, USD/CNY fell 0.6% to 6.5718, falling to a more than two-year low, with traders hoping Biden’s victory will prompt more cordial U.S.-China relations, as the second-largest economy in the world recovers smartly from its Covid-19 hit.
USD/TRY also slumped, falling 2.7% to 8.2911 as traders react to the decision of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to fire Governor Murat Uysal over the weekend, replacing him with former Finance Minister Naci Agbal.
The Turkish currency has lost about 30% against the dollar in 2020, a decline that has accelerated since the central bank held back from raising the cost of borrowing at its October meeting.
