SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar hit a 10-week low on Monday as investors heralded Joe Biden's election as U.S. president by buying trade-exposed currencies on expectations that a calmer White House could boost world commerce and that monetary policy will remain easy.
The Chinese yuan  struck a 28-month peak, the New Zealand dollar  rose 0.6% to hit a 19-month high and the Australian dollar  made a seven-week top as the dollar index fell to its lowest since early September (=USD). 
Sterling  hit its highest in more than two months while the euro (EUR=) rose 0.1%, extending an almost 2% gain from last week to hit a two-month high of $1.1895.
Biden crossed the threshold of the 270 electoral college votes required for victory on Saturday by winning the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Republicans appear to have retained control of the Senate, though the final makeup may not be clear until runoff votes in Georgia in January.
""The outcome is ideal from a market point of view,"" said CMC Markets' chief strategist in Sydney, Michael McCarthy.
""Neither party controls the Congress, so both trade wars and higher taxes are largely off the agenda.""
The prospect of more gridlock also means that expectations for a massive U.S. fiscal stimulus package have been lowered, which has sent bond yields down in anticipation of less borrowing and more quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve.
The buoyant mood sent equities surging and the safe-haven Japanese yen  slipped a fraction to 103.42 per dollar - just below an eight-month high made on Friday when the dip in U.S. yields deterred investment flows from Japan. 
The yuan, particularly sensitive to the election outcome because of a perception that Biden will take a softer or more predictable line on China, was also boosted by strong Chinese trade data over the weekend to stand at 6.5758 per dollar. 
The South Korean won  hit a 21-month high of 1,115.33 per dollar and the Mexican peso  rose 0.7% to 20.3980 per dollar, its highest since March. 
""The undertow of dollar weakness is probably going to have a bit of a way to run in terms of the Fed and also less trade tension as something positive for other currencies,"" said Westpac currency analyst Sean Callow.
RISKS REMAIN
Selling was held in check by underlying virus worries and because Donald Trump, the first incumbent to lose a re-election bid in 28 years, has made no sign of conceding while fighting legal battles to overturn the result.
Traders are also wary of fresh lockdowns as coronavirus cases surge, with the global tally of infections topping 50 million on Sunday as cases in the United States surpassed 10 million.
""To me the bearishness that's in the dollar needs to get reassessed,"" said Hayden Briscoe, head of fixed income at UBS Asset Management in Hong Kong.
He cited the possibility of fresh lockdowns in the United States or hoped-for European stimulus ultimately disappointing as major risks to the dollar's decline.
Europe's fiscal and monetary responses to a second wave of coronavirus infections, which have already prompted new restrictions on everyday life, will be in focus when European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks on Thursday.
Later on Monday are appearances from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and chief economist Andy Haldane at 1035 GMT and 1400 GMT, where talk of negative rates is in focus. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan makes a speech at 2200 GMT.
On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets, with expectations it will hold rates but lay the framework for going negative next year.
In emerging markets, the beaten-down Turkish lira  rose more than 2% in the wake of the ouster of the central bank chief and the resignation of Turkey's finance minister over the weekend.

The lira has slid 30% to record lows this year amid the coronavirus pandemic as investors worried about falling forex reserves and double-digit inflation.

1,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yuan extended its recent rally as the dollar weakened following Joe Biden’s presidential victory in the U.S.
The offshore yuan strengthened 0.16% to 6.5811 per dollar at 10:42 a.m. in Hong Kong, following last week’s 1.6% surge that was the biggest gain since January 2017. The currency has been on a tear since the start of June as China’s economy rebounded, attractive bond yields drew overseas funds and investors bet on more stable relations with the U.S. in the event of a Biden presidency.
With the election result all but concluded, investors are likely to focus on China’s economic reports as well as signals from the People’s Bank of China. In the absence of efforts to restrain the currency’s strength, the nation’s assets will remain attractive to global investors. China’s 10-year sovereign debt yields 3.2% versus 0.8% for Treasuries, while a recovery in exports and consumption is expected to continue as the country remains largely free from the pandemic.
“As long as dollar weakness continues, the yuan’s appreciation can only be slowed but not inverted,” said Gao Qi, a strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore who expects to change his year-end yuan forecast from 6.7. “We may hear comments from PBOC officials to warn the market of one-sided movement in the yuan and more relaxations on capital outflows.”
Yuan Is Halfway Through Erasing Losses Since Trade War Began
So far, there’s been no strong sign officials want to halt the rally. China is relaxing controls on the yuan at the fastest pace since a shock devaluation five years ago, easing curbs on money flowing out of the country and giving banks more say on the reference rate.
The onshore yuan rose 0.2% to 6.5947 per dollar. China’s central bank on Monday set its daily yuan fixing slightly stronger than expected, the first time it did so since Oct. 23.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, starting its week with losses as Democrat candidate Joe Biden was declared the winner of the U.S. presidential elections.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, edged down 0.14% to 92.168 by 10:20 PM ET (2:20 AM GMT), barely above a ten-week low. Investors retreated from the greenback over the expectation that a Biden administration would mean a steadier U.S. foreign policy and the continuation of a soft monetary policy, as announced by the Federal Reserve during the previous week.
“The dollar has weakened in anticipation of a Biden presidency bringing calmer politics ... and anticipation of Fed coming to the rescue again amid near term risk of rising COVID infection,” Bank of Singapore FX analyst Moh Siong Sim told Reuters.
Biden won the state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, thereby obtaining the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election against incumbent president Donald Trump. However, Trump is refusing to concede and continuing legal action to contest the result. Adding to the uncertainty is which party holds the Senate majority, with four races yet to declare winners, some investors warned that it was too early to say whether market volatility has finally calmed down.
“We would caution that heightened volatility is not necessarily behind us, even though the election result is all but settled,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy said in a note.
However, some investors are betting on the Republicans retaining their majority in the Senate, boosting stocks but putting downward pressure on the greenback. Should their bets be correct, the divided Congress would create more work for the Federal Reserve as the Democrat agenda on taxes or regulations is thwarted.
“Republican control of the Senate is likely to see them dump the economic populism of President Trump and pursue a material decline in the U.S. fiscal deficit, which is set to underpin a large fiscal drag in 2021,” Perpetual head of investment strategy Matt Sherwood told Reuters.
“That means 2021 growth will now be more dependent on the U.S. Fed,” Sherwood added, as well as a COVID-19 vaccine, both of which would be negative for the dollar.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 103.31.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.37% to 0.7281 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.53% to 0.6808. Although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely expected to hold rates when it meets on Wednesday, the central bank is also expected to lay the groundwork to introduce negative rates in 2021.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.20% to 6.5950. The yuan rose to a 28-month peak over news of Biden’s victory, with investors hopeful of a more conciliatory approach to U.S.-China relations. China also released trade data, including October’s exports and imports year-on-year, as well as the trade balance, over the weekend. Further data, including the Consumer Price Index, is due tomorrow.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 1.3182. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and chief economist Andy Haldane are due to speak later in the day, with the focus squarely on negative rates. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan is also due to speak later in the day."

(Reuters) - An increasingly bearish picture is unfolding for the U.S. dollar, which has suffered its worst week since March on signs that Federal Reserve money printing rather than government spending may be deployed to bolster the economy in the aftermath of Tuesday's elections. 
A potentially divided U.S. government with Republicans in control of the Senate may mean a smaller fiscal stimulus package from lawmakers, increasing pressure on the U.S. central bank to ramp up its bond-buying and other economically supportive policies that have weighed on the dollar (=USD) this year. 
Major networks on Saturday declared Democrat Joe Biden the winner of the U.S. presidential election, offering some certainty after days of conflicting reports about who might run the White House for the next four years. 
At the same time, Democrats could still win more sway in the Senate if runoff races in two Republican-held seats in Georgia go their way in January, bolstering the case for a larger fiscal stimulus package that has been viewed by some investors as dollar-negative.
Those fresh concerns come on top of issues that have dragged the dollar lower for most of 2020 and led some investors to fret about its status as the world's dominant reserve currency, including expectations of rock-bottom interest rates and massive U.S. government spending for years to come.
The U.S. currency is off about 10% from its highs of the year and stands near more than a two-year low. Its decline has buoyed rallies in assets some investors see as dollar alternatives, such as gold and bitcoin, which are up 4% and 12% so far this month, respectively. 
""If you had to write a playbook that would get people to say 'I need an alternative to the dollar,' this whole process fits that story,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that the central bank was committed to keeping its bond purchases steady at $120 billion a month, but he also said lawmakers will likely need to provide more fiscal stimulus to help the economy recover from the coronavirus-fueled contraction earlier this year.
More of the burden for supporting the economy could shift to the Fed if a fiscal stimulus package is delayed or smaller than needed, some investors said. That's a potential negative for the dollar, as some quantitative easing policies are tantamount to printing money. 
""The Fed can surprise us,"" said Jack McIntyre, fixed income portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. ""They can do a lot to provide liquidity to the market, to push back the solvency risks that will come about if we don't get a fiscal package.""
McIntyre has reduced his dollar exposure in favor of emerging markets and investment grade government bonds. 
DOVISH FED
A weaker dollar would likely be welcomed by many U.S. companies, as it makes it cheaper for multinationals to convert earnings back into their home currency while boosting the competitiveness of U.S. products abroad. 
But it also pushes up the value of other currencies, complicating the efforts of economies like the euro zone and Japan to boost growth and potentially leading other central banks to cheapen their own currencies in response. 
The euro has gained around 6% against the dollar this year, while the Japanese yen is up around 5%.
Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management, believes the dollar will sink to fresh lows over the next three months. 
""The Fed is very dovish and is going to stay dovish,"" he said. ""The bigger the stimulus, the worse for the dollar.""
Some don't agree with the bearish sentiment on the dollar. John Floyd, head of macro strategy at Record Currency Management, argues that while the Fed has said it will keep asset purchases at current levels, the European Central Bank recently signaled it may increase its economic support in December. 

""That's a big difference,"" he said.

4,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A Joe Biden presidency, checked by a Republican-controlled Senate, may be just what emerging market investors are looking for.
While the Democrat is seen pursuing policies conducive to trade and the environment, a divided Congress may stop him from firing a fiscal bazooka. That means more exports and faster growth for developing nations, as well as a boost for riskier assets from a more accommodative Federal Reserve, according to investors and analysts.
Emerging-market stocks are heading for their best weekly performance in five months after a turbulent week dictated by prospects of the U.S. presidential election outcome. Investor demand for riskier assets has risen amid speculation that Biden will win the presidency and with the final result still uncertain, U.S. policy makers left interest rates near zero on Thursday and made no change to asset purchases.
The MSCI emerging-market stock index swung between gains and losses on Friday in Asia, after rising to the highest since 2018 and erasing all its post-pandemic losses the previous day. A similar measure of developing-nation currencies added 0.1%, paced by the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht.
Here’s what market participants had to say:
Charles Robertson, chief global economist at Renaissance Capital in London:
It’s arguably the best news since the taper tantrum of 2013 and commodity price collapse of 2014 hit many in emerging markets so hard. EM debt and currencies should perform very well. The big problem in recent years was dollar strength driven in part by Trump’s protectionism. Fewer trade wars should reduce the bid for dollars, allowing currency appreciation, and improving external debt ratios to gross domestic product.
Charles Diebel, money manager at Mediolanum International Funds in Dublin:
It means that you have a president who is more normal in his approach to trade. EM is supported by its correlation to weaker USD, so it is good for exports. With U.S. Treasuries likely to be in a range, it allows EM to adopt a slightly more dovish tone and will see inflows on a yield pick-up basis.
Simon Harvey, a foreign-exchange analyst at Monex Europe in London:
You will see some currencies outperform -- notably the Mexican peso and Chinese yuan -- from a reduced trade risk. We’ll see a marginal boost to risk appetite. EM currencies will also receive some tailwinds from lower U.S. yields and protracted expectations of the Fed normalizing policy. This favors the rand and Latam currencies.
Magdalena Polan, global emerging-market economist at Legal & General Investment Management in London:
I would expect less headline risk and lower volatility. I would expect President Biden and his team to be more predictable than Trump, and more prone to a multilateral approach. But attempts to limit China’s impact on the U.S. economy will likely continue as they have bipartisan support.
Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Melbourne:
The implications of a widening U.S. deficit, possibly more predictable U.S. foreign policy, and lower bond yields is a weaker U.S. dollar. All of which are positive for emerging markets, and notably, Asian assets. Meanwhile, as inflation expectations reduce and the anticipated rise in yields in DM government bond markets are capped further, it will be emerging-bond markets where investors seek out income and relatively higher spreads.
Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management in London:
A Biden win with a split Congress is perhaps the best outcome for riskier asset classes in the medium term. Trump’s corporate tax cuts will stay in place, while fiscal stimulus should turn out to be sufficient, not excessive. What is more, policy making should become less erratic with Biden in the White House, which could reduce stocks’ risk premium over time.
Kunjal Gala, lead global emerging markets portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) in London:
A Biden Presidency is likely to be pragmatic with a focus on globalization and hence positive for emerging markets. However, pressure on China is likely to be sustained as Biden could possibly unite with allies to counter China. Regardless of the political outcome, the emerging market structural growth opportunity remains intact, driven by an aspiring, growing middle class, rising digitization, reforms and infrastructure development.
Zhikai Chen, head of Asian equities at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management in Hong Kong:
In the event of a Biden victory, it will potentially bring relief to Asian equity investors as U.S. policies will likely return to the prior norm versus the current administration’s unpredictable tactics. This reduces the political and policy uncertainties between the two largest economies and allow investors to focus more on company fundamentals. We are mostly invested in companies where we have very good visibility on the earnings outlook and derived the vast majority of their revenues from domestic demand.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, with the result of the contentious U.S. presidential election still unknown and the possibility of a legal battle likely to lead to prolonged uncertainty.
At 2:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.537. EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1838, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 103.44, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7269.
The U.S. presidential battle still remains undecided early Friday, but Democratic candidate Joe Biden has an edge over President Donald Trump, with a few important states still counting votes.
Trump's legal challenges to vote counts in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan have so far had no effect.  
Trump has also questioned the election’s credibility. “If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,” he said late on Thursday, as usual without presenting any evidence. 
“FX markets have reacted to news of a much closer U.S. election by selling currencies most exposed to the global recovery story and buying USD and JPY,” said ING analyst Chris Turner, in a research note. 
“Certainly, the prospect of at least smaller fiscal stimulus, if not an outright contested election – combined with poor Covid-19 trends – favor more defensive positioning this month.”
Uncertainty about the U.S. economic recovery from the pandemic is also growing, along with the number of Covid-19 cases, with Wednesday’s private payrolls data and Thursday’s initial jobless claims both disappointing. This put the focus squarely on October’s nonfarm payrolls data, due later in the day, which is forecast to show a slight slowdown in job creation.
The Federal Reserve kept its monetary policies unchanged on Thursday, but Chair Jerome Powell stated that more fiscal and monetary support was needed as rising coronavirus cases clouded the outlook for the economic recovery.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3138, edging lower after Thursday’s strong gains on the back of the Bank of England deciding to increase its bond-buying program to try and support the country’s weakening economy.
EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said Friday there was only a ""50/50"" chance that Britain and the European Union will be able to reach a deal over the terms of Britain's exit from the EU.
 "
6,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s rallying yuan is more than halfway through its recovery from a selloff triggered by President Donald Trump’s trade war.
Underpinning the recent strength in the Chinese currency are its wide interest-rate premium over the borrowing costs on the dollar and the country’s relatively fast economic recovery from the virus pandemic. The prospects of a Joe Biden win in the U.S. presidential election are also boosting confidence in the yuan because the Democrat is expected to be less hostile -- or at least more predictable -- in his policies toward Beijing.
The yuan is poised for a gain of 0.9% this week to 6.6338 per dollar, closing in on the key level of 6.6 for the first time in more than two years. The currency has jumped 8% since late May, trimming more than half of the declines since China-U.S. disputes in everything from trade to intellectual property protection sent the exchange rate to the weakest level in a decade.
The rapid rally is a double-edged sword for Beijing. While it opens an window for policy makers to liberalize the foreign-exchange market, it also hurts exporters repatriating overseas funds. In October, China relaxed its controls on the yuan at the fastest pace since after a shock devaluation five years ago, easing curbs on capital outflows and giving banks more say on the reference rate. It has set its fixing at levels weaker than analysts and traders had expected for 10 straight sessions as of Friday, suggesting the authorities could be seeking to slow the gains.
While poised for weekly gain, the yuan declined as much as 0.4% on Friday morning.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against many currencies on Friday, but traders say more losses are likely as a contentious U.S. presidential election diminished hopes for large stimulus to support the economy any time soon.
Investors are betting that Democrat Joe Biden will become the next president but Republicans will retain control of the Senate, which will make it difficult for the Democrats to pass the larger fiscal spending they have been pushing.
Biden maintains an edge over President Donald Trump, but a few important states are still counting votes and Trump is mounting legal challenges to vote counts, so there is still a high degree of uncertainty.
A large decline in long-term Treasury yields due to expectations for less fiscal spending, combined with a rally in equities and other risk assets, has placed the dollar under consistent selling pressure that is likely to continue.
""There is a green light for the resumption of dollar selling, reflecting past declines in real interest rates,"" said Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
""There's an argument that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to backstop risk assets. The pandemic is still trending in the wrong direction.""
The dollar traded at 103.61 yen  in Asia on Friday, close to an eight-month low.
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has vowed to work closely with overseas authorities to keep currency moves stable, because a strong yen is widely viewed as a threat to Japan's economy.
Against the euro (EUR=EBS), the dollar traded at $1.1818 after falling 0.87% in the previous session.
The British pound  traded at $1.3128, holding onto a hefty 1.23% gain from Thursday.
The dollar index (=USD) against a basket of six major currencies stood at 92.668, close to a two-week low.
For the week, the dollar index was down 1.5%, on course for its biggest drop in almost four months.
Voting tallies from several U.S. states continued to trickle in during the Asian session, but currencies showed little reaction because the declaration of an outright winner could take several more days or even weeks, some traders said.
Investors also await the release of U.S. non-farm payrolls later on Friday, which is forecast to show a slight slowdown in job creation.
Worries about the U.S. economy are growing, which is a reason to expect declines in the dollar to continue into next year, some analysts say.
The rise in new coronavirus cases to record levels in several states could also curb U.S. economic activity.
The onshore yuan  fell slightly to 6.6366 per dollar but still remained close to its more than two-year high reached on Thursday.
Many investors expect a Biden administration will slightly scale back Trump's trade war with China, which should benefit the yuan.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar  fell against the greenback in Asian trading after the country's central bank said it is prepared to expand bond purchases if needed to support the economy.

The declines in the Aussie also dragged the New Zealand dollar  lower.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, reversing earlier losses even as a victor is yet to be declared in the U.S. presidential elections and expectations that large stimulus packages to support the COVID-19-hit economy will be rolled out soon diminish.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was up 0.21% to 92.743 by 9:45 PM ET (1:45 AM GMT).
Democrat Joe Biden is close to declaring a victory, with 264 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win and Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina still counting votes. Incumbent President Donald Trump has 214 votes and has already mounted legal challenges to vote counts in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan as well as requesting a recount in Wisconsin, adding to the uncertainty.
An additional challenge to a Biden presidency is that Republicans retain control of the Senate, making it difficult to push through stimulus packages with large price tags.
Investors’ expectations of less fiscal spending have led to a large decline in long-term Treasury yields, which alongside a rally in shares and other risk assets, is expected to put the dollar under consistent selling in the long term, some investors warned.
“There is a green light for the resumption of dollar selling, reflecting past declines in real interest rates … there’s an argument that the Federal Reserve will have to backstop risk assets.

Uncertainty about the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 is also growing, with investors digesting Thursday’s monetary policy released by the Federal Reserve and awaiting non-farm payrolls data, due later in the day.
These worries could lead to declines in the greenback into 2021, some investors warned.
The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, with several U.S. states reporting record levels of COVID-19 cases after the election.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 103.62, hovering near an eight-month low.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.25% to 0.7264, after the Reserve Bank of Australia said it is prepared to expand bond purchases if needed to support the economy. An ongoing trade dispute with China, with a deadline for Chinese traders to stop buying at least seven categories of Australian commodities arriving, also has Australian exporters on edge.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 0.6777.

The GBP/USD pair edged own 0.17% to 1.3120. The Bank of England also handed down its monetary policy on Thursday."

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell as much as 0.9% to the lowest since May 2018. That came as the euro rallied 1% and the yen strengthened past 104 per dollar, its strongest level in eight months and a resistance level from 2016. It was broken briefly during virus-induced market panic in March.
“The dollar has been declining as a result of the increasing likelihood of a Biden victory,” said Sonja Marten, a strategist at DZ Bank AG. “For now, the dollar is trading as a safe haven and the prospect that we are going to get a clear election result sooner than some had feared is currently reflected in rising risk appetite, and hence a weaker dollar.”
Investors have been bracing themselves for such a slide in the case of a Biden win, which could pave the way for more stimulus. Combined with an decidedly dovish Federal Reserve, whose policy makers are due to meet later Thursday, this creates increased headwinds for the world’s reserve currency.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday as Democrat Joe Biden looked to be edging closer to winning the U.S. presidential election, while sterling gained as the Bank of England delivered a bigger than expected boost to the U.K.’s struggling economy.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.312. EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1740, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.38, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.7187.
The U.S. presidential battle remains undecided early Thursday, but Democratic candidate Joe Biden has taken the lead in the counting for the pivotal Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Michigan, suggesting he is getting closer to claiming the White House.
Expectations that a Biden administration would result in a slightly softer tone on trade policy are likely to weaken the dollar against the currencies of countries that often faced the threat of tariffs during Trump's administration.
USD/CNY traded 0.1% lower at 6.6429, while USD/MXN gained 0.1% to 20.922, steadying after Wednesday’s 0.9% drop. The Russian ruble also strengthened by nearly 1% on perceptions that a split Congress will find it harder to agree on tougher measures against the country in response to alleged election interference.
However, Republican incumbent President Donald Trump has attacked the vote counts in several states by pursuing lawsuits and a recount, meaning financial markets are having to prepare for days or even weeks of uncertainty.
The Federal Reserve is due to announce its latest monetary policy decision later Thursday, but is widely expected to keep policy on hold given the uncertain political situation.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD gained 0.2% to 1.3010 after the Bank of England decided to increase its bond-buying program by 150 billion pounds to 875 billion pounds, more than widely expected, in an attempt to support the country’s weakening economy.
However, it kept its key interest rate unchanged at 0.1%, despite having examined the possibility of cutting it to zero or even below in recent weeks.
The move is a response to the sharp slowdown in the U.K. economy coming from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has forced the government to implement a second partial lockdown.
“We think that [the new lockdown] will take roughly 6%-7% off monthly GDP for November, following a forecast 1% contraction in October. That figure could rise if some schools are closed, or if there is a knock-on effect on industries not officially required to close,” said analyst James Smith at ING, in a research note.
“For the fourth quarter as a whole, that’s likely to mean a contraction of roughly 1.5% if most restrictions are lifted in December, or 2%+ if restrictions last longer.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to its weakest level in more than two years against the yuan and ground lower against other Asian currencies as Democrat Joe Biden edged ever so closer to the White House in a nail-biting U.S. presidential election.
Financial markets, however, were braced for days or even weeks of uncertainty as Republican incumbent President Donald Trump has opened a multi-pronged attack on vote counts in several states by pursuing lawsuits and a recount.
That could hamper the dollar in the short run, traders say.
Elsewhere, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after a media report that the Bank of England, which announces a policy decision later on Thursday, is considering negative interest rates.
The Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep policy on hold on Thursday, is also in focus as traders navigate market volatility in the wake of a knife-edge U.S. election that has pushed up the yuan and the Mexican peso.
Biden has claimed the pivotal Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Late reporting showed the former vice president with a lead in Nevada and Arizona, while Trump held a lead in Georgia.
Expectations that a Biden win will take a slightly softer tone on trade policy is likely to weaken the dollar against the currencies of countries that often faced the threat of tariffs during Trump's administration, analysts said. 
""The moves in the yuan and the peso show that the market is trying to price in a Biden victory,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""For slightly different reasons, we could also see the euro gain against the dollar.""
The onshore yuan  briefly rose to over a two-year high of 6.6381 per dollar, extending its recent gains as China's currency has become a popular trade to bet on a Biden victory.
Emerging market currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit  and the Indonesian rupiah  also rose against the greenback.
The euro (EUR=EBS) bought $1.1713 in Asia on Thursday, steady from the previous session.
The British pound  fell 0.35% to $1.2947. Against the euro, the pound (EURGBP=D3) fell 0.22% to 90.45 pence.
The dollar was little changed at 104.34 yen .
Even if Biden manages to surmount the legal challenges from Trump to become the next president, Republicans look likely to retain control of the Senate and can use that to stymie Biden's fiscal policy agenda - another complicating factor for currency traders.
Some analysts said Republican control of the Senate would prevent a Biden government from raising corporate taxes, which is positive for equities. However, a divided government also decreases the chances of big fiscal stimulus, which could be seen as a negative, other analysts said.

The Mexican peso , which had suffered from the Trump administration's hard line on trade, gave up some of its 0.9% gain on Wednesday and fell back to 21.03 per dollar.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, avoiding big moves as markets await the outcome of a nail-biting U.S. presidential election.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 93.490 by 10:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT).
Democrat candidate Joe Biden has 264 of the 270 electoral votes needed to declare victory, compared to incumbent President Donald Trump’s 214, according to Bloomberg, claiming victory in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan earlier in the day. The election now hangs on the vote count from a few remaining swing states, and Trump is already pursuing lawsuits and a recount in Pennsylvania and Michigan. The uncertainty could negatively impact the dollar in the short run, some investors warned.
Even if Biden were to overcome the challenge posed by Trump and become the next president, the failure to achieve a Democrat sweep of the Senate and House of Representatives could hamper his fiscal agenda for big stimulus packages to aid the COVID-19-hit economy and pose an additional challenge to investors.
A Biden administration could also give a boost to some currencies, such as the Mexican peso, that suffered under the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration at the expense of the dollar. Biden is widely expected to take a softer tone on trade policy than Trump. The peso steadied from Wednesday’s 0.9% gain earlier in the day.
“The moves in the yuan and the peso show that the market is trying to price in a Biden victory,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
“For slightly different reasons, we could also see the euro gain against the dollar,” Yamamoto added. The euro steadied from the previous session on Thursday.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 104.33.
The AUD/USD was down 0.26% to 0.7154 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.6688.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.6556. Investors are keeping an eye on whether the onshore yuan would gain against the dollar, with the yuan seeing a brisk trade as a bet on a Biden victory.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.28% to 1.2948. The pound saw losses over news that the Bank of England, due to announce its monetary policy later in the day, is considering negative interest rates.
The Federal Reserve will also hand down its monetary policy later in the day, which is widely expected to remain the same."
13,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan is emerging as one of the most sensitive assets to the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections.
The offshore yuan climbed as much as 0.9% in late trading Wednesday to 6.6202 per dollar, its strongest level since July 2018, after earlier falling as much as 1.4%. That was the biggest intraday swing since the day after Beijing devalued the currency in August 2015. The currency’s one-week implied volatility -- a proxy for market risk -- fell from a record high, while traders reduced their hedges against yuan weakness.
The offshore yuan is particularly sensitive to the election outcome given that some analysts view a Biden administration as potentially more moderate toward China in the trade war.
China’s currency is one of the best performers in Asia in the past six months, with the offshore rate rallying 7.5% against the greenback, as the country’s economy rebounded from the effects of the coronavirus and attractive yields drew inflows.
Authorities appear comfortable with the pace of gains, taking more steps to loosen their grip on the currency than at any time since curbs were imposed in the aftermath of the devaluation.
The offshore yuan’s 12-month forward points -- instruments used as protection for depreciation in the currency -- slid to a one-month low on Thursday. The yuan’s three-month risk reversal fell the most since July on Wednesday.
Biden won Michigan and Wisconsin Wednesday, putting him on the brink of taking the White House from President Donald Trump, hours after the president’s team opened legal fights to stop vote counting in at least two states.
The offshore yuan last traded at 6.6291.

The currency tested 21 per dollar before eventually strengthening past that level as vote counts in Wisconsin and Michigan pointed to a potential win by the ex-vice president. The peso had dropped about 4% overnight to a session low of 21.9782 as President Donald Trump appeared victorious in Florida, reviving worries of a replay of 2016.
“I still feel pretty good about the peso,” said Brendan McKenna, a strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. “The election is leaning toward Biden’s favor right now, which takes some uncertainty off Mexico even though Trump wasn’t targeting the country this time around.”

The peso traded at 20.9826 as of 3:15 p.m. New York time on Wednesday, up 0.6% from Tuesday’s close. One-month implied volatility slid to 18.83% after spiking to the highest since April.
A divided U.S. Congress will probably mean supportive policies for growth, including low tax rates, will remain, boosting sentiment and helping the peso advance past 20.83, according to McKenna.
The 20.83-84 area had capped peso gains in September and October. A breach would send the currency to the highest level since the global pandemic spread seven months ago.
Pre-election sentiment was cautious, even as polls showed Biden with a bigger lead in several swing states than Hillary Clinton held four years ago. The currency lost more than 2% between Oct. 26 and Nov. 2, the five days prior to the vote. Four years ago, the currency rallied 1.45% in the same period prior to the election.
Although the election remains close, a Biden victory “can definitely allow the peso to continue to appreciate,” said Jesus Lopez, a Banco Base strategist in Monterrey.
Lopez saw resistance at 20.85 and doubts the level would be broken before there’s a clear result. If it does break through, the currency could rise to as high as 20.50, according to Lopez.
The peso is poised to test 20.8450, near its September high, according to a note from Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical FX strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). If the currency strengthens past 20.8450 on a closing basis, it could extend gains to at least 20.55, possibly with another extension past 20, Fitzpatrick wrote in a Nov. 4 note.

Investing.com – The dollar fell from highs Thursday as signs that former Vice President Joe Biden's bid for the White House is gathering pace resumed concerns about a hike in spending from Democrats, though the fading prospect of a blue wave kept losses in check.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.14% to 93.43, but had been as high as 94.32.
President Donald Trump's path to remain in the White House has suffered a blow after former vice president Joe Biden increased his lead over the president following a win in Wisconsin.
Biden leads Trump 248-213, with 270 needed to emerge victorious. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shifted to a neutral dollar on election uncertainty following earlier results showed Trump was in the lead. 
The recent weakness in the dollar was led by bets the greenback would weaken on a blue wave - Democrats taking both the White House and Congress – that would have added to debt levels, increasing the deficit and likely weighing on the world’s reserve currency, Deutsche Bank said.  ""We no longer see a compelling narrative of dollar weakness into year-end.""
In a blow to hopes of a blue wave, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, unexpectedly clung onto her seat in Maine, denying Democrats a key senate seat that many expected would be tightly contested.

LONDON (Reuters) - A surprisingly close U.S. election contest caused the dollar to swing around in cash markets on Wednesday but derivatives market ""fear"" gauges showed implied currency volatility declining from multi-year highs as big bets on a weaker dollar were unwound. 
Unlike in March, when the coronavirus crisis unleashed mayhem in markets, reactions were relatively contained with a 1% jerk higher in the dollar abating as vote counting progressed and diluted President Donald Trump's early lead. 
Overnight gauges of euro-dollar implied volatility had surged on Tuesday  to their highest levels in more than three years, and similar though less dramatic moves were seen in yen  and sterling  gauges. 
Currency market players said expectations of a Democrat clean sweep had led many traders to place bets on the dollar falling, but the close race had fuelled a rally instead, washing out some of those trades. 
""The trades that did not work were on the options side -- because so many put on option trades before,"" said Andreas Koening, head of global FX at Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager.
""It (had) looked interesting via options ... but most of these strategies didn’t work.""
For example, overnight implied volatility for the euro-dollar currency pair peaked at 22% in Asian trading, before settling at 12% in London.
That is still twice the one-year average, indicating that some wariness remains. Similarly, one-week volatility  fell to 9% from nearly 12% while one-month gauges slipped to 7.5% from more than 8.5%, also above average.
Traders said option market volumes were well below what was seen during the 2016 U.S. election.
""I think people definitely want to keep their powder dry for when they see a more conclusive result,"" said Stuart Oakley, London-based global head of cash currency trading at Nomura.
Trump's wins in the battleground states of Florida, Ohio and Texas confounded investors' hopes for a clear result and the wait is on to see if he retains the so-called Rust Belt states -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- that sent him to the White House in 2016.
Marvin Barth, head of FX and EM macro strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) recommended buying shorter-dated volatility gauges until a clear result emerged.
Even more broadly, a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) index which measures volatility in several currencies <.DBCVIX> slipped to a two-week low of 7.6%.
Currency funding markets meanwhile showed no sign of any rush to secure U.S. dollar funding as was seen during March. Dollar borrowing costs on the euro-dollar three-month swap market  held steady at around 17 basis points compared to March highs of around 100 bps.
""There doesn't seem to be any kind of stresses in the market or big asset allocation flows,"" said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer of core investments at AXA Investment Managers.
""For the moment I think most investors are just waiting to see what happens.""

17,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said on Wednesday it had changed its view on the U.S. dollar given an extremely uncertain U.S. election outcome and no longer sees a ""compelling narrative"" for dollar weakness. 
Deutsche cited three reasons for its change of view: an easing in expectations for hefty fiscal stimulus, the risk of a protracted contested election result, and a chance that the election uncertainty leads to a politicisation of COVID-19 containment measures.
""All in, we do not see good risk reward in shorting the dollar anymore, especially against EM FX,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note, referring to emerging market currencies.

The dollar (=USD) rose as much as 1.2% overnight to hit more than one-month highs versus its rivals as early U.S. presidential election results indicated a tight race.

18,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira resumed its drop as early presidential election results in the U.S. pointed to a closer race than polls had predicted, while traders focused on the prospects for a local interest-rate hike.
The lira joined the retreat among emerging currencies, falling as much as 1.5% to 8.5253 per dollar, its ninth loss in 10 days, before paring the slide to 0.3%. That offset the gains of the previous day, when speculation about a possible interest-rate increase lifted the Turkish currency.
While investors have argued that a win for Donald Trump would help the lira by easing the chance of sanctions against Ankara, the currency was still among the worst performers in emerging markets on Wednesday, even with the incumbent still firmly in the race. Traders are more concerned about the direction of central bank policy, analysts said.
“The market views a Trump victory as mildly supportive -- or less negative -- than a Biden win for the lira,” said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors in London. “But the currency dynamics are not being driven by political outcomes thousands of miles away, but by policy inactions by the central bank in Ankara.”
Investors have called for an emergency rate move after policy makers unexpectedly kept rates on hold last month. Measures to tighten liquidity and rates in the repo market without explicitly hiking the benchmark have failed to stem the lira’s decline as geopolitical pressures mounted.
A win for Trump, who has opposed Congressional sanctions against Turkey over the purchase of a Russian missile system, would be a relief for some Turkish assets. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has been critical of the Turkish government, and would probably take a tougher stance than Trump.

“A strong and imminent rate hike from central bank, considering the inflation trend and balance in domestic market, would break the downward trend, regardless of U.S. elections,” Onur Ilgen, an Istanbul-based treasury manager at MUFG Bank Turkey AS, said. “Indecisive central bank moves might further hurt investors’ confidence and open a path for new record lows, no matter what the result of the elections would be.”

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Wednesday, with risk-sensitive currencies weakening, as the U.S. presidential election was seen as too close to call, suggesting a period of heightened uncertainty.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.6% at 94.115. It had shed 0.9% on Tuesday, its biggest daily drop since late March as traders had bet on a clear cut victory for Democrat candidate Joe Biden.
Additionally, EUR/USD fell 0.6% to 1.1638, GBP/USD dropped 1% to 1.2928, USD/JPY rose 0.4% to 104.91, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 1.3% to 0.7065.
Incumbent President Donald Trump has won Florida, Iowa and Ohio, critical battleground states, undercutting the earlier expectations of a decisive victory for Biden.
Several key states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are still counting, and traders are now bracing for the possibility that the election results may not become clear on Wednesday, with markets hedging against the risk of a contested election.
“One of the few things clear so far is that we are not going to see a Democrat landslide win as polls had suggested. That has wrong-footed an FX market which was positioned for some clarity,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
A win for Biden had been expected to lead to a large stimulus to support the economy, while he was also seen as being less confrontational in trade issues with China and other trade partners than Trump.
USD/CNY rose 0.6% to 6.7188, with the yuan falling despite China’s services sector growing for the sixth consecutive month in October, as the world’s second largest economy continued to rebound strongly from its coronavirus hit.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index grew to 56.8 in October, higher than the previous month’s 54.8 reading and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar clawed back early losses against risk-sensitive currencies on Wednesday after preliminary results suggested President Donald Trump has a slight edge over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Florida, a key battleground state.
That undercut rising expectations in markets this week that Biden will likely win the presidency and adopt a large stimulus to support the economy.
""If Biden won Florida, he was almost certain to win the entire race but uncertainties seem high and we are seeing a correction in risk-on trades,"" said Yujiro Goto, head of FX strategy at Nomura Securities.
Trump was narrowly leading Biden in Florida, while other competitive swing states that will help decide the election outcome, such as Georgia and North Carolina, remained up in the air. 
The dollar index measuring the greenback against a basket of currencies (=USD) stood at 93.626, flat on the day. It had shed 0.9% on Tuesday, its biggest daily drop since late March as traders had bet on a Biden victory.
A win for Biden, expected to be less confrontational in trade issues with China and other trade partners than Trump, could be a boon for currencies that have suffered from tariffs imposed by the president. 
The euro fetched $1.1707 (EUR=), down 0.1% on the day after having climbed as high as $1.1770 earlier.
The British pound dipped 0.2% to $1.3036 , erasing earlier gains of 0.6%. The Australian dollar gave up 0.2% to $0.7143 .
The safe-haven yen was little changed at 104.59 per dollar .
The offshore Chinese yuan, seen as a currency that has much to lose if Trump wins due to his hawkish stance on China on trade and several other issues, dropped 0.25% to 6.6959 dollar .
Investors were braced for the possibility that the election results may not become clear on Wednesday, with markets hedging against the risk of a contested election or a potentially drawn out process as mail in ballots were counted. 

""A contested election probably takes all of the SPX, Bond yields and the USD (at least versus majors) down meaningfully,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, continuing its gains as polls close on election day in the U.S., with investors turning to the safe-haven asset as results from eastern states start coming in.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.20% to 93.593 by 9:52 PM ET (1:52 AM GMT).
The economy and COVID-19 were the top two issues for voters, according to an Edison Research exit poll on Tuesday. The uncertainty continues as vote counting could go on for several days, delaying the outcome.
Currently, Democrat candidate Joe Biden has 85 electoral votes, leading over incumbent President Donald Trump’s 72 votes, according to Bloomberg. Trump won Indiana’s electoral votes, the first state to be decided, but the overall race is still too close to call and it could take several days for the results to be announce.
A Biden presidency is expected to pass big stimulus packages to support the COVID-19-hit economy, which is expected to boost riskier currencies such as the AUD and the NZD, although whether Biden is more successful in pushing those packages through Congress hinges on whether the Democrats win the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Biden is also expected to be less confrontational with China and other partners in trade issues, which will boost currencies in countries where Trump imposed tariffs, such as China’s yuan.
“It seems like many people are betting on a victory by Biden. It is a complete risk-on trade,” Daiwa Securities senior currency strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
However, some investors warned that the closer the vote is to call, the higher the risk the election will be contested.
“A contested election probably takes all of the SPX, bond yields and the dollar, at least versus majors, down meaningfully,”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) chief international strategist Alan Ruskin told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 104.59, with Japanese markets re-opening after a holiday.
TheAUD/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 0.7149 even after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its interest rate to 0.10% from 0.25% and said that the board would buy AUD100 billion ($71.10 billion) of government bonds in its monetary policy, handed down on Tuesday.
The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.6694 and the USD/CNY pair was up 0.39% to 6.7016. Data released earlier in the day showed that October's Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 56.8, up from September's 54.8 figure.

Investing.com – The dollar slump Tuesday as Wall Street warned investors that a victory for former vice president Joe Biden could hurt the greenback, with the latest surveys suggesting that President Donald Trump is lagging behind Joe Biden in key battleground states.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.64% to 93.5.
Former Vice President Biden holds a lead over Trump across key swing states including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to the New York Times/Siena College poll.
“Should Biden manage to secure one of those three states (especially Florida or North Carolina) then the chances for Donald Trump would fall dramatically,” ING said in a note. “In other words, while there is a high risk of a delay in the result, there is also a material chance that Joe Biden may have virtually secured a win by 03:00 EST (08:00 GMT) if results show he’s clearly ahead in those states.”
A Biden victory could spell bad news for the dollar as the former vice president is unlikely to continue with Trump’s trade war against China and the EU, boosting “American imports from overseas and thus add to the global supply of dollars,” Paul Craig of Quilter Investors, the asset manager, said, according to the Telegraph.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), however, suggests that the dollar is set to fall regardless of who emerges victorious as negative real interest rates in the U.S. and a sharp global economic recovery from the Covid-19 recession represent ""standard recipe for broad dollar weakness.”
""We are currently forecasting about a 15% depreciation in the real trade-weighted dollar from this year's peak to the end of 2023, but a larger move is certainly possible,"" it added.

23,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira weakened for a ninth day, overtaking Brazil’s real as the worst performer in emerging markets this year.
The currency dropped as much as 0.7% to 8.4843 per dollar Tuesday even as most of its peers advanced. The decline brought its loss this year to almost 30%.
The lira’s nosedive has accelerated since the Turkish central bank last month defied expectations by keeping its key one-week repo rate on hold while continuing to enact stealth measures to raise the cost of borrowing.
The prospect of a Joe Biden victory in the U.S. election is additionally rattling lira traders already concerned over Turkey’s widening current-account deficit, dwindling foreign reserves, geopolitical tensions and rising Covid-19 infections. Biden is seen as likely to take a harder stance against the Turkish government than President Donald Trump over the country’s purchase of a Russian missile-defense system.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is set to extend its rally over the coming year if the COVID-19 crisis becomes less of a drag on the global economy, FX strategists said, adding that a Democratic sweep in the U.S. election would bolster prospects for the currency. 
The loonie has rallied nearly 11% against its U.S. counterpart since March, but progress has stalled over the last two months as resurging coronavirus cases and delay of a U.S. pandemic relief package weighed on investor sentiment.
The outlook for fiscal stimulus will be shaped by Tuesday's U.S. election, including the White House race between President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
""If you do have a Biden victory, particularly a Blue Wave, we would have a larger expectation that you would see a much larger fiscal package come through,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities.
""That is ultimately reflationary and pretty positive for risk assets. It's an environment that the (U.S.) dollar should underperform and the CAD should do particularly well,"" Issa said.
Blue is the color associated with the Democratic Party, versus Republican red. Biden is well ahead in national opinion polls, but races are tighter in battleground states that will be crucial to the election result.
The Canadian dollar is expected to strengthen slightly to 1.32 per U.S. dollar, or 75.76 U.S. cents, in three months from about 1.3230 on Monday, the poll of more than 30 currency strategists showed. It is then expected to climb to 1.2938 in one year, compared to 1.3000 in last month's forecast. 
Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the outlook for the global economy. That outlook has become more uncertain in recent weeks as some countries, including Canada, reintroduced measures to help contain the spread of the virus. 
""We see the Canadian dollar remaining around 1.33 over the next few months due to continued uncertainties related to the pandemic,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins. 
""Subsequently, the international context should improve, which would favor several currencies, including the loonie.""

Last month, a Reuters poll predicted the world economy grow 5.3% next year after shrinking 4.0% this year. That is a touch higher than the International Monetary Fund's latest forecast of 5.2% in 2021.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Tuesday, giving up some earlier gains, as traders look for a more neutral position ahead of the U.S. presidential election.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 93.915. Additionally, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1662, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 104.56.
The dollar had seen demand over the last few days, climbing to a one-month high on Monday, as traders sought the safety of the greenback anticipating volatility during the election period.
""We have pared back a lot of our positions,"" said Stuart Oakley, a London-based executive at Nomura, in a Reuters report.
""It's a bit reckless to position ourselves for one outcome of the election... We've positioned ourselves to trade the post (election) volatility.""
The dollar has recovered some of its positioning ground over the past few weeks, according to the latest CFTC G10 FX data, said ING, in a research note. 
But “a less pronounced net-short positioning ahead of the U.S. vote may suggest that the dollar is somewhat less protected on the downside in the event of a Blue wave (i.e. a Biden landslide victory), which we see as the most negative outcome for the dollar,” ING added. 
Despite its recent bounce, the dollar index is still down about 9% from its March highs and on track for its biggest annual fall since 2017.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD traded 0.1% higher at 0.7059, gaining against the greenback despite the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates and announced a new bond-buying program to try and boost its economy from its Covid-19 hit.
The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its key interest rate, yield-curve target and bank lending facility rate to 0.10% from 0.25%, and said it would buy A$100 billion of government bonds with maturities of around 5-10 years over the next six months.
GBP/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.2942, showing some strength ahead of Thursday’s Bank of England rate-setting meeting.
Speculation is growing that the central bank will move to support the economy, likely through additional bond purchases rather than negative interest rates, after the U.K. announced over the weekend that it would enter a second national lockdown for a month to stem the surge in Covid-19 infections.
“The domestic driver has so far played second fiddle for GBP, although the recently-imposed one-month full lockdown in the U.K. and the BoE meeting this week may increase selling interest on the pound,” said ING.
Elsewhere, both the ruble and the Turkish lira stabilized after sharp losses in the recent week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The battered dollar’s long-term fortunes are unlikely to improve regardless of who wins Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election, investors and analysts said.
Despite its recent bounce against a basket of currencies, the dollar index (=USD) is still down about 9% from its March highs and on track for its worst year since 2017, weighed down by expectations that U.S. rates will remain near historic lows for years to come.
Many market participants believe that a victory by Joe Biden - currently the front-runner in polls - and a potential Democratic sweep would likely weigh on the U.S. currency further, as the former vice president is expected to open the door to policies that investors view as dollar-negative, including robust fiscal stimulus.
Four more years of a Donald Trump presidency may offer a less-clear path for the dollar. Although a continuation of Trump’s belligerent approach toward China would likely boost the dollar’s allure as a haven asset, those gains may be outweighed by factors such as continued negative U.S. real yields, analysts said.
A Reuters poll last month showed analysts’ median forecast looking for the euro to rise to $1.21 in a year, up about 4% from current levels.
Here are some of the main factors expected to influence the dollar over the long term.

RATE DIFFERENTIALS
For years, comparatively high U.S. interest rates relative to other developed countries supported the dollar by making it more attractive to investors seeking yield. 
That yield advantage shrank in 2020, when the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to combat the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and pledged to keep them at historic lows for years.
""The biggest FX trends ...will be the COVID-induced downward convergence of interest rates,"" said Kit Juckes of Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), in a note to clients. This ""is unambiguously negative for the dollar, and far from priced-in.""

REAL YIELDS
Real, or inflation-adjusted, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries plunged below zero in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. That has diminished the dollar's attractiveness and fueled rallies in everything from stocks to gold.
A Reuters poll in September showed analysts expected the yield to rise to 0.93% in 12 months, about half the expected average inflation rate, suggesting negative real returns over the coming year.
""We do not see a scenario which would derail a resumption of the (dollar’s) current broad downtrend, as U.S. real yields are likely to remain negative,” analysts at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) wrote.

SHORT SQUEEZE?
Net bets against the dollar stood at $26.46 billion in the futures market last week after hitting a more than 9-year high of $34.07 billion in August. 
While that short position reflects the negative sentiment swirling around the dollar, it could also fuel gains if a change in the narrative forced investors to unwind those bets all at once. 
The uncertainty surrounding a contested election could be one such event. Some analysts believe a Trump win or divided government - which could result in a smaller or delayed fiscal stimulus package - may be another.
Because the market consensus appears to lean heavily on a Biden win, “a Trump victory is hugely bullish for the (dollar),” analysts at TD securities wrote. “The market is not priced for a return of fresh geopolitical uncertainty and zero-sum, tit-for-tat trade battles.”
RESERVE STATUS
Trump has railed against a strong dollar throughout most of his term, complaining that it gives other nations an unfair competitive advantage in trade.

Although the accelerated fiscal spending expected in a potential Biden presidency may weigh on the dollar, some believe the Democrat’s less confrontational approach to foreign policy may bolster the dollar’s appeal as a reserve currency.

Biden “will not talk the (dollar) down; and he will embrace multilateralism, including the framework that has built and supported the (dollar’s) reserve currency status,"" wrote Alan Ruskin of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Latin American currencies are poised to edge up briefly against a weaker U.S. dollar with a potential Democrat sweep in the U.S. elections, but domestic challenges will continue holding them back after any initial bounce, a Reuters survey showed.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead over Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has widened in the final days of the 2020 campaign in three critical Rust Belt states that Trump narrowly won four years ago, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls.
The Mexican peso  and the Brazilian real (BRBY) are set to gain in the event of a solid Democrat victory that would open a path to a swift fiscal stimulus package and gains for sectors such as green energy, adding downward pressure on the U.S. currency.
Still, Latin America's foreign exchange markets will have to grapple with more slow growth and budget challenges ahead, a tough legacy of the COVID-19 shock that has placed the four main Latin American economies in the top 10 ranking of total infections globally.
""The Mexican peso has been boosted by the increasing chance of a Biden victory in the past month, suggesting that it could rally a bit further if he wins the election,"" said Nikhil Sanghani, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""And while another Trump victory would probably cause the Mexican peso to reverse some of its recent gains, we doubt that this outcome would have severe implications for the currency, particularly when compared to the 2016 vote."" 
On the downside, Mexico's recovery from the depths of the pandemic is losing steam, even with a big pickup in the third quarter that made up for much of the contraction in the previous three months.
This means any rise in the peso would be short-lived. Indeed, it is expected to drop to 21.4250 in one month and trend towards 21.55 in one year, according to the median estimate of 20 analysts polled Oct. 27-Nov. 2.
BIG DEFICIT, SOFT REAL
The Brazilian real is forecast to remain soft on account of a towering fiscal deficit that is getting more difficult to tame despite repeated vows by President Jair Bolsonaro's economic team to do so in 2021.
""In Brazil, foreign exchange moves are currently more related to fiscal worries,"" said Flavio Serrano, chief economist at Haitong Brasil. ""I don't expect any big changes for the real due to the U.S. vote."" 
The currency is seen at 5.52 per U.S. dollar in one month and just at the 5.0 mark in one year, reflecting persistent doubts over its ability to return to more firm pre-pandemic trading levels.
The real depreciated to five-month lows last week as the government posted a primary budget deficit of 76.2 billion reais ($13.2 billion) in September caused by heavy emergency expenditures in the fight against the virus and depressed tax revenues.
Casting more shadows over the coming months, Brazil revised its 2020 debt and deficit forecasts to record highs due to the borrowing and spending needed to support individuals, businesses and local authorities during the health crisis.

The real is down 30% from the start of the year, compared with an 11% loss for the Mexican peso. While Bolsonaro has pledged to resume his austerity agenda next year, some investors expect he may not do so before the 2022 election in Brazil.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, giving up some gains ahead of the U.S. presidential election, which starts later in the day.
Although uncertainty over the election’s outcome saw investors turn to the safe-haven asset earlier in the session, they are avoiding big moves. This uncertainty has led investors to stock up on greenbacks in order to profit from the volatility once the result is announced, rather than betting on a specific outcome.
“We have pared back a lot of our positions … it’s a bit reckless to position ourselves for one outcome of the election … we’ve positioned ourselves to trade the post (election) volatility.” Nomura executive Stuart Oakley told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 94.037 by 9:48 PM ET (1:48 AM GMT).
Democrat candidate Joe Biden has a comfortable lead over incumbent President Donald trump according to opinion polls, and a Biden victory could see big stimulus packages, with a more consistent foreign policy potentially benefitting trade-exposed currencies.
However, investors are not counting out the possibility of a Trump victory or an inconclusive result, with some states too close to call. Volatility gauges are on the rise even as spot prices remain steady, a hint of future volatility as the election results, which are not expected until the middle of the trading day on Wednesday in Asia at the earliest, start to come in.
The euro and the yen both saw one-week rises in their one-week implied volatility to above 11%, the highest since April, with the yuan’s one-week volatility climbing above 12%, hovering near a five-year peak seen on Monday.
“The risk of a period of heightened currency volatility appears to be more certain … we see a risk early results and exit polls give opposing signals on election day, boosting currency volatility during Wednesday’s Asia session,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy in a note.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 104.77.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.08% to 0.7047, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) due to hand down a crucial monetary policy widely expected to include a record low rate cut to 0.1% and a move towards quantitative easing, including a government-bond buying program.
“NAB’s assessment is that the RBA will need to convince the market they are prepared to buy at least AUD150 billion worth of bonds to justify the yield declines already seen over the course of October. Otherwise, the market, be it bond yields or AUD, risks a ‘buy the fact’ response, having sold the rumor during October,” NAB head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.6634.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.07% to 6.6854 and the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 1.2923."
29,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Currency traders are hedging against a volatile yuan after the U.S. presidential election, sending a measure of expected swings to the highest in more than nine years.
The offshore yuan’s one-week implied volatility -- often used as a proxy of market risk -- has more than doubled in the past week to the highest since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2011. The overnight tenor is also elevated, surging as much as 15 percentage points on Tuesday to a more than two-year high. The metrics based on options track forecasts for movement in the Chinese currency against the dollar.
Currency traders elsewhere are also hedging for wilder moves. Overnight measures for the Australian dollar and sterling were at the highest since April on Tuesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A broader JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. index tracking implied volatility for emerging-market currencies closed at a one-month high on Monday.
President Donald Trump faces Democrat challenger Joe Biden in Tuesday’s vote, with some initial results expected Wednesday in the Asia region. Biden has been seen as potentially more moderate toward China in the trade war, with some market watchers predicting the countries’ almost-destroyed relationship could improve under the Democrats.
Another contributing factor for greater yuan swings may be that since last week, some Chinese lenders stopped including a volatility-smoothening factor when submitting their reference rates to the country’s central bank.

30,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s central bank is expected to sell extra debt to soak up liquidity as funds return to the financial system following Ant Group Co.’s initial public offering.
Heated demand for the share sale had kept the local currency at the strong end of its trading band with the greenback in recent weeks. That spurred the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to inject nearly $24.6 billion into the financial system last month through buying U.S. dollars, swelling the liquidity pool.
The sale of Exchange Fund Bills is one method the HKMA can use to influence the amount of liquidity in the system. Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills stood at HK$1.07 trillion ($138 billion) as of end-September.
While excess liquidity is not a problem in most parts of the world right now, Hong Kong’s open capital borders and pegged currency make it vulnerable to fund flows in and out of the city. The retail portion of Ant’s deal lured HK$1.3 trillion in orders as of Friday, or more than 390 times the initial supply, according to the South China Morning Post, which cited people familiar with the matter.
“Liquidity conditions that are excessively flush can prompt investors to take on too many risks when buying properties and stocks, a scenario that will make the authorities worried,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank. “Therefore, they may need to sell EFBs to withdraw some liquidity after the Ant IPO. And demand for the bills will be strong, given banks will want to make use of the abundant liquidity they own.”
The HKMA already planned to sell about HK$829 billion of the bills this quarter, a lot of which would be used to roll over maturing debt, according to Bloomberg calculations based on its tentative issuance schedule released in August. On top of the quarterly releases, the de-facto central bank occasionally publishes statements on additional debt sale or reduction of planned issuance to manage liquidity. The HKMA didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comments.
“Hong Kong faces high financial risks, as some tech companies are doing very well when the economy is in recession,” said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. “So the HKMA will be pressured to withdraw liquidity, as it doesn’t want to see the equities bubble enlarge any further. The HKMA will likely sell EFBs in a gradual manner, with the first batch of issuance being around HK$400 billion.”
The HKMA may sell Exchange Fund Bills in small sizes, so interbank borrowing costs or the Hong Kong dollar won’t likely see outsized volatility, according to Chun Him Cheung, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). The one-month interbank lending rate, known as Hibor, has fallen to about 0.32% from 2.67% at the end of 2019.
Pressure on the Hong Kong dollar to rise is ebbing now that Ant’s IPO is allocated. It was last 0.02% weaker at 7.7513 per greenback after being at or around the 7.75 limit since mid-September.
The fact that the city’s currency is away from the strong end means the window is open for the officials to absorb some of the liquidity, said OCBC’s Li.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hovered near a one-month high on Tuesday as investors opted for caution in the hours ahead of polls opening on election day in the United States.
Traders are on edge over the result and rather than betting outright on a particular outcome, many have lately flocked to the safety of dollars so that they are well positioned to take advantage of volatility when results arrive.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the dollar held at 94.050, just below a month-high hit on Monday. The safe-harbour yen  has also ground higher in recent weeks and it was steady at 104.75 yen per dollar early in Asia trade.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  was steady at $0.7054 ahead of a crucial central bank policy meeting where markets expect a rate cut and a shift to quantitative easing.
""We have pared back a lot of our positions,"" said Stuart Oakley, a London-based executive at Nomura.
""It's a bit reckless to position ourselves for one outcome of the election... We've positioned ourselves to trade the post (election) volatility.""
Opinion polls have consistently showed Democrat challenger Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump. Analysts said a Biden win could weaken the dollar as he intends to spend big on stimulus, while a steadier foreign policy could lift trade-exposed currencies.
But with battleground states too close to call and with the prospect of either a Trump victory or an inconclusive result likely to support the dollar, moves on Tuesday were slight.
The New Zealand dollar , which like the Aussie recovered from a Monday low along with a bounceback in equities, was steady at $0.6630. The euro (EUR=) sat just above a one-month trough at $1.1639 and sterling was below $1.30. 
Beneath the steady spot prices, volatility gauges are soaring in an indication that things could get bumpy as election results arrive through the Asia session on Wednesday.
One-week implied volatility for the euro  and yen  were both above 11%, the highest since the beginning of April. One-week implied volatility for the yuan was over 12% and a fraction below Monday's five-year peak.
""The risk of a period of heightened currency volatility appears to be more certain,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy in a note to clients.
""We see a risk early results and exit polls give opposing signals on election day, boosting currency volatility during tomorrow's Asia session.""
Besides results, which are not due until the middle of Asia's trading day on Wednesday at the soonest, investors are closely watching the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy decision at 0330 GMT.
The RBA has flagged policy easing and economists polled by Reuters expect that to take the form of a 15 basis point rate cut to a record low 0.1% and a government bond-buying programme.
""NAB's assessment is that the RBA will need to convince the market they are prepared to buy at least A$150 billion worth of bonds to justify the yield declines already seen over the course of October,"" said NAB head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Bets against the U.S. dollar were expected to linger or even increase in the immediate aftermath of the Nov. 3 presidential election, despite jitters in the run-up along with surging coronavirus cases, a Reuters poll showed.
After trading within tight ranges for much of October, the greenback rose to a four-week high on Friday on fears the election results will be contested in the courts, along with economic damage from renewed lockdowns in Europe. 
Traders reduced net short dollar bets in the latest week, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But bets against the U.S. currency have outstripped those in favour for 31 weeks in a row and that is set to carry on.
In the Oct 27-Nov 2 Reuters poll, nearly 70% of analysts, or 29 of 42, said net short dollar positions would either stay the same or rise further immediately after the election. Only 13 said they would ease off.
""The dollar's move is obviously dependent on the election, but what is striking is ... how little territory the dollar has been able to gain, and if anything, this pullback is viewed by many investors as a dollar-selling opportunity,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
Thirty-nine of 60 analysts with a view said the election outcome would be the biggest driver of the dollar over the coming weeks rather than the coronavirus spread, where the United States leads the world in daily infections.
Slightly fewer than half of respondents, 25 of 57, said incumbent Donald Trump getting re-elected along with a continued Republican Senate - seen as unlikely according to poll averages - is the outcome that would bring about a stronger dollar.

The broader Reuters survey of more than 70 respondents showed foreign exchange strategists expect the dollar to weaken against most major currencies over the coming year.
""USD positioning remains heavily skewed to net-short territory by its historical standards, but given the centrality of the U.S. election risk event there is surely more room for those net shorts to be rebuilt into the dollar in a market-friendly election outcome,"" said Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING.
Democratic challenger Joe Biden leads in national opinion polls and a win for him and his party taking the Senate would probably hurt the dollar, partly on expectations of a swift, large fiscal stimulus package.
""The USD oversold condition does suggest a surprise win by President Trump could easily trigger a material short-squeezing effect on the USD,"" added ING's Pesole.
A continued surge in coronavirus cases that has forced lockdowns in parts of Europe has pushed the European Central Bank to flag further monetary easing in December, pressuring the euro down to a four-week low on Friday.
The euro fell 0.6% against the dollar in October.
Still, the single currency was up nearly 4% for the year and was expected to rise further to around $1.18 in a month. In 12 months, it was expected to rise more than 4% to $1.21 from about $1.16 on Monday.
""The euro, which is largely a COVID-19 story, hasn't been hurt as much as you would have expected,"" said Standard Chartered's Englander. 
""The sense in the market is even though this is unexpectedly aggressive resurgence, it is also temporary. The market is reluctant to abandon the short dollar trade."" 
Ongoing concerns over the economic drag from rising global infections have pushed stocks lower, and crude oil down by double-digits in a week on Friday.
Commodity-linked currencies fell against the dollar on Friday, and for some it was their worst week since the March collapse near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
While that trend was likely to play out this week, in line with the broad expectations in the poll, the dollar was predicted to weaken against most major currencies over the coming year - including commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and the Canadian dollar.
""At some point we get back to what I call the fundamental view: the dollar is too expensive at these prices for the interest rate differentials that now exist in the world,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
""We will see the dollar after the election, in all probability, return to the pandemic lows.""

Investing.com – The pound gave up ground against the dollar to test a key level Monday as investors bet the Bank of England is likely to step up monetary policy easing following a second lockdown in England.
GBP/USD fell 0.36% to $1.2896 to trade just above its 100-day moving average of $1.2874.
Rumors are swirling that the BoE on Thursday is set launch £100 billion of asset purchases.
""[T]here is little doubt the bank will need to remain supportive at this time of need. According to the latest Reuters poll, we should expect a fresh £100 billion added to the asset purchase facility. That would take the total size of the package to £825 billion,"" IG senior market analyst Joshua Mahony said in a note.
The widely expected move from the bank to shore up the economy comes as the U.K. announced over the weekend that it would enter a second national lockdown for a month to stem the surge in Covid-19 infections. Coronavirus cases in the UK on Monday fell to 18,950 compared with 20,900 cases a week ago.
The new lockdown measures demand that people stay at home unless it’s for essential purposes, including education, medical reasons, or to shop for groceries.
Economists have warned that another UK lockdown would likely dent economic growth in the final quarter of the year, throwing the country into a double-dip recession.
Thursday's meeting will come too soon for the central bank to cut interest rates below zero, but negative rates are likely to be considered in future meetings as the bank has limited capacity to keep ratcheting up its bond-buying program.
""[I]n terms of forward guidance, the MPC also seems bound to keep the door open to a possible eventual cut in Bank Rate to negative territory if economic conditions warrant such a move once the necessary technical preparations have concluded,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) agreed, adding that any potential move to cut rates below zero would come after UK banks have provided their assessment on how they would prepare for a negative rate environment.
""While we expect further guidance on negative rates, we don't expect any action on Thursday, pending receipt of banks' responses on the operational impact of negative rates, due only later in November,"" Morgan Stanley said."
34,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound declined to the weakest level in a month on concern a lockdown across England would deal a painful blow to an economy already reeling from similar measures earlier this year.
Sterling fell as much as 0.7% to $1.2855, the lowest since Oct. 7, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced the month-long restrictions amid concern that the coronavirus is spreading rapidly and the National Health Service risks being overwhelmed.
“Another lockdown is the worst-case scenario for the U.K. economy and the pound,” said Lee Hardman, a foreign-exchange strategist at MUFG Bank. “It will increase pressure on the Bank of England to deliver even more aggressive stimulus at this week’s policy meeting.”
Bloomberg Economics said the second lockdown will mean the economy contracts in the fourth quarter and that the BOE will increase its asset purchase target this week by possibly more than the 100 billion pounds ($129 billion) previously forecast. The central bank will decide on policy on Nov. 5, the same day the latest lockdown measures come into effect.
Several Factors
The shutdown is competing with a range of factors likely to influence the pound this week, from optimism about a breakthrough on Brexit trade negotiations with the European Union to the U.S. election on Tuesday. Uncertainty around the vote has driven the cost of hedging the pound over one week to its highest since April.
“I would expect that if it wasn’t for hopes of a Brexit trade agreement that the pound would be a lot lower,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank, adding that a stronger U.S. dollar is exaggerating the latest move in the pound.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Monday, with more lockdowns in Europe on the back of the incessant rise in coronavirus cases and the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election weighing on investor sentiment.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 94.142, after climbing 1.2% over the last week, its largest weekly percentage rise since late September.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to $1.1641, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 104.75, while the risk sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7011.
Over the weekend, the U.K. joined Germany and France in reintroducing partial lockdowns to try and curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus, with Europe crossing the stark milestone of 10 million total infections. GBP/USD fell 0.2% at 1.2910.
Sterling “could be in for a rough ride,” Nordea said, given “a new nationwide lockdown after a bizarre U-turn by Boris Johnson, unsolved Brexit negotiations and a clear disinflationary vibe despite an already very weak GBP. “
The Bank of England holds a rate-setting meeting later this week, and Nordea is looking for an increase of GBP150-GBP200 billion in the bank's asset purchase program.
This disappointing news is prompting investors to stick with the U.S. currency, which is often considered a safe haven, although ranges are tight as Tuesday's presidential election keeps financial markets on edge.
Democrat candidate Joe Biden has maintained a healthy lead over incumbent President Donald Trump in national polls over the last weekend before the election, but the race appears to be a lot tighter in the important swing states.
“We favor USD longs into the election with rising restrictions in Europe and a potential scope for lengthy lockdowns,” Nordea analysts said in a research note.
There is also the risk of delayed or contested election results, both of which would lead to heightened volatility, likely benefitting the greenback.
The U.S. data slate is pretty crowded this week, although the usually important FOMC meeting and the U.S. labor market report will play second fiddle to the presidential election.
“Data-wise, the FOMC should retain a dovish bias on Thursday, being ready to do more should it be necessary, while Friday’s U.S. jobs report is likely to show a further loss of momentum,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Also, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.6959, with the yuan retaining its recent strength, helped by strong Chinese factory activity data.

The ruble tumbled past 80 against the dollar, its weakest level since March as tighter lockdowns in Europe threatened demand for crude, Russia’s key export earner.
The ruble has been under pressure for months amid fears of new sanctions, low oil prices and rising coronavirus cases. Concern that Joe Biden may crack down on Russia should he win this week’s U.S. presidential vote has contributed to the currency’s more than 7% slide in the last three months.
Crude sank to a five-month low as a continued increase in Libyan production coincided with a wave of new virus-lockdown measures in Europe. Large swathes of Europe enter lockdown this week, with England joining nations from Austria to Portugal taking tougher action to counter the surge in coronavirus infections.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar steadied on Monday as investors prepared for U.S. presidential elections on Tuesday, while a surge in global coronavirus cases continued to weigh on sentiment.
The greenback held onto gains after posting its largest weekly percentage rise since late September in the previous trading session.
The pound inched lower on cornavirus worries, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced over the weekend a one-month lockdown across England.
Investors are sticking to the U.S. currency, which is often considered to be safe, as Tuesday's presidential election keeps financial markets on edge.
Democratic challenger Joe Biden leads in national opinion polls though the race is seen as close in enough battleground states that President Donald Trump could achieve the 270 votes needed to win in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the overall victor.
""Currency volatility can extend well beyond Election Day because there is a high risk the losing candidate will dispute the election results. The 2000 election took around one month to resolve the disputes,"" analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) said in a client note.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, last sat at 94.17 (=USD), near its one-month high of 94.195.
Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus continues to ravage already-battered economies.
England's lockdown aimed to last until Dec. 2 could be extended as Britain struggles to contain a second wave of COVID-19, a senior cabinet member said on Sunday. The United Kingdom is grappling with more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day.
Against the dollar, the pound was last down 0.39% to $1.2904 , with traders also eyeing updates on Brexit trade talks. EU and British Brexit negotiators will continue talks in Brussels on Monday until around mid-week, people on both sides told Reuters.
In Europe, new COVID-19 cases have doubled in five weeks, a Reuters tally showed, with total infections surpassing 10 million.
The euro steadied in Asian trade but was close to hitting long-term lows against the greenback and Japanese yen.
It last fetched $1.1638 (EUR=EBS), extending losses after a near one-month low of $1.1640 against the U.S. dollar seen last week, while against the yen, the common currency changed hands at 121.83 (EURJPY=).
""The euro has been selling since infection cases and lockdowns stood out in Europe,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
""But infection cases in other countries, like the U.S., have been on a rise as well. As time goes on, I think increasing coronavirus cases and lockdowns will be common topics in any country, to the extent that they are no longer themes for the currency market,"" he said.
Indeed, the United States posted nearly 87,000 cases on Saturday and record hospitalisations in Midwestern states.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  also took a hit from global coronavirus concerns, last trading at $0.6999 after slipping to its lowest since July at $0.6997. 
The greenback was little changed against the yen at 104.72 yen , away from a five-week trough of 104.02 hit on Thursday.
""Dollar/yen will likely remain quiet for today and tomorrow, due to the election,"" Daiwa Securities chief FX strategist Mitsuo Imaizumi said, but added any dispute over vote count could lead to volatility.
Chinese yuan last sat at 6.6883 per dollar , as China's factory activity data, both private and official, were above analysts' expectations.
Besides the U.S. presidential election, this week is filled with economic data, including PMI data from the United States, euro zone and elsewhere, as well as U.S. non-farm payrolls and Chinese trade.

Three central banks are also due to announce policy decisions this week. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, while the Bank of England and U.S. Federal Reserve deliver their decisions on Thursday.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential elections and rising number of COVID-19 cases globally continuing to weigh on investor sentiment.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 94.093 by 11:17 PM ET (3:17 AM GMT). The dollar held onto gains from the previous week, seeing its largest weekly percentage rise since late September during the previous session as investors cautiously turned to the safe-haven asset.
Although the polls predict a win for Democrat candidate Joe Biden over incumbent president Donald Trump, the race remains tight and the possibility of a contested election is keeping investors from making firm predictions on the election’s outcome.
“Currency volatility can extend well beyond Election Day because there is a high risk the losing candidate will dispute the election results. The 2000 election took around one month to resolve the disputes,” analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) said in a client note.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 104.66.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.08% to 6.6867 China released positive data earlier in the day that showed the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rising to 53.6 in October, ahead of the expected growth of 53. Data released on Saturday also showed growth in the in October's manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs of 51.4 and 56.2 respectively, although the manufacturing PMI was slightly lower than September’s reading of 51.5. The Caixin services PMI is due later in the week.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7017 and the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.11% to 0.6609.
The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.2934. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced a second lockdown in England beginning later in the week and ending on Dec. 2 as the number of daily COVID-19 cases surpassed 20,000. However, Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned on Sunday that an extension of the lockdown is likely. The news overshadowed the extension of Brexit trade deal talks with the European Union until later in the week.
Although the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Europe and U.S., some investors suggested that the market is developing an immunity to news of rising cases numbers and new lockdowns.
“The euro has been selling since infection cases and lockdowns stood out in Europe. But infection cases in other countries, like the U.S., have been on a rise as well. As time goes on, I think increasing COVID-19 cases and lockdowns will be common topics in any country, to the extent that they are no longer themes for the currency market,” Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno told Reuters.
It is also big week for central banks, with the Reserve Bank of Australia handing down its monetary policy on Tuesday and the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiling their respective polices on Thursday."
39,"<span>Nov 01, 2020 07:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The won’s biggest monthly gain since June last year is prompting some analysts to warn the rally may be overdone.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank Korea Ltd. and Woori Bank estimate that the won may be near its peak after jumping 3% against the dollar in October to lead performance in Asia. The surge prompted policymakers to issue a verbal warning last week, even as technicals suggest the currency is overbought.
“The economic situation isn’t all that optimistic,” Park Chong Hoon, an economist at StanChart in Seoul said, adding that the wide trade surplus that has supported the currency is unlikely to persist. “Foreign investors are continuing to sell local assets, while South Koreans continue to invest aboard in search for better yields.”
The won has rallied for five straight months bolstered by a surprise jump in economic growth and the fastest increase in exports in decades. The calls for caution come against broader bullish consensus from others like UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and RBC Capital Markets, which had argued that a Joe Biden victory in the Nov. 3 U.S. election would support trade-dependent currencies.
Woori Bank’s Min Gyeong-won disagrees. He sees the won declining next year on expectations that U.S. trade protectionism will continue no matter who wins the elections.
“Whoever becomes the president, U.S.-China trade tensions are likely to heighten,” said Min. “Markets are looking at Biden as if he is a savior to the world, but in fact his trade stance isn’t that much different from Trump’s protectionism policies.”
Overbought
Technical analysis show the won may be primed for a pull-back. Slow stochastics, a momentum indicator, is signaling that it may struggle to advance past 1,120 against the dollar in the near-term.
It closed at 1,135.15 on Friday, with StanChart forecasting it to weaken to 1,220 by year-end.
The won’s gains brought a warning last week from the nation’s Vice Finance Minister Kim Yong-beom, who said the government will take measures to stabilize currency markets if needed. The currency’s advance in October far outpaced other Asian tech exporters, with the offshore yuan only rising 1.3% while the Taiwan dollar gained 0.9%.
“Dollar-won’s drop is likely to be capped around 1,130 as that level seems to attract verbal warnings from authorities,” said Min.

Investing.com - The euro fell sharply against the dollar Friday and is on course for a second straight month of declines for the first time since February, as investors fear strong quarterly economic growth in Germany will prove transitory as the spread of the virus gathers pace.
EUR/USD fell 0.25% to $1.1646.
German GDP rose 8.2% in the third quarter, topping economist forecast for a rise of 7.3%, led by a rise in consumer spending as well as investment in machinery and exports.
Looking ahead, however, Europe's growth engine is unlikely to see a repeat in the fourth quarter as the second wave of the virus has forced the country into another lockdown starting Monday.
""[A]ccording to our estimates, the state-ordered closure of restaurants, pubs, hotels, theaters, cinemas etc. as well as stricter regulations for retailers will cause GDP to fall by 1% in the fourth quarter,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""We have assumed that the lockdown will end at the end of November …  but since new infections usually react to a lockdown with a delay and the government wants to see progress in this area, the restrictions could also affect December,"" it added.
Infection in Germany have topped 500,000 after an increase of 19,409 in the 24 hours through Friday morning.
As well as an expected dip in German GDP, expectations that the European Central Bank will mount a massive stimulus-response in December will also ensure any strength in the euro is fleeting.
“ECB President Christine Lagarde sent a crystal-clear message that: further stimulus will be announced in December, and there will be a package of measures,” Marco Valli, head of macro research at UniCredit, said in a note, according to CNBC."
41,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest funding tweaks by Turkey’s central bank couldn’t stop the lira from hitting a record low as the currency headed for its steepest monthly decline since a rout two years ago.
The decision to end access to liras from the cheaper Borsa Istanbul repo market is the latest step in the regulator’s bid to tighten policy and bolster the Turkish currency without resorting to an outright policy-rate hike. The move to cease funding at 11.75% will lead to a higher lira borrowing cost by forcing lenders to use more from the central bank’s late liquidity window.
The lira initially reversed losses, but soon resumed declines against the dollar. The currency has hit a record low every day this week and traded 0.4% lower at 8.3270 as of 11:21 a.m. in Istanbul, the biggest drop among emerging-market peers on Friday.
The latest development comes after the central bank stunned investors by holding the one-week repo rate steady last week, while increasing the late liquidity window, a marginal source of lending originally intended for emergency funding.
The decision quashed hopes that the monetary authority was determined to tighten policy and curb inflation. In September, the central bank began reversing an easing cycle by unexpectedly raising interest rates by 200 basis points to 10.25%.
“In the period ahead, we can take all the necessary steps, including on policy interest rates,” Governor Murat Uysal said in the central bank’s quarterly inflation briefing on Wednesday. The lira is “extremely undervalued,” he said.
While Uysal said the central bank doesn’t target a particular exchange rate, he warned that a weak lira poses risks to price stability and said the regulator will maintain tight policy until inflation improves.
The weighted average cost of lira funding rose by 21 basis points to 13.08% on Wednesday, amounting to a 574 basis points rate hike from as low as 7.34% in July.
Election Jitters
Uncertainty in the run-up to U.S. elections next week is also dimming appetite for riskier assets. Investors are paying particular attention to the American presidential contest given the potential for Democratic candidate Joe Biden to take a harsher stance with Ankara if he wins the race.
While some investors have called for an emergency hike to stem the lira’s drop, Kieran Curtis, London-based director of investment at  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc  (LON:ADNl)., said the central bank would leave any decision on tightening until its scheduled November meeting.
“One of the main causes of the acute weakness a couple of years ago was a really big liquidation of foreign holdings of domestic securities,” Curtis said. “The stock just isn’t big enough to be this kind of driver any more.”"

Investing.com - The dollar maintained overnight gains in early European trade Friday, while the euro struggled near four-week lows as new Covid-inpired lockdowns in Europe prompted the European Central Bank to hint at more monetary easing.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 93.998, after climbing to a near four-week high during the previous session, largely on the back of the euro’s drop. EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1669, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2913, while USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 104.41.
The ECB kept interest rates steady on Thursday, but acknowledged that the fallout from the second wave of coronavirus infections had damaged the economic outlook.
“The ECB sent strong signals that another easing package would be in store in December, as the economic outlook had darkened notably. The ECB’s stance leaves some more room for bond yields and EUR/USD to fall further,” said Nordea analyst Jan von Gerich, in a research note.
A further cut in interest rates seems in doubt, however, with Robert Holzmann, a member of the ECB's governing council, telling Bloomberg that there would be ""little effectiveness"" from lower interest rates.
Nordea is looking for an expansion of the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program of 500 billion euros and the announcement of more Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations. 
However, “given the recent developments in terms of weak inflation and more economic restrictions due to Covid-19, risks are tilted towards an even bigger easing package,” von Gerich added.
Attention will turn to the release of the euro zone’s third-quarter GDP release, with a rebound expected from the second quarter’s 11.8% decline. The U.S. equivalent rebounded at a 33.1% annualised rate last quarter, data showed on Thursday, and earlier Friday France's GDP release showed a rise of 18.2%.
A great deal of uncertainty remains ahead of next week’s U.S. presidential election and as the number of Covid-19 cases grows rapidly globally.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY dropped 0.2% to 6.6986, with the yuan set to post a positive month, the fifth in a row, helped by China seemingly recovering more quickly from the virus pandemic. Also helping Friday was a tightening of liquidity, which pushed the benchmark gauge of interbank borrowing costs to the highest since February.

43,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan rose the most in a week, outperforming all other currencies in Asia, as cash supply tightened at the end of the month.
The yuan gained as much as 0.55% to 6.6789 a dollar, erasing all losses since the central bank made building short bets cheaper three weeks ago to encourage weakness. The currency was up 0.4% at 6.6890 as of 1:40 p.m. in Shanghai.
Underpinning the strength on Friday was a tightening of liquidity, which pushed the benchmark gauge of interbank borrowing costs to the highest since February. Demand for the yuan typically rises toward month-end, as banks hoard funds for regulatory checks and exporters sell their dollar receipts.
The Chinese currency is poised to advance for the fifth month, thanks to its wide interest-rate premium over the U.S. and the economic recovery from the virus pandemic. The yuan also received a boost from optimism that it would remain strong during a major meeting of the Communist Party this week, where leaders outlined economic plans for the next five years.
The onshore yuan is in line for a gain of 1.6% this month and is up 7.2% from a low in May.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, and the euro hovered near a four-week low against the dollar over hints from the European Central Bank (ECB) that it could roll out further monetary easing by the end of the year.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.15% to 93.838 by 10:39 PM ET (2:39 AM GMT), after climbing to a near four-week high during the previous session over the euro’s decline.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 104.45. A rebound in U.S. treasury yields and broad dollar buying saw the greenback rally from a five-week trough overnight.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.33% to 0.7051 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.6634.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.34% to 6.6914.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.07% to 1.2936. The U.K. and the European Union (EU) continue to work towards reaching a post-Brexit trade agreement by the end of the year.
The ECB announced its monetary policy on Thursday, keeping interest rates steady but committing to craft a response to the second wave of COVID-19 cases in the region by its December meeting and conforming to investor expectations.
“We agreed, all of us, that it was necessary to take action and therefore to recalibrate our instruments at our next Governing Council meeting,” ECB President Christine Lagarde said.
“The economy in the euro zone is deteriorating at a faster pace than expected, and some view that monetary easing won’t be enough to lift the euro zone, or that it will be too late [in December]. Such reactions probably pressured the euro to fall,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters, adding that the euro is unlikely to rise in the immediate future.
An advance estimate of U.S. third-quarter GDP released on Thursday showed a 33.1% rise quarter-on-quarter, the fastest pace since records began in 1947. Separate data showed that 751,000 Americans filed for unemployment claims in the week ended Oct. 24, against the 791,000 claims from the previous week.
Although the dollar was on track to post its second monthly gains, uncertainty over the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential elections and worries over the mounting number of COVID-19 cases capped gains.
The number of global cases rose by 479,000, according to the World Health Organization, and France and Germany begin government-mandated lockdowns on Friday and Monday respectively. The U.S. also reported rising cases in 41 of the country’s 50 states.
Investors now await data due to be released later in the day, including the EU’s third quarter GDP and October inflation, while across the Atlantic, the U.S. is due to release September data on personal consumption and expenditures, as well as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar firmed on Friday and the euro wallowed near a four-week low against the greenback after the European Central Bank signalled further monetary easing by the end of the year.
The euro's overnight decline helped lift the U.S. dollar near four-week high against a basket of currencies.
The ECB kept interest rates steady on Thursday but committed to contain the growing fallout from a second wave of coronavirus infections, saying it would hone its response by its December meeting, as widely expected by the market.
""We agreed, all of us, that it was necessary to take action and therefore to recalibrate our instruments at our next Governing Council meeting,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde told a news conference.
""The economy in euro zone is deteriorating at a faster pace than expected, and some view that monetary easing won't be enough to lift the euro zone, or that it will be too late (in December). Such reactions probably pressured the euro to fall,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, noting that it will be difficult for the single currency to rise in the immediate future.
The euro was little changed at $1.1676 (EUR=EBS) in Asia, taking a pause after hitting a four-week low of $1.1650 in U.S. trade overnight.
Against the yen, the common currency slightly eased at 122.08 yen (EURJPY=EBS).
Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew at a record pace for the third quarter and an improving trend in jobless claims, while scars from the coronavirus recession still lingered.
U.S. gross domestic product rebounded at a 33.1% annualised rate last quarter, according to an advance estimate on Thursday, the fastest pace since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Separately, a report showed 751,000 people in the United States filed for state unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 24, compared with 791,000 the previous period. 
The dollar index rose to a four-week high overnight due to the euro's decline and U.S. data. It stayed near Thursday's level at 93.916 (=USD) and was on track to post its second monthly gains. 
Still, uncertainty surrounding Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and coronavirus fears continue to loom over market. 
Global coronavirus cases rose by over 500,000 for the first time as France and Germany falls back into coronavirus lockdowns next week. The United States also faces with rising cases in 47 states, and patients were overwhelming hospitals across the country. 
Data due on Friday include euro zone's third-quarter gross domestic product and October inflation, while the U.S. awaits September personal consumption and expenditures as well as Chicago PMI. 
The greenback was little changed against the Japanese yen at 104.55 yen , having rallied from a five-week trough overnight as it benefited from a rebound in U.S. treasury yields and broad dollar buying.
Sterling changed hands at 1.2927 , undermined by a lack of Brexit-related headlines as London and the European Union have just two months to reach a post-Brexit trade agreement. 
The Aussie  changed hands at $0.7031, slightly above a three-month low of $0.7002 marked overnight. 

Across the Tasman Sea, the kiwi  held steady, last fetching 0.6623 per dollar.

46,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As U.S. voters prepare for next week’s presidential election, Chinese investors have already decided what they think the outcome will be: the continued decoupling of the world’s two largest economies.
A victory for Democratic candidate Joe Biden would likely result in a toning down of anti-China rhetoric from the White House, fund managers say, but it wouldn’t change the now-bipartisan view in Washington of Beijing as a strategic rival. Regardless of the outcome, two camps have emerged: one that is holding on to its current strategy and another that is reducing its exposure to potential stock volatility.
“I will continue to stay away from telecommunications and semiconductors, anything that may be hurt by worsening U.S.-China relations,” said Qi He, fund manager at Huatai Pinebridge Fund Management Co. “But that applies to either candidate.”
He has been overweight on consumer stocks amid moves toward companies including Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. by President Donald Trump’s administration, which have rattled markets in recent months.
Given that polls were so poor at predicting the Trump victory in 2016, Liu Wei, fund manager at Beijing Zhikai Investment Management Co., said he expects more volatility and uncertainty down the road. “We’ve decreased exposure in A-shares by around 20 percentage points to dampen any kind of market shock from the election,” Liu said.
Some see volatility as a more immediate possibility should the election be close. “The risks are greatest if we see a dog fight, with Trump losing by a very small margin,” said Chen Da, managing director at Anlan Capital. “He would probably not relinquish his claim to power peacefully if that happens.”
Rather than prepare for that outcome by reducing exposure onshore, Chen said he is planning to hedge through VIX futures, if it begins to look like the election is going to be a close call.
“From experience we find that event-driven investment decisions don’t pay off that well,” he added. “These things are in effect a bet on a bet –- you have to get the election outcome right, and then the reaction in stocks right, so it’s very easy to get it wrong.”
There are mixed views on what the impact on Chinese tech stocks would be if Biden wins -- as current polling predicts. Xiong Qi, deputy head of research at Windsor Capital Management Co. in Beijing, said the advisory firm had reduced its positions in the sector due to risk concerns regarding Biden. “He may boost taxation, which will weigh on tech stocks in the U.S.,” Xiong said. “Chinese tech stocks will also feel the pressure.”
On the other hand, a Biden win would benefit China tech and export stocks the most, said Shanghai-based independent economist Andy Xie, who made a name for himself at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in the early 2000s.
“The tech war should ease off under Biden - there will likely be more transparency in supply chain access,” Xie said. A Biden administration would pursue reciprocity and give Beijing some time to open up before imposing new sanctions, he added. “Export stocks are massively undervalued because investors don’t know if further tariffs will come on.”
Even if a Biden win could reduce trans-Pacific tensions superficially, Chinese defense, tech hardware and financial stocks will continue to perform well, said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International in Hong Kong.
“Biden may be less confrontational when dealing with China compared with Trump,” Hong said. “But the rivalry in the areas of military, finance, technology and ideology is on.”

Investing.com – The euro fell sharply against the dollar Thursday as the European Central Bank kept rates on hold, but in a sign that another monetary policy bazooka looms, the bank said it would ""recalibrate"" its policy tools in December.
EUR/USD fell 0.77% to $1.1656.
""We agreed, all of us, that it was necessary to take action and therefore to recalibrate our instruments at our next Governing Council meeting,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference.
Lagarde in no uncertain terms expressed that the bank was looking at using ""all instruments,"" rather than just topping up the €1.35 trillion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, of PEPP, at its Dec. 10 meeting.
""We expect it to increase the volume of the PEPP bond purchase programme by 600 billion euros, to launch new TLTROs next year and probably to lower its deposit rate by 10 basis points,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The sense of urgency to deliver more easing at the end of the year has been exacerbated by a second wave of Covid-19 sweeping through Europe, forcing France and Germany, the two biggest eurozone economies, to re-impose lockdowns that will dent growth.  
Lagarde warned that risks to the euro area's recovery were ""clearly"" tilted to the downside, and suggested the pace of recovery or lack thereof would largely depend on how the economic bloc's efforts to contain the virus spread.
The central bank is in the midst of its review policy framework, but has expressed mixed views on adopting the Fed's new inflation measure, which allows prices to run above target over a period of time.
Lagarde said that while headline inflation would likely remain negative until early 2021, it is expected to gather pace over the medium term once the impact of COVID-19 subsides."
48,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's major state-owned banks have been swapping U.S. dollars for yuan this week, traders said on Thursday, suggesting monetary authorities are trying to rein in the sharply appreciating currency. 
Those operations in the onshore currency swap market have caused the value of the yuan to fall in the forwards market, tamping expectations that it will appreciate further and simultaneously making it more expensive for investors to borrow yuan. 
Two other traders told Reuters they saw big state banks buying dollars in the onshore spot market during late night trading sessions to effectively prevent the yuan from strengthening too fast. 
The yuan  has appreciated 7% against the dollar since the depths it hit in May, as China's rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and high-yielding markets draw foreign investor inflows.
Traders took the state banks' action as an official sign that the authorities might not want the Chinese currency to strengthen too much in a short period of time, hurting exports.
""The swap market actions, along with recent policy moves, were all meant to slow down the pace of yuan appreciation,"" said one of the traders. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has taken other measures recently to ease the pace of appreciation.
It lowered the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions when conducting some foreign exchange forwards trading to zero earlier this month..
On Tuesday, the PBOC's currency trading system suspended a counter-cyclical factor that local banks had been using to massage the value of the yuan's daily mid-point, effectively removing another tool routinely used to prevent depreciation. 
The swaps by the big state banks drove up the one-year premium on dollars  to as high as 1,700 points this week, implying a 2.5% decline over the next 12 months in the tightly managed yuan.
U.S. ELECTION RISK
State banks usually act on behalf of the central bank in the country's foreign exchange market, but they could also trade on their own behalf. 
This is not the first time that big state banks are using swaps to affect yuan expectations. They were active in yuan forwards multiple times in the previous two years, using swaps to curb dollar supply as authorities sought to slow the currency's depreciation.
Their swaps this week caused the onshore yuan to be priced weaker in forwards than its offshore counterpart  for the first time since February 2018, according to Refinitiv data.
Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, said next week's U.S. presidential elections posed big uncertainties for the outlook for the yuan, or renminbi.
The election outcome has a particularly strong resonance for China, which has endured higher trade tariffs and a hostile backdrop for its tech firms under U.S. President Donald Trump.
Analysts think a win for Democrat challenger Joe Biden, who is ahead in opinion polls, could mean more predictable trade policies.
Mizuho's Cheung said a surprise victory for Trump could reverse the yuan's gains, and the PBOC may not do more for the time being.

""At this stage, excessive policy measures to curb renminbi appreciation expectation could do more harm than good, with the back-and-forth FX policy stance causing market confusion,"" Cheung wrote.

49,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
The Turkish lira may be on course for its worst month since August 2018, fueling speculation that the central bank will once again turn to an outsized interest-rate hike to stem the rout.
Since the start of October, the currency has lost around 7% of its value against the dollar, a depreciation reminiscent of the meltdown two years ago that forced the central bank to jack up borrowing costs by 625 basis points.
Like then, the trigger is a cocktail of mounting geopolitical risks and concern that monetary policy remains far too loose to anchor the currency. Investors say if the losses aren’t contained, the central bank may ultimately have to take action before its next scheduled meeting on Nov. 19.
It wouldn’t be the first time. The central bank raised interest rates by 300 basis points in an emergency meeting in May 2018 to curb the lira’s losses, and more than doubled them in an unscheduled meeting in January 2014.
“There is no reason why the lira could not overshoot to a level such as 9.00 per dollar in coming weeks,” said Tatha Ghose, a senior economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) in London, adding that a large emergency rate hike might be the only policy response that could break the momentum.
The currency weakened as much as 1.6% to 8.3224 against the dollar Wednesday, extending by far the biggest decline in emerging markets this month. It was down 0.4% to 8.3016 per dollar as of 11:02 a.m. in Istanbul, set for a sixth day of declines.
The losses come after the central bank stunned investors by holding the one-week repo rate steady last week while increasing the late liquidity window, a marginal source of lending originally intended for emergency funding.
That marked a policy u-turn that quashed hopes the monetary authority was determined to tighten policy and curb inflation. In September, the central bank began reversing an easing cycle by unexpectedly raising interest rates by 200 basis points to 10.25%.
On Edge
For a market already on edge given diplomatic tussles over energy exploration in the Mediterranean, and a deepening rift between Ankara and its Western allies, last week’s decision was a decisive stroke. Further darkening the outlook, the central bank on Wednesday raised its inflation projections for the end of this year to 12.1%, from a previous forecast of 8.9%.
Amid the tumult, the central bank appeared to be leaving open the possibility for action.
“In the period ahead, we can take all the necessary steps, including on policy interest rates,” Governor Murat Uysal said in the central bank’s quarterly inflation briefing on Wednesday, noting that the lira was “extremely undervalued.”
While Uysal said the central bank wasn’t targeting an exchange rate, he warned that a weak lira poses risks to price stability and said the policy maker will maintain its tight monetary policy until inflation improves.
Yet that didn’t compel traders to scale back their bearish bets on the currency. One-month risk reversals -- a closely watched gauge of investor positioning and sentiment -- jumped to the highest level since early September after the comments.
“We think an emergency rate hike could come at any time as this sort of move in the lira is unsustainable,” Win Thin, the New York-based global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, wrote in a note.
No Panacea
But even a rate hike is no guarantee that the currency will recover lost ground.
While the lira rallied in the months that followed the surprise increases in September 2018, it still ended the year down almost 30%, the second-biggest loss in the developing world. Following an emergency increase in 2014, the currency ended the year 8% lower.
At the the heart of the issue is that investors remain uneasy about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s sway over monetary policy. He places a premium on growth and job creation and holds the unconventional view that lower rates cause lower inflation.
For its part, the central bank over the years has resorted to what the market calls stealth tightening -- raising borrowing costs and tweaking liquidity, but keeping headline rates steady. Last week, the central bank widened its so-called interest-rate corridor to give itself more flexibility in increasing the weighted-average cost of funding.
“The current interest rate regime aims to tighten in a temporary and oh very unconvincing way,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “The reality is people simply do not believe the CBRT’s prime focus is inflation; they think it is delivering growth, jobs and poll support for the ruling party.”

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trade Thursday, holding onto recent gains as new lockdowns in Europe to combat the surge in Covid-19 cases prompted demand for safe havens.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was flat at 93.403, having gained around 0.5% so far this week.
Concerns of further damage to the economic recovery have grown as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel returned their countries back into lockdown on Wednesday, after recording new record levels of cases in the second wave of the Covid-19 virus.
EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1746, after sliding to a one-week low of $1.1718 overnight, on speculation that the European Central Bank may move up additional stimulus - which many expect for December's meeting - to today's meeting.
“The case for even more ECB easing has strengthened further lately, but we still expect the central bank to wait until December with further easing,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
“What the ECB could do next week is to explicitly commit to a faster pace of purchases, or at the very least give clear signals that more easing will likely be in store in December. The latter step is more likely than the former, and should be enough to avoid a disappointment in financial markets,” the bank added.
It's also a heavy day for U.S. data, with the weekly report on jobless claims in focus. Third-quarter GDP will provide for more dramatic headlines, but the data has essentially been overtaken by the events of the last few weeks already.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was largely flat at 104.28, after the dollar dropped to its lowest level in more than a month against the safe-haven yen on Wednesday.
The Bank of Japan kept its key interest rates and asset purchases unchanged earlier Thursday, as widely expected. However, the central bank cut its growth forecast for the year ending in March to a 5.5% contraction from a 4.7% drop, citing a delayed recovery in the services sector.
GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3002, showing some strength as European Union and U.K. negotiators continue discussions over the trading arrangements between the two blocs, raising hopes that a Brexit deal could be reached by early November.

51,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 01:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan stood pat on policy but trimmed its economic forecast for the current year as rising waves of the coronavirus abroad cloud the recovery outlook and spark renewed nerves in markets.
The BOJ kept its key interest rates and asset purchases unchanged, according to a statement from the central bank Thursday. All but one of 43 surveyed economists forecast the result.
The bank cut its growth forecast for the year ending in March to a 5.5% contraction from a 4.7% drop, citing a delayed recovery in the services sector. It raised its growth projection for the following year to 3.6%. Amid renewed concern over the trajectory of the pandemic, it said the outlook for the economy was extremely unclear.
The decision to hold on policy likely reflects signs of a recovery from a record contraction as production and exports improve. Still, the BOJ stated its readiness to take further action if needed. Ramped-up asset buying has helped keep markets relatively stable while around $1 trillion in loan programs has ensured struggling firms can access credit rather than going bust.
A resurgence of the virus in the U.S. and Europe is increasing the risks for Japan’s export-reliant economy. A return to partial lockdowns in some parts of Europe and the prospect of an even more prolonged pandemic are helping fuel stock market falls and further yen gains.
The yen was trading largely unchanged at 104.48 against the dollar following the decision. The currency this week strengthened to a five-week high against the greenback amid concern over the impact of the worsening pandemic on global economic activity. The Nikkei 225 stock index was down around 0.4% after the start of the afternoon trading session, paring earlier losses.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“While the reflation effort is on the back burner for now, the central bank continues to face serious challenges, with the economy still struggling from the virus impact and recent readings on core inflation below zero.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

The decision comes just hours before the European Central Bank is set to deliver its own policy decision. The ECB is expected to hold fire, while signaling more stimulus in the works to combat the impact of the virus’s recent spread, though speculation is growing that it may move early.
While Japan has had far fewer virus cases than many other developed countries, the surge in Europe and the U.S. casts a shadow over the outlook.
“The BOJ is definitely keeping its guard high,” economist Hirofumi Suzuki at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Banking Corp. said before the BOJ decision. “There are so many uncertainties, from the impact of rising virus cases in Europe to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.”
While the number of bankruptcies is actually down from last year and the jobless rate has remained low at 3% for now, an increasing number of Japanese companies are showing signs of stress. Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Metals Ltd. said Tuesday it will cut 3,200 jobs. Airline ANA Holdings Inc. forecast its biggest-ever operating loss and reportedly plans to slash pay for 15,000 employees by 30%.
The pressure on companies will intensify if the pandemic intensifies and the timeline for containment lengthens.
On inflation, the bank trimmed its forecast for this fiscal year, citing the impact of government-sponsored discounts on travel packages to help regional economies and the tourism industry.
Inflation is running far below the BOJ’s 2% target, but the bank’s priorities now are keeping credit lines open to companies and maintaining market stability. The BOJ hasn’t announced any major new stimulus since April. Its virus-fighting measures include funding programs worth about $1 trillion and expanded asset purchases.

The currency declined as much 0.05%, the most since June 16, to 7.7536 versus the greenback. Ant has stopped taking orders from big investors after strong demand for its Hong Kong shares. The IPO had spurred inflows into the city in recent months, prompting repeated interventions from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to stop the currency from strengthening past the limit of its band against the greenback.
The local currency may weaken to 7.7550 after Ant starts trading, said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. “It’s inevitable that some capital would leave Hong Kong after Ant’s subscription for institutional investors finished,” he said.
Large-scale capital flight is unlikely, said Ong, because demand for Ant’s shares and future listings by other Chinese companies should support demand for the Hong Kong dollar, he said.
The local currency strength comes at a time when the city’s economy has been pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic. The unemployment rate has climbed to a 15-year high.
Short-term interbank rates fell, with the one-week Hong Kong dollar lending rate known as Hibor retreating 15 basis points, the most since August, to 0.48411%.
The HKMA has sold a total of HK$383.5 billion ($49.5 billion) of local dollars since April to defend its foreign-exchange peg. These moves have boosted the interbank liquidity pool to the largest level on record.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, with fears over fresh lockdowns implemented in Europe to curb the incessantly rising number of COVID-19 cases and the prospects for the region’s further economic recovery.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 93.418 by 9:59 PM ET (1:59 AM GMT), reversing earlier gains.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.18% to 104.47, after the dollar dropped to its lowest level in more than a month against the safe-haven yen on Wednesday. The Bank of Japan will announce its monetary policy later in the day and is widely expected to avoid changes to the current monetary settings.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.31% to 0.7066 and across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair was up 0.21% to 0.6650.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.15% to 6.7180. China is due to release details of its economic plans for the next five years later in the day. The Chinese Communist Party will also release a 15-year plan as it concludes four days of closed-door negotiations later in the day.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.11% to 1.2995.
Both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered fresh lockdowns in their respective countries on Wednesday to curb the second wave of COVID-19 cases hitting the region. However, worries grew about the measures’ impact on an already fragile economic recovery.
The euro was at a one-week low against the dollar overnight, when it also saw its weakest levels against the yen since July. Although the European Central Bank (ECB) is not expected to introduce new stimulus measures after its meeting later in the day, some investors were expectant that a path towards action in December is currently being paved.
“The euro can fall further if [ECB President] Christine Lagarde lays the groundwork for further policy easing at her post meeting press conference,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy said in a note.
Another event on investors’ minds is the U.S. presidential election, with the Nov. 3 date less than a week away as the country also faces an uptick in COVID-19 numbers.
Democrat candidate Joe Biden is comfortably ahead of incumbent president Donald Trump in the polls, with investors cautiously betting on a Democrat victory in both the White House and both chambers of Congress.
However, some investors warned that it was too early to tell.
“While Biden is taking the lead, Trump has been catching up in some parts of swing states … there is certainly a possibility of a higher volatility in the market if it becomes a closer battle, involving risks such as full results not being released [on election day,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
On the data side, the U.S. will release its third-quarter gross domestic product later in the day."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held gains against a basket of major currencies on Thursday as escalating coronavirus cases in Europe stoked fears across markets that fresh lockdowns would further hit the already fragile economic recovery.
The safe-haven greenback steadied against a basket of six currencies (=USD) at 93.41, taking a pause after its 0.3% gains in early trade.
Concerns of further damage to the economic recovery grew as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered their countries back into lockdown on Wednesday, as a massive second wave of coronavirus cases threatened to overwhelm Europe.
The euro (EUR=EBS) changed hands at $1.1753 after sliding to a one-week low of $1.1718 overnight. It also steadied against the Japanese yen (EURJPY=), last fetching 122.63 yen after hitting its weakest levels since July overnight.
Amid surging cases across Europe, the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday is expected to resist pressure to unveil new stimulus measures, but will likely pave the way for action in December.
""EUR can fall further if ECB President Christine Lagarde lays the ground work for further policy easing at her post meeting press conference,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy in a note. 
Traders also braced for volatility with the U.S election less than a week away, while the country, like Europe, also faces an increase in coronavirus infections. 
With former Vice President Joe Biden consistently leading in the polls over President Donald Trump, traders cautiously bet on his victory and a possible ""blue wave"" outcome, where Democrats control both chambers of Congress.
""While Biden is taking the lead, Trump has been catching up in some parts of swing states,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
""There is certainly a possibility of a higher volatility in the market if it becomes a closer battle, involving risks such as full results not being released (on the election day),"" he said.
Data due on Thursday includes U.S. third-quarter gross domestic product, which analysts expect to show record growth but not enough to make up for the pandemic impact.
The greenback steadied against the Japanese yen at 104.33 yen , having dropped to a more than one-month low on Wednesday. 
The Bank of Japan ends its two-day policy meeting later in the day and analysts expect the central bank to keep monetary settings unchanged.
The Australian dollar  drifted away from its near one-week low of $0.7038 marked overnight. It last sat at $0.7063.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar  edged higher against its U.S. counterpart, last up 0.27% to 0.6652.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar  held steady, last trading at 1.3308 against the greenback, after it fell to a three-week low overnight. 
The Bank of Canada said on Wednesday it expects interest rates to remain at current record lows until 2023 and reduced its weekly bond-buying programme.

LONDON (Reuters) - Equity and currency volatility shot higher on Wednesday and the cost of sourcing dollars rose, reflecting fears that the U.S. election and resurgent COVID-19 pandemic could tip markets back into the sort of chaos endured earlier this year.
A selloff in March wiped a third off the value of U.S. stock indexes (SPX) over a three-week period and the premium for cash dollars hit multi-year highs as the pandemic slammed markets and locked down economies.
Now, with less than a week to go before the U.S. presidential election, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases is forcing Germany and France to consider stringent new restrictions that will almost certainly damage Europe's faltering economic recovery.
Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and commodity research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said a double-whammy of the pandemic accelerating and an unclear election result could push volatility significantly higher.
""In the case of a very chaotic U.S. election outcome this might even come to or close to the level we saw in spring.""
Concerns were most strongly reflected in currency markets, especially in the implied volatility contracts derivatives traders use to protect investments against sudden swings in the exchange rate.
One-week euro and yen implied volatility against the dollar rose to their highest in nearly seven months  , nearly doubling from a day ago as the maturities now encompass election day on Nov. 3 and the day after. 
The euro also came under pressure in cash markets, weakening 0.6% versus the greenback (EUR=EBS), while U.S. and European stocks fell by 3% or more (STOXX) (SPX).
The election outcome has particularly strong resonance for China, which has endured higher trade tariffs and a hostile backdrop for its tech firms under U.S. President Donald Trump.
A win for Democrat challenger Joe Biden, who is currently ahead in opinion polls, would mean more predictable trade policies.
One-week offshore Chinese yuan volatility  traded at 10.950, the highest since Jan. 7, 2016.
""We've got so much uncertainty ahead,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank.
GRAPHIC: Currency swaps - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmjyjdpr/swaps.PNG 
LIQUIDITY SQUEEZE?
While a Biden win is widely viewed as dollar-negative, dollar swap markets, where traders outside the United States source the currency, suggest some investors are starting to hedge their bets.
Three-month euro-dollar swaps  rose to 18.5 basis points, close to a one-month high, reflecting investors' willingness to pay a greater premium for dollars. 
With central banks now providing ample liquidity support, reflected in money market funds and corporate balance sheets flush with cash, this week's market jitters are not indicative of an impending dollar shortage. 
But with economies under fresh pressure and European COVID deaths up 40% in the past week, investors are taking no chances and the VIX equity volatility gauge (VIX) is already close to its June highs.
""Investors are finding a reason to sell,"" said Chris Bailey, a strategist at Raymond James, noting the risk to growth and economic recovery from tricky U.S. stimulus negotiations, a surprise or disputed election outcome and renewed lockdown calls.

Investing.com – The euro fell against the dollar Wednesday, a day ahead of the European Central Bank meeting as fears the eurozone economy recovery is set to for a setback as Germany and France mull renewed lockdown measures to curb Covid-19 infections.
EUR/USD fell 0.37%, to $1.1751, though had hit an intraday low of $1.1718.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country would enter a four-week lockdown from Monday. Under the measures, the hospital sector is likely set to slow as bars, restaurants, gyms, and cinemas close, but schools, kindergartens and day care centers stay open.
France, which is already under curfew, is set to impose a nationwide lockdown starting Friday.
""Virus is circulating in France at a speed that even the most pessimistic forecast didn't foresee,"" Macron said in an address televised nationally. ""The measures we've taken have turned out to be insufficient to counter a wave that's affecting all Europe.""
Both Germany and France have seen a surge in the Covid-19 cases, with the latter expected to be experiencing 100,000 new cases per day, said Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, who is leading the country's virus response.
In the face of a second wave of the virus, the euro has remained somewhat resilient, still trading close to $1.20, as markets continue to bet the effect of the pandemic will be temporary.
""In our view, [the resilience in the euro] is partly because markets (and ourselves included) continue to stick to the glass-half-full view and consider the rise in Covid cases and the associated EZ slowdown as temporary,"" ING said.
The European Central Bank meeting on Thursday is unlikely to result in further easing, but the central bank could to lay out the welcome mat for more easing in December.
""[W]e think it is too early for specific measures to be announced at this meeting, but the guidance is likely to hint at more asset purchases (likely via the Public Sector Purchase Programme) to eventually come,"" ING said in a note..
The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.00%. 
ECB leader Christine Lagarde will deliver an update on the eurozone economy and policy following the release of the monetary policy statement. 
""Christine Lagarde could definitely present some hints. Even if some might argue that recent months have shown that the real communication action is no longer taking place at the press conference but in the blog entry the day after,"" ING added. "

The currency dropped 0.8% to 8.2560 per dollar as of 11:41 a.m. in Istanbul, bringing its retreat this year to 28%.
Disappointment that the central bank didn’t enact an interest-rate increase last Thursday has sent the lira to record lows every day this week. Rising Covid-19 infections, uncertainty over the U.S. election and stimulus, and mounting tensions with Europe have merely added to the negative backdrop.
‘Pain Threshold’ Nears for Lira as Erdogan Dials Up Rhetoric
With the currency in freefall, central bank Governor Murat Uysal revised up inflation forecasts during a presentation in Istanbul Wednesday. Inflation will end the year at 12.1%, up from a previous prediction of 8.9%. The country will still post positive growth this year, he said.
The lira is “extremely undervalued,” Uysal said. The country will still post positive growth this year, he said.
“There is no reason why the lira could not overshoot to a level such as 9.00 per dollar in coming weeks,” Tatha Ghose, a senior economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) in London, wrote in a report. “While rate hikes by the central bank would no longer act as a credible long-term policy response, we get the sense that a large emergency rate hike might be the only policy response we see in an attempt to break the momentum.”
Though the central bank unexpectedly held back from raising its one-week repo rate last week, it widened the interest-rate corridor to give itself more flexibility in increasing the weighted average cost of funding. State-run lenders have also sold more than $1 billion to support the currency so far this week, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public.
In a conference call with foreign investors on Tuesday, Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said multinational companies have already begun diverting production to Turkey, which he said is at a “turning point.” He ruled out capital controls.
“The new economic model proved itself by raising exports to the pre-pandemic level through production, investment, job opportunities and a competitive exchange rate,” state news agency Anadolu cited him as saying.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Wednesday, with traders turning away from riskier currencies given the current uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic as the U.S. presidential election draws near.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 93.138. EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1774, falling for the third consecutive session, while USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 104.19.
The dollar has seen some strength of late, with traders seeking out this safe haven as the virus spreads in Europe, Britain and the United States, fanning concerns that economic growth will weaken once again.
The euro has suffered lately from this move, not helped by the news that French President Emmanuel Macron is set to give a televised address on Wednesday evening, amid local reports that his government was leaning toward reinstating a national lockdown to curb a resurgence in coronavirus cases.
That said, trading ranges are becoming more limited as growing wariness about the U.S. presidential election is starting to limit large currency movements.
Polls show Democrat rival Joe Biden has a lead over Republican incumbent President Donald Trump, but many traders are nervous as the same polls failed to predict Trump's victory four years ago.
A tight result could lead to legal battles over potential voting irregularities, delaying the outcome of the election and creating more uncertainty, which would likely weigh on the dollar.
“Investors seem to be caught within the dichotomy of short-term (i.e. coming weeks) and medium-term (i.e. the 2021 view) outlooks,” said ING analyst Petr Krpata, in a research note. 
“The former suggests caution due to the rise in the pandemic in Europe and the risk of the U.S. election outcome,” he added, but ”the constructive medium-term outlook and the possibility of missing out (on the rally) suggest that, despite the bumpy ride ahead in coming weeks, periods of risk assets coming under pressure should be one-off and not long-lasting. This means a prolonged USD strengthening trend seems unlikely.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.3035, remaining above the physiologically-important 1.30 level, with European Union chief negotiator Michel Barnier talking again with his British counterpart as the two sides try to strike a last-minute trade agreement.
Sterling has been trading in a tight range of late, with “the next move in either direction (and the break of the range) coming from the eventual outcome of the negotiations, which are unlikely to materialise until mid-November,” ING’s Krpata said.
The Bank of Canada holds its latest rate-setting meeting later Wednesday, and is expected to hold its overnight interest rate at 0.25%, following its long-term commitment to keep interest rates at historic lows.
USD/CAD traded 0.1% higher at 1.3201.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Tuesday sold a record HK$31.8 billion ($4.1 billion) worth of local dollars to curb the currency’s strength. This will lift the interbank liquidity pool to almost HK$450 billion on Thursday, surpassing the previous high in 2015.
The de-facto central bank has stepped in 83 times this year to prevent the local currency from strengthening past its permitted trading range with the U.S. dollar. The pace of interventions has picked up recently, and October’s size will top HK$183 billion, the largest on record.
An elevated liquidity pool means interbank rates will likely remain steady despite massive demand for cash during large stock sales. Suppressed borrowing costs will also benefit local businesses struggling in the wake of last year’s protests in the city and the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the economy.
Ant’s initial public offering, month-end bank regulatory checks and demand for the Hong Kong government’s inflation-linked retail bonds -- or iBonds -- have helped increase demand for the local currency, said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank. “This situation will likely ease up once Ant’s IPO finishes in early November,” she said. “By then, some capital may leave Hong Kong, allowing the Hong Kong dollar to move away from its strong end to trade at around 7.75-7.76 per dollar.”
However, the aggregate balance could still have room to rise further in coming months, given the local dollar’s interest rate premium over the greenback and with further listings by Chinese firms in the pipeline, Li added.
The one-month Hong Kong dollar lending rate, known as Hibor, was at 0.41571% as of Tuesday, near a multiyear low. The Hong Kong dollar was little changed at 7.75 per U.S. dollar as of 11:02 a.m. Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar on Wednesday following a media report that France's government was leaning toward reinstating a national lockdown to curb a resurgence in coronavirus cases.
The dollar, however, gave up early gains against other major currencies as sentiment turned bearish due to uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. presidential election next week.

FOCUS ON U.S. ELECTIONS
Traders, however, say the bigger focus is on the United States, which is also struggling to contain the coronavirus as people vote early before elections on Nov. 3.
Domestic polls show Democrat rival Joe Biden has a lead over Republican incumbent President Donald Trump, but some investors are sceptical because the polls did not predict Trump's victory four years ago.
Legal battles between Republicans and Democrats over how to count votes have raised the risk that the outcome of the election will be disputed, which is a negative factor for the dollar, some analysts say.
Sentiment for the greenback has also weakened after Trump conceded that an additional round of U.S. fiscal stimulus is unlikely before the election.
The onshore yuan  fell to 6.7140 against the dollar, extending a pullback from a 27-month high hit last week as the People's Bank of China takes steps to curb the currency's appreciation.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, but investors are avoiding big moves and risks ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3. In Europe, reports that France could reintroduce a national lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 sent the Euro tumbling against the dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.22% to 93.127 by 10:05 PM ET (2:05 AM GMT). The euro was down against the dollar on Wednesday, a third consecutive trading session in the red for the single currency.
Despite its gains, sentiment for the greenback showed signs of turning bearish, with the election less than a week away. Some investors are prepping for increased volatility in the market over the second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the U.S threatening economic growth, and the uncertainty over the election outcome so keeping investors on tenterhooks.

But the focus remains on the U.S., which is also struggling with its own second wave.
U.S. polls show that Democrat candidate Joe Biden is ahead of incumbent President Donald Trump, but memories of Trump’s surprise victory four years ago has some investors wary of predicting the election outcome. The possibility of a disputed election as legal battles between the two parties over how to count the votes already cast continue, will be negative for the dollar.

The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.7130. The AUD’s gains were capped by data showing that Australia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 1.6% quarter-on-quarter during the previous quarter, higher than the 1.5% predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. The Reserve Bank of Australia is also tipped to announce lower interest rates and increased government debt purchases after its next meeting on Nov. 3.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Turkish lira's rapid decline in recent days has rung echoes of tumbles past such as the 2018 meltdown which pushed the country into an economic crisis and sent ripples through other emerging markets. 
After the lira broke through the threshold of 8 to the dollar on Monday, markets are trying to read the runes of how much further policy makers will let the lira slide with the currency having lost nearly 30% since the start of the year.
""It now feels very 2018 and the questions are now how low the lira can sink and when the CBRT will be forced to go, tail between its legs, to ask (President Tayyip) Erdogan for an emergency rate hike,"" said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management. 
""Is that at 8.50, or 9?""
Below are three charts illustrating economic and markets pressure points for Turkey, where the currency is enduring its eighth straight year of losses, having lost more than 80% of its value in the past decade.
DWINDLING RESERVES
Reserves are dwindling fast, and efforts to shore up the pressured lira have torn a sizeable hole in the central bank's war chest. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated that policy makers intervened to the tune of $16 billion in August alone. 
By traditional rules of thumb, reserves should cover the equivalent of three months of imports - Turkey is forecast to hit 2.6 by year-end. 
""Turkey’s import coverage by FX reserves is no longer adequate,"" Phoenix Kalen at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said in a recent note.

POLITICAL QUICKSAND
Syria, Libya, Nagorno Karabakh - Turkey's geopolitical tangles and affiliations have seen it at odds with one or the other major power at most times. 
The latest standoff between Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron over the treatment of Muslims has done little to soothe frayed nerves. And with Joe Biden on track to win the race for the White House, fresh sanctions could be adding to the pressure on Turkey's already strained markets. 
""If opinion polls are proved to be incorrect and President (Donald) Trump is re-elected on Nov. 3, this would bring the severely battered lira some respite following its precipitous fall,"" said RaboResearch's global head Jan Lambregts. ""However, as things stand, the lira is on the verge of a total meltdown.""

ROLLING OVER 
Turkey's external public debt burden is seen as manageable, but its companies and financial institutions face hefty repayments of around $13.3 billion in the last quarter of 2020. November is a key month for the country's financial institutions, which have $3.7 billion coming due. A weaker lira will add to the pressure on firms and financial institutions needing to roll over hard-currency debt. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ozDcb1)

63,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound looks poised for gains ahead of U.S elections, yet whether it can maintain momentum after the vote is still questionable.
Option risk reversals show traders are no longer bearish the U.K. currency over a one-week horizon, opening the way for an advance before the Nov. 3 vote in America. Behind the shift in this gauge of positioning and sentiment lies the latest progress in Brexit negotiations, and a bias in the market to sell the dollar in the run-up to the election.
Whether the currency manages to hit fresh highs or sustain gains thereafter, however, still depends largely on how negotiations between the U.K and the European Union pan out. The market’s overall risk appetite given uncertainty surrounding the pandemic will also prove key.
The pound drifted against the dollar on Tuesday, after bouncing back from the psychologically important $1.30 handle early in the session. According to traders in Europe, leveraged funds were fading the move lower, with institutional investors looking to add topside sterling exposure in the options space.
Charts are also working in cable’s favor. The currency remains within a bullish trend channel in both the short and medium term. Meanwhile, momentum gauges such as Bloomberg’s fear-and-greed indicator show bulls remain in control of price action.
But caution is still warranted. Sterling reached a six-week high of $1.3177 on Oct. 21, only to falter again as profit taking kicked in. Corporate selling on a hedging basis has also been a key element in this pullback, according to a trader in Europe familiar with the transactions who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly.
And the outlook further out into the future still remains murky. One-month risk-reversals remain in bearish territory for sterling as investors look for an official resolution in Brexit talks before turning bullish in the longer-term too.
According to Bloomberg’s option-pricing model, the chances of the pound trading 5% higher in six months time are slightly higher than the probability of an equivalent drop.

64,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A catalyst is emerging for the Canadian dollar that is gnawing at the central bank’s influence and potentially its monetary policy: the performance of global equities.
The loonie has traditionally been seen as a commodity-linked currency because of the country’s vast natural resources. But trillions of dollars of stimulus, along with interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have realigned those forces.
The one-year rolling correlation of the dollar-loonie to world equities is stronger than the pair’s relationship with base metals, crude oil and yield differentials, according to the Royal Bank of Canada. That means strategists may have to modify their models to better reflect global risk appetite. It also gives the BOC more leeway in policy without worrying about currency effects.
Investors “look at the world from a ‘risk on/risk off’ standpoint,” George Davis, strategist at RBC, said by email. They are “using equity markets as their main proxy for risk sentiment. So, the huge recovery in equities since late March has been accompanied by CAD appreciation. BOC policy is a very neutral factor at the moment.”
The loonie’s correlation to the MSCI World Index is around 84%, compared with about 43% in February. For oil, that level is now just under 40%, compared with 53% in February, while the relationship with the two-year Canada-U.S. swap spread is about 28%, after reaching 42% earlier this year, according to RBC data.
Swap spreads reflect the declining importance of the BOC’s policy rate. Earlier this year pre-Covid, at 1.75%, Canada had one of the highest rates among advanced economies helping drive the loonie’s price action. Having kept the rate at 0.25% since March, it’s a different story, and traders are wagering the central bank will leave its overnight rate unchanged again Wednesday and well into next year as the economy slowly rebounds.
U.S. Politics
With the BOC and commodities playing a lesser role, the loonie’s fate is increasingly tied to broader risk sentiment. All eyes are centered on the U.S. as the White House and Congressional leaders battle over a new round of fiscal stimulus that could fuel more demand for riskier assets. At the same time, opinion polls suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is likely to defeat President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, and a resounding win by Democrats could tip the balance toward more government spending.
“If your belief is that there’s a Biden victory in the cards and is positive for equities, be long loonie,” said John Velis, FX & macro Americas strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK). “What happens to the USD is what happens to CAD, and what happens to the USD is what happens with the equity market, which is itself a function of policy and political risk.”
Of course, there’s a flipside to the loonie’s new alliance. If the global economic recovery sputters or coronavirus cases continue to multiply without a break-through vaccine, stocks could take a turn for the worse. On Monday, the loonie weakened versus all Group-of-10 currency peers and stocks fell amid coronavirus flare-ups in Europe and as U.S. stimulus talks stalled.
Technically, the dollar-loonie pair has been consolidating for nearly two-months after falling from a year-to-date high of 1.4668 set in March to end Monday at 1.3212. Even after the uptick at the start of week, the pair remains below a descending trendline, currently 1.3288, where a close above that line would likely point to further gains. Moreover, a subsequent drop below the psychological 1.30 support level would suggest the pair is breaking out of its range and will likely breach its year-to-date low of 1.2957 nearby as a new trend forms.
“It is safe to say that the Canadian dollar is at the mercy of global risk sentiment at the moment,” said Simon Harvey, FX analyst at Monex Europe and Monex Canada.

65,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank has neutralized the counter-cyclical factor in its daily yuan midpoint fixing, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, in a move to let the fixing more closely reflect actual currency market moves.
The offshore yuan  slipped about 0.2% against the dollar to an almost two-week low of 6.7236 per dollar after Reuters reported the move.
The Chinese currency has strengthened against the dollar over recent months as foreign capital inflows have sped up and economic fundamentals have improved. The onshore yuan  has gained more than 6% against the dollar since late May.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has asked some of the 14 midpoint contributing banks to submit and adjust their models to better reflect flexibility in the exchange rate and let the currency become more market-driven, one of the sources said.
The counter-cyclical factor is the adjustment that contributing banks make to the daily trade-weighted reference rate that the PBOC uses to guide the yuan.
Some analysts said they were not surprised at the adjustment as the use of the counter-cyclical factor was meant to dampen depreciation pressure, and its effect has diminished recently due to recent yuan rallies.
""Given that there is no longer any depreciation concerns, it makes sense to do away with the counter-cyclical factor (CCF), and reducing the reserve requirement ratio as they have done a couple of weeks back,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, which is not a fixing contributor.
""This does not necessarily mean that they are seeking to actively weaken the yuan – it is just that those tools are no longer needed.""
Goh added that economic fundamentals were still in favour of the Chinese currency, and yield differentials between China and other major economies should continue to attract capital inflow to support the local currency.
The PBOC could not be immediately reached for comment outside of business hours.
The central bank lowered the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions when conducting some foreign exchange forwards trading to zero earlier this month.
China first introduced the counter-cyclical factor in 2017 in what regulators said was an effort to better reflect market supply and demand, lessen possible ""herd effects"" in the market and help guide the market to focus more on macroeconomic fundamentals.

It has since adjusted its methodology a number of times to cope with market conditions and keep the currency stable.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, handing back some recent gains, although activity is starting to weaken as the U.S. presidential election draws near.
At 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.985, after posting gains Monday on the back of increasingly negative news surrounding the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1820, USD/JPY was largely flat at 104.80, while USD/CNY was flat at 6.7110.
The number of Covid-19 cases has now reached over 43 million cases globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with a number of countries, including the U.S., Russia and France, all setting new records with tens of thousands of new daily coronavirus infections this week.
However, trading ranges are becoming more limited as growing wariness about the U.S. presidential election is starting to limit large currency movements. With a week remaining, polls are giving Democrat candidate Joe Biden a solid lead over President Donald Trump nationally, albeit only a narrow one in certain key swing states.
“Almost everyone already agrees that Biden will win and THE consensus trade ahead of such a Biden victory is probably to be short USD/CNY. Biden’s less aggressive policy stance on China has been front-run, why it may make sense to expect some profit-taking on such a view should Biden actually win,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was unchanged at 1.3023, remaining above the 1.30 level, with Brexit talks, which resumed last Thursday, extended to Wednesday.
“As negotiations are now set to extend for a few more weeks, GBP is temporarily navigating some calmer waters, but as soon as the new deadlines approach and GBP volatility peaks up again, a neutral positioning is yet another factor adding to the downside-skewed balance of risks for the over-complacent sterling,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
Also, USD/TRY rose 0.7% to 8.1309, continuing to rise above the psychologically-important 8.0 level, despite Turkey’s banking regulator taking another step to slow lending a in try and stop the lira’s rout.
The regulator said late Monday that banks will be able include foreign-currency loans extended to other local lenders for one year when calculating their asset ratio, making it easier for them to meet the requirement.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar handed back some recent gains against most of its major rivals on Tuesday, as strong regional economic data helped to offset worries about a second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose for a fifth straight month in September and South Korea's economy roared back to growth, official data showed.
That supported the yuan  and sent the won  soaring close to a seven-month peak. It also unwound some of the previous day's modest dollar gains against major currencies amid an equities selloff driven by a resurgence in coronavirus infections.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar fell 0.1% (=USD). It was lower by about the same margin on the euro, yen and pound and it slipped a little bit further against the Aussie and kiwi. 
""Trade numbers in Asia have been improving. Most countries are now reporting positive year-on-year export growth. For now, that is helping to offset nervousness about the COVID outbreaks in Europe,"" said ANZ's head of Asia research Khoon Goh.
""It's the export-oriented currencies that are outperforming in Asia,"" he said. The Canadian dollar  also recovered some of Monday's selloff as the price of oil stabilised.
Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist at Maybank in Singapore, said the region's firm handle on the coronavirus, especially in North Asia, was also a positive factor, with Japan, Singapore, South Korea and China combined posting fewer than a thousand new cases a day through October.
That compares with the United States, Russia and France, all of which hit fresh records with tens of thousands of new daily coronavirus infections this week.
Europe needs a ""serious acceleration"" in the fight against the coronavirus, with the spectre of further shutdowns looming, a top World Health Organization official said on Monday.
POLL POSITION 
Growing wariness about the U.S. presidential election kept a lid on large currency movements, however. Since the vote is just a week away many investors appear to have already figured out their positions.
Data shows long bets on the yen shrank for a fourth straight week last week, as investors wagered on a victory for Democrat Joe Biden, though short bets against the yen also fell - pointing to heightened uncertainty around the vote. 
""People are wary of putting on fresh positions given the event risk,"" said Mayank Mishra, an FX strategist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank in Singapore. ""Price action over the next one week may remain choppy,"" he said.
""The view we've taken is that the medium-term dollar bearish dynamics remain in place, irrespective of who comes to the White House. The short-term part may be affected by the outcome, and we believe that a Biden win is likely to accelerate the dollar downside.""
If the Democrats also secure the Senate, a Biden-led administration is likely to press for a larger coronavirus aid package, lifting sentiment, widening the U.S. current account deficit and weakening the dollar.
Ahead on Tuesday, investors are looking to U.S. consumer confidence figures and the Richmond Fed manufacturing index at 1400 GMT, as well as the progress of the virus in Europe and the United States. 

Elsewhere, the Taiwan dollar  rose by as much as 1% in Asia to a more than nine-year high. The Turkish lira  hit a record low on Monday amid a slew of geopolitical concerns and as a surprise central bank decision to keep its policy rate on hold last week reveberates through markets.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning, giving up earlier gains. Tensions between the U.S. and China are rising and these concerns, along with continuing worries over the second wave of COVID-19, drove the steepest stocks selloff in a month and a bond rally.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, edged down 0.11% to 92.942 by 10:31 AM ET (2:31 AM GMT).
On the COVID-19 front, the U.S., Russia and France all set new records for the number of daily COVID-19 cases. There are over 43.4 million cases globally as of Oct. 27, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Some investors were wary of the dollar’s prospects ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
“The dollar is broadly stronger, but not massively,” with structural forces such as low real yields holding back further gains adding to the wait-and-see approach to the election, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
“I think many would probably remember the bad experiences we had going into the Trump-Clinton election [in 2016] … if you had a position on [the election], you would have been whipsawed big time. I think the strategy this time is to travel light, and to choose the opportunity on the day rather than take on a very, very strong position going into the election,” Catril added.
With a week remaining, although polls are giving Democrat candidate Joe Biden a solid lead over President Donald Trump, both men were engaging in some last-minute campaigning in battleground states where the race is tighter.
Some investors view a Biden victory, especially if combined with a Democrat Senate, as negative for the greenback as the Democrats are expected to introduce stimulus measures with big price tags to combat COVID-19, which is expected to improve investor sentiment and boost riskier currencies.
Investors are already starting to bet on a Biden victory, with positioning data showing long bets on the safe-haven yen shrinking for a fourth consecutive week. But a fall in short bets against the yen pointed to increased uncertainty about the election’s outcome.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.10% to 104.71.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.12% to 6.7038. U.S.-China tensions mounted over a potential $2.4 billion sale of U.S. anti-ship missiles to Taiwan, potentially encompassing as many as 100 Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems built by Boeing (NYSE:BA). The systems in turn include up to 400 land-based missiles. China reacted to the news by slapping sanctions on U.S. companies, including  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Boeing Defense and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) “in order to uphold national interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party will set the nation’s next five-year plan within the week.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.7134 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.1% to 0.6690. The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.10% to 1.3037."
69,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest money manager is shorting the dollar on expectations that unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus will prolong its losses -- regardless of who wins the U.S. election.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). holds a “modest” short in the greenback against the likes of the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Indonesia rupiah, said Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit in Singapore. The three Asian nations are among those best positioned to benefit from a weakening dollar as investors seek out higher-yielding assets and growth.
“My base case is that we still have at least one- to three years of more moderate dollar weakness on the cards -- that’s not going to change,” Seth said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Regardless of the election outcome, some of the policy actions have already happened.”
The $7.3 trillion giant joins global peers including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and UBS Asset Management that favor selling the dollar with just a week to election day. On Monday, BlackRock strategists downgraded their views on Treasuries on growing likelihood of significant fiscal expansion under a unified Democratic government.
A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar has fallen over 1% this month as Joe Biden extended his lead in polls over President Donald Trump. The yuan has risen 1.3% against the dollar, Indonesia’s rupiah has gained 1.6% while India’s rupee is little changed.
The downtrend in the greenback may see a “temporary pause” depending on the election outcome, but its weakness is likely entrenched over the long term, said Seth.
“The dollar still is on the expensive side from a fundamental standpoint,” he said. “I don’t think that direction reverses or changes because of elections.”
Here some comments from Seth on other asset classes:
Credit Bets
There are three broad areas in Asia which look appealing -- high yield, China credit and private credit. Asian high yield overall looks attractive on both a relative and absolute basis compared to U.S. or Europe. We are also looking at illiquid opportunities in countries where there is a shortage of credit, but reasonable growth potential.
Asia Rates
In Indonesia, we do like the intermediate part of the curve so maybe toward the 10-year. In the case of China the positioning is broader so it is across government bonds, banks, higher quality state-owned enterprises, some local government and credit exposure. For India, it’s more toward the five-to-seven year part of the curve.
Downside Hedges
Rather than take a lot of duration risk at these levels in U.S. Treasuries, we are trying to overall look at portfolio structures, portfolio beta and cash levels. Nothing stands out cheap when you think of hedges today. Depending on the mandate and portfolio, we do look at a combination of CDS or equity options or FX for that matter as potential ways to hedge downside.
India Opportunities
We have a cautious and selective view in terms of our positioning in India given that the rebound after Covid shock is still at a very early stage. We do see the central bank potentially having room to ease further as we go into the next quarter. The gap in the on-shore credit markets provides some interesting investing opportunities for global investors. Especially in the illiquid space, we do see India actually providing fairly good opportunities along with China.

70,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The lira’s latest swoon is offering the clearest evidence yet that the Turkish central bank last week missed an opportunity to restore its credibility in the eyes of traders.
Though the currency’s unprecedented slide through 8 per dollar on Monday came amid a flurry of negatives for risk assets, the biggest concern for investors remains the central bank’s reluctance to deliver a decisive interest-rate increase that would confirm its commitment to stemming the lira’s depreciation.
“The central bank has only itself to blame for today’s decline in the lira,” said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors in London. “Central banks reap what they sow. The central bank sowed confusion and policy uncertainty last week and they’re now reaping yet another major currency selloff.”
The lira fell as much as 1.7% to 8.0984 per U.S. dollar and traded down 1.4% as of 6:49 p.m. in Istanbul. That was the biggest decline among emerging-market currencies Monday and extended a nine-week streak of depreciation, its longest rout since 1999. The benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index fell 3.9%.
Turkey’s central bank rattled investors last week by unexpectedly keeping rates on hold, a move that halted a brief recovery in the currency ahead of the decision. The regulator has already spent foreign-exchange reserves faster than any other major developing economy to try to support the lira. Foreign investors sold $13.3 billion of Turkish equities and bonds this year, the most since at least 2005.
“It’s like Groundhog Day Turkish style,” said Tim Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “A repeat of 2018. The central bank seems to never learn. It failed to listen to the market by not hiking rates last week and is now suffering the consequences.”
Foreign-investor interest in Turkish assets is being additionally sapped by a string of geopolitical risks. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government faces possible U.S. sanctions over the purchase of a missile system from Russia and is engaged in territorial disputes in the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus.
Currency Sales
Government-owned lenders sold at least $800 million on Monday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. State banks don’t comment on interventions in the foreign-exchange market.
Diplomatic spats aren’t helping. On Sunday, President Erdogan challenged the U.S. to sanction the country over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defense systems. He also stepped up criticism of Europe’s treatment of Muslims, repeating an attack on his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron by suggesting he needed psychiatric help. He called on Turkish people to boycott French goods on Monday.
“The fallout with France, with Erdogan effectively suggesting that Macron needs therapy, is not a good way to win international friends and influence people, nor is it the kind of thing that investors in the lira like to hear,” Rendell said.
The lira has lost more than 25% this year, the worst-performing currency in emerging markets after the Brazilian real.

Investing.com – The pound held steady against the dollar on Monday, shrugging off renewed demand for the safe-haven greenback on expectations the U.K. and EU will eventually reach a Brexit deal after both sides agreed to push out the deadline to reach a consensus. 
GBP/USD fell 0.13% to $1.3024.
Brexit talks, which resumed last Thursday, were extended to Wednesday, when EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to attempt to bridge some of the divide between the U.K. and EU.
Ahead of the talks, Barnier’s effort to clinch a deal could receive a boost on hopes German Chancellor Angela Merkel may be able persuade French President Emmanuel Macron to ease his stance on the key sticking point of fishing rights.
Britain has stressed that it prefers to take control over access to its waters, when the Brexit transition period ends. Macron, however, fears that a softer stance on fisheries could see French fishermen sacrificed.
The optimism on progress this week had been tempered somewhat following reports the U.K. is waiting until after the U.S. election to reveal its negotiation strategy as a Joe Biden victory could weaken Britain’s negotiation stance. Biden had previously stressed that a U.K.-U.S. deal would depend on Britain securing a deal with the EU.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, however, said Brexit and the U.S. election result were “entirely separate,” according to U.K. media reports.  "

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Monday, with record numbers of Covid-19 cases in Europe and the U.S., coupled with doubts about a new U.S. stimulus package, prompting traders to turn their back on riskier currencies in favor of safe havens.
At 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.972, after dropping almost 1% last week. EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1831, while USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 104.88.
The coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in Europe and the U.S., with both France and America recording a record number of cases over the weekend.  Spain has announced a new state of emergency and Italy has ordered restaurants and bars to shut by early evening. 
In the U.S., there are few signs of a compromise resulting in a new coronavirus relief bill making its way through Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows accused each other of “moving the goalposts” on stimulus legislation in interviews on Sunday, suggesting a new bill before next week’s election is very unlikely. 
This week will also see three major central banks hold meetings, as well as economic growth data for both Europe and the U.S.. 
The Bank of Canada and Bank of Japan are expected to hold fire for now, and so most eyes will be on the European Central Bank, in the wake of hints from senior officials that they see an emerging need for more action.
Additionally, data due out Thursday is forecast to show U.S. economic output rebounded by 31.9% in the third quarter, while third-quarter eurozone GDP data should also see a strong rebound after the 11.8% drop in the second quarter.
“With regard to the ECB, our team expects a strongly dovish message from President Lagarde and plenty of hints about more QE in December,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
ING is looking for third-quarter eurozone GDP to jump 9.5% on the quarter, but this could prove the high point with lockdowns in Europe broadening by the day.
“This all means that EUR/USD will probably continue to roughly trade a 1.17-1.19 range, rather than pushing on above 1.20 just yet,” ING added.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.3004, but has remained above the 1.30 level amid hope for a trade deal between Britain and Europe. Sentiment was helped by S&P keeping its rating and outlook on U.K. sovereign debt unchanged late on Friday.
Also, USD/TRY rose over 1% to 8.0640, rising above the psychologically-important 8.0 level, extending its slide from Friday after the country’s central bank decided not to lift interest rates to protect the currency, as expected.
The currency has been hit hard by low real rates given inflationary pressures as well as uprisings in the eastern Mediterranean and Caucasus and economic damage from the pandemic.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar found support on Monday, as surging coronavirus cases in Europe and the United States and a lack of progress toward a U.S. stimulus package put traders in a cautious mood, although hopes for a Brexit trade deal held sterling steady.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the greenback trod water in the Asia session, after having fallen broadly last week. Against the risk-sensitive Australian dollar and against the euro it gained about 0.2%.
Sterling , however, held firm at $1.3024. 
The United States has recorded its highest ever number of new COVID-19 cases for two consecutive days and so has France. Spain announced a new state of emergency and Italy has ordered restaurants and bars to shut by 6 p.m.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that she expected a White House response on Monday regarding the latest stimulus spending plan, but there have been few tangible signs that a long-stalled deal is actually nearer.
""The combination of receding hopes for a pre-election fiscal deal and the news on COVID and potentially stricter lockdowns is enough to take a bite out of the stock market,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
He said half-percent dip in S&P 500 futures (ESc1) had spilled over into currency markets, where traders are also in a cautious mood ahead of the U.S. election on Nov. 3.
The Japanese yen  slipped a fraction on the firmer dollar to 104.85 per dollar and other Asian currencies also traded a touch lower.
Hopes for a breakthrough in the trade-deal stalemate between Britain and Europe held the pound steady above $1.30.
Over the weekend, Britain's Northern Island minister said there was a good chance of a trade deal.
BLUE WAVES AND CENBANKS
The week ahead holds three major central bank meetings and the final sprint to the polls in the United States.
The Bank of Canada and Bank of Japan are expected to hold fire for now, while the market assumes the European Central Bank will sound cautious on inflation and growth, even if it skips a further easing on Thursday.
""The risk is that ECB President Christine Lagarde strikes a dovish tone during her post-meeting press conference,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso.
""If President Lagarde emphasises the downside risks facing the Eurozone economy, the counter-cyclical dollar can rise.""
Analysts also reckon that a Joe Biden victory next week, especially if the Democrats win control of the Senate, would likely herald a large U.S. stimulus package. But investors are treading carefully.
""I think that the dollar is now as polarised as it gets,"" said Diego Parrilla, chief investment officer of Quadriga Igneo, a fund designed to profit in market turmoil.
""On the one hand, we have a very clear will from the Fed and the U.S. government to print and borrow their way out of the problem,"" he said, weakening the outlook for the dollar.
""But it's almost like the more consensus you get and the bigger the position, you will see also big reversals, and my personal view is that the dollar remains a good thing to own during periods of stress.""
Elsewhere, China's top leaders chart the country's economic course for 2021-2025 at a key meeting starting on Monday, and may adopt a lower or more flexible growth target.
The yuan , which has soared more than 7% since May as China has led the world's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, edged lower with the broader mood to 6.6852 per dollar. 

Later on Monday, investors are watching for a German sentiment survey at 0900 GMT, following a robust Purchasing Managers' Index figure last week, and U.S. housing data, due at 1400 GMT.

Investing.com – The dollar fell Friday and is set for a weekly loss, with experts suggesting a reprieve for the greenback is unlikely, as a disappointment over stimulus may not send investors rushing into the world reserve currency.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.22%, to 92.75.
“Overall, we’re neutral to slightly negative on the dollar this week and believe investors can weather news that a US stimulus bill may not be forthcoming ahead of the election,” Dutch bank ING said in a note. 
The bank also suggested that a bullish round of economic data in the coming week will ease fears of a double-dip recession, dealing another blow to safe-haven demand in the greenback. 
Third-quarter GDP, expected to show a huge 35% quarter-on-quarter annualized bounce, and fresh insights on U.S. consumer confidence and durable goods orders will ""not be supporting double dip fears just yet,” the Dutch bank said.
The dollar has also been weighed down by losses against the Chinese renminbi amid positive flows in China and upbeat economic data. The USD/CNY decline could likely continue as there will likely be much interest in China’s 14th Five Year plan – leaders meet October 26-29 – which could “prompt more flows into Chinese asset markets,” it added."

The IHS Markit flash composite index of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers increased to 55.5 from 54.3, the group reported Friday. Readings above 50 indicate growth and the figure stands in contrast to the euro area, where the gauge contracted for the first time in four months. In Japan, business activity contracted for a ninth month.
“The U.S. economy looks to have started the fourth quarter on a strong footing,” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. “More encouragingly, business optimism surged higher, indicating that firms have become increasingly positive about prospects for the coming year” on a further easing of virus-related restrictions on business, more certainty after the election and hopes for more fiscal stimulus.
The composite index of future activity increased to the highest level since May 2018.
The IHS Markit’s flash services PMI rose by 1.4 points to 56 in October, also a 20-month high and a gauge of business expectations jumped by the most in more than a decade. The group’s manufacturing index edged up to 53.3, the fourth straight month of expansion and the highest since January 2019.
Despite the faster expansion in activity overall, measures of employment growth moderated at both service providers and manufacturers.

78,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s battle to control its currency is upending South America’s second-largest economy, wreaking havoc on everything from household finances to the production and sale of common goods.
Measures including taxes on greenback purchases and demands that some companies restructure their dollar-denominated debts have misfired, propelling the gap between the official and the black market exchange rates to the widest since 1989 while failing to boost international reserves. Some analysts warn a large devaluation may be on the horizon despite President Alberto Fernandez’s public opposition to the idea.
Controls on the peso and increased money printing are adding to the coronavirus pandemic and amplifying existing economic problems such as a three-year recession and one of Latin America’s fastest inflation rates, all while stirring memories of past crises.
“You can’t de-dollarize the mentality of a nation simply by cutting its access to dollars,” said Adriana Dupita, Latin America economist at Bloomberg Economics. “Rather, the only way to convince agents to think in peso terms is to have policies that make the currency credible. So far, we are yet to see those policies.”
Here are some examples of how a dysfunctional currency is complicating the day-to-day lives of Argentines:
1. What’s a Peso Worth?
Parallel exchange rates are making life impossible for local businesses, hindering their ability to plan and creating a daily headache of discerning how much the peso is worth. For Lucas Frascoli, the owner of the bicycle manufacturer Fad Bikes in the outskirts of Rosario, any change in the official rate immediately impacts steel pipe prices. On top of that, some suppliers work with prices tied to an intermediate level between the official peso and the black market rate.
“My suppliers send open bills with the quantity of products but with no prices. The day they send the products, I get to know the price, and then I pay immediately,” he said. “I have new prices every single week.”
2. No One Wants Pesos
The widening gap between the official and the parallel exchange rates is stoking consumer fears that a large devaluation is coming. Meanwhile, annual inflation running near 40% adds to the sensation that the local currency is losing value fast.
As a result, many common Argentines rush to unload their pesos at all cost. “Nobody wants pesos, so clients don’t care anymore about the prices. They just buy,” said Pablo Gaytan, co-owner of Corralon Ciudadela, a local business in the province of Buenos Aires that sells construction materials. A shortage of supplies amid a strict coronavirus lockdown has also added to the uncertainty, he said.
3. Import Shortages
The government has clamped down on imports to prevent dollars from flowing out of the country, leading to shortages of key goods from abroad. In the case of Edgardo Guerrini, who owns Guerrini Neumaticos SA, the administration has not granted him authorization to purchase vehicle tires from Asia for the last two months. As a result, he has no inventory to distribute from the province of Mendoza to a network of more than 600 shops nationwide.
The domestic food market is another sector hit hard by the restrictions, according to Pablo Ricatti, who runs a company that makes rolls for burgers and hot dogs. “There is a shortage of products that have some imported components, such as mustard,” Ricatti said.
4. Real Estate Woes
While it’s been standard practice to sell Argentine properties in U.S. dollars, some owners have started to price rents in greenbacks, too. Still, the lack of trust in the direction of the peso makes it difficult to determine future housing costs, especially as capital controls force Argentines to use the black market to buy the dollars or agree to pay in pesos based on the informal currency rate.
“Permanent and temporary rentals are being dollarized in some locations and for some consumers in top segments,” said Jose Rozados, director of real estate consultancy Reporte Inmobiliario. “It’s very hard for the household owner to forecast prices with this volatility.”
 "
79,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Times are tough at SeaWorld (NYSE:SEAS), home of killer whales and bottlenose dolphins. But they’re even tougher at GeckoParx, a few hours down the Florida Turnpike.
Both amusement parks were forced to close temporarily when the coronavirus pandemic struck. Despite setback after setback, SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  — a publicly traded corporation — easily secured something that every business needs: credit. It borrowed almost $730 million in the capital markets. And smaller GeckoParx? It’s shutting its doors after burning through nearly all of its money.
The gulf between big companies that have ready access to credit and just about everyone else got wider in the fallout of the Covid-19 crisis, as the Federal Reserve blew open capital markets and pledged to keep interest rates low as long as needed. Bond markets are rarely an option for the likes of GeckoParx, with its 40,000 square feet of trampolines, ninja courses and arcades.
Even federal relief programs for small businesses — including a $525 billion lifeline that initially kept millions afloat — have often benefited the largest of small companies, those with established banking relationships. GeckoParx couldn’t hold on even with government help.
“I am at a point right now where I am just putting my hands up and walking out the door,” said John Duran, who founded GeckoParx in 2017 after over two decades of running family-entertainment businesses. “They didn’t even give us a chance to fight.”
The divide over access to corporate credit —  who can get it, and who can’t — is likely to deepen. And what is happening in the business world is also happening at the household level: Americans with solid incomes and good credit are getting loans, while many others are getting turned away. The sharp line between these haves and have-nots, some economists predict, could be one of the lasting consequences of the pandemic economy.
“It’s absolutely unambiguous that monetary policy has increased wealth inequalities,” Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University, said on Bloomberg Television. “Those at the bottom are having a very hard time.”
The fallout on the fragile recovery and labor markets will play out in the next few months. Small businesses employ almost half of the country’s private-sector workforce and have contributed about two-thirds of net employment gains in recent years. They so far have proved more resilient than feared thanks in part to Paycheck Protection Program government-backed loans. But the aid ended in August without reaching some of the tiniest and most vulnerable firms, especially those owned by minorities. Prospects for more stimulus before the Nov. 3 presidential election remain uncertain.
By one estimate, the number of U.S. small businesses has dropped by almost a quarter compared with January. That’s fueling concerns that large companies, some enriched by the pandemic’s impact, will move in to fill the void.
Personal Toll
Before mid-March, GeckoParx was a successful business, pulling in $2.1 million in annual revenue, with a profit margin of almost 39%.
After being snubbed by several banks at the onset of the crisis, owner Duran received $32,700 from the Paycheck Protection Program and about $150,000 through the Economic Injury Disaster Loans, a separate federal initiative for small businesses. It wasn’t enough to cover the monthly rent and other fixed costs such as utilities and insurance. Two eviction notices followed, and Duran’s landlord personally sued him for almost $300,000 last month.
After a short trip to bankruptcy court, the 50-year-old entrepreneur has decided to close his park for good. Moreover, the house where he lives with his wife and two kids is now up for sale.
The personal toll is mounting for many other business owners across the country.
Take Tim Smith, 60, who owns vinyl-record store Papa Jazz in Columbia, South Carolina. He got a $26,600 PPP loan to help when business dropped as much as 65% at the peak of the crisis, but still had to dock his own salary to keep going. Or Dena Paolino, 55, the owner of an all-female boxing gym, Striking Beauties, in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, who couldn’t get a PPP loan and has used her personal stimulus check to keep her business afloat.
After using almost all the money they got through the PPP to keep their staff on payroll, Darlene and Mike Moore closed their southern-style restaurant in downtown Asheville, North Carolina, in mid-September, just under three years after opening.
“We knew we weren’t going to be able to sustain ourselves,” Darlene, 41 and a mother of two, said. “It became too much to endure.”
The PPP, part of an unprecedented stimulus package passed by Congress in March in response to the pandemic, was always meant as a short-term stopgap for firms with fewer than 500 employees, primarily to keep workers employed. After a rocky start, the PPP reached hundreds of thousands of truly small companies by the time it closed to new applications on Aug. 8. But many more were left behind, rejected by lenders or daunted by burdensome and often confusing rules to get the loans converted into grants.
Even if lawmakers extend the expired PPP to allow recipients to get a second loan, it won’t be enough to help those who never got one in the first place, said advocacy group Small Business Majority.
‘Bizarre Economy’
By contrast, the Fed’s action benefited all types of borrowers, as long as they were big enough to issue bonds.
One of the peculiarities of the Covid-19 crisis is the divide created between bigger and smaller firms, said Robert Bartlett, a professor of law and faculty co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Business. The Fed’s effort to add liquidity to the system allowed both investment-grade and junk-rated companies to access financing, while smaller firms were left with tighter credit markets, he said.
“It’s all part of this bizarre economy,” Bartlett said. “For some people, it’s record-setting highs, but desperation for others.”
The Fed announced its plan to directly purchase corporate bonds in late March, and expanded it to include some junk-rated debt in early April. The mere announcements sparked a rally so broad that junk-rated borrowers were able to hit the market before the Fed had bought a single corporate bond.
Among them was SeaWorld, which was already troubled before the pandemic forced it to temporarily close all of its 12 parks. About a month after the Fed’s announcement the Orlando-based company had sold  $227.5 million of bonds.
In July, SeaWorld made another trip to the bond market, announcing its offer on the same day it disclosed a 96% drop in second-quarter preliminary revenue compared with a year earlier. The bond attracted so much demand that the deal was increased by $100 million to $500 million.
“The pandemic has unquestionably affected businesses of all sizes in the travel, tourism, hospitality and entertainment industries including SeaWorld,’’ the company said in an emailed statement. “We have made difficult but necessary decisions to shore up our balance sheet using available resources to put the company in the best possible position to continue to contribute to our nation’s recovery.”
But the booming debt market also bolstered the fortunes of businesses that got a boost from the pandemic.
Western Global Airlines LLC, a seven-year-old air carrier with about 400 employees that serves clients such as  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., picked up new orders as passenger airlines cut their cargo capacity and consumers flocked to online shopping.
The Estero, Florida-based company raised about $400 million in the corporate bond market. The borrowing did not come cheap at an interest rate of over 10%, but it let the co-founders and other shareholders cash out a minority stake in the company.
Western Global also received plenty of support from the government: $8.2 million via a PPP loan in April and $34.8 million starting in June through a program for the aviation industry run by the U.S. Treasury.
Western Global didn’t respond to a request for comment.
When asked for comment for the story, a Fed representative referred to an Oct. 20 speech by Daleep Singh, executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Singh said the Fed's $13 billion of corporate bond purchases helped firms maintain jobs and prevented defaults. Companies that accessed the bond markets since March employ more than 16 million people, he said. The Small Business Administration declined to comment.
Widening Gap
Any concentration in market power could exacerbate disturbing trends in the U.S. economy that already emerged as a result of a decline in competition, according to an August paper by two Federal Reserve Board economists. They identified deepening inequality and financial instability as a result of larger firms controlling more of their markets.
A study published by the New York Fed in August found that Black-owned firms have been almost twice as likely to shutter during the pandemic compared to all others. About 41% of Black- and Latino-owned business said they won’t make it through the next few months without additional financial support, according to a Small Business Majority survey released on Oct. 20.
Entrepreneurs are a resilient bunch, and data show that Americans have created new businesses in surprisingly high numbers in the third quarter. It remains unclear how many will take off.
Frank Knapp, 68, whose family owns a dog-boarding business in Columbia, South Carolina, got PPP relief money in a second round to help stay afloat, after his local bank at first refused because it wasn’t comfortable with the program and risks. He worries small businesses that go away will simply be replaced by larger competitors.
“The customers they were serving aren’t doing without,” Knapp said. “They are going to get their service from a bigger business that survived.”

80,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The resurgence of the coronavirus has knocked Europe’s economic recovery back a step and raised the possibility of another contraction.
IHS Markit’s monthly measure of business activity fell to a four-month low of 49.4 in October from 50.4 in September. Within the report is a clear, divergent trend of manufacturing strength being offset by damage to services from the second wave of the pandemic.
New government curbs as well as consumer fears of the virus are driving the two-speed economy. In Paris and eight other major French cities, authorities introduced a curfew this month that’s hitting restaurants and bars particularly hard. In Germany, a Bavarian district imposed a two-week lockdown after infections climbed above a rate that triggers an automatic tightening of restrictions.
While the weakness is largely limited to services, the fallout on jobs and spillovers to the rest of the economy will worry policy makers. The deteriorating outlook strengthens the case for the European Central Bank to pump more monetary stimulus into the economy, and governments may have to extend expensive aid programs.
IHS Markit warned that the euro-area economy could shrink again this quarter. Its report said employment fell again in October, confidence deteriorated and orders declined.
“While the overall downturn remains only modest, and far slighter than seen during the second quarter, the prospect of a slide back into recession will exert greater pressure on the ECB to add more stimulus and for national governments to help cushion the impact of Covid-19 containment measures,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

Investing.com - The dollar posted small gains in early European trade Friday, following the final presidential debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Joe Biden before the Nov. 3 election.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.082, bouncing back from the seven-week low seen earlier in the week. However, it remains 0.6% lower for the week.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1793, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3054, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 104.72.
The final debate between the two presidential candidates took place in Nashville, Tennessee late Thursday and was more restrained than the chaotic first debate, with the debate centering more on policy rather than personal attacks.
That said, “people are just closing out longs ahead of the election just in case Biden isn’t [elected] … we’re coming into that eye of the storm now where it takes a bit of a brave soul to put on new positions ahead of the election,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations between House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over the potential for a new substantive coronavirus relief bill, with Pelosi expressing optimism that a consensus could be reached.
“Market players will take their cue from U.S. political developments as well as the sustained acceleration in Covid-19 cases around the globe as the fall ushers in a new wave of infections as predicted by experts,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY was largely flat at 6.6843, with the yuan holding onto gains against the greenback as Wang Chunying, spokeswoman for China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, told a news conference that the yuan has been more stable than expected. This comes despite the Chinese currency reaching its highest level against the dollar in 27 months on Wednesday.
The Chinese currency could see sharp gains if Joe Biden wins November’s U.S. presidential election, according to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) strategists. Chinese exporters would expect a more predictable U.S.-China trade relationship in that circumstance, and will start selling their dollar cash piles to buy yuan, the strategists wrote in a note dated Thursday.
Additionally, USD/TRY rose 0.2% to 7.9478, the day after Turkey’s central bank raised the upper bound of its interest-rate corridor but unexpectedly left its benchmark rate on hold.
The central bank surprised investors last month with a 200-basis-point increase and has since tightened policy further by restricting funding at the benchmark rate, forcing banks to borrow using costlier options. 
But this hasn’t stopped the currency’s decline, with the lira falling another 2% against the dollar since the September rate decision.
“Exchange rate developments are likely to remain as one of the key determinants of CBT policy in the period ahead given ongoing geopolitical issues and US elections-related sensitivities,” ING added.

LONDON (Reuters) - A dearth of action in fixed income markets is prompting bond investors to focus more on currencies to spot market trends, marking a turning point for the gigantic but generally murky foreign exchange markets.
Buying bonds at the rate of roughly $2 billion per hour in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks have crushed volatility and reduced its efficacy as a signalling instrument.
While the collapse in interest rate differentials should lead to a fall in currency price swings, as rate changes and their relative levels are major drivers for exchange rate moves, investors say the lack of these two factors is making currency markets more volatile.
This has major implications from investors to central banks because the former express their views on the economic outlook or major events via the bond markets, which the latter use as a key tool for the transmission of their monetary policy.
If the bond markets are broken, then currencies provide an alternative, investors say.
""It is early days but anecdotal evidence from some client conversations suggest that they are looking at currencies as an asset class to predict market trends compared to earlier when discussions would be on what the bond markets are predicting,"" said Robert Mcadie, chief cross-asset strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
A  State Street  (NYSE:STT) index of prices of various goods across different currencies show volatility is rising for a range of currencies including the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, euro and the British pound.
More broadly, currency market volatility <.DBCVIX> has risen from a 1-1/2-year low hit in late July while overall bond market volatility <.MOVE3M> remains near 2020 lows.
The rise in currency market volatility comes after at least five years of calm when major currencies held within tight ranges.

NUMBED
With interest rate markets numbed and an environment where central bank inflation targets are becoming looser, bigger moves in currencies will be more common as forex markets will increasingly bear the primary burden of reflecting large macro-economic trades or major event risks like the U.S. elections.
For example, volatility in the widely watched bond volatility index (MOVE) is a third of what it was around the 2016 U.S. elections.
Owen Murfin, an institutional fixed income portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management, a $528 billion fund, said it is ""far more flexible to express your views"" in forex markets than in rates.
Murfin, who said he has been ""pretty active"" trading the Norwegian Crown versus the U.S. dollar, is bullish on an economic recovery for the oil-exporting nation. 
He said the Norwegian bond market can be too small and relatively illiquid to express such views, and volatility there is low.
That view is shared by Oliver Boulind, a senior fixed income portfolio manager at HSBC Asset Management who allocated more risk to Latin American currencies including the Chilean, Mexican and Colombian currencies in the summer than their bond markets.
As bond investors switch to currencies, policymakers are following.
Take the euro for example. Since the European Recovery Fund was announced on May 18, the euro has rallied more than 10% versus the greenback with relative bond yields barely changed even though the news was primarily about debt mutualisation.
That has prompted the European Central Bank to become more vocal about the strength of the currency in recent days.
It is also reflected in tightly controlled currency markets like China where the yuan climbed to 27-month highs this week while bond yields remain largely contained, as investors bet on the outcome of the U.S. elections.
Sentifi, an alternative data provider, say the relative success of the Chinese authorities to deal with the pandemic is also fuelling yuan gains.
WAIT & WATCH
To be sure, switching from bonds to currencies is not easy. They are far more volatile than interest rates with 1%-2% daily swings a common occurrence - large by the standards of bond investors who are accustomed to relatively tiny yield moves.
But that is not deterring investors. Data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) shows the correlation of FX trading flows on their trading platforms to currency market swings is increasing, suggesting low bond market volatility is pushing more bond investors to currency markets.
The growing contrast between calm bond markets and the edginess in currencies is also changing the behaviour of so-called ""carry trade strategies"" where overseas buyers of U.S. debt would typically leave currency risk embedded in such trades unhedged because of the expensive hedging costs.
But with interest rates skirting zero in the developed world and volatility absent, Japanese buyers of U.S. and European debt are increasingly hedging FX risks because the after-hedged returns of buying such bonds are now in positive territory.
For example, Japanese investors bought a net 1.946 trillion yen of U.S. bonds in the week of Oct 4-10, according to Ministry of Finance data, the second-biggest weekly buying this year.
""The interest from our clients in FX has never been higher. But there is a wait & see approach from some investors. Do you want to put new capital to work before Nov. 3? Probably not,"" said Russell LaScala, co-head of global FX division at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) referring to the date of the U.S. Presidential election.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia, ending a tough week as it saw losses against the euro and its largest weekly drop against the yen in a month. U.S. President Donald Trump and Joe Biden participated in a restrained final presidential debate before the Nov. 3 presidential election earlier in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.08% to 93.043 by 1:02 PM ET (5:02 AM GMT). Although the dollar remained above Wednesday’s seven-week low, it was down 0.7% for the week and remained in the bottom half of a months-long range.
Trump was more restrained than during the first presidential debate on Sep. 29, where he constantly interrupted both Biden and moderator Chris Wallace.
Bookmaker  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) tweeted that betting markets showed a small movement in Trump’s favor in the immediate aftermath of the debate. However, some investors expected caution and no big moves ahead of the election.
“People are just closing out longs ahead of the election just in case Biden isn’t [elected] … we’re coming into that eye of the storm now where it takes a bit of a brave soul to put on new positions ahead of the election,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 104.70. The yen saw its highest weekly rise since mid-September, reversing some overnight losses after House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed optimism about a consensus on the latest stimulus measures. Investors also turned to the safe-have yen over the anticipated turbulent trade ahead of the election.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7112. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.6667. New Zealand released a weaker-than expected consumer price index earlier in the day, which rose 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and 1.4% year-on-year in the third quarter.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.6835. The yuan had held onto gains against the greenback as Wang Chunying, spokeswoman for China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), told a news conference that the yuan has been more stable than expected.
Wang’s comments suggested that Chinese authorities are not too worried about the yuan’s recent rise and helped the yuan’s onshore trade to soar up to about half a percent shy of the 27-month peak it saw on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.15% to 1.3062. The pound saw losses on Thursday over the Brexit uncertainty, with investors monitoring the intensified talks between the U.K. and European Union, started on Thursday as a last-ditch effort to reach a deal.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar took stock at the end of a poor week on Friday, having shed about a cent against the euro and suffered its largest weekly drop against the yen in a month, as investors began to wager on a Biden presidency and big U.S. stimulus.
Daily moves were slight and mostly in the dollar's favour early in the Asia session as traders awaited the final U.S. presidential debate, which begins at 0100 GMT.
Markets could be sensitive to any vote-shifting moments as campaigning hits fever pitch ahead of polling day on Nov. 3.
The dollar has lifted from Wednesday's seven-week low against a basket of currencies (=USD), but still sits about 0.8% lower for the week and in the bottom half of a monthslong range.
Persistent hopes that Congress might pass a stimulus package before the election and confidence that spending follows anyway, no matter who gets elected, has driven a selloff in the bond market in anticipation of more government borrowing. 
The dollar has been sold through the week because the prospect of stimulus has supported investors' mood and their appetite for riskier currencies instead, while underlying caution has also given the safe-haven Japanese yen a boost.
""If we do get through and Biden wins and he pushes on with stimulus, then we're back in to a negative U.S. dollar, risk-on, positive for Aussie and kiwi kind of story,"" said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer.
""But for now there's still a bit of a political risk overhang,"" he said.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  inched 0.1% higher early on Friday and is about 0.7% firmer this week, with further gains capped by a growing expectation that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut rates when it meets in November.
The New Zealand dollar  slipped 0.l% Friday after softer-than-expected inflation data, but has gained almost 1% for the week.
The Japanese yen  dipped overnight after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there was progress in stimulus talks, but it is about half a percent higher for the week and has ground nearly 3% higher since April.
The euro (EUR=) has gained 0.8% this week, though pulled back overnight as COVID-19 cases surge in Europe.
British, European and U.S. Purchasing Managers' Index figures are due later on Friday.
Sterling  slipped overnight on uncertainty over Brexit outlook, but it is up 1.2% this week and is clinging on above $1.30 thanks to hopes that Britain and the European Union can reach a trade deal before a transition period ends on Dec. 31.
In offshore trade the Chinese yuan  hovered just short of a more than two-year high hit earlier in the week. [CNY/]
Analysts said the debate may not move markets immediately, but that political uncertainty over the election meant for a risky environment.
""There may be verbal fireworks but we expect no material impact on the dollar,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy.
""We continue to see a high risk that the election outcome is delayed or contested,"" she said, adding to near-term downside risks for the Australian dollar.

85,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s fast-growing $157 billion market for exchange-traded funds will be directly accessible to overseas investors from Friday, at least four years since the plan was first hatched.
Four so-called “feeder” ETFs will begin trading in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, the first batch in a project aimed at connecting the two markets. The Shenzhen funds will track the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index and the S&P New China Sectors Index, while the Hong Kong-listed ETFs will follow the benchmark CSI 300 Index and a gauge of China’s 5G companies.
The investment vehicles, popular with retail traders around the world because they’re among the cheapest way to trade an index, will collect capital locally and settle trades across the border. Some 900 million yuan ($135 million) of funds has been gathered in a pre-sale of the ICBC CSOP S&P New China Sectors ETF, said Melody He, managing director at provider CSOP Asset Management Ltd.
Regulators in Hong Kong have been mulling broadening trading links with mainland China to include ETFs since at least 2016. The plan was delayed partly due to complex clearing and settlement issues. At $40 billion, Hong Kong’s ETF market is smaller than the mainland’s even though its first fund was launched five years before China’s in 1999. ETFs in China nearly doubled in value in the first half of this year.
“This is the very start of ETF connectivity,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sharnie Wong.
While there are ETFs in Hong Kong, London or New York following China’s onshore equity market, the tracking error can be as high as 15%, partly due to limits on foreign ownership. The feeder ETFs can better replicate mainland benchmarks because their providers are local and won’t be subject to caps. Overseas investors are currently permitted to own no more than 30% in yuan-denominated shares.
Unlike other major stock markets in the U.S. or Japan, China -- the world’s second largest -- isn’t overrun by ETFs. Individual investors haven’t caught on to the products even though costs can be a lot lower than with mutual funds, partly due to little demand for individual stock research.
China ETFs Give Retail Investors Access to Soaring Tech, Ant
ETFs can be traded in real time and in the U.S. are growing increasingly complex and diverse since the first one came about in 1993. China’s first ETF was launched by China Asset Management Co. in 2004. They only started to gain traction in China after MSCI Inc. added yuan-denominated shares to its benchmarks in 2018.
Cross-border trading of ETFs between Hong Kong and mainland China will take time to grow, said Wong, adding that the experience of the stock connect scheme launched in 2014 between both sides could be instructive.
“It could take six years for northbound trading to contribute 5% to mainland China’s ETF turnover, assuming participation of international investors in ETFs is similar to that of A-shares,” she said.
“It may take only two years for southbound trading to contribute 5% to Hong Kong’s ETF turnover, if mainland investors appetite for Hong Kong listed ETFs is similar to that of stocks.”

Investing.com – The pound fell Thursday despite the U.K. and EU resuming talks on a trade deal as experts warned that the display of brinkmanship from the U.K. amid negotiations risks an accidental no-deal Brexit.
GBP/USD fell 0.47% to $1.3083.
EU Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier arrived in London on Thursday, seeking to intensify talks with his British counterpart David Frost to find a solution to key sticking points state aid and fisheries.
Fisheries have longed dogged progress on a deal as the U.K. appears determined to take control over access to its waters, when the Brexit transition period ends, rather than stick with the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, which set fishing quotas among EU member states.
But with just months to go until the transition period ends, the U.K. appears unwilling to allow talks to run past the year-end deadline.
""In terms of the timeframe, I think, what I would say is that time is now very short,"" said a spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""We have been repeatedly clear that any agreement needs to be in place before the end of the transition period.""
The U.K.'s somewhat tough stance to talks and penchant for brinkmanship risks could risk an accidental no-deal Brexit as the clock ticks down toward the end of the year, Commerzbank Foreign Exchange Strategist Esther Reichelt warned. ""The fact that the British government finds it more important to display its political power 10 week prior to the de-facto Brexit than to make progress in the negotiations should constitute cause for concern.""
This keeps the potential for sterling to retrace its gains on the table as ""the risk of a no-deal accident in which the political cost of a compromise is seen as too high remains considerable,"" Reichelt added."

LONDON (Reuters) - A dearth of action in fixed income markets is prompting bond investors to focus more on currencies to spot market trends, marking a turning point for the gigantic but generally murky foreign exchange markets.
Buying bonds at the rate of roughly $2 billion per hour in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks have crushed volatility and reduced its efficacy as a signalling instrument.
While the collapse in interest rate differentials should lead to a fall in currency price swings, as rate changes and their relative levels are major drivers for exchange rate moves, investors say the lack of these two factors is making currency markets more volatile.
This has major implications from investors to central banks because the former express their views on the economic outlook or major events via the bond markets, which the latter use as a key tool for the transmission of their monetary policy.
If the bond markets are broken, then currencies provide an alternative, investors say.
""It is early days but anecdotal evidence from some client conversations suggest that they are looking at currencies as an asset class to predict market trends compared to earlier when discussions would be on what the bond markets are predicting,"" said Robert Mcadie, chief cross-asset strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
A  State Street  (NYSE:STT) index of prices of various goods across different currencies show volatility is rising for a range of currencies including the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, euro and the British pound.
More broadly, currency market volatility <.DBCVIX> has risen from a 1-1/2-year low hit in late July while overall bond market volatility <.MOVE3M> remains near 2020 lows.
The rise in currency market volatility comes after at least five years of calm when major currencies held within tight ranges.

NUMBED
With interest rate markets numbed and an environment where central bank inflation targets are becoming looser, bigger moves in currencies will be more common as forex markets will increasingly bear the primary burden of reflecting large macro-economic trades or major event risks like the U.S. elections.
For example, volatility in the widely watched bond volatility index (MOVE) is a third of what it was around the 2016 U.S. elections.
Owen Murfin, an institutional fixed income portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management, a $528 billion fund, said it is ""far more flexible to express your views"" in forex markets than in rates.
Murfin, who said he has been ""pretty active"" trading the Norwegian Crown versus the U.S. dollar, is bullish on an economic recovery for the oil-exporting nation. 
He said the Norwegian bond market can be too small and relatively illiquid to express such views, and volatility there is low.
That view is shared by Oliver Boulind, a senior fixed income portfolio manager at HSBC Asset Management who allocated more risk to Latin American currencies including the Chilean, Mexican and Colombian currencies in the summer than their bond markets.
As bond investors switch to currencies, policymakers are following.
Take the euro for example. Since the European Recovery Fund was announced on May 18, the euro has rallied more than 10% versus the greenback with relative bond yields barely changed even though the news was primarily about debt mutualisation.
That has prompted the European Central Bank to become more vocal about the strength of the currency in recent days.
It is also reflected in tightly controlled currency markets like China where the yuan climbed to 27-month highs this week while bond yields remain largely contained, as investors bet on the outcome of the U.S. elections.
Sentifi, an alternative data provider, say the relative success of the Chinese authorities to deal with the pandemic is also fuelling yuan gains.
WAIT & WATCH
To be sure, switching from bonds to currencies is not easy. They are far more volatile than interest rates with 1%-2% daily swings a common occurrence - large by the standards of bond investors who are accustomed to relatively tiny yield moves.
But that is not deterring investors. Data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) shows the correlation of FX trading flows on their trading platforms to currency market swings is increasing, suggesting low bond market volatility is pushing more bond investors to currency markets.
The growing contrast between calm bond markets and the edginess in currencies is also changing the behaviour of so-called ""carry trade strategies"" where overseas buyers of U.S. debt would typically leave currency risk embedded in such trades unhedged because of the expensive hedging costs.
But with interest rates skirting zero in the developed world and volatility absent, Japanese buyers of U.S. and European debt are increasingly hedging FX risks because the after-hedged returns of buying such bonds are now in positive territory.
For example, Japanese investors bought a net 1.946 trillion yen of U.S. bonds in the week of Oct 4-10, according to Ministry of Finance data, the second-biggest weekly buying this year.
""The interest from our clients in FX has never been higher. But there is a wait & see approach from some investors. Do you want to put new capital to work before Nov. 3? Probably not,"" said Russell LaScala, co-head of global FX division at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) referring to the date of the U.S. Presidential election.

88,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The lira sank to a record low, trading near 8 per dollar, after Turkey’s central bank unexpectedly held back from raising its key interest rate. Sovereign bonds and bank stocks also fell.
The currency depreciated as much as 2.1%, about three times more than any other emerging-market counterpart, to trade at an unprecedented 7.9797 per dollar. It was at 7.9605 as of 2:41 p.m. in Istanbul.
The lira gained about 0.4% ahead of the meeting on expectations that the Turkish central bank would lift the one-week repo rate for a second time in a row. The benchmark Borsa Istanbul Banks Index fell as much as 3.7%.
Yield spreads on Turkish sovereign bonds widened 4 basis points relative to U.S. Treasuries.
The Monetary Policy Committee left its key one-week repo rate at 10.25%, a decision forecast by just two of 27 respondents in a Bloomberg survey. At the same time it raised the upper bound of its interest-rate corridor to 14.75% from 13.25% and doubling the gap with the central bank’s overnight lending rate to 300 basis points.
Turkey Expands Rate Corridor But Unexpectedly Holds Benchmark
The lira’s slump shows investors’ disappointment as it has “fallen like a stone,” said Nigel Rendell, an analyst at Medley Global Advisors in London. As far as the market is concerned, widening the rates corridor is “a smoke and mirrors trick that is worse than useless if the central bank wants to have an ounce of inflation fighting credibility,” he said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, as traders warily studied the ongoing negotiations in Washington over a potential new U.S. stimulus package.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.713, rebounding a touch after falling to its lowest level since Sept. 2 overnight.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1851, a fraction below a one-month high of $1.1865 hit on Wednesday, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 104.64.
The dollar had weakened Wednesday on confidence that an agreement on stimulus was close, sparking demand for riskier assets, but this optimism has dissipated Thursday amid opposition from Senate Republicans over the size of the potential aid bill.
Negotiations between House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to continue on Thursday, but prospects remain dim for any substantial aid to be agreed before the Nov. 3 election, after negotiators on both sides acknowledged the possibility of a deal that only took effect after that date.
The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book suggested Wednesday that the U.S. economy expanded at a ""slight to modest"" pace though employment trends were sluggish. With this in mind, traders will look to the release of weekly jobless claims data later Thursday for guidance.
However, most eyes will be on the final presidential debate between President Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden later in the day. 
“Biden is leading Trump by miles in polls, while the increasing probability of a 'Blue Wave' outcome has been correlated with higher equities, a weaker USD and a steeper curve, but such a viewpoint is already consensus by now,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3134 after climbing to a six-week high overnight after Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator said talks with the European Union will resume on Thursday afternoon.
“The timescale for some sort of agreement has now slipped back into Mid-November, and there will doubtless be a flurry of ratifications necessary in member states before this can be passed, which will take the theater right to the closing curtain on Dec. 31,” ING analyst Robert Carnell said, in a research note. 
USD/TRY was down 0.1% at 7.8032 ahead of the latest policy meeting of Turkey’s central bank later Thursday.
The central bank surprised the market last month with a 200-point hike, designed to combat double-digit inflation and a record-low lira. However, the currency has since dipped another 4% against the dollar since then. 
Thus most economists expect Turkey's central bank to keep tightening policy, raising its key interest rate by 175 basis points to 12%, according to a Reuters poll.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The prospect of a victory for Joe Biden in the U.S. election has weighed on the rouble for months and its fortunes now appear more closely tethered to the White House contest in two weeks' time than Russia's economic health.
The rouble enjoyed a moment in the sun after Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. election victory, helped by the Republican president's congenial relations with counterpart Vladimir Putin. 
Low debt levels as well as prudent monetary and fiscal policies have protected the currency from some of the wild swings suffered by its emerging market peers from Turkey to South Africa for much of the recent period.
But as Democratic candidate Biden has pulled ahead of Trump in the polls since June, focus has turned to a new administration's likely relations with other global powers, including greater friction between Washington and Moscow. 
That risk, combined with angst about COVID-19's spread in Russia and lower oil prices, has contributed to the rouble tumbling around 9% against the dollar in the past three months, making it one of emerging markets' worst-performing currencies. It is now trading at around 77  against the dollar.
Graphic - Rouble, oil prices and U.S. political terms: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdxjlkpo/Capture.PNG
While the weakness has been a boon for exporters and the budget, it may hamper the ability of the central bank this month to continue easing monetary policy to support the COVID-ravaged economy. 
The central bank declined to comment, citing its week of silence before its board meeting on Friday, where it is widely expected to keep the key rate on hold.
""If there wasn't geopolitical risk in the currency, we'd probably be closer to 70, or even lower,"" said Blaise Antin, head of emerging market sovereign research at TCW. ""That's reflective of the investor concern that's out there and that concern isn't going to go away on Nov. 4.
""Even if Biden wins, there's going to be considerable uncertainty about what his policy mix will be.""
The currency's discount to other commodity peers has widened in the past three months, noted ING's Dmitry Dolgin.
The sanctions risk has hit portfolio flows into the local state debt (OFZ), which suffered outflows of $600 million in the third quarter after raking in $2.1bn in the second quarter.
Graphic - Foreign investment in Russian local bond market: https://graphics.reuters.com/US-ELECTIONS/RUSSIA/bdwvkjzqqpm/chart.png
Further outflows could follow in case of a Democratic victory, Dolgin said.
Foreigners hold around 29% of the local bonds and restrictions on their trading are viewed as a potential target in the event of renewed U.S. or international sanctions.
Stocks have lagged other emerging markets since polls began to shift towards Biden and also suffered outflows, adding to pressure on the currency, while foreign direct investment was net negative in the most recent first quarter data. 
Graphic - Direct investment into Russia: https://graphics.reuters.com/US-ELECTIONS/RUSSIA/bdwpkjzyjvm/chart.png
Russia is not the only country that could find itself in more troubled waters in the event of a Biden win, with Turkey, Brazil and Saudi Arabia also expected to face more challenging times. 
Some analysts and investors feel the rouble's slide makes it look cheap based on fundamentals. They point to low debt levels by international standards and a recovering economy - the government has ruled out a second lockdown.
""The rouble screens as being amongst the cheapest currencies globally right now so that's for us the best indication that the risk premium is too much,"" said Saad Siddiqui at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
The rouble also enjoys relative insulation from low oil prices by the fiscal rule, which redirects oil revenues to the National Wealth Fund if crude prices top $42.4 per barrel, a system designed to shield reserves and the economy from price swings for Russia's main export.
Although the current account suffered its weakest second and third quarters since 2013 due to low oil prices and output reductions, OPEC cuts are anticipated to lessen into next year and some analysts are positive on oil's outlook.
SANCTIONS
Most investors are braced for the likelihood of renewed sanctions if Biden sweeps to power.
The Russian government's ties to Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, who won a disputed presidential election in August and its alleged poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny may draw Biden's ire.
Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
He has long maintained a tough stance towards Putin's government and was vice president when the U.S. enacted harsher sanctions on Russia's financial, energy and defence sectors as punishment for the 2014 annexation of Crimea.
While that helped inflict hefty losses on the rouble, investors feel some of the risk of testier relations this time may already be priced in.
""Biden's focus will be first on Russia, which means that there is a higher probability of having more stringent sanctions,"" said Nikolay Markov, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management. 
""But there shouldn't be a significant decline in the rouble, unless the other main risk materialises, which is the pandemic getting out of control."" 
And the rouble could yet receive a boost if Trump won on Nov. 3.
""If there's a Trump win, it will be a buying opportunity,"" said Markov. ""He'll be much less stringent on Russia.""

91,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 12:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China is preparing to grant additional quota for funds to invest in securities overseas, Caixin reported, a move that would allow more capital to flow out of the country.
The Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor quota will be bumped by $10 billion in the near term, Caixin said on Thursday, citing an unidentified official from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. An earlier version of the story had said the QDII would be increased by between $2 billion and $3 billion every quarter, with a cap for annual increases kept at $10 billion. Caixin has since removed those references.
The foreign-exchange regulator didn’t immediately reply to a Bloomberg fax seeking comment on the Caixin report. The QDII quota was last at $107 billion in September, according to SAFE.
The yuan weakened 0.3% to 6.6681 per dollar on Thursday.
A rapid advance in the yuan may give policy makers the confidence to allow more capital to flow out of the country. Though a clear signal, in reality the move would do little to offset the capital that’s currently flowing into China’s onshore bond market. Overseas investors bought more than $100 billion worth of debt in the interbank market this year -- or about 10 times the planned quota increase in Caixin’s report.
The currency on Wednesday rose to the strongest since July 2018 even after the central bank set its daily reference rate weaker than expected. In addition to a falling dollar, the yuan is being underpinned by a wide interest-rate premium over the rest of the world, as well as expectations that a Democrat win in November’s U.S. election would encourage further strength.
SAFE last expanded the quota by $3 billion in late September -- the first enlargement since April 2019 -- just as the yuan completed its best quarter in 12 years versus the dollar. China hasn’t widened the quota for two consecutive months since 2018, and it hasn’t done so regularly since before the yuan was devalued five years ago.
The move “suggests to the market that policy makers want to either slow or stop yuan appreciation by opening an outflow channel,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior emerging-markets strategist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY). “There could be a little bit of a pause in the appreciation as a result of the news, but it will not have a lasting effect. More will need to be done.”
QDII, which was created more than a decade ago, allows onshore institutional investors to buy overseas securities such as stocks and bonds. SAFE used to grant quotas under the scheme prior to a shock devaluation in August 2015. The capital flight that followed prompted Beijing to tighten scrutiny on funds flowing outside its borders, by halting new quota offering under the program and making it harder for mainland individuals to buy foreign exchange.
On Oct. 10, Beijing scrapped a two-year rule that made shorting the currency expensive, a decision that was widely seen as a move to rein in the yuan’s rapid appreciation. While the yuan plunged the day after the rule change, it has erased all losses since then.
Still, Beijing has many other tools at its disposal to rein in the yuan’s ascent. It could issue a string of weaker reference rates, which limit the onshore currency’s moves by 2% on either side, or issue verbal warnings to guide market expectations. It could also ask banks to remove a so-called counter-cyclical factor in their fixing formulas, in effect encouraging them to submit weaker quotes for fixings.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, reversing losses from the previous session as the focus remains squarely on the U.S. Congress’ progress towards passing the latest stimulus measures.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.14% to 92.763 by 9:58 PM ET (1:58 AM GMT), after seeing its lowest level since Sep. 2 overnight. Both President Donald Trump and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made remarks that raised hopes of the measures’ passage before the Nov. 3 presidential election, whetting investor appetite for riskier assets and a retreat from the greenback.
”For a while, the pattern has been that when stimulus talks stalled, equities fell and the dollars were being bought due to risk-averse sentiment. But with optimistic headlines like these, the market is inclined to shift to risk-on mood and sell the dollars,” Mizuho Bank chief market economist Daisuke Karakama told Reuters.
However, the optimism faded as continuous opposition from Senate Republicans reduces the chances of the measures being passed before the election. Pelosi herself said, before continuing discussions with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that she remained optimistic about reaching a deal despite the Republican opposition but admitted that the measures might not pass before Americans head to the polls.
Investors now await the final presidential debate between Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden later in the day.
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard separately warned that the biggest risk to her outlook for economic recovery was that the federal government’s fiscal support would be withdrawn too soon.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar steadied against most major currencies on Thursday as U.S. stimulus talks remained the focus for markets with trading buffeted over recent days by the extent of progress made on the potential size of the aid package.

Investing.com - The pound jumped against the dollar Wednesday as the U.K. and EU are set to resume Brexit talks after Britain welcomed the economic bloc's desire to break the impasse in negotiations. 
GBP/USD rose 1.73% to $1.3129, its highest level since March.
Post-Brexit trade talks are set to get underway on Thursday after EU Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier said a deal was in reach, and pledged to ""seek the necessary compromises on both sides.""
""Despite the difficulties we've faced, an agreement is within reach. If both sides are willing to work constructively, if both sides are willing to compromise,"" Barnier said in a speech. 
The U.K. signaled it was ready to intensify talks to thaw key sticking issues including fishing rights, and sovereign aid.
""It is clear that significant gaps remain between our positions in the most difficult areas but we are ready, with the EU, to see if it is possible to bridge them in intensive talks,"" a spokesman for the government said, according to U.K. media reports.
The pound was also helped by easing fears over negative rates after Deputy Bank of England Governor Dave Ramsden said cutting rates below zero could hamper lending activity.
""While there might be an appropriate time to use negative rates, that time is not right now,"" Ramsden said.
The sense of urgency to explore options to boost the economy comes in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 infections that have forced the government to impose new lockdown measures in parts of the country.

“Changes in activity varied greatly by sector,” the central bank said in its Beige Book survey released Wednesday in Washington. “Economic activity continued to increase across all districts, with the pace of growth characterized as slight to modest in most districts.”
The report was based on information collected by the Fed’s 12 regional banks through Oct. 9.
The U.S. economy’s rebound has shown some signs of slowing in recent weeks as fiscal stimulus passed in early spring has expired and Covid-19 makes an autumn resurgence. The most recent economic data has been mixed, with consumer spending rising while jobs gains have slowed.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard warned earlier on Wednesday that more fiscal stimulus is needed, with spending and employment at risk. The report was released in advance of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting Nov. 4-5, which starts the day after the U.S. election. Economists expect the central bank to make few if any changes to policy.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey stands to lose more than most other countries if Joe Biden is elected president since he is expected to toughen the U.S. stance against President Tayyip Erdogan's foreign military interventions and closer cooperation with Russia.
Investors and analysts say the beleaguered Turkish lira is especially vulnerable if a Biden White House pulls the trigger on long-threatened sanctions over Ankara's purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, which Washington says compromise NATO defences. 
An apparent S-400s test last week prompted a furious response from the State Department and Pentagon. Top Republican and Democratic U.S. senators also called for sanctions that could hobble a Turkish economy hit by two slumps in as many years. 
Erdogan has downplayed possible fallout and promised counter-sanctions. 
The American threats have rung hollow since Moscow shipped the weapons to Ankara in mid-2019, largely because President Donald Trump has resisted punishing Erdogan, with whom he has regular calls, saying he hopes talks will resolve the issue.
Erdogan has leveraged his warm ties with Trump to flex military muscle in Syria, Libya, the Eastern Mediterranean and this month in Nagorno-Karabakh, filling some gaps left by a U.S. retreat from the region in recent years. 
But the relationship could cool if Biden, the Democratic candidate and front-runner, wins the November 4 election. 
In remarks that drew sharp criticism from Ankara, Biden in December advocated a new approach to the ""autocrat"" Erdogan and fretted over close Turkish cooperation with Russia.
Biden has said little specifically about the issue recently and his campaign did not respond to a request to comment. His platform calls on ""all NATO nations to recommit to their responsibilities as members of a democratic alliance."" 
The lira, down 24% this year to all-time lows, already partly reflects the Biden risk, investors say. Any decisive rebound in Turkish assets may be delayed until after the vote when the White House decides whether, and perhaps how, to sanction Turkey. 
""A Biden victory would certainly increase the risk of U.S. sanctions ... and of course you'll have anxiety returning to an already unstable financial market that has been hit by the pandemic,"" said Roger Kelly, lead regional economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
The lira's slide is due mostly to depleted FX reserves at the central bank, double-digit inflation and what Moody's (NYSE:MCO) says is a balance-of-payments risk. 
Yet the U.S. election has loomed in the background: the latest currency selloff began in July, when Biden's near 10-point lead in polls solidified. A Turkish government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some investors say now that $13.5 billion has been pulled from Turkish bonds and stocks this year there's good reason to invest, especially after the central bank began hiking its key interest rate, which is expected to hit 12% on Thursday.
But sanctions over S-400s, now back on the radar, are making some optimists think twice. 
""There's justification for owning Turkish hard currency paper. You may have to navigate through some choppiness but ... quite a bit of bad news is already priced in,"" said Blaise Antin, head of EM sovereign research at Los Angeles-based TCW.
""Yet the Erdogan back channel to the White House will very likely be much weaker"" under Biden, he added. ""Erdogan is a pragmatic guy. I expect he would try some sort of pivot."" 
NEW U.S. APPROACH
Turkey's Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said this month it would work with any U.S. president yet press him to abandon support for Kurdish militant groups in Syria, and to extradite U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen who it says orchestrated a failed coup in 2016.
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak has downplayed the fall in the lira, which is near 8 versus the dollar, and he expects Turkey's economy to avoid a contraction this year.
For a graphic on Timeline of Turkish lira's gradual decline:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjjnyqvr/Lira%20timeline%20US%20elections.PNG
Foreign holdings of Turkish government debt have fallen to 3% from more than 25% five years ago. Flows briefly reversed after last month's surprise rate hike, but the rally was cut short by reports of the planned S-400 test. 
A U.S. House defence spending bill worth hundreds of billions of dollars includes sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that is meant to punish countries dealing with Russia. 
The Senate could pass it and send it to the White House as soon as December, setting the stage for Biden or Trump to select mild or harsh sanctions next year. Separately last year, Washington suspended Ankara's involvement in an F-35 programme. 
Erdogan sees Turkey's NATO membership and its opposition to Russia in conflicts in both Syria and Libya as a check on what any U.S. Administration might do, said Nikolay Markov, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management. 
""The U.S. will need to rely on Turkey as the main ally in that region, so that puts a cap on sanctions they can take against Turkey,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Wednesday to a one-month low, as increased optimism surrounding a new U.S. stimulus package helped boost the demand for riskier currencies, to the detriment of the greenback. 
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 92.787, falling to its lowest level for a month. EUR/USD was up 0.3% at 1.1859, reaching a one-month high, while USD/JPY was down 0.3% at 105.23. 
News that President Donald Trump was willing to accept a large aid bill, as a string of negative opinion polls puts pressure on him to get a deal done before the Nov. 3 election, has raised hopes for a stimulus breakthrough.
Negotiations between House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will continue on Wednesday.
That said, the dollar losses haven’t been extreme as there remains strong opposition from within Trump’s own Republican Party about a package of any real size being agreed.
“All in all, a fresh stimulus bill before the elections remains far from certain and we suspect there is not much of it currently being priced in by the markets, which should keep the downside for risk assets relatively limited if prospects of a bipartisan-deal eventually collapse,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Aside from the political maneuvering in Washington, traders will look to the release of the Federal Reserve's October Beige Book for clues of the extent of the U.S. economic recovery. It will provide a snapshot from businesses and communities about how the resurgence of Covid is being felt across the country.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.2997, after annual inflation in the U.K. accelerated in September. Consumer prices rose 0.5% on year in September compared with a 0.2% rise in August, driven by higher transport costs, as well as higher prices at restaurants.
Separate figures showed the government borrowed 36.1 billion pounds ($46.75 billion) in September, the third-highest total for any month since records began in 1993, to help finance various coronavirus-relief packages for the economy.
""Whilst it's clear that the coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on our public finances, things would have been far worse had we not acted in the way we did to protect millions of livelihoods,"" British finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Additionally, USD/CNY traded 0.5% lower at 6.6411, falling to its weakest level since July 2018, a consequence of the Chinese economy’s relatively strong rebound from the pandemic.  
""China is the strongest economic story in town, relative to Europe and the U.S.,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim,in a Reuters report. A Joe Biden presidency, he added, could also provide support by calming Sino-U.S. relations.
On Monday, China reported that its gross domestic product grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar hit a one-month low on Wednesday as investors who are optimistic about a pre-election U.S. stimulus package sought out riskier currencies, while the strong recovery in China's economy helped drive the yuan to a two-year high. 
President Donald Trump has raised hopes for a stimulus breakthrough, saying he was willing to accept a large aid bill, despite opposition from his own Republican Party.
That sent U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) to a four-month high, in anticipation of more government borrowing, and pressed the dollar index (=USD) to its lowest level since September by boosting investors' mood.
Doubts that any package can actually pass the Senate are keeping the dollar from breaching last month's two-year lows.
The dollar index was last down about 0.1% in Asia. 
The Australian and New Zealand dollars, which have lagged other majors' gains on the greenback due to expectations of monetary easing in both countries, each rose about 0.4%. [AUD/]
The euro (EUR=) hit a one-month high of $1.1844.
""U.S. stimulus faith remains in play,"" said Sook Mei Leong, ASEAN head of global markets research at MUFG in Singapore.
""This is notwithstanding that euro/dollar remains vulnerable to the stream of ... increases in COVID-19 cases and crimped economic activities from the re-introduction of lockdowns.""
Such worries and the drawn-out and oscillating fortunes of the U.S. stimulus bill have held the dollar in its range this month and will determine its next moves.
The Japanese yen  has likewise been held in stasis as the brightening mood weakens the greenback, but the simultaneous rise in U.S. yields attracts investment flows from Japan out of yen and in to dollars. The yen edged up 0.1% on Wednesday.
""All eyes are on whether a U.S. stimulus bill is agreed upon,"" Kim Mundy, currency analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in Sydney, said in a note.
""Without a more aggressive U.S. fiscal thrust, the U.S. economic recovery is at risk and the dollar is vulnerable to a renewed bout of strength in the short-term.""
YUAN SHOW IN TOWN
In contrast to the dollar's dependence on stimulus hopes, the yuan extended a remarkable rally on Wednesday, hitting a 27-month high and pulling China-exposed Asian currencies with it.
The yuan has soared 7.6% on the dollar since May as China has led the global coronavirus recovery and its stock and bond markets have soaked up offshore capital flows.
A firm onshore guidance rate fixing on Wednesday assuaged worries that policymakers are concerned about its rise. 
""China is the strongest economic story in town, relative to Europe and the U.S.,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim. A Joe Biden presidency, he added, could also provide support by calming Sino-U.S. relations.
Data on Monday showed China's economic growth accelerating as the pandemic recedes, and a state planning official on Wednesday said auto sales and production could hit last year's levels.
The yuan  was last up 0.2% at 6.6532. Its rise helped lift the Australian dollar , weighed down by expectations of a rate cut in November, from Tuesday's three-week low.
The South Korean won , Singapore dollar  and Thai baht  also rallied. The Indonesian rupiah  hit a two-week high after solid demand in a Tuesday debt auction.
Later on Wednesday, preliminary Australian retail sales figures are due. At 0730 GMT, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and chief economist Philip Lane host a broad strategy review event in Frankfurt.

The U.S. Federal Reserve releases its ""Beige Book"" economic survey at 1800 GMT.

99,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 10:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yuan briefly climbed to its strongest level since July 2018, presenting China’s central bank with another test of how much appreciation it will tolerate.
The yuan gained as much as 0.16% to 6.6664 a dollar in early trading in Shanghai. The People’s Bank of China fixed its daily reference rate at 6.6781, which was slightly weaker than expected.
The latest push higher will have traders watching to see whether the People’s Bank of China will act to slow gains. One of its preferred measures is to fix the currency’s daily reference rate -- which limits moves to 2% in either direction -- at levels weaker than market watchers expect. It also has other tools at its disposal, such as relaxing capital controls installed after a shock devaluation five years ago and mobilizing state-backed banks to sell the yuan.
The PBOC said on Oct. 10 it was scrapping a rule that made it expensive to bet against the yuan. In the first session after that change, the onshore yuan slumped the most in nearly seven months.
The currency of the world’s second-largest economy has surged 4.7% over the past three months, the most in Asia after the South Korean won.
The yuan’s rally has been aided by a weak dollar, China’s rate premium over U.S. government debt climbing to a record and the economy’s rebound from the virus pandemic. That recovery continued in the July-September period, when gross domestic product expanded by 4.9% from a year earlier.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia over continued optimism over the U.S. Congress passing the latest stimulus measures before the Nov. 3 presidential election, boosting risk sentiment and pushing the dollar down to a near one-week low.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.15% to 92.963 by 9:52 PM ET (1:52 AM GMT).
President Donald Trump signaled that he was willing to accept a package with a larger price tag despite Republican opposition, saying on Tuesday, “I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats.”
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also was hopeful that the Republican-Democrat gap on the stimulus measures’ price tag is narrowing, saying, “I hope so. That’s the plan,” for an agreement to be reached the following week.
Stimulus measures are seen as a short-term weight on the greenback, as spending supports the economy and increases investors’ risk appetite.
The expectations also sparked a selloff in U.S. bonds, and the Federal Reserve will release its ‘Beige Book’ economic survey later in the day.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.09% to 105.40, with investors retreating from the safe-haven yen.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.31% to 0.7068, with the Westpac/Melbourne Institute (MI) Leading Index, a preliminary indication of retail sales figures, increasing 0.2% month-on-month. The index last recorded a 0.5% growth.
The NZD/USD pair gained 0.32% to 0.6598, with the Antipodean risk currencies seeing a cap on gains over expectations of negative rates in New Zealand, and monetary easing across the Tasman Sea in Australia.
“All eyes are on whether a U.S. stimulus bill is agreed upon … if U.S. policymakers manage to agree on fiscal deal, the dollar can edge lower especially against commodity sensitive currencies,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy said in a note.
“But without a more aggressive U.S. fiscal thrust, the U.S. economic recovery is at risk and the dollar is vulnerable to a renewed bout of strength in the short-term,” the note added.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.14% to 6.6658. The yuan continues to bask in the glow of data released earlier in the week suggests that China is leading the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Offshore yuan was headed towards a more than two-year peak on Tuesday.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 1.296. Investors continue to keep an eye on the progress of Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union.

Investing.com – The pound cut its gains against the greenback Tuesday, as the U.K. continues to dig in its heels over restarting trade talks with the EU and parts of Britain go into lockdown to curb virus infections.
GBP/USD fell 0.05% to $1.2940.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly told the Greek prime minister Brexit talks will remain paused until the EU changes its stance on the discussions.
“He reaffirmed that the EU have effectively ended those negotiations by stating they did not want to change their negotiating position,” Johnson’s spokesman said following the call with Prime Minster Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “Should the EU fundamentally change their position, then the UK would be willing to talk on that new basis.”
Issues including fishing access and state aid rules have held up progress on talks.
EU negotiator Michel Barnier who just a day earlier extended an olive branch after suggesting that the bloc was committed to intensifying talks called on the U.K. to ""make the most of the little time left"" with just months ago until the end of the transition period at year-end.
Without a trade deal, the U.K. will trade with the EU on World Trade Organization trade terms, which many have said will hurt growth, particularly a time when Britain has resumed some lockdown to curb a surge in cases.
Johnson confirmed Greater Manchester would be going into the highest level of lockdown - Tier 3 - from 12.01am on Friday morning.
Coronavirus infections in the U.K. soared by 21,330 since Monday, the highest one-day rise since June 5.
The prime minister also had to contend with a widely expected defeat in Parliament as his internal markets bill, which seeks to undermine parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, was voted down.
Sterling remains vulnerable until there is meaningful progress on talks, analysts have warned.
""A true breakthrough would be the news that an agreement has been reached on the issue of fishing. That would be more suited to justifying strong Sterling appreciation as this is one of the real stumbling blocks in the negotiations. Until that is reached, I would remain cautious as a Sterling bull,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Thu Lan Nguyen said."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro struggled to rise above the $1.18 level on Tuesday as fading hopes for a U.S. coronavirus aid package dealt a blow to risky assets worldwide, with rising coronavirus infections in Europe also weighing on the single currency.
While markets remain hopeful talks between U.S. House Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will result in a deal before the Nov 3 presidential election, any agreement will have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate where opposition to a bigger stimulus bill remains stubborn.
Those concerns pushed the euro (EUR=EBS) lower in early trades, with the single currency down 0.1% at $1.17600 after it briefly popped to a one-week high of $1.1794 in the previous session.
""As we approach U.S. elections and with COVID infections around the globe rising at a fast pace, investors may refrain from engaging into large trading positions,"" said Charalambos Pissouros, a senior market analyst at JFD Group.
France reported a massive jump in people hospitalized with COVID-19 and Ireland announced some of Europe's toughest restrictions.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar dropped 0.3% to $0.7045 , hitting a three-week low of $0.7038 on increasing expectations of monetary easing next month by the country's central bank.
Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) last policy meeting confirmed the Board had discussed cutting rates and buying longer-dated debt as a means to support the economy and restrain the currency.
Sterling held on to small gains made the previous day at $1.2941 .
Britain's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said there was no basis to resume trade talks with the European Union unless there was a fundamental change in Brussels' approach to negotiations.

At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 93.445. EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1768, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.53.
The greenback has been trading in a narrow range of late, with traders watching the ongoing discussions between U.S. lawmakers over the need and size of additional stimulus with a great deal of caution.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin “continued to narrow their differences” in a telephone conversation on Monday, her spokesman said.
However, there remain serious doubts that the political impasse will be lifted in time for measures to be passed by the end of Pelosi’s self-imposed Tuesday deadline to reach a deal with Republicans.
U.S. housing starts for September are due later in the session, but, aside from the stimulus talks, the focus will soon move to Thursday’s second presidential debate, with many seeing this as President Donald Trump’s last chance to move the needle in the race for the White House,
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded largely flat 1.2946, still supported as the EU appeared to extend an olive branch, saying it remains committed to intensifying Brexit-deal talks with the U.K..
“As we enter yet another crucial phase for Brexit and sterling this week, we suspect market positioning on GBP did not shift too much on the short side after the confrontational comments and threat of no-deal witnessed last week,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“We believe this is a market that is far from pricing in a no-deal outcome … and remain of the view that the downside risks for sterling in a no-deal scenario are still sizeable,” ING added.
Additionally, USD/CNY traded 0.1% higher at 6.6839, not far removed from the two-year low of 6.6695 it reached per dollar on Monday, the pair’s weakest level since July 2018. 
On Monday, China reported that its gross domestic product grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, slower than the median forecast of 5.2%, but considerably better than the growth seen in Europe or the U.S..

 "
104,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As Brexit sends hedging costs soaring again, strategists are recommending a slew of less crowded ways to trade the never-ending political drama.
From euro-area bond spreads and equity derivatives to the shape of the inflation curve, investors can place bets on Britain’s economic future, without speculating directly on its volatile currency.
As the nation heads toward a no deal with the European Union, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still holding out room for more negotiations this year, spurring investors to prep for fresh political fireworks.
With that in mind, here are some alternative investing styles to trade the torturous negotiations.
For the deal pessimists, selling Irish sovereign bonds to buy French government debt looks like a good hedge, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Ireland’s economy is far more dependent on the U.K. than the latter’s continental neighbor, therefore its yield typically rises relatively more when no-deal talk pummels the pound.
Investors can make bets on the inverted correlation between the Irish-French bond spread and sterling, while deal optimists can go the other side of the trade.
In the equities world, one view holds that the FTSE 100 should suffer relatively less than the Stoxx Europe 50 Index on no-deal fears. That’s because a cheaper pound tends to cushion the impact on U.K.-listed multinational stocks, more so than the comparable dynamic in the euro-area index.
As such, sell-side strategists have recommended selling puts on the FTSE to buy them on SX5E. Right now, pricing appears to favor that trade with a benchmark put costing well above its five-year average relative to its counterpart, as measured in volatility terms.
One wild trade lives in market-derived inflation expectations. Traders are expecting higher price pressures over the next five years relative to the next 30, spurring an inverted yield curve. Retail price inflation is currently seen around 48 basis points more than in three decades time, near historic extremes.
All that could change under a trade agreement that fosters a pound rally, thereby easing the imported cost pressures, according to Bloomberg Intelligence global derivatives strategist Tanvir Sandhu.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets, for one, predicts a U.K.-EU deal in some form or another by early November, sending the pound back to $1.40 versus $1.30 currently. The upside for speculators is huge: The sterling options market on Monday flashed only a 2% probability this level would be reached by mid-November.
Any sterling-positive news in the weeks ahead therefore has the potential to jolt cross-asset trades, from bond spreads to inflation curves.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, with doubts over the status of the latest U.S. stimulus measures continuing to linger. The Chinese yuan continued near a two-year high against the dollar over signs of continued economic recovery in the country.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, inched up 0.05% to 93.477 by 10:09 PM ET (2:09 AM GMT).
U.S. shares took a hit on Monday over doubts that Congress will pass the stimulus measures ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election, now two weeks away.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin “continued to narrow their differences” in a telephone conversation on Monday, her spokesman said.
Pelosi hopes that there will be “clarity” on whether the measures will be passed by the end of her self-imposed Tuesday deadline to reach a deal with Republicans.
However, investors remain unconvinced that a deal will be reached before the deadline.
“Although Pelosi has set a Tuesday deadline for a deal, it does not seem like she has a clear conviction that there will be an agreement … markets probably still think a deal before the election is unlikely,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.

The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.11% to 6.687, reversing earlier losses. Investors are still digesting the Chinese quarterly growth data released on Monday, which showed that the GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, less than expected. However, the data showed a continuous recovery for the world’s second-largest economy overall, helping offshore yuan to reach its strongest level since July 2018 and surpass its 2019 peak.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.35% to 0.7043. The AUD continued a third consecutive day of losses over increasing speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will introduce further monetary easing measures soon.
RBA Assistant Governor Chris Kent said earlier in the day that the RBA board is considering further monetary policy easing, including expanding its bond buying program to include longer-dated government debt. Kent's statement was corroborated by the minutes from RBA’s October meeting, which revealed that RBA discussed the possibility of further monetary policy easing, including cutting the cash rate towards zero and buying longer-dated government bonds, during the meeting.
“These options would have the effect of further easing financial conditions in Australia,” the minutes said.

The game of brinkmanship between both parties, however, is expected to continue in the wake of little progress on key issues that have held back talks including the so-called level playing field commitments, fisheries and issues of governance.

At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.8727, following a 0.7% rise last week when a global surge in coronavirus cases and an impasse over the stimulus package prompted caution. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1709, USD/JPY was largely flat at 105.41, while USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 6.7024. 
Earlier Monday, China reported that its gross domestic product grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, slower than the median forecast of 5.2% but an increase from the second quarter's numbers. China remains the only major economy worldwide set to grow this year, according to new International Monetary Fund forecasts released last week.
Investors globally are pinning hopes on a robust recovery in China to help restart global demand as economies struggle with renewed lockdowns amid a second wave of coronavirus infections.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that she was optimistic that legislation on a wide-ranging coronavirus relief package could be pushed through before the election on Nov. 3. But setting a Tuesday deadline for Congress to pass the measures leaves little time for such a bill.
Continuing the political theme, just fifteen days out from election day, Democrat challenger Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by about ten points in national polls, and has a narrow lead in several battleground states. The pair are due to face off in a final debate on Thursday.
“President Trump will hope that this Thursday’s second and final TV debate in Nashville presents an opportunity to score some points off Biden,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“Any narrowing in the opinion polls will probably be taken as a negative by risk markets, increasing as it does the chances of a contested election. This comes at a time when financial markets are priced towards a benign outcome in the form of a Democratic clean sweep,” ING added.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2936. Traders are taking Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s comments about the U.K. government’s willingness to go for the Australia-style trade deal, i.e. no deal, with a large pinch of salt. Speculation is rising that the controversial Internal Markets Bill, which essentially rips up the Withdrawal Agreement that governs the current transition period post-Brexit, will be watered down by the House of Lords this week.
“If the market credibly believed in the threat of a no deal Brexit, GBP would be materially weaker today,” ING analysts said.
Still, time is running out for some form of deal to be done.
“Two months is the absolute minimum required to legislate for a deal, if one is done,” said Adam Cole, head of currency strategy at RBC Europe, in a Bloomberg report. “So early November is the real deadline. If it’s clear at that point that we are heading for no deal for sure, we have around 5% downside across the board.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with China due to release quarterly growth data, including GDP and industrial production readings, later in the day, despite fading hopes for the latest fiscal stimulus package to be passed by the U.S. Congress ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential elections.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 93.672 by 9:40 PM ET (1:40 AM GMT), following a 0.7% rise the previous week over surging numbers of COVID-19 cases and the impasse in Congress.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 105.41.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.36% to 0.7106. The NZD/USD pair was up 0.32% to 0.6625, after the NZD showed little reaction to Prime Minister Jacinda Arden’s Labor party cinching a landslide victory on Saturday.
The risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies saw gains over expectations that the Chinese data will show strong growth for the quarter. Investors are hoping that a strong recovery in the world’s second largest economy will strengthen demand amid rising COVID-19 cases and the re-introduction of restrictive measures such as lockdowns.
Although the People’s Bank of China introduced policies to stem the yuan’s recent rise during the previous week, the expectations have boosted the currency over its 18-month high of 6.6788. The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.12% to 6.6883.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 1.2938.
In the U.S., despite House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi setting a Tuesday deadline for Congress to reach consensus on a deal before the election, most investors remain doubtful that the deadline will be reached as a Joe Biden victory looks imminent. 
“Fiscal remains the buzzword … but forget the Republicans’ move to pass a $500 billion bill, it will not see the light of day, and expectations of a new stimulus bill have been pushed into 2021,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters. With around two weeks left until Nov. 3, national polls show Democrat candidate Biden leading incumbent President Donald Trump by around ten points. The two men will square off at a final debate scheduled for Thursday.
“Markets will be attentive to any potential shift in polls, although traditionally the last debate has less impact in public opinion … the main risk for markets now would be a tightening in polls, which would reduce the likelihood of a large Democratic fiscal stimulus package and could raise the likelihood of a long-contested election,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
Meanwhile, Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed stimulus package efforts via a phone call on Saturday and are due to speak again later in the day. Trump has also renewed his offer to up the package’s price tag."

For pound traders who have weathered more than four years of Brexit talks, anything short of a resolution one way or the other by the beginning of November is a distraction.
Analysts say that in order for both sides to prepare for new trade terms in 2021, there needs to be at least a broad outline of what they’ll be at the start of next month. Combined with what could be a contentious U.S. presidential election, that is leading to the cost of hedging against swings in the pound peaking in three weeks.
“Two months is the absolute minimum required to legislate for a deal, if one is done,” said Adam Cole, head of currency strategy at RBC Europe. “So early November is the real deadline. If it’s clear at that point that we are heading for no deal for sure, we have around 5% downside across the board.”
Traders weren’t overly vexed Friday by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s announcement that the U.K. is preparing to leave without a trade deal, with MUFG Bank strategist Lee Hardman describing that as political posturing. The pound erased losses to trade 0.1% higher at $1.2932 in Asia on Monday after Bloomberg News reported that British officials were prepared to re-write Johnson’s lawbreaking Brexit legislation to revive failing talks with the European Union.
No Panic
Traders have grown accustomed to filtering out political noise, after suffering years of negotiations that yielded no results and seeing deadlines come and go. Also, this time around, trade talks are competing for market impact with the spread of the coronavirus.
Even with the U.K.’s transition period from the EU ending soon, sterling is pricing in only a “modest” no-deal risk premium, according to MUFG. It recommends a short tactical position on the pound versus the dollar given rising Brexit risks and a resurgence in Covid-19.
“The outlook for the U.K. economy is darkening heading into year-end, which could encourage the Bank of England to deliver more stimulus next month,” MUFG’s Hardman and Derek Halpenny said in an emailed note.
Jobless figures are up the most on record after the spread of Covid-19 caused the worst recession in more than a century. The downturn has already led to record-low Bank of England interest rates and money market bets on further cuts, another millstone for any gains in the currency.
Britain’s standing in the eyes of rating agencies has deteriorated. Moody’s on Friday cut its rating by one notch to Aa3, with a stable outlook. The firm cited softer economic growth, an erosion of fiscal strength and a weakening in institutions and governance.
Get it Done
Johnson said the nation is preparing for an Australian-style trade deal with the EU, which is essentially a no-deal Brexit. Companies would trade on terms set by the World Trade Organization in most areas, with tariffs on goods and an agreement on the processes to reduce some regulatory barriers.
The U.K. and EU’s chief negotiators, David Frost and Michel Barnier, will speak again early this week. The U.K. still wants to reach a trade agreement and the door is open for more negotiation, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said Sunday.
Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney warned Thursday that once negotiations move into November, the two sides are running out of time to reach a deal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled that the EU should make a move in the U.K.’s direction.
“Sterling is really just waiting for whether to move in the deal or no deal direction, and I’d be concerned if there wasn’t an agreement by the end of November,” said Mikael Olai Milhoj, an analyst at Danske Bank A/S. “While the U.S. election will cause volatility for all currencies, November will be particularly bad for the pound.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar clung to gains on Monday, supported by investor worries about the looming U.S. election and the fading prospects of any fiscal stimulus beforehand, while the Chinese yuan held firm ahead of the release of quarterly growth data.
The dollar index (=USD) was steady in early trade, following a 0.7% rise last week when a global surge in coronavirus cases and an impasse over the stimulus package stoked caution.
The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars edged higher on expectations that data due later on Monday shows strong growth in China, and on faint hopes that Democrats and the White House could agree on a new spending program. [AUD/]
But enthusiasm was tempered by the opposition of Senate Republicans and as investors focused on what the election outcome means for stimulus later, with a Joe Biden victory seen weakening the dollar by boosting sentiment with big spending.
The Antipodean currencies rose about 0.2% each, with no real reaction from the kiwi to the landslide election victory of Jacinda Ardern's Labour party over the weekend. The euro, yen and sterling were all steady in morning trade in Asia.
""Fiscal remains the buzzword,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""But forget the Republicans' move to pass a $500 billion bill, it will not see the light of day, and expectations of a new stimulus bill have been pushed into 2021.""
He said a Biden administration with control of the Senate could pass a stimulus program as large as $3.5 trillion.
Something closer to $1 trillion was probable if Biden won the presidency but the Democrats failed to win the Senate, Weston said, while a Donald Trump victory and a split Congress could limit spending to between $500 billion and $1 trillion.
Fifteen days out from election day, Biden leads Trump by about ten points in national polls, and has a narrow lead in several battleground states. The pair are due to face off in a final debate on Thursday.
""Markets will be attentive to any potential shift in polls, although traditionally the last debate has less impact in public opinion,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
""The main risk for markets now would be a tightening in polls, which would reduce the likelihood of a large Democratic fiscal stimulus package and could raise the likelihood of a long contested election.""
The main focus of traders in Asia on Monday is Chinese growth and economic data due at 0200 GMT.
The yuan  has largely shrugged off hints last week from Chinese policymakers that its recent rise has been too fast and too large, returning to sit near an 18-month high of 6.6788 in anticipation of strong GDP growth and capital inflows.
The yuan last sat at 6.6930 in offshore trade.
Investors globally are pinning hopes on a robust recovery in China to help restart demand as economies struggle with heavy lockdowns and a second wave of coronavirus infections.

The world's second-largest economy likely grew 5.2% in July-September from a year earlier, faster than the second quarter's 3.2%, according to a Reuters poll.

All but one of 43 analysts polled by Bloomberg expect the central bank to stand pat at the two-day gathering ending on Oct. 29. The economists see the BOJ largely sticking to its existing economic forecasts in its quarterly outlook report.
While little more than a tenth of respondents see the bank extending the deadline for two virus-linked funding programs and enlarged asset purchases at the meeting, 95% of them expect the decision by January.
Click here to see full survey results.
The results follow remarks by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last month that there is a good chance the BOJ will lengthen the time frame of the program beyond March 31. At the height of the pandemic the bank created two funding programs worth a total of about $1 trillion and raised its buying limit on corporate bonds and commercial paper.
“The extension could even come as early as this meeting” said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA. Still, “fiscal policy must play the leading role in supporting the economy with the BOJ helping back that up through yield curve control,” he added.
To that end, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will compile another extra budget by the end of this year, according to 85% of the economists. Kuroda said earlier this month that the government can keep the cost of issuing bonds low as the central bank anchors interest rates at ultra low levels to stimulate prices.
The economists see only slight tweaks to the BOJ’s growth outlook and no change to its price forecasts, including its -0.5% projection for the year ending in March, according the median estimate in the survey.

Investing.com – The pound remained off session lows against the dollar Friday, shrugging over a further souring of trade talks between the U.K. and EU after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said talks were ""over"" unless there was a fundamental change from the economic bloc.
GBP/USD rose 0.06% to $1.2920, above its session low of $1.2866.
""There is only any point in Michel Barnier coming to London next week if he's prepared to address all the issues on the basis of a legal text in an accelerated way, without the UK required to make all the moves or to discuss the practicalities of travel and haulage,"" the official spokesman for the prime minister said, according to media reports.
Just a day earlier, EU leaders dropped their commitment to work ""intensively"" with the U.K. to reach a trade deal and said Britain would need to ""make the necessary moves"" to secure an agreement.
Level playing field commitments, fisheries, and issues of governance continue to be key sticking points holding up progress on trade talks.
Negotiators on both sides have confirmed, however, they will be in touch via telephone next week.
The lack of progress on a deal and the surge in Covid-19 infections have some on Wall Street earmarking bets against the GBP/USD against a favorable trade next week.
""We are recommending a short tactical GBP/USD trade idea to reflect higher Brexit risks in the week ahead after the EU leaders summit failed to make progress on a trade deal,"" MUFG notes. ""The outlook for the UK economy is darkening heading into year end which could encourage the BoE to deliver more stimulus next month,"" it added."
113,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan surged past a key technical level, a sign that the central bank may soon be forced to rein in further strength in the currency.
The gains, which pushed both the onshore and offshore rates past 6.7 per dollar, accelerated just an hour before the official close at 4:30 p.m. in Shanghai. The close was the center of attention earlier this week amid speculation the central bank was using it to influence its daily reference rate on the following day.
Currency traders may also be preparing for a stronger-than-expected set of economic data from China, with reports on gross domestic product, industrial production and retail sales due Monday.
The offshore rate was 0.25% stronger at 6.6966 per dollar at 4:13 p.m. The onshore yuan rose 33% to 6.7025.
After starting the week with its biggest drop since March, the yuan is close to erasing all losses since the People’s Bank of China scrapped a two-year rule that made it expensive to bet against the currency. Beijing may now need to take more measures to rein in the appreciation, including guiding the yuan lower with weaker reference rates.
More aggressive measures include tweaking the fixing formula or relaxing capital controls installed in the aftermath of a shock devaluation five years ago.
The Chinese exchange rate posted its best quarterly advance since early 2008 in the three months through June, as the dollar slumped and the yuan’s wide interest-rate premium over the rest of the world attracted foreign inflows."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, heading for its best week of the month as rising coronavirus cases prompt nervous traders to seek out this safe haven.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up just 0.01% at 93.873, posting gains of around 0.8% this week, its best weekly performance since late September. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1697, down over 1% this week, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.33. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD was hit hardest, dropping 0.2% to 0.7076, off over 2% this week to a more than two week low.
The prime driver of this move back into the dollar as a safe haven has been the spike in Covid-19 cases on both sides of the Atlantic, triggering fears of fresh lockdowns and worries over the detrimental impact on economic recovery.
In Europe, London is set to enter a tighter lockdown from midnight, while Paris, and a number of other major French cities, is set to suffer a curfew for the next four weeks. The news isn’t much better in the U.S., with Midwestern states battling a surge of new cases as temperatures drop.
Throw in U.S. initial jobless claims moving in the wrong direction once again and little chance of new fiscal stimulus ahead of November’s elections, and it’s easy to see why traders may choose to shun riskier currencies at this time.
“With the probability of a pre-election U.S. fiscal stimulus declining further overnight and the ongoing deterioration of the Covid situation in Europe (accompanied by further restrictions, the latest being the night-time curfew in selected French cities, including Paris), the dollar should retain support,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.2893, 1.2% lower this week after suffering heavy selling overnight following the European Union's demand that Britain offer more concessions to secure a trade deal or brace for a disorderly end to the post-Brexit transition period in three months.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to respond Friday, but given it was his hardline stance on the negotiations which propelled him to power, backing down will be complicated.
The United Kingdom formally left the EU on Jan. 31, but the two sides are haggling over a deal that would govern around $900 billion in annual trade when informal membership - known as the transition period - ends on Dec. 31.

115,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart said the coronavirus pandemic is turning into a major economic crisis and warned of the possibility of a financial crisis emerging.
“This did not start as a financial crisis but it is morphing into a major economic crisis, with very serious financial consequences,” Reinhart said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There’s a long road ahead.”
Reinhart, who took her new role in June, is best known for her work with then-Harvard colleague Kenneth Rogoff on the last financial crisis in their 2009 book “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.” It made the pair the go-to resource on the history of government defaults, recessions, bank runs, currency selloffs, and inflationary spikes.
Asked whether central banks buying bonds to keep yields low is ultimately a zero-sum game when everyone’s doing it, Reinhart said, “This is a war. During wars governments finance their war expenditures however they can and right now there are dire needs.”
“The scenario we are in is not a sustainable one,” she added.
Reinhart spoke after the world’s richest nations agreed to renew a debt-relief initiative for the poorest through at least the first half of 2021, falling short of the World Bank’s call for a full-year extension.

China is owed almost 60% of the money that the world’s poorest nations would be due to repay this year, according to World Bank data. It has made many loans to developing countries with terms that aren’t transparent and at higher interest rates than the nations can afford, the bank’s president said in August.
Asked about China not participating in the debt-suspension relief, Reinhart said the nation was in fact involved, just “less than fully.”
The China Development Bank, a major lender, hasn’t joined the effort, nor have private sector creditors, she said. “Full participation is something we should strive for but unfortunately haven’t yet seen.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, continuing a downward trend despite investors turning to safe-haven assets over ever surging number of global COVID-19 cases and the U.S. Congress’ continuous stall on passing the latest stimulus measures ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 93.832 by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT). However, the dollar saw its largest weekly rise since late September as it has gained 0.8% so far during the past week.
Europe and the U.K. implemented fresh restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, and the number of cases in the U.S. also rose, with Midwestern states battling a surge of new cases as temperatures drop.
The spike in cases on both sides of the Atlantic triggered fears of fresh lockdowns and worries over the detrimental impact on economic recovery.
“Markets fear a slowdown in activity as new virus cases rise … the deterioration is evident everywhere across Europe, which is a major blow to the recovery’s momentum and reinforces deflationary risks,” ANZ bank analysts including Susan Kilsby and David Croy said in a note.
With 898,000 Americans claiming unemployment over the past week, higher than the 825,000 claims forecast and hitting a two-month high, the data suggested bumps ahead in the road to recovery.
“The data is consistent with the idea that the spread of COVID-19 and removal of fiscal stimulus have seen a stalling of the economic recovery,” NAB FX strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the stalemate over the stimulus measures continues, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejecting an offer by President Donald Trump to raise the price tag on this $1.8 trillion offer.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.17% to 105.27. However, the safe-have yen recorded a 0.2% rise for the week.
The Antipodean risk sensitive currencies were mixed, with the AUD seeing losses, but the NZD reporting gains against the dollar. The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 0.7080, losing 2% for the week as investors are still digesting dovish comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.6596, with Jacinda Arden widely expected to win the general election taking place on Oct. 17.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.7420. China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee is set to adopt a new law restricting sensitive exports vital to national security on Saturday. Once adopted, the law will apply to all companies in China, including foreign-invested ones, and threatens to increase U.S.-China tensions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was headed for its best week of the month on Friday, as surging coronavirus cases and stalled progress toward U.S. stimulus had nervous investors seeking safe assets.
As fresh curbs to combat COVID-19 were introduced in Europe and Britain, the world's reserve currency surged to a two-week high of 93.910 against a basket of currencies (=USD). It held just below that peak in Asian morning trade.
London enters a tighter COVID-19 lockdown from midnight, which with a curfew in Paris leaves two of Europe's largest cities living under state-imposed restrictions.
The U.S. Midwest is also battling record surges in new cases as temperatures get colder, prompting authorities to set up a field hospital in the suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in case of an overflow of patients from hospital wards.
""Markets fear a slowdown in activity as new virus cases rise,"" ANZ bank analysts Susan Kilsby and David Croy said in a note.
""The deterioration is evident everywhere across Europe, which is a major blow to the recovery's momentum and reinforces deflationary risks.""
Risk sensitive currencies were hit hardest, with the Australian dollar  dropping almost 1% on Thursday to a more than two week low of $0.7057. It has lost 2% for the week, weighed also by a dovish central bank speech. [AUD/]
The kiwi  fell by 1% on Thursday to $0.6577 and both Antipodeans sat just above their troughs on Friday. The Norwegian krone  is nursing a 2.4% loss this week.
The euro (EUR=) fell 0.3% against the dollar overnight and has lost about 1% for the week so far as worries gather. The U.S. dollar has gained 0.8% against a basket of currencies so far this week, its largest weekly rise since late September.
Dollar demand pushed even the safe-haven yen lower on Thursday, though the Japanese currency is up 0.2% for the week. The yen  was last steady at 105.38 per dollar.
The lockdown worries driving the selloff come as hopes for U.S. stimulus before the Nov. 3 election fade and as data shows cracks emerging in the recovery.
Weekly U.S. jobless claims rose by more than expected and hit a two-month high last week, increasing concerns the pandemic is causing lasting damage to the labour market. Some 25 million Americans are on jobless benefits.
""The data is consistent with the idea that the spread of COVID-19 and removal of fiscal stimulus have seen a stalling of the economic recovery,"" said NAB FX strategist Rodrigo Catril.
Stimulus plans, meanwhile, are bogged down in a three-way negotiation between the White House, Senate Republicans and House Democrats.
President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was willing to raise his offer of $1.8 trillion for a COVID-19 relief deal, but the idea was nixed by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Sterling was also heavily sold overnight, dropping more than 0.8% to $1.2891 on concerns about the obstacles keeping the European Union and Britain from reaching a Brexit trade deal. Sterling  was last at $1.2902.
The European Union has put the onus on Britain to compromise on their new economic partnership or stand ready for trade disruptions in less than 80 days.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will respond and set out his approach to the talks on Friday.

Investing.com – The pound fell sharply against the dollar on Thursday, after EU leaders did not commit to work ""intensively"" with the UK to reach a trade deal and placed the onus on Britain to ""make the necessary moves"" to secure an agreement.
GBP/USD fell 0.82% to $1.2904.
Following the conclusion of the first day of the European summit, Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator said the level playing field commitments, fisheries and issues of governance remained key sticking points holding up progress on trade talks.
EU leaders also called on the UK to make further concessions to reach a deal on trade, drawing criticism from UK Brexit negotiator David Frost.
""Surprised EU is no longer committed to working 'intensively' to reach a future partnership,” Frost said in a Tweet. ""Also surprised by suggestion that to get an agreement all future moves must come from U.K. It’s an unusual approach to conducting a negotiation.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announced his decision on Friday, whether the UK will walk away or continue talks.
The lack of progress on talks come as the U.K. faces an aggressive second wave of the coronavirus that has forced the government to impose lockdown restrictions that could slow the recovery.
""With less generous financial support on offer from the government for businesses most affected by the restrictions, however, the moves might accelerate the labour market shakeout already underway, and accentuate a leveling off of the UK economic recovery that has been evident in many recent data series, including transport use,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said."

Russian companies that don’t rely heavily on imports “are in a sweet spot right now,” Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said in an interview on Wednesday.
The Kremlin has introduced measures to get companies to be less reliant on imports since U.S. and European sanctions curbed Russia’s access to international markets in 2014. Manturov said three years ago that a ruble rate of 62 per dollar would be an optimal level for the policy to blossom. The currency was trading near 78 per dollar on Thursday.
The ruble is one of the worst-performing currencies in emerging markets this year due to a slump in global oil prices and concern the U.S. and European Union may introduce new sanctions. Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said in parliament Thursday that the currency is undervalued, while the central bank has warned the devaluation may push inflation above a 4% target.
After a deep slump in the second quarter, the Russian economy bounced back over the summer after many lockdown restrictions were lifted. Industrial production will probably only shrink 4.5% for the full year, while manufacturing will contract 2%, Manturov said.
Virus infections have surged in recent weeks, with daily tallies surpassing levels reached in the spring. Manturov said the government isn’t discussing any plans to prolong support measures for businesses.
“We hope that the peak is over,” Manturov said. “The recovery was very quick in many industries.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday on safe haven inflows as coronavirus cases continue to mount and the idea of pre-election stimulus in the U.S. is officially consigned to the trash.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.483. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1740, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.28. The risk-sensitive AUD/USD dropped 0.7% to a one-week low of 0.7110, weighed by Australia’s central bank chief hinting at a possible rate cut or bond buying.
The French government on Wednesday declared a public health state of emergency as the increase of coronavirus cases in the country reached worrying levels. 
France is just one of a number of countries battling a second wave of the Covid-19 virus, with new cases hitting 100,000 daily in Europe, and governments are having to make tough decisions on localized lockdowns.
This comes as U.S. stimulus plans appear to fatally bogged down, as far as having a timeline ahead of the elections in early November is concerned.
""Getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, adding that he and Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are still ""far apart"" on their spending priorities.
Delay has supported the dollar for a few weeks, by weighing on investors' sentiment and boosting demand for safer assets.
That said, many traders are now looking past the election, with the polls increasingly suggesting a victory for the Democrat candidate Joe Biden.
“We think a Democratic ‘Blue Wave’ would be good for risk and bad for the dollar in 2021 – but clearly many things have to fall into place, not least Covid-19 second waves remaining contained at local levels,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“We favour a continued period of consolidation in FX markets over the next month. That should see EUR/USD trading in a 1.17-1.20 range. Thereafter our preference remains for a rally to 1.25 throughout 2021 as clarity emerges on a potential Biden White House and what it means for a return to a rules-based trading system,” ING added.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded largely unchanged at 1.3006, remaining near the key 1.30 level with the European Union and Britain now expected to prolong Brexit talks past a mid-October deadline to try to overcome a few tricky issues holding up a new trade agreement.
European Union leaders are set to meet in Brussels later Thursday to discuss progress in the Brexit discussions. 
Although the two sides retain differences on the three key issues of fisheries, fair competition and methods of solving disputes, with cable around 1.30, the forex market seems to expect progress in the near future.
""Given the rising concerns of COVID 19 into a cold and wet European winter, the last thing either side need, but more so the UK, is a move to WTO tariffs,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, in a Reuters report. ""The prospect of a Free Trade Agreement, therefore, seems high.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar inched higher on Thursday as rising coronavirus cases and scant progress towards a U.S. stimulus deal unsettled investors, while the Aussie dropped to a one-week low after the central bank chief hinted of a possible rate cut or bond buying.
France has imposed curfews as autumn brings a steep rise in infections, and the fear is that a new wave of lockdowns could stall the global recovery just as hopes for U.S. stimulus before the Nov. 3 election are fading.
The safe-haven yen  stayed just shy of a two-week peak on the dollar. The greenback held or gained ground elsewhere, except against sterling which had jumped on signs of progress in Brexit talks.
The Australian dollar  lost half a percent to $0.7129 after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe mentioned bond buying and a small rate cut as among options for policy support during the next stages of recovery.
Lowe said Australia's 10-year yield was among the highest in the developed world and the central bank was studying what benefits could come from buying longer-dated debt. He said it was possible to move rates from a record low 0.25% to 0.1%.
""These are pretty explicit policy options,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow. ""There was enough vibe in there for the market to lean towards (thinking) that they will do something.""
Slightly better-than-expected Australian employment data did little to shift those expectations.
Money markets <0#YIB> are priced for a November rate cut and bond markets think the RBA could start buying further along the curve, with 10-year bond futures  up 8.5 ticks to their highest since April. 
Meanwhile, U.S. stimulus plans appear bogged down.
""Getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Wednesday, adding that he and Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are still ""far apart"" on their spending priorities.
Delay has supported the dollar for a few weeks, by weighing on investors' sentiment and boosting demand for safer assets.
But a full blown rally has so far been staved off by the expectation that spending happens eventually. Against a basket of currencies the greenback was steady at 93.428 (=USD).
""Do not rule out a more defensive tilt as we approach the U.S. elections, providing some support for the dollar,"" OCBC Bank strategist Terence Wu said in a note on Thursday.
Sterling  clung to a 0.5% overnight gain as the European Union and Britain were set to prolong Brexit talks past a mid-October deadline to try to bridge stubborn gaps holding up a new trade agreement, according to sources and documents.
European Union leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday will pressure Britain for concessions, saying a trillion euros worth of trade could be sunk if London does not budge on fisheries, fair competition and solving disputes.
""The right noises seem to be heard from key officials,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone.

""Given the rising concerns of COVID 19 into a cold and wet European winter, the last thing either side need, but more so the UK, is a move to WTO tariffs,"" he said. ""The prospect of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), therefore, seems high.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, despite the ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases and the U.S. Congress’ lack of progress towards passing the latest stimulus measures ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election continuing to dampen investor sentiment.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 93.398 by 9:58 PM ET (1:58 AM GMT).
The impasse over the measures continues, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warning on Wednesday that “Getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult.” Mnuchin added that he and House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi remain “far apart” on their spending priorities. With the election only weeks away, investors’ risk aversion gave the greenback a short-term boost.
France triggered fears of a fresh waves of global lockdowns as it imposed curfews to curb the rising number of COVID-19 cases.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% to 105.25, above a two-week high of 105.04 seen during the previous session.
The AUD/USD pair was down 0.26% to 0.7144, in the wake of Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe teased bond buying and a small rate cut among RBA’s options for policy support on the road to recovery.
With Australia’s ten-year yield among the highest in the developed world, Lowe said that RBA was looking at the benefits from buying longer-dated debt, adding that a rate cut to 0.10% from the current, record low 0.25% was also possible.
Markets reacted quickly to the news, with ten-year bond futures rising 6.6 ticks to their highest point since April and investors already preparing for a rate cut in November.
“These are pretty explicit policy options that are plausibly going to be considered,” Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow told Reuters.
“There was enough vibe in there for the market to lean towards (thinking) that they will do something,” he said. “Anyone who was thinking about a November cut would be feeling better about it now,” Callow added.
Even September’s 6.9% unemployment rate, slightly down from August’s 7.1% reading, failed to lower rate cut expectations nor boost the AUD.
The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.6658 ahead of the Oct. 17 general election.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.02% to 6.7147. China released data earlier in the day showing that the consumer price index rose 1.7% year-on-year in September, down from the predicted 1.8% rise and August’s 2.4% growth. The producer price index also fell 2.1% year-on-year, more than the forecast 1.8% fall and the 2% fall reported in August.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3018, passing the 1.3 mark. The pound helped onto its gains from the previous session over signs of progress in the U.K.’s Brexit talks with the European Union (EU). The two parties are also likely to extend the talks past Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s self-imposed Oct.15 deadline to reach a deal, in order to work through their remaining differences.
“This was seen as a positive for sterling because there was some risk that Johnson might tell his EU counterparts that he was walking away,” National Australia Bank’s head of FX Ray Attrill told Reuters."

Investing.com – The pound rose against the dollar Wednesday as investors continued to bet the UK and EU will agree to a trade deal even as talks on fisheries continue to stall progress and Prime Minister Boris appears unwilling to rule out walking away from negotiations.
GP/USD rose 0.72% to $1.303.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly set to decide on Friday whether to walk away or continue talks with the EU, according to UK media reports. The prime minister will continue negotiations with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen later on Wednesday. 
The reports come just hours after hopes were boosted that a no-deal Brexit would be avoided as the prime minister was reported to be willing to continue talks to secure a trade deal beyond his suggested deadline Thursday, according to Sky News.
Ahead of the two-day European summit on Thursday, Angela Merkel has called for EU leaders to be more realistic in accepting Britain’s negotiating position on fisheries, which remains a key sticking point in trade talks.
""There are still differences, with fisheries being the starkest. We need to get substance settled and not having a common text to work from has made progress doubly difficult,"" a UK spokesperson, Sky News reported.
Analysts have trimmed forecast for a no deal Brexit in recent days, with TD Bank cutting its odds of ""hard Brexit"" to 20%-to-25% from around 40% previously.  A no-deal Brexit ""probably would come more as an ‘accident’ at this stage than by intent,” TD Bank Strategist Ned Rumpeltin said.
""There are limits to that, however, as the market will eventually turn its attention to some of the other difficulties the U.K. economy now faces,"" Rumpeltin added."
124,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound erased its losses after the U.K. signaled it wouldn’t immediately abandon Brexit trade talks.
Sterling recovered against both the dollar and the euro after an earlier drop, following a report that European Union leaders meeting Thursday in Brussels will say progress hasn’t been sufficient.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously said he will walk away from the talks if there is no clear progress by the summit. He’ll now make a decision on whether to end talks after this week’s meeting, according to a person close to the negotiations.
The pound rose as much as 0.3%, before trading little changed at $1.2928 as of 10:35 a.m. in London. It was up 0.1% against the euro at 90.66 pence.
“As has been the case in the past, whenever the Brexit threat was pushed further into the future, the pound tended to recover some ground,” said Valentin Marinov, head of G-10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “While this will not remove the cloud of Brexit uncertainty hanging over the pound, it will give the pound some breathing space, with investors now focusing on November for a potential breakthrough in the talks.”
Officials on both sides are still at loggerheads on several key issues including fishing rights and state aid.
The pound will remain vulnerable to the trade negotiations, but the odds of a no deal have fallen to around 20%-25% and the currency should finish the year at $1.35, according to Toronto-Dominion Bank.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, holding on to recent gains following doubts about how quickly a Covid-19 vaccine will come to the market, prompting a more risk averse trading environment.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up marginally at 93.567, retaining recent gains after hitting a three-week low of 92.997 on Friday. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1744, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.50.
Risk appetite has weakened after Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) placed its coronavirus antibody test on hold due to potential safety concerns, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paused its Covid-19 vaccine trial because of a participant’s unexplained illness.
The coronavirus continues to tighten its grip on the Western world, with Europe, in particular, hard hit by a second wave. Many countries are now widening restrictions to try to regain a grip on the pandemic. 
That said, the recent losses in equity markets have been pretty small and currency moves are likely to be subdued as the U.S. presidential election looms on Nov. 3.
“Overall, markets may still be inclined to look at the glass half full as they retain some hope around U.S. fiscal stimulus and Joe Biden’s consolidated lead in the polls which lowers the perceived risk of a contested election,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2906, extending declines after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson repeated his threat to abandon negotiations with the EU on relations between the two after the end of the Brexit transition phase.
Johnson’s self-imposed Oct. 15 deadline drawing near and there are few signs of an agreement being reached.
The European Union would prefer to have a Brexit deal, but it is ready in case no agreement can be reached, the Commissioner for the EU's single market, Thierry Breton, said late Tuesday.
EU leaders are holding a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to assess progress. 
Later Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund will publish its latest Fiscal Monitor, which will track the likely path of budget deficits next year as they come to terms with the pandemic's after-effects. The IMF on Tuesday had forecast a 4.3% contraction for the U.S. economy this year, and an 8.3% drop in Eurozone GDP.

126,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China is pressing ahead with a dollar bond sale amid growing uncertainties over U.S. elections and tensions with Washington.
For a fourth straight autumn, China is looking to sell dollar notes with three-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter who aren’t authorized to speak publicly. Some of the shorter-dated bonds have lower premiums than in 2019 during the initial marketing phase of the nation’s last dollar bond sale.
The Ministry of Finance is opening up its bond sale to a broad pool of U.S. investors for the first time, potentially diversifying its investor base and setting aside concerns of decoupling in credit markets. The deal is set to include China’s debut issuance of 144A notes, as well as previously sold Regulation S senior bonds, allowing a wider range of potential international investors compared to last year’s jumbo global offering of $6 billion dollar bonds and 4 billion euro notes.
“144A issuance shows that China is keen to promote its USD bonds globally, including to U.S. investors,” according to Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “China has taken a pragmatic approach to deepen and liberalize its financial markets, and this is likely to continue with or without political tensions with the U.S.”
Officials at the ministry weren’t immediately available to comment.
The fresh sovereign debt sale this week comes as uncertainties ahead of the U.S. elections in November are beginning to weigh on investor sentiment. Issuing the notes in October helps avoid potentially less receptive market conditions, according to analysts.
China’s business-as-usual approach contrasts with rising concern about a decoupling between the world’s two largest economies. The Ministry of Finance said during its 2017 resumption of dollar-debt sale that it would help build a benchmark yield curve for Chinese issuers, which range from developers to local governments.
Initial Pricing
China is selling notes with tenors of three years, five years, 10 years and 30 years, according to a person familiar with the matter. The initial guidances are:

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held on to gains against most currencies on Wednesday as renewed questions about a coronavirus vaccine and lack of an agreement on additional U.S. fiscal stimulus prompted a shift to safer assets.
The yuan was little changed versus the dollar after the central bank's daily fixing of the yuan's mid-point was largely in line with estimates, suggesting authorities have paused their attempts to rein in the currency.
The euro and British pound are likely to extend declines, analysts said, as a return of restrictions on economic activity in Europe and Britain to battle a second wave of coronavirus infections unnerves investors.
Currency moves, however, are likely to be subdued as the U.S. presidential election looms on Nov. 3, but analysts said sentiment is leaning against riskier bets, which should support the dollar in the coming days.
""Many factors are pointing to more upside for the dollar,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""U.S. stimulus may not come until after the election. The People's Bank of China is halting the yuan's rise. There's no reason to buy the euro, and there are a lot of euro longs that need to be unwound.""
The dollar last stood at $1.1744 per euro (EUR=D3), holding on to a 0.6% gain from the previous session.
The pound  traded at $1.2932, nursing a 1% loss from Tuesday.
Sterling also took a hit due to worries about little progress in trade talks between Britain and the European Union and the chance the Bank of England will adopt negative interest rates.
Risk appetite has weakened after Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said on Tuesday it is pausing a clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine and Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) also said it paused a coronavirus antibody treatment.
Hopes are fading that U.S. Republicans and Democrats will reach a compromise on a new round of fiscal stimulus, which would deal a blow to the economic outlook.
Both developments are supporting the dollar, traders said.
The onshore yuan  last traded at 6.7422 per dollar. On Monday the yuan posted its biggest daily fall in seven months after the central bank cut foreign exchange forward reserve requirements, which makes it cheaper to short the currency.
The Australian dollar  was little changed in early Asian trade but is likely to add to its 1% decline on Tuesday due to concern about a row with Beijing over coal imports, traders said.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar  edged higher against its U.S. counterpart.
Reserve Bank of New Zealand Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby said on Wednesday that some economic data have surprised to the upside.

But he also said the central bank's discussion of negative interest rates is ""not a game of bluff"".
 
"
128,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 10:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s central bank is not bluffing when it says it may resort to negative interest rates, Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby said.
“It’s not a game of bluff,” Hawkesby told a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) conference in Sydney via video link on Wednesday. He was responding to a suggestion that the Reserve Bank is only using the threat of negative rates to exert downward pressure on the kiwi dollar and has no intention of actually using them.
The RBNZ has said it may cut its cash rate into negative territory early next year to stoke inflation as the coronavirus pandemic drives up unemployment. Its counterpart in Australia has been far more circumspect on the use of negative rates, saying it is “extraordinarily unlikely” to use them.
Hawkesby said he’d noticed that skepticism toward negative rates is “particularly strong in Australia,” and possibly stems from “a desire not to be seen as a basket case.”
“The biggest challenge about having a negative policy rate is the communication challenge,” he said. “How to explain it to the general public, how to explain it as a policy, how to win the argument, how to retain hearts and minds that you’re doing the right thing for the right reasons.”
He said Sweden’s Riksbank was a good example of a central bank that had used negative rates effectively to lift inflation and then managed to exit the policy.
New Zealand Eyes Sweden as Roadmap for Negative Interest Rates
In assessing the alternative policy tools it could use, the RBNZ was guided by principles such as their effectiveness, efficiency, impact on financial stability and implications for its balance sheet, he said.
“The combination of the economic outlook and those principles will determine what actions we take,” he said. “I think all central banks are going through that process” and “trying to do the right thing for their economies.”
The RBNZ is still “very much in the mindset of ‘have we provided enough stimulus, and if we need to provide more what is the best way to do that?’” Hawkesby said. “That is what has motivated our work around active preparation of a package of further tools.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, holding onto gains from the previous session as further setbacks in developing a COVID-19 treatment and a lack of consensus over the latest stimulus measures in the U.S. sent investors scrambling for safety.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.01% to 93.550 by 10:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT).
Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) on Tuesday paused its government-sponsored clinical trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment, similar to the one taken by President Donald Trump during his bout with the virus. The pause comes on the heels of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) suspending clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine on Monday due to a mystery illness in one of the participants, and dampened hopes that a treatment would be released soon.
Hopes that Congress would pass the latest stimulus bill ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election continue to fade, dampening the economic outlook. Although no big moves are anticipated ahead of the election, some investors predicted that the dollar would continue to be supported by the dampened sentiment over the next few days.
Other investors listed even more reasons to be optimistic about the greenback’s prospects.
“Many factors are pointing to more upside for the dollar … U.S. stimulus may not come until after the election. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is halting the yuan’s rise. There’s no reason to buy the euro, and there are a lot of euro longs that need to be unwound,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.11% to 105.35.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.02% to 6.7440. Investors continue to monitor the impact of PBOC’s attempts to stem the yuan’s recent appreciation, after the central bank announced on Monday that it would remove financial institutions’ reserve requirement ratio when conducting foreign exchange forwards trading. Investors also await a speech from China President Xi Jinping in Shenzhen later in the day, in which he is expected to map out a vision for the region’s growth.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7166. Although the AUD was little changed earlier in the session, an ongoing coal imports spat between Canberra and Beijing sparked concern about the AUD adding to the 1.5% decline it saw during Tuesday’s session.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.17% to 0.6659, with the NZD holding steady against the greenback as the country prepares to vote in a Oct.17 general election.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.2935. The pound extended declines as the U.K. continues to battle a second wave of COVID-19 cases and re-implements measures restricting economic activity. Further adding to the pound’s woes are worries about the little progress made towards a Brexit deal between the U.K. and the European Union, with less than two days to go ahead of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s self-imposed Oct. 15 deadline. The possibility that the Bank of England could introduce negative interest rates also dampened investor sentiment.",,,,,

Investing.com – The pound fell sharply Tuesday as concerns about a no-deal Brexit and fears over a looming lockdown hurt sentiment.
GBP/USD fell 0.95% to $1.2940.
The possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal is a ""credible hypothesis,"" French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian reportedly said Tuesday, according to media reports.
The stark warning that a hard Brexit could be in the offing when the transition period ends on Dec. 31 comes as the French government appears reluctant to give in to UK demands over control of its fisheries.
""We will not accept a bad deal and a bad deal in fisheries in particular,""  said Clément Beaune, a close ally of French President Emmanuel Macron, The Wall Street Journal reported. ""We will have no weakness on this issue of fisheries, that is clear.""
The uncertainty over deal comes just days ahead of the Oct. 15-16 European summit, during which EU Brexit negotiator will provide an update on Brexit negotiations.
""The EU summit will now be seen mainly as the point where chief negotiator Barnier updates leaders on key sticking points, with a chance to agree on priorities and red lines,"" Action Economics said.
The pound was also hurt by fears the UK is headed for another lockdown following a spike in coronavirus cases.

LONDON (Reuters) - The performance gap between emerging market currencies and their developed peers has blown out to its widest level in more than a decade as falling interest rates, an uncertain economic outlook and sizeable outflows curb investor appetite.
A group of 10 major emerging currencies - including the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira - have underperformed developed market currencies by nearly 14% this year, according to Nordea Research.
Graphic: EM FX and developed FX https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaymbdva/EM%20FX%20and%20developed%20FX.JPG
That is in stark contrast to the aftermath of the 2008/09 global financial crisis when the same basket of currencies gained as much as 25% thanks to massive fiscal stimulus from China, which in turn boosted global growth and commodity prices and helped countries from Indonesia to Brazil recover quickly.
""A lot of people expected emerging markets to strengthen strongly...but that hasn't happened this time as the carry story has virtually disappeared and we are also not seeing dramatic growth outperformance,"" said James Binny, global head of currency at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Relatively higher interest rates in emerging markets have always been a big draw for investors, but now central banks are being forced to do the heavy lifting to support their struggling economies, and policy makers - in the absence of meaningful inflation pressures - are far more tolerant of currency weakness than in the past.
Emerging central banks have now cut interest rates for 20 consecutive months.
Graphic: Performance of EM vs DM https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvznreevw/performance%20of%20EM%20vs%20DM.JPG
There are signs the easing cycle may be running out of steam with the speed of rate cuts slowing and Turkey and Hungary surprising with rate hikes. Yet that offers little solace to foreign investors who made a beeline to emerging markets in recent years.
Foreign investor holdings of major emerging market local currency debt has fallen sharply to near $400 billion from $550 billion at the start of the year, TS Lombard data shows.
While some of the decline has been offset by investors piling into Chinese local bonds ahead of the country's inclusion in the global bond benchmark WGBI next year, dismal growth prospects mean outflows from emerging markets remain large.
Even by the end of 2022, the economies of Brazil, Mexico and Turkey are likely to be around a tenth smaller than pre-virus estimates, according to forecasts by Capital Economics.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, gaining some ground as the more risk-averse sought a safe haven following news of Johnson & Johnson’s setback with its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up just 0.1% at 93.227, regaining a little ground after falling Friday to a three-week low of 92.997. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1785, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.37, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.7179.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said late Monday it had temporarily paused its Covid-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials due to an unexplained illness in a study participant, delaying one of the highest profile efforts to contain the global pandemic. 
In September, rival AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, also due to an unexplained illness. While trials in the U.K., and elsewhere, have resumed, the U.S. trial is still on hold pending a regulatory review.
That said, the dollar gains are small and the overall tone remains positive for risk as polls are tending to suggest a clear-cut presidential election victory for Democrat candidate Joe Biden. The market is expecting this to result in a large stimulus to shore up a pandemic-hit economy.
“Supporting risk assets and pressuring the dollar seem to be hopes for fresh U.S. fiscal stimulus and investors settling into a view that the Presidential election outcome will not be contested,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“We don’t expect these views to be challenged too harshly in the week ahead since the second Presidential TV debate looks to be delayed and neither party in Congress wants to be seen killing stimulus prospects.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.3041, still above the key 1.30 level as hopes for a Brexit deal offset concern about pressure on the economy from new coronavirus restrictions. EUR/GBP dropped 0.1% to 0.9037, near its weakest levels in two weeks.
“This Thursday’s EU summit is Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s self-imposed deadline for a trade deal, but we expect the deadline to be breached and negotiations to continue in the coming weeks,” said ING.
“GBP net-short positioning does offer some position-squaring upside room, but it's key to note that the size of GBP shorts is still small compared to other periods where a no-deal outcome appeared as a serious risk.”
Also, USD/CNY was largely flat at 6.7471, with China currency’s recent bout of weakening, on the back of the central bank lowering the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions when conducting some foreign exchange forwards trading, halted by strong trade data.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar bounced back from a three-week low on Tuesday as market players bought it back, particularly against riskier peers, after Chinese authorities appeared to be trying to put a brake on recent rises in the yuan.
The Australian dollar lost about a half percent, taking an additional hit from media reports China has halted coal imports from the country as their relations deteriorate.
But overall risk sentiment was propped up by hope that former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will beat President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. election and push forward with a large stimulus to shore up a pandemic-hit economy.
The dollar index rose 0.1% to 93.190 (=USD), trying to extend its rebound from Friday's near-three-week low of 92.997, with the euro falling 0.17% to $1.1794 (EUR=).
The Chinese yuan fell 0.1% to 6.7500 per dollar , after the central bank set a weaker than forecast midpoint, offseting any boost from strong Chinese trade data.
China's central bank announced on the weekend the removal of reserve requirements for some foreign exchange forwards, cementing speculation Beijing wants to curb the yuan's strength.
""Biden trades have been hot in the last several days, in which people sell the dollar, particularly against currencies that have suffered under Trump, like the yuan, the Mexican peso or the Canadian dollar,"" said Masaru Ishibashi, joint general manager of Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
""But if you think that Beijing is sending a message to rein in the yuan's strength, then it might make sense to unwind that trade for now."" 
The Mexican peso also fell 0.4% to 21.270 to the dollar  while the Canadian dollar dipped 0.1% to C$1.3124 per dollar .
A Biden victory is seen as negative for the dollar also partly because his pledge to increase corporate tax would reduce returns from investments in the United States, putting pressure on the dollar even against safe-have currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc. 
The yen moved little at 105.43 per dollar  while the Swiss franc traded at 0.9102 to the dollar , near its highest in three weeks.
Sterling traded above the key $1.30 level as hopes for a Brexit deal offset concern about pressure on the economy from new coronavirus restrictions British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced.
The pound stood near its strongest levels in two weeks against the euro, which changed hands at 0.9043 pound (EURGBP=).
On the other hand, the Australian dollar dropped as much as 0.6% to $0.7165 , not helped by media reports China has stopped taking shipments of Australian coal.
""Despite the positive risk sentiment, the Aussie appears to have been well contained by further indications that Chinese imports of met and thermal coal have been banned. This is important given that 22% of Australian thermal coal exports went to China in the last year and 28% of met coal,"" said Rob Rennie, head of financial market strategy at Westpac.

""We stick to the view that the near-term risks for the A$ are lower and a dip below 0.70 through end October/ early November is still possible.""

The Ministry of Finance is arranging investor calls for 144a and Regulation S senior bonds Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter who aren’t authorized to speak publicly. The ministry is seeking to raise about $6 billion via multi-tranche notes that will likely include three-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities, Bloomberg reported last week.
Officials at the ministry weren’t immediately available to comment.
The planned bond sale follows the ministry’s jumbo global debt offerings in two currencies in November, when it sold $6 billion of dollar bonds and 4 billion euro notes. The former drew bumper demand with orders at more than triple the targeted size.
China’s fresh sovereign debt sale this week comes as uncertainty ahead of the U.S. elections in November is beginning to weigh on investor sentiment with some analysts anticipating a pick-up in volatility.
“By moving forward the USD bond auction to October, MOF will avert risks of facing less receptive market conditions and increased volatility due to the U.S. elections,” said Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. With the Fed keeping policy rates near zero and yields hovering near record lows, China should see a significantly lower cost of funding across the curve compared to 2019, he added.
China’s Ministry of Finance hired 13 financial institutions for the sale that includes four Chinese firms, according to people familiar with the matter.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, despite edging closer to three-week lows and some investors stubbornly holding onto hopes of large U.S. stimulus measures to prop up the COVID-19 ravaged economy before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
“It seems there is a strong optimism that eventually there will be stimulus. It is hard to argue against fiscal expansion given the COVID-19 epidemic is almost like a natural disaster,” SMBC Nikko Securities chief currency and foreign bond strategist Makoto Noji told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, edged up 0.11% to 93.207 by 10:04 PM ET (2:04 AM GMT).
But other investors were skeptical that Republicans and Democrats would reach a consensus and pass the measures before the election, with Democrat Joe Biden continuing to widen his lead against President Donald Trump and a Biden victory expected to bring big stimulus measures.
Should Biden triumph over Trump on November 3, his campaign pledge to raise corporate taxes is seen as negative for the greenback as it would reduce returns from investments in the U.S.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 105.31.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.19% to 6.7580, with investors awaiting Chinese trade data, including exports, imports and the trade balance, due later in the day. The offshore yuan is still reeling from the impact of the People’s Bank of China’s removal of financial institutions’ reserve requirement ratio when conducting foreign exchange forwards trading. The move, an attempt to curb the recent appreciation in the yuan, also lowered the cost of shortening the currency.
President Xi Jinping will also deliver “a crucial speech” in Shenzhen on Wednesday during celebrations to mark the city’s designation as a special economic zone.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.56% to 0.7167, with the AUD impacted by China’s reported suspension of Australian coal imports and the Australian government currently seeking clarity from China.
Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.6632 ahead of the Oct.17 general election, which incumbent Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is widely expected to win.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 1.3043, remaining above the key $1.30 level. Hopes for a Brexit deal with the European Union, with only two days remaining until Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s self-imposed deadline of Oct.15, outweighed worries over Johnson’s new COVID-19 restrictions on Monday. The new system involves a three-tiered system of local lockdowns, putting further pressure on the economy."

The top-ranked forecaster of the Australian dollar sees the currency’s remarkable rally losing steam as a rebound in iron ore prices and Chinese manufacturing cools.
Jason Schenker, the Texas-based president of Prestige Economics LLC, projects the Aussie will edge about 1% higher to 73 U.S. cents by year-end and to 74 cents in early 2021. That’s after a 33% surge from an 18-year low in March.
“You’re not likely to get this catapult up two years in a row,” said Schenker, who worked at McKinsey & Co. and Wachovia before starting his own company. “We’re still expecting positive growth but there’ll be some deceleration,” he said of the currency.
Schenker hasn’t set foot in Australia or China during his 16-year run of forecasting the Aussie. Instead, he puts greater store in studying key commodities and factory gauges like China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index.
The pace of recovery in China’s official manufacturing PMI has slowed to incremental gains in recent months after surging more than 40% earlier in the year from a pandemic-induced low. Increases in the price of iron ore, Australia’s top export to China, are losing momentum after gaining about 35% this year.
“You only recover from a once in a century pandemic once in a century,” said Schenker, who has written books including The Future After COVID. “We’re settling into a period of seeing improved growth, but industrial metals are not going to have as nearly a robust a year next year.”
Rising political tensions between the Chinese and Australian governments also threaten to curb gains in the Aussie. In the latest development, Beijing has suspended purchases of Australian coal, according to people familiar with the order.
His fourth quarter Aussie forecast is slightly above the 72 U.S. cents median of strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The currency traded around 72.12 U.S. cents at 7:40 a.m. in Sydney on Tuesday.
In Schenker’s analysis, China’s manufacturing and industrial metal prices matter more than even the Reserve Bank of Australia’s monetary policy.
He said that living in Texas, a major oil hub, keeps him attuned to commodity markets.
“Our economies are of comparable sizes as well -- Australia and Texas -- and that’s helped,” Schenker said. “Our expectations around the macro piece turned into an accurate forecast.”

Investing.com – The euro was flat on Monday as European Central Bank members reportedly downplayed expectations that it would adopt the Federal Reserve's average inflation targeting measure, cooling bets on central banks allowing inflation to run above target.
EUR/USD fell 0.14%, to $1.1808.
Several ECB policymakers appeared reluctant to follow the Fed with an average inflation target on concerns it could lead to unrealistic expectations about future policy decisions, Reuters reported, citing ECB unnamed sources.
""We want flexibility so an average target would not really give us a benefit,"" one of the sources said, according to the report.
For years, the central bank has targeted an inflation policy of ""below but close to 2%."" A move toward average inflation targeting would see the ECB allow inflation to run above its 2% target for some time to make up for periods of sluggish price increases. In recent years, eurozone inflation has remained short of the bank's target. A move toward a Fed-like average inflation targeting measure could allow inflation to run hot to make up for periods of lagging price pressures.
Just weeks ago toward the end of September, Christine Lagarde suggested that in the current environment of lower inflation, the concerns that the central bank faces are different than those in 2003, and would need to be reflected in its inflation aim.
The sluggish move in the euro comes as signs the second wave of Covid-19 is starting to weigh on growth and attracting the attention of the central bank. 
""High-frequency indicators point to (the economy) losing a certain momentum  […]  We will have new projections in December and will assess how adequate the package is according to new projections but we don’t have a concrete date"" ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said in a live interview with the Institute for International Finance, Reuters reported."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's move to cool a rising yuan stands little chance of stopping further gains, international banks say, as the strength of the world's number two economy and a near-record yield advantage drive big and steady inflows.
Over the weekend, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) scrapped a requirement for banks to hold a reserve of yuan forward contracts, removing a guard against depreciation and sending the currency down 1% for its steepest drop since March. 
Yet an identical move three years ago ultimately proved ineffective, and investors say this time the conditions are even more likely to buoy the yuan, perhaps as far as 6.5 per dollar.
""In all previous instances, the impact of the regulatory change was temporary,"" said Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Swedish bank SEB in Singapore.
""We continue to expect the yuan to remain on an appreciation trend, with USD/CNY approaching 6.60 by end-2021,"" she said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasts yuan, last quoted at 6.7436 , will hit 6.5 per dollar in 12 months.
Much as in 2017, the PBOC's move follows a long spell of appreciation. The yuan has strengthened more than 6% since late May and just closed its best quarter in a dozen years as China leads the world out of the coronavirus pandemic and soaks up capital flows.
Foreign holdings of Chinese government debt rose at the fastest pace in more than two years last month, with the spread between Chinese (CN10YT=RR) and U.S. 10-year (US10YT=RR) government bond yields holding near record highs scaled in July. In another nudge for the yuan to weaken, Beijing granted $3.4 billion in outbound investment quotas last month, the first fresh permission for such flows since April 2019.
Yet analysts say China's economy, projected to keep growing as the rest of the world shrinks, could attract enough capital to fuel a self-perpetuating yuan rise.
Macquarie Bank's head of China economics Larry Hu suggested continued bond market inflows combined with limited unaccounted for outflows, could keep lifting the currency and in turn drawing more inflows.

""The million-dollar question now is whether the latest surge in the CNY marks the tipping point. Maybe, but no one knows for sure,"" he wrote in a note.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday, with negotiations over the latest stimulus measures in the U.S. seemingly in difficulties as the election approaches.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 1% at 93.108, regaining a little ground after recording its biggest loss in six weeks on Friday, falling to a near-three-week low of 92.997. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1814, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.50, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3050, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.7227.
The dollar had been hard hit Friday on hopes that a deal for new U.S. stimulus would be reached, reducing the need for this safe haven currency, after the Trump administration proposed a new $1.8 trillion package.
However, this offer ran into opposition from both sides, with the Democrats saying it was not comprehensive enough and the hard-line Republicans worried about the extent that this would increase the country’s debt pile.
That said, this rebound in the dollar, limited as it is, may be short-lived if Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is to be believed. The influential investment bank suggested the greenback could well slump to its lows of 2018--when the dollar index fell below 89--on the rising likelihood of Joe Biden winning the U.S. election and progress on a coronavirus vaccine.
“The risks are skewed toward dollar weakness, and we see relatively low odds of the most dollar-positive outcome -- a win by Mr. Trump combined with a meaningful vaccine delay,” Goldman strategists wrote in a note Friday. “A ‘blue wave’ U.S. election and favorable news on the vaccine timeline could return the trade-weighted dollar and DXY index to their 2018 lows.”
Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan weakened Monday after the People's Bank of China said it will lower the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions when conducting some foreign exchange forwards trading, a move which is seen keeping the yuan's strength in check. 
The yuan hit a 17-month high on Friday, having gained more than 6% against the dollar since late May. At 2:55 AM ET, USD/CNY traded 0.3% higher at 6.7160.
Additionally, USD/TRY climbed 0.5% to 7.8977, with the lira weakening despite the Turkish central bank raising the remuneration rate applied to lira required reserves to 7% from 5%.
Turkey’s central bank raised interest rates in September, for the first time in two years, to provide a boost to a currency which is down 34% year-to-date. Forex traders smell weakness as Turkey has used up a lot of its foreign exchange reserves during the coronavirus pandemic, and further losses look likely.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with negotiations over the latest stimulus measures in the U.S. floundering and the yuan seeing a drop after the Chinese central bank announced measures to curb the currency’s strength earlier in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.10% to 93.108 by 9:43 AM ET (1:43 AM GMT). The greenback rebounded from losses on Friday, the biggest in six weeks, as investors hoped for Congress to reach consensus on the stimulus measures.
Investor hopes rose after President Donald Trump proposed a $1.8 trillion package on Friday during talks with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, inching closer to the Democrats’ $2.2. trillion proposal.
However, Trump’s offer irked his fellow Republics, many of whom are reluctant to add to a growing debt pile, and potentially costing his party critical support in the Nov. 3 presidential elections.
As the election looms closer, investors are increasingly betting on the likelihood of Trump losing to Democrat rival Joe Biden in the election, and Biden offering a package with a larger price tag as president.
Some investors remained unconvinced.
“On the whole, the big picture has not changed that much,” Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) director of FOREX Kyosuke Suzuki told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 105.60.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.40% to 6.7199, after the yuan touched a 17-month high on Friday in both onshore and offshore trade. The Chinese currency has gained more than 6% against the greenback since May, driven in large part by the favorable yield differential between China and other major global economies.
The offshore Chinese yuan fell in the wake of the People’s Bank of China’s decision to lower the requirement ratio for financial institutions when conducting some foreign exchange forwards trading.
Some investors predicted that the move would encourage the use of forwards, thus keeping the yuan’s strength in check.
“The authorities have not stood in the way of yuan strength, but this move could be seen as a sign that they want to slow the pace of appreciation,” ANZ head of Asia Research Khoon Goh said in a note.
“Our interpretation is that removing the reserve requirement is intended to encourage firms to hedge in order to manage currency risk. It also enhances the foreign exchange market structure by making it easier for foreign investors to hedge their onshore portfolio investments,” the note added.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7230 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.02% to 0.6663. The Antipodean risk currencies saw retreats as the stimulus talks stalled.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.10% to 1.3033 ahead of the upcoming European Council meeting on Oct 15 to 16, where the Brexit deal with the U.K. is on the agenda.

The yuan surged about 1.6% on Friday when the currency traded for the first time this month following National Day holidays, extending its best quarterly advance in 12 years. A recovering economy, a hefty yield premium in sovereign debt over Treasuries and the prospect of a U.S. presidential victory by Democrat nominee Joe Biden are all providing tailwinds for a currency that earlier this year was near its lowest level since 2008.
Effective Monday, financial institutions no longer need to set aside cash when purchasing foreign exchange for clients through currency forwards, according to a statement from the PBOC on Saturday. Back in September 2017, when the PBOC similarly cut the cost to zero following sharp gains, the yuan slumped about 2.5% in the next three weeks.
Banks previously had to hold 20% of sales on some foreign exchange forward contracts, a move imposed two years ago when the currency slumped toward 7 per dollar.
The yuan is the top performer among Asian peers in the past three months through last week, climbing about 4.5% against the dollar. It closed on Friday at about 6.69 per dollar, its strongest level since April 2019.

The euro slipped 0.15% to $1.1818 (EUR=) while the Australian dollar shed 0.25% to $0.7223 .
The yen was little changed at 105.65 to the dollar .
The U.S. dollar index edged up to 93.104 (=USD), bouncing back from Friday's near-three-week low of 92.997. The index saw its biggest loss in six weeks on Friday on hopes that a deal for new U.S. stimulus would be reached.
President Donald Trump on Friday offered a $1.8 trillion coronavirus relief package in talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - moving closer to Pelosi's $2.2 trillion proposal.
But Trump's offer drew criticism from several Senate Republicans, many of whom are uneasy about the nation's growing debt and concerned a deal would cost Republicans support in the upcoming presidential election, denting the risk-on mood.
Still, with Nov. 3 election only weeks away, investors bet that Democrat Joe Biden is more likely to win the U.S. presidency and offer a larger economic package.

Financial institutions will no longer need to set aside cash when purchasing foreign exchange for clients through currency forwards, effective Monday, the People’s Bank of China said Saturday. The measure comes in the wake of Friday’s 1.4% surge in the yuan, its biggest advance in more than 13 years, and makes the central bank’s daily currency fixing a key focus when markets open.
This “may be an attempt to moderate the yuan’s increase,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global in New York, wrote in a report Sunday. “When the PBOC last did this, in September 2017, the yuan fell around 2.5% in the following few weeks.”
A similar move now would bring the onshore yuan toward 6.8650 per dollar, Chandler said. The currency closed on Friday at about 6.6930 per dollar, its strongest level since April 2019.
The central bank’s latest move comes against the backdrop of a slide in the dollar that’s been fueled by unprecedented U.S. stimulus efforts to counter the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. The yuan has just had its best quarter in 12 years versus the U.S. currency, appreciating more than 4%.
Banks previously had to hold 20% of sales on some foreign-exchange forward contracts, a rule imposed two years ago when the currency slumped toward 7 per dollar.
As well as the result of the fixing, the yuan’s move on Monday will also depend on the extent of official intervention to amplify the apparent message from authorities to calm the yuan’s strength.
On the three previous occasions when the rule was changed, it was accompanied by a miss or a change in the fixing rate, although this varied from 0.1% to 0.5%, according to a Bloomberg study. The onshore yuan moved by an average of 0.5% within 24 hours of the rule change and was roughly sustained a week after the rule change.

The dollar was selling for as much as 312,200 rials on the unofficial market, up from 304,300 on Saturday, according to the foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. 
The economic daily Donya-e-Eqtesad’s website gave the dollar rate as 310,000 up from 303,300 on Saturday.
The Tehran-based daily said the rial had fallen to 317,000 per dollar earlier on Sunday but clawed back some its losses after the Central Bank said it would inject $50 million per day to support the currency.
The currency has lost about 57% of its value in 2020 as a drop in oil prices has deepened the economic crisis in the country, which also has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the Middle East. On Sunday, the daily death toll hit a new high of 251.
The United States on Thursday slapped fresh sanctions on Iran's financial sector, penalising 18 banks to further choke off Iranian revenues as Washington ramps up pressure on Tehran weeks ahead of the U.S. election.

Analysts said the sanctions may further deter European and other foreign banks from working with Iran, even for permitted humanitarian transactions.

148,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank raised the cost of currency swaps it does with local lenders, signaling to some analysts it will increase the benchmark rate at its meeting later this month.
The bank raised the lira rate on dollar swaps by 150 basis points to 11.75% on Friday. The increase on the cost of swaps that account for more than half of total funding came as the lira slumped past 7.90 per dollar this week, a record low. The currency, which has lost a quarter of its value this year, reversed declines after the news to trade 0.1% higher at 7.9338 per dollar at 11:41 a.m. in Istanbul.
The move effectively raised the central bank’s cheapest funding rate, which will potentially pressure banks to increase their lira deposit and lending rates. It could also lead to higher offshore swap rates.
“The weighted average cost of funding may rise past 12% until the next meeting,” said Onur Ilgen, an Istanbul-based treasury manager at MUFG Bank Turkey AS. “If there is no clear recovery trend in the lira, we believe a 200-basis-point hike may be delivered at the next meeting on Oct. 22.”
The one-week repo rate, raised to 10.25% last month, has for weeks been a benchmark in name only as policy makers used other funding channels to raise the cost of money and try to contain the lira’s weakness. Tightening by stealth pushed up the average cost of cash provided by the central bank to 11.56% on Thursday from as low as 7.34% in July.
“It is encouraging that the CBRT is more proactive as today’s decision is essentially an emergency rate hike,” said Piotr Matys, a London-based strategist at Rabobank. The move signals a rate hike at the central bank’s next meeting, he said.
The lira, however, may not be in the clear even if the central bank delivers an outright rate increase on Oct. 22.
“The bullish bias in USD/TRY remains underpinned by factors which are unlikely to vanish,” said Matys. “Those include prevailing geopolitical tensions fueled by various conflicts Turkey is involved in and the risk that the U.S. may impose sanctions over the S-400 missile defense system.”

149,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Pound traders who have grown used to Brexit brinkmanship between London and Brussels are making two assumptions: there’ll probably be a trade deal, and U.S. elections matter more right now.
It’s spurring demand for pound-bullish option bets and putting a kink in the currency’s volatility curve, which peaks at the one-month tenor. That’s well beyond the U.K.’s self-imposed Oct. 15 deadline to strike an accord with the EU, but just in time for the Nov. 3 vote in America.
Britain and the EU have been at a similar impasse in the past, only to reach some sort of compromise at the very last minute. With signs that officials are more upbeat -- at least in private -- when it comes to the prospect of clinching a deal, there’s little reason to believe that this time will be any different, the thinking goes.
Meanwhile, the possibility of a contested U.S. election is uncharted territory for markets, and deserves a higher risk premium given the stakes.
Deja Vu
In sign of the market’s positioning, sterling held its ground when the U.K. government warned Wednesday it would pull out of trade talks with the EU if there is no clear deal in sight next week.
Out of a notional 19.8 billion pounds ($25.6 billion) that traded through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation this month, 63% were pound calls, up from 44% in September. The CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) announced Wednesday that it executed the largest single options trade ever, a three-month pound call with strike at $1.40.
Risk reversals -- a gauge of market positioning and sentiment -- also show a familiar pattern unfolding when Brexit negotiations seemingly break down. Initially, demand for dollar upside exposure intensifies sharply when concerns grow, yet quickly retreats after the first round of hedging goes through.
Bets Are On
Over-the-counter trades paint a similar picture. There is large interest for so-called downside digitals in euro-pound and call spreads in cable, according to traders in Europe, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly.
Investors are also going long volatility on structures that expire by end-October, early November, essentially betting that the pound may see large price swings around the U.S. presidential elections, the traders said.
Data Friday showed the U.K. economy grew at less than half the pace anticipated in August even as the government stepped up efforts to revive the beleaguered hospitality industry.
Given concerns about the pace of the recovery, and lingering global risks, options gauges show sentiment over the pound remains bearish overall in the medium term. But for now, the latest bets show a clear preference for the currency.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of seven major central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve set out on Friday how a digital currency could look like to help catch up with China's ""trail blazing"" and leapfrog private projects like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s Libra stablecoin.
The central banks and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said core features should include resilience, availability at low or no cost, appropriate standards and clear legal framework, and an appropriate role for the private sector.
Bank of England (BoE) Deputy Governor and chair of a BIS committee on payments Jon Cunliffe said the rise in cashless payments since lockdowns to fight the pandemic has accelerated how technology is changing forms of money.
Central banks began looking closely at digital currencies after Facebook last year announced its yet-to-be-launched digital token Libra that would be backed by a mixture of major currencies and government debt. The body behind Libra has since tweaked plans and now hopes to launch several ""stablecoins"" backed by individual currencies.
Central banks need to keep up to avoid the private sector plugging payments gaps in unsuitable ways, Cunliffe said.
Besides the Fed and the BoE, the seven central banks that have teamed up with the BIS include the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank and Bank of Japan, but not the People's Bank of China. 
China is already piloting a digital renminbi, with the PBOC saying it would boost the yuan's reach in a world currently dominated by the dollar. 
Japan's top financial diplomat, Kenji Okamura, said on Thursday that China was seeking to win a first-mover advantage in building its own digital currency, warning it was ""something we should be afraid of"".
""I don't think this is a race between central banks,"" Cunliffe said, adding that no one central bank digital currency (CBDC) answer was going to dominate the whole world.
Benoit Coeure, head of innovation at the BIS, said there was no international race, but there was an advantage for central banks to quickly catch up with the private sector and get ahead of the curve to shape the future.

The International Monetary Fund could play an important role in dealing with any cross-border ""spillovers"" from a national CBDC, Coeure said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday as investors start to factor in a Joe Biden presidency and the likelihood of more U.S. stimulus spending.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.528, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.94.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1771, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2950, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7178.
The latest opinion polls suggest Americans are steadily losing confidence in President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with his net approval on the key issue this election hitting a record low in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.
With this in mind, and with Trump refusing to take part in the next presidential debate scheduled virtually for next week, traders are starting to factor in Democrat candidate Joe Biden winning the White House and adjusting their thinking as to what that means for additional stimulus.
“With Biden’s lead extending and the accompanying reduction in the likelihood of a contested outcome, the post-election dollar outlook looks fragile, particularly if larger post-election fiscal stimulus is delivered by the Democrats and the Federal Reserve keeps the narrative of low real rates for longer firmly in place,” said ING analysts, in a research note.
Additionally, talks have resumed between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over coronavirus aid plans, a mere two days after President Donald Trump abruptly ended them, suggesting the Republicans feel they have lost this diplomatic battle.
Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan soared to a 17-month high, as the country’s markets reopened after the mid-autumn holiday break. 
At 2:55 AM ET, USD/CNY traded 1.1% lower at 6.7172, its biggest daily jump in nearly two years. In part this move is a catch-up of the week’s softening of the greenback, but it has also been helped by data released earlier in the day showing that September’s Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index increased to 54.8 from August’s reading of 54.
Adding to the demand for the yuan is the idea that a Biden presidency would result in a steadier Sino-U.S. relationship, less inclined toward tariffs and trade disputes.
""Polls are showing that Biden is taking the lead... it means the risks of resuming a new trade war are getting smaller, so I think this is positive for the renminbi,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, in a Reuters report.

Sovereign bonds rallied after the central bank said it would double the size of purchases at open market operations to 200 billion rupees ($2.7 billion). The RBI will also buy state debt, and help companies raise funds by doing targeted long-term repurchase operations worth a trillion rupees.
The latest measures come as stubbornly high inflation kept the central bank from cutting rates even as the economy suffers from Asia’s worst-virus outbreak. In a sign of stress, underwriters have had to pick up four sovereign debt auctions recently after investors demanded higher yields.
“This was a bond market policy today rather than the money policy,” said Vijay Sharma, executive vice president for fixed-income at PNB Gilts Ltd. Governor Shaktikanta Das “has done everything under his control, except cutting rates, to keep interest rates low through the bonds. The bullish sentiment will remain.”
The yield on the benchmark India 10-Year bond fell six basis points to 5.96%. The rupee gained 0.2% to 73.0650 to a dollar.
“Market participants should be assured that in keeping with the monetary policy stance announced today, the RBI will maintain comfortable liquidity conditions and will conduct market operations in the form of outright and special open market operations,” Das said in his speech.
Benchmark yields have largely been steady this month with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration sticking to its 12 trillion rupees borrowing aim for the fiscal year. The second-half borrowing starts Friday with a scheduled 280 billion rupee debt sale"

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar drifted toward a small weekly loss on Friday, while the Chinese yuan soared to a 17-month high, as investors wagered on a Joe Biden presidency and on more U.S. stimulus spending.
The yuan's leap, when China's markets reopened after the Mid-Autumn break, was partly a catch-up since the offshore yuan has gained against a softening dollar during the week.
But as it extended gains beyond 1%, its biggest daily jump in nearly two years, traders said it provided one of the clearest indications yet that Biden's lead in the polls is driving bets on a steadier Sino-U.S. relationship. [CNY/]
A stronger-than-expected setting of the yuan's trading band also signalled that policymakers in China don't mind its rise.
The yuan  was last up 1% at 6.7218 per dollar in onshore trade and it rallied half a percent to 6.7083 per dollar offshore . The dollar eased 0.1% against a basket of currencies (=USD) and it is down 0.4% for the week.
""I think the main message is that the (People's Bank of China) is allowing further renminbi appreciation at this level,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. ""So markets are positioning for a renminbi rally.""
The prospect of a Biden administration less inclined toward tariffs and trade disputes was another boost, he added.
""Polls are showing that Biden is taking the lead... it means the risks of resuming a new trade war are getting smaller, so I think this is positive for the renminbi.""
Reuters/IPSOS polling this week put Biden, a Democrat, narrowly ahead of Republican President Donald Trump in five states - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Arizona - that will play critical roles in deciding the victor.
STIMULUS HOPES
A growing expectation that, whoever wins, U.S. stimulus spending will flow has also been weakening the dollar in the short term, by improving investors' mood and their willingness to buy riskier assets such as stocks and commodity currencies.
Talks have resumed between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over coronavirus aid plans, two days after President Donald Trump ended them, and investors reckon a Democratic administration would be eager to spend.
""The uncertainty is more around whether it will happen before the election and how big it will be,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney. ""Investor confidence is growing that Biden will win the presidential election by a clear margin, reducing the risk that Trump disputes the result.""
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  rose 0.1% on Friday to put it a fraction higher for the week, despite analysts interpreting a Tuesday central bank statement as a signal of monetary easing to come.
The New Zealand dollar  likewise recouped Thursday losses made after another dovish signal from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and was last up 0.3% at $0.6602.
The safe-haven Japanese yen , which has been sold with the upbeat mood, was a tiny bit higher at 105.87 per dollar on Friday. It is down about 0.5% this week.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, drifting towards a second consecutive weekly loss over higher commodity prices and rekindled expectations that the U.S. Congress will pass the latest stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.13% to 93.502 by 9:57 PM ET (1:57 AM GMT).
House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin resumed talks to discuss the measures, defying President Donald Trump’s ban announced earlier in the week.
Investor anticipation of further stimulus measures to support the U.S. economic recovery from the impact of COVID-19 set the greenback into retreat mode as improved risk sentiment sees investors buying riskier assets, such as commodity currencies.
With Trump continuing to receive treatment for COVID-19 and refusing to take part in the next presidential debate scheduled for the following week, Democrat candidate Joe Biden is ahead of Trump in polls and looks increasing likely to win the Nov. 3 election.
Some investors expect that a Biden win would increase the likelihood of further stimulus measures as the Democrats push for large spending packages.
“Market participants are travelling with the idea that a new round of U.S. fiscal stimulus is coming regardless, the uncertainty is more around whether it will happen before the election and how big it will be,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.

Investing.com – The euro struggled Thursday after the minutes of the European Central Bank signaled further stimulus in the not too distance future amid an uncertain outlook.
EUR/USD fell 0.03%, to $1.1756.
""The outlook remained surrounded by high uncertainty and the balance of risks continued to be tilted to the downside,"" the ECB said in its accounts of the September meeting.
The tone of members in the September meeting was in contrast somewhat with ECB President Christine Lagarde's optimistic take on the euro-area economy.
At the conclusion of the meeting, Lagarde talked up the recovery as the central bank raised its growth forecasts for the euro area.
Incoming data pointed to a ""strong rebound in activity broadly in line with previous expectations,"" Lagarde said.
But the ECB account of the meeting showed that members preferred the bank to remain flexible on policy and had concerns about the pace of inflation.
""Close monitoring of inflation expectations remained warranted, since there was a clear risk that the negative shock to the path of inflation as a result of the pandemic could give rise to a renewed downward trend in inflation expectations,"" the account showed.
Members were also in favor of ""keeping a ‘free hand’ in view of the elevated uncertainty,"" and stressed the need to ""carefully assess all incoming information, including the euro exchange rate, and to maintain flexibility in taking appropriate policy action if and when needed.""
""[W]ith a risk of a double-dip recession in the eurozone towards the end of the year […] we expect the ECB to increase QE, focusing on PSPP, the public sector purchase programme, instead of continuing PEPP, its emergency pandemic response,"" ING said in a note."

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday as renewed U.S. stimulus hopes boosted risk appetite, prompting gains in equity markets and risker currencies.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.562, while USD/JPY was largely flat at 105.97.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.1778, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2948, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.3% to 0.7160.
This move followed President Donald Trump rowing back from previous comments, and tweeting Wednesday he was ready to sign off on piecemeal measures, including support for individuals, small businesses and airlines.
That said, a great deal of volatility has been injected into the foreign exchange market of late as uncertainty has increased - there has been a second wave of Covid-19 cases (France and Spain posted record numbers of new infections on Wednesday), the economic recovery has become more patchy and the important U.S. elections and Brexit deadlines are approaching. 
“We think that uncertainty will prevail for now, and risk appetite could be under pressure over the coming month, as is often the case ahead of U.S. presidential elections,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “Beyond the elections, we could see a rebound in risk appetite, irrespective of the winner – assuming that we have a clear winner, that is.”
With this in mind, Nordea sees a clear risk of EUR/USD trading above $1.25 in 2021, and this dollar weakness is likely to be broad-based against most peers. The ECB's Luis de Guindos, Isabel Schnabel and Yves Mersch are all due to speak in the course of the day., with de Guindos the likeliest to express concern about the euro's strength.
In addition. the European Central Bank is scheduled to release the minutes from its last rate-setting meeting later in the session. Investors will be studying to see if the central bank is preparing the ground for additional bond buying later in the year, particularly as the region’s economic recovery looks more shaky given the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Additionally, the weekly U.S. employment data are due early in the U.S. session, and are likely to show the recovery in the world's largest economy is slowing, especially after Friday’s disappointing nonfarm payrolls release.
Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have made great play over the last few weeks of the need for additional stimulus from the U.S. lawmakers to try and cement the country’s economic recovery.

Investing.com – The dollar crept up on Thursday morning in Asia, with revived hopes for some U.S. spending improving sentiment and whetting investor appetite for riskier currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, inched up 0.0% to 93.683 by 10:11 PM ET (2:11 AM GMT).
After shaking markets by halting the talks between Democrats and Republicans over the latest stimulus measures, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested via Twitter on Tuesday that he would be open to gradual spending measures.
However, doubts remain that any measures will be passed before the Nov. 3 presidential elections, now just weeks away, despite House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi continuing to advocate a standalone bill for aid to airlines.
“It looks like they still can’t agree on a bigger package … if they could get an agreement on that, you’d get a bit more of a reaction and the U.S. dollar would fall,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.
Investor sentiment also improved with hints of even more spending from the U.S. Federal Reserve in its minutes from its September meeting. The notes matched expectations that the Fed would unleash more fiscal spending, but some investors would be open to further debate about the Fed’s bond buying program.
“This nuance did not come across in Powell’s post-meeting press conference nor in recent speeches … in that vein it is worth noting that the Fed’s (Loretta) Mester on Monday said she might support shifting asset purchases to more longer-dated bonds,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) economist Tapas Strickland said in a note.
Fed officials Eric Rosengren and Raphael Bostic will be delivering speeches later on in the day, these could potentially provide further clues about the Fed’s internal debates.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 106.03, with the safe-haven yen sinking to a three-week low of 106.11 per dollar overnight.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.7136. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.24% to 0.6563, with a Reserve Bank of New Zealand official telling a media briefing that the central bank is ""actively working"" on negative interest rates and a funding-for-lending program.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 1.2925. The pound was dogged by concerns over the latest informal Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union.

Investing.com – The dollar was largely unchanged Wednesday as demand for the safe-haven fell on renewed stimulus hopes, while the release of the Fed's minutes showed policy members backed the continuation of low rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.07% to 92.92.
Hopes for stimulus were restored somewhat after President Donald Trump said he was ready to sign off on piecemeal measures, including support for individuals, small businesses and airlines.


The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting, meanwhile, showed the members generally agreed that the central bank should no rush to raise rates and also reiterated the importance of additional stimulus.
""[P]articipants reaffirmed that they were committed to using the Federal Reserve's full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability,"" the minutes noted.
A lack of further stimulus from Congress risked slowing the pace of the recovery, Fed members said in the monetary policy meeting, according to the minutes. ""The staff's forecast assumed the enactment of some additional fiscal policy support this year; without that additional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower.""
Some members, however, appeared wary of allowing inflation to run above target for a period of time, saying it could limit the Fed's flexibility on policy.
There did appear to be some debate among members on whether the economy should be allowed to run hot even if inflation and unemployment meet the central bank's target.
""These participants were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee's flexibility for years,"" the minutes noted."

Investing.com - The dollar handed back early gains in European trade Wednesday, as President Donald Trump’s twitter barrage created volatility.
At 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.737, while USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 105.78.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.2919, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.5% to 0.7140.
Trump's decision, announced via Twitter, to call off stimulus talks until after the Nov. 3 presidential election increased downside risks for an already shaky U.S. economy, with the Covid-19 virus still running rampant through many states, and consequently boosted the dollar as traders deserted more risky currencies.
“This is a curious decision. Dragging out the talks but reaching no satisfactory conclusion, President Trump could at least have claimed that the fault lay with the opposition,” said ING’s Robert Carnell, in a research note.
“By unilaterally pulling the plug, at a time when many states are finding their ability to finance supplemental unemployment insurance challenged by lack of funds, this seems to be a gamble with a low probability of paying off.”
Subsequent tweets from Trump during Asian hours on Wednesday, calling for support for airlines and the Paycheck Protection Program, suggested that he may have had at least a partial change of heart, and this has changed sentiment.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had warned on Tuesday of the dire consequences for the U.S. economy if the coronavirus was not effectively controlled, calling for more economic assistance.
The minutes from the U.S. central bank's most recent meeting, due later in the session, are now firmly into focus, while several Fed speakers are also due to speak. If fiscal stimulus is slow in coming, central banks are going to be placed under even more pressure to add monetary largesse to try and boost their respective economies.
German industrial production fell 0.2% in August, a much weaker result than the 1.5% gain expected,  yet EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.1753.
“At face value, today’s industrial production data is a disappointment. After two strong months in May and June, German industry is clearly struggling to gain further momentum,” said ING’s Carsten Brzeski, in a research note. “However, even if industrial production remains unchanged in September, the quarterly growth rate would still be around 10%.”
Also of note, Poland's central bank holds its next rate-setting meeting later Wednesday, and all 24 economists by surveyed by Bloomberg predict benchmark borrowing costs will be left at a record-low 0.1%.
Record new cases of Covid-19 are reigniting concerns about Poland’s economic outlook and strengthening the case to keep interest rates near zero."

Investing.com – The dollar moved upwards on Wednesday morning in Asia, with investors digesting U.S. President Donald Trump’s shock cancellation of talks on the latest stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.19% to 93.922 by 10:02 PM ET (2:02 AM GMT).
The cancellation destroyed the sense of calm regained in the market after he was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday after being treated for COVID-19, and decreased risk appetite as hopes for the stimulus measures to be passed before the Nov. 3 presidential election evaporated.
Trump’s move also increases the downside risks to the U.S. economy, which was already shaky, but could increase safe harbor flows into assets such as the greenback.
“The reaction is a type of risk-off trade to buy the dollar and the yen against other currencies,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
“Without additional stimulus, the U.S. economy will slow, and the global economy will slow,” Yamamoto warned.
Trump, who is still in recovery from COVID-19 and the virus’ highest profile patient remains under medical surveillance, cancelled the talks with Democrats until after the election via a tweet. However, with the number of COVID-19 cases rising in parts of the U.S., the cancellation puts the country’s economic outlook in serious jeopardy.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sounded the warning bell on Tuesday in his keynote speech to the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) conference a mere hour before the Trump bombshell. Powell warned that the U.S. economy could slip into a downward spiral if COVID-19 is not effectively controlled and called for more economic assistance.
European Central Bank (EBC) chief economist Philip Lane also delivered a keynote speech to the conference.
Both the Fed and ECB will release minutes from their respective September meetings later in the day, with investors looking to comments from several Fed speakers over the coming days for further clues to the central bank’s outlook.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held onto gains against most currencies on Wednesday after Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt cancelling of talks on economic stimulus with Democrats increased risk aversion.
Currencies had only just regained a sense of calm after Trump returned to the White House from hospital, where he received treatment for the coronavirus.
Trump's surprise decision to call off stimulus talks until after the Nov. 3 presidential election increases downside risks for an already shaky U.S. economy, which is likely to favour safe harbour flows into the dollar.
""The reaction is a type of risk-off trade to buy the dollar and the yen against other currencies,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""Without additional stimulus, the U.S. economy will slow and the global economy will slow.""
The dollar was last quoted at $1.1738 per euro (EUR=D3), holding onto a 0.4% gain in the previous session.
The British pound  was quoted at $1.2869 after skidding by 0.86% on Tuesday as optimism about Britain's trade negotiations with the European Union failed to shield sterling from the dollar's advance.
The dollar bought 0.9179 Swiss franc  after rising 0.3% in the previous session.
Trump, still being treated for COVID-19, on Tuesday turned to Twitter to break off talks with Democrats on an aid package even though U.S. virus cases are rising, which poses a serious threat to the economic outlook.
Highlighting the peril, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned that the U.S. economy could slip into a downward spiral if the coronavirus is not effectively controlled and called for more economic assistance.
Traders will look to minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting and comments from several Fed speakers for further signs of how central bankers view the outlook.
The increased risk aversion, however, did not move the dollar against the yen, which was last quoted at 105.64 , because both currencies tend to be bought during times of uncertainty, analysts say.
Trump has only just returned to work on Monday after three nights in hospital following his bombshell admission last week that he had contracted the coronavirus.
Medical professionals have said Trump's early discharge from hospital puts others at risk of infection, and its spread among his most senior staff is swinging public opinion against him. 
Support for his Democratic rival Joe Biden has grown by about four percentage points since mid-September, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling from Oct. 2 to 6, with 52% of likely voters backing Biden compared to 40% for Trump.
Investors are starting to warm up to the idea of Biden winning the election, which is a positive for the dollar, Mizuho's Yamamoto said.
The Australian dollar  steadied at $0.7106 in early Asian trade after tumbling by more than 1% on Tuesday. Traders say the Aussie faces more downside risks due to expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia's next move is to cut rates.

Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar  bought $0.6587, close to a one-week low.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign exchange markets are growing less fearful about the outcome of next month's U.S. presidential election, judging by the fall in longer-dated implied volatility on options, the main measure of how much risk is perceived.
Currency options investors are increasingly betting that Democratic challenger Joe Biden will conclusively defeat President Donald Trump, given his lead in prediction markets and national polls.
This can be seen in the fall of some prices for implied volatility, which measures how much the options market believes spot exchange rates will move over a given period and is distinct from actual or realized volatility.
Biden opened his widest lead in a month in the U.S. presidential race after Trump's positive coronavirus test as a majority of Americans believed he could have avoided infection if he had taken the virus more seriously, the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.
Options are widely used to hedge against expected moves ahead of a major event. ""Vol"" is a key input in the price of an option and can vary for an instrument depending on supply and demand for options and time to maturity. The higher the volatility, the greater the uncertainty over a given term.
Options strategists pointed to flatter implied volatility curves for most currency pairs and said longer-dated volatility, three months and onwards, traded lower than the shorter-dated vols.
This suggested that investors are expecting less chaos and a calmer market weeks after the Nov. 3 election. The three-month volatility extends until December and any view or expectation of turmoil will be reflected in the options pricing for this period.
""The market is assuming that there is a higher probability of a Biden presidency and that there won't be as much uncertainty after the election as the market was previously thinking,"" said James Rider, research director, at currency advisory firm FXvolResearch in Vancouver, Canada.
The implied volatility used by banks to price three-month options on the dollar's exchange rate against the Japanese yen fell to a two-month low of 7.1%  on Tuesday, from a session high of 7.6% on Monday. The three-month vols were also below the one-month level, which hit a six-week peak of 7.7%  on Monday.
This was significant, Rider said, because two weeks ago, the longer-dated dollar/yen volatility was higher than the front-end one, suggesting the market was betting on a contested election.
""My interpretation is that a little bit of risk sentiment has been taken out of the market,"" Rider said.
The decline in back-dated volatility occurred even after Trump's positive coronavirus test on Friday. He left a military hospital on Monday after a three-day stay, saying he felt much better.
Implied volatility on three-month dollar/Swiss franc options at 6.67%  was also lower than the one-month vols of 7.0%, which overall reflects bets of a more definitive election result, analysts said. Along with the yen, the Swiss franc has been viewed as a safe haven.
To be sure, one-month volatility on dollar/yen options remained elevated. It hit a four-week high of 7.7% on Monday, but was last at 7.47% on Tuesday. 
Stephen Innes, chief market strategist, at online brokerage AxiCorp, said that was probably due to expectations being split between a contested and uncontested election.
""There is still a chance that this election remains a highly contested affair, despite the fact that the market pricing the eventual winner is beginning to narrow to where the polls are. The market always remains very circumspect of polling numbers after prior voting debacles,"" he added.
Biden's odds on various betting websites have improved in recent days, with Smarkets.com giving the former vice president a 63% chance of winning the election, up from 55% before last week's chaotic presidential debate. 

One-month vol on dollar/yen slipped to 7.41% after Trump called off virus-related stimulus talks until after the election.

Investing.com - The dollar was flat Tuesday as Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank was in no hurry to stop supporting the economy and warned a slower recovery would keep rates lower for longer.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.03% to 93.57.
""If recovery is slower, rates will be at lower bound for longer; guidance is outcome-based, not time-based,"" Powell said. The fed chief also called on Washington to roll out a bigger stimulus package and warned of the economic perils of too little stimulus. ""Too little support would lead to a weak recovery … Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth,"" he added.
The ongoing pledge from Powell to keep rates lower to ensure a robust recovery comes just a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's minutes of its September meeting.
Following its September meeting, the Fed held interest rates steady in the range of 0% to 0.25% and signaled no hikes through 2023. The central bank also tied its guidance to its new inflation measure, which allows prices to overshoot its 2% target for some time.
The minutes will be parsed for any further clues into the conviction of Fed members to allow the economy to run hot. In its projections last month, the Fed estimated that inflation would not meet its target 2% through 2023.
Ahead of the release of the minutes, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who voted against the Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged last month, said he was wary of keeping rates at zero if unemployment and inflation meet the central bank's targets.
“With the new framework and our inflation targets, I think we’re going to be more accommodative than we have been in the past, but I don’t know if we want to be committing to keeping rates at zero until we meet these targets,” Kaplan told CNBC in an interview."

LONDON (Reuters) - Currency traders are seeing increased demand for derivatives that enable holders to position for a stronger pound, as improved chances of a Brexit trade deal start to push the risk of negative interest rates off the table. 
Sterling is 4% off 2020 highs of $1.35 hit last month when Britain appeared set to exit European Union trading arrangements with no alternatives in place, a catastrophe that could force the Bank of England to cut rates below 0%.
But recent positive news around Brexit talks have flipped markets into bullish mode, lifting sterling back toward $1.30.
""A month ago I would've said (UK Prime Minister) Boris Johnson has offended the Europeans to a point where they don't want to negotiate with him,"" said Mark Holman, CEO at TwentyFour Asset Management, adding that talks seemed to be getting ""warmer and warmer"".
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is advising clients to buy sterling, predicting a trade deal by November.
But many prefer to position via options -- derivatives which allow holders to buy or sell at a pre-agreed price within a stipulated time period. 
Last week for the first time in two months, ""call"" volumes for sterling surpassed ""puts"", implying greater demand for options conferring the right to buy, rather than sell the pound, data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) show.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s proprietary tracker also showed clients bought more pound calls versus the dollar and euro last week. 
Another gauge, risk reversals, which measure the ratio of pound calls over puts, showed that a month ago investors were the most bearish on sterling in six months, at 2.3. This has since halved.
(Graphic: Risk reversals https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplbyqepb/Pasted%20image%201601983450761.png) 
And implied sterling volatility -- an option market measure of expected price swings -- has slipped off mid-September highs.
(Graphic: Implied volatility https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmblewpr/gbp.PNG) 
Demand for sterling in option markets stems partly from dampened negative interest rate expectations; money markets have pushed back bets on sub-zero rates to May 2021, from March. 
For now, traders are not betting too big on pound strength -- there are some $500 million of call ""strikes"" at around $1.33-$1.35 by end-October, DTCC data shows, levels at which option holders can exercise their right to buy.
That's nowhere near early August levels, when $1.5 billion worth of options were setting limits between $1.35-$1.40.
Morgan Stanley data also shows asset managers selling pound futures, while leveraged funds' short pound positions are back near early July highs, albeit far below year-ago levels. 
But with overall bets still neutral to slightly short, there may be scope for a significant pound rally if Brexit talks go well from here.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, as an improving appetite for risk after U.S. President Donald Trump’s discharge from hospital led traders to turn away from safe haven currencies.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.500, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1783, supported by a fourth straight rise in German factory orders that was stronger than expected, while USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 105.69.
President Trump returned to the White House on Monday after a three-night hospital stay. While this doesn’t mean he is completely cured, the market is taking this development as a sign that political risks associated with the election are ebbing.
Also helping the ‘risk-on’ mood was renewed confidence that U.S. lawmakers may be close to a compromise over a new coronavirus relief package after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone for about an hour Monday. They are set to continue their discussions later Tuesday.
As well as Trump's health, ""there is also some market attention on whether the U.S. Congress will pass the extra stimulus bill,"" said Tai Hui, Chief Asia Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a Reuters report.
""If we do see some form of stimulus coming through, I think the market will take it in a positive light as much of the important support from the previous round has expired,"" he said.
That said, moves have been small :the market is awaiting comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as other central bankers, at a meeting of the National Association for Business Economics later Tuesday.
Still, the dollar is likely to see volatile trading in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, according to foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters. The greenback rose more than 2% in September, its best monthly performance this year, but is still down more than 3% in 2020.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2990, helped by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreeing over the weekend to intensify Brexit talks to close ""significant gaps"" that stalled progress. 
This has prompted Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to urge its clients to buy sterling. 
""A joint statement issued on Saturday constituted a clear political signal that enough had been achieved to further intensify technical talks,"" Goldman said. 
Without an agreement, the U.K. is set to leave the EU with no deal when the transition period ends at the end of the year.
AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7157 after the Reserve Bank of Australia left rates on hold, as expected, but laid the ground for further monetary easing.

167,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank kept monetary policy unchanged Tuesday, clearing the field for the government to unveil a fiscal blueprint designed to drive the economy’s recovery from a Covid-induced recession.
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe kept both the key interest rate and three-year yield target unchanged at 0.25%, as expected, having earlier expanded a bank lending program that officials said represented “substantial stimulus.” The most recent jobs report showed a fall in unemployment and the currency has edged back about 2% in the past three weeks, easing pressure to move.
“Public sector balance sheets in Australia are in good shape, which allows for continued support, with the Australian Government budget to be announced this evening,” Lowe said in a statement following the meeting. “Both fiscal and monetary support will be required for some time given the outlook for the economy and the prospect of high unemployment.”
The RBA has been working in tandem with fiscal policymakers, pushing down the cost of borrowing to smooth the path for major spending programs. The government’s budget, due five hours after the rate decision, is expected to see a boost to infrastructure, the bringing forward of tax cuts and other measures to kickstart a recovery.
Economists expect the budget deficit will swell to A$220 billion ($158 billion), or 11.6% of gross domestic product, this fiscal year, and unemployment is forecast to rise to 8% by mid-2021 from the current 6.8%, according to the median estimate of a Bloomberg survey.
Expectations that the RBA would add to stimulus on the same day as the budget increased last month as economists predicted a “Team Australia” initiative of combined fiscal-monetary support. This view was buttressed when Deputy Governor Guy Debelle delivered a speech that set out potential additional policies. These included:
Yet Debelle also said that the government’s September expansion of its bank-lending program represented “substantial stimulus” and was in some ways similar to a QE program. The consensus view subsequently shifted to the RBA staying out of the government’s way on budget day to allow it to maximize the impact of its fiscal plan.
Australia’s recovery looks to regain momentum as the southeastern state of Victoria contains a serious outbreak of Covid that had forced it to impose the strictest lockdown in the country. With warmer weather approaching, a public wiser about the risks and authorities better able to run contact-tracing programs, there are grounds for optimism.
Nonetheless, analysts still expect the RBA to deliver further support as the Covid shock has blown the economy even further away from a mandate the central bank was struggling to achieve even before the virus. The debate is about when.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia over rising hopes that the U.S. Congress will reach an agreement over the latest stimulus measures to ease the economic impact of COVID-19.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, inched down 0.03% to 93.468 by 9:52 PM ET (1:52 AM GMT).
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke for about an hour on Monday via a phone call, with topics discussed including the measures. The pair are scheduled to speak again later in the day. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows added to the optimism, saying that potential for an agreement in Congress on more economic relief measures is still there, with President Donald Trump also committed to seeing a deal struck and passed.
The optimism is tinged with caution, however, as COVID-19 spreads among key policy making figures. The list includes Trump, who tested positive for the virus during the previous week alongside wife Melania Trump.
Trump returned to the White House on Monday after his three-night stay at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which also contributed to investors’ increased risk appetite. However, he will remain under medical surveillance, after White House physician Sean Conley’s warning that the president may “not be out of the woods yet”.
Some investors placed more importance on the progress of stimulus measures than Trump’s return home.
“I think hopes of U.S. stimulus are the main driving force,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
“As for Trump’s discharge, the impact is not clear-cut but it is seen as positive for the risk environment to the extent that there are less worries about the White House getting caught in complete chaos and unable to make decisions,” Yamamoto added.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.01% to 105.70.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.7189. Australia is awaiting the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision, due later in the day. Although expected to keep its benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0.25%, some investors are now expecting a cut to 0.10%. The government will also hand down the annual budget later in the day.

BENGALURU/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Volatility in emerging market currencies will not let up in the next six months as U.S. presidential election jitters mount and domestic economic growth tapers off, a Reuters poll of market strategists showed.
Most emerging market currencies were forecast to weaken or at best cling to a range over the next three to six months but will rise about 2% on average in a year, supported by a weaker dollar, the Sept. 28-Oct. 5 poll found.
Reuters surveys since the global shutdown in activity in March have been consistently concluding emerging market currencies will not recoup even half their coronavirus-induced 2020 losses within a year.
Still, a steep dollar selloff, which just posted its worst quarter in three years as expectations for a swift recovery from the COVID-19 recession made investors exit safe havens, has helped currencies in less developed countries rise. That comes despite deep economic troubles from the pandemic.
""EM currencies are running on empty without capital inflows or a resounding macro narrative. The large output gap and lower level of economic activity will have a disproportionately negative impact on currencies,"" said Jason Daw, head of emerging markets strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""EM FX has tended to weaken in the lead up to and for several months after a challenger victory in the contest for the White House. A Democratic sweep, our central scenario, could result in weaker EM currencies.""
A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Sunday found 51% of voters were backing Democrat Joe Biden while 41% said they were voting for President Donald Trump.
EVENT RISK
The Chinese yuan , the most actively traded emerging market currency but also tightly managed by its local authorities, was predicted to edge up about 1% to 6.70 per dollar in a year from now.
""We expect CNY to continue to gain ground against a backdrop of broad USD weakness and a favourable external balance. However, in the near term, the upcoming U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 is a key event risk,"" said Irene Cheung, senior strategist at ANZ.
""We however see the risk of volatility in the coming weeks ... Any delay in or contest of the U.S. election result could see a prolonged period of uncertainty.""
All but one of 68 FX strategists who answered an additional question said already-high volatility in emerging market currencies would increase rapidly or remain the same over coming months.
South Africa's rand , which has been on a rollercoaster ride since April, is expected to gain nearly 0.5% to 16.5 per dollar in 12 months. The rand's appeal has been enhanced by the lack of alternative high-yielding currencies as growing geopolitical risks diminished the appetite for assets in Turkey and Russia.
The increase in forward volatility in the rouble  and lira  is more pronounced for key events and dates that occur later in the election process,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note to clients.
""The move is consistent with a lower likelihood of a contested and delayed result, but resulting in outsized moves in the rouble and lira as the race, according to prediction markets, has moved in favour of Biden in recent days.""
Turkey's lira  slumped to a record low last month and Russia's rouble  returned to levels last seen in March on fears the countries would get dragged into military conflict in the South Caucasus.
The lira, which has plunged nearly 30% this year, is set to depreciate 3.2% more to 8.0 per dollar in the next 12 months, the poll showed.
But the Russian rouble, which has lost over 25% of its value against the dollar this year will gain over 9.0% to 71.0 per dollar by this time next year.
""Apprehensions around potential new international sanctions and the uncertainties related to the U.S. elections may keep the rouble on the defensive with higher volatility likely until the end of the year,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.
 "
170,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s positive correlation with U.S. equities may break this quarter due to a drop in its carry-trade appeal and a possible fiscal stimulus package.
Data from the last 10 years show the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has risen on average about 1.7% in the fourth quarter and the S&P 500 Index has advanced 1.9%, with the index usually outperforming its foreign counterparts. However, seasonal patterns seen in currencies have shifted in 2020 amid the onslaught of the global pandemic, and with this being an election year the correlations may break even further.
The stimulus will likely boost economic optimism, crimping demand for haven assets like the dollar. Also its carry-trade appeal -- referring to borrowing in cheaper-financing currencies to invest in the greenback-- has been undermined by the Federal Reserve’s easy monetary policy that pushed yields lower.
Should inflation rise because of the Fed’s dovish stance and increased stimulus, the greenback will suffer as real yields drop and shares may advance.
The relationship may also invert should a fourth quarter rally in shares be interrupted by the upcoming U.S. presidential election. In the month before the last three votes, the S&P 500 Index fell, while the dollar rose as investors rushed to haven assets amid a decline in risk appetite. President Donald Trump contracting the virus, possible shutdowns and concerns about a contested election could add to the uncertainty.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The recent surge in the U.S. dollar will last less than three months, according to a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters who said the greenback would have a roller coaster ride in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.
In September, the dollar rose more than 2% - its best monthly performance this year. But the greenback is still down more than 3% in 2020, a loss which was not expected to be recouped over the coming year, according to the Reuters poll of around 80 strategists taken between Sept. 28 and Oct. 5.
While last week's ill-tempered debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden reinforced concerns the outcome of the Nov. 3 presidential election could be questioned and boosted the greenback, hopes for U.S. stimulus have had markets in the mood for riskier bets.
The expected pull and push in the currency market in the lead up to the election was underscored by the wide range of forecasts in the one-month-ahead predictions compared to the previous month.
While Trump's positive test for COVID-19 and data on U.S. currency futures positions point to upside potential in the dollar's recovery, nearly three-quarters of analysts, 54 of 75, in response to an additional question said the greenback's recent surge would last less than three months.
That included 13 respondents who said the dollar's run-up was already over, while the remaining 21 predicted it to run for over three months.
""The outlook for the next month or so is messy to be honest, because of the U.S. election... but the dollar will benefit from the ongoing political uncertainty in the next few weeks,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy, at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Reuters Polls: EUR/USD and U.S. Treasuries/German Bund yields outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gjnpwjodjvw/EURUSD.PNG
That expected volatility was also highlighted in the median responses to additional questions, which showed the dollar could rise around 2%, or conversely fall by as much, in the run-up to the election.
But beyond the near-term, strategists remained skeptical about the dollar's strength as the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive easing has wiped out the yield advantage of dollar-denominated assets.
That was reflected in predictions over the coming year for the euro. Having lost about 2% in September against the dollar, it forecast to trade about where it was on Monday - around $1.18 - in three months, and then rise over 2.5% to $1.21 in a year.
Still, the greenback's appeal as a safe-haven asset and demand for it as a reserve currency from global investors, governments and central banks for portfolio rebalancing and fund transfers was expected to limit the weakening.
""The dollar is a safe-haven because of its intrinsic qualities and its liquidity - as there's so much debt around the world issued in dollars and because so many business invoices are drawn up in dollars on a day-to-day basis,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""There have been investors wondering if their short dollar positions were sensible in the current environment. And you've just seen some short-covering of dollars certainly.""
Other currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, which are widely considered as safe bets, have gained this year against the dollar.
That trend was predicted to be in play in the near-term.
Against currencies associated with higher risk such as the Australian and Canadian dollars, the greenback has slid and that trend was predicted to hold true provided an expected economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis improves the outlook for commodity prices.
Indeed, after gaining more than 2% this year so far, the Aussie dollar was forecast to gain another 3% over the next 12 months. The New Zealand dollar and the Canadian dollar, nursing loses of over 1% and 2% respectively, were forecast to gain nearly 4% and 2%.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower in early European trade Monday, as positive news about U.S. President Donald Trump’s health resulted in traders seeking out more risk to the detriment of the safe haven currencies.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.860, while USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 105.58, rebounding after posting a one-week low of 104.95 on Friday.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1724, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD climbed 0.2% to 0.7172.
Doctors on Sunday insisted President Trump was doing well and could be discharged from his military hospital as soon as Monday, a conclusion that was boosted by the president taking part in a motorcade to acknowledge well wishers gathering outside the hospital.
Monday morning has begun with a more positive risk tone, said Ray Attrill, head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, in a Bloomberg report, with the possibility of President Trump’s release from hospital countering fears the U.S. election might not take place on schedule.
Adding to the general market confidence is the idea that the likelihood of a new stimulus package may be improving as President Trump’s infection brings the virus very close to Capitol Hill, prompting both parties to see the urgency of responding to its impact.
That said, “we still find the prospects of a big fiscal deal very slim ahead of the election,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “first as the political environment remains intoxicated by the Republican turbo-nomination of Amy Barrett for the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, but secondly also as large parts of the U.S. economy still holds a re-opening momentum.”
Elsewhere, sterling has retained most of the gains it saw over the weekend after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the EU's executive, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed to step up negotiations on a post-Brexit deal.
The final round of Brexit trade negotiations are seen as key for the currency as the expiry of the transition period at the end of December approaches.
“While the outlook for GBP does not look negative for next week, we continue to see the GBP pay off as asymmetric, skewed to larger losses should the trade negotiations fail vs limited gains should a light trade deal be agreed,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
At 2:55 AM ET, GBP/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2922, while EUR/GBP gained 0.2% at 0.9072.

Below are three charts illustrating the pressure points for Turkey, where the currency is enduring its eighth straight year of losses, having lost more than 80% of its value in the past decade. 
1/ PRIVATE SECTOR FX DEBT 
Turkey's external public debt burden is deemed manageable but its companies and financial institutions face hefty repayments of nearly $10 billion in the next two months. 
""Further lira depreciation would distort corporate balance sheets more and thus would have negative impact on investment prospects,"" said Ugras Ulku, head of emerging Europe research at the Institute of International Finance (IIF). 
More currency weakness would constrain companies' ability to increase investment at a time when stronger capital spending is crucial in order to improve productivity, employment, competitiveness and exports, Ulku added.

2/ INFLATION 
Price pressures are a sore point for Turkey, which has a history of hyperinflation - overcoming it just 17 years ago. Below-inflation interest rates have failed to check price growth while offering little incentive to foreign capital, further weakening the currency in a country with a persistent current account deficit. 
Data on Monday is expected to show inflation rose further in September. 
""We expect the depreciation of the lira to be the main driver of the increase in inflation,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Kevin Daly told clients. In fact, last month's figures likely underestimated the pace of core inflation, given tax cuts in various sectors, he added.

3/ NOT-SO-CHEAP OIL 
International oil prices have dropped around 40% since the start of the year, providing some relief to importing nations. Yet lira weakness means Turkey has reaped just around half that benefit. Any further lira weakness would wipe out more of that gain. 
Turkey's import-to-GDP ratio stood at nearly 30% at the end of 2019, according to World Bank data, with fuel imports making up around 8% of those.

175,"<span>Oct 04, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Fast-money wagers against longer-dated Treasuries have hit a record in a sign hedge funds are positioning themselves ever more aggressively for a steeper yield curve.
Net short speculative positions in long bond futures saw the biggest weekly climb since 2007 to reach around 209,000 contracts, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Meanwhile, net long positions on 10-year Treasuries have risen to their highest since October 2017.
So-called steepener trades are often seen as bets on reflation, while investors are also positioning for the possibility of greater deficits should the Democratic party prevail in November’s election. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken after Tuesday’s debate showed Joe Biden leading Donald Trump by 14 percentage points. It was taken before the president was diagnosed with coronavirus.
The surge in shorts appears to be related to new wagers on the direction of the curve, rather than so-called basis trades which bet on the spread between bonds and futures, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists including Jay Barry.
“We think curve positioning could be behind those moves,” they wrote in a note to clients Friday. “While outright exposure to duration positions are not large, curve steepening positions remain large relative to historic ranges, and the risk is these trades could be unwound.”
The spread between the 10-year and 30-year yields has widened by more than 30 basis points so far this year and was at around 79 basis points on Monday. It reached near 81 basis points in June, the year-to-date high.
Big Risk for Bonds Is That U.S. Election Actually Goes Smoothly
Similar bets are also being made in the swaption market. Options on swap rates show the cost to hedge against a 25 basis point rise in 30-year rates is at the highest in six months relative to protection against a decline of the same size.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with investors awaiting updates on U.S. President Donald Trump’s health after he and his wife Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19 during the previous week.
The US Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.13% to 93.787 by 10:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT).
Trump’s diagnosis adds further uncertainty and volatility to his campaign to be re-elected in the Nov. 3 presidential election against Democrat nominee Joe Biden, who has tested negative for the virus.
“With not a lot of major economic indicators released this week, the focus all comes down to Trump’s illness … there is a welter of information about the severity of his condition, and that is making it difficult for market participants to make a move,” Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno told Reuters.
Although the medical team treating Trump stated that he could be discharged from Walter Reed National Medical Center, where he has been receiving treatment, the team’s release of contradictory information about Trumps health caused confusion among investors.
Trump also surprised supporters outside the medical facility on Sunday as he rode by in a motorcade.
“Earlier, some traders bought back dollars and U.S. stock futures immediately after the news came out about Trump briefly leaving the hospital … but I don’t think it means that he has been completely cured.” Sumitomo Mitsui Bank’s Uno warned.
The focus will remain on the presidential election, with Mike Pence and Kamala Harris to spar in the vice-presidential debate scheduled for Wednesday. However, hopes that the U.S. Congress would pass the latest stimulus measures ahead of the election faded after House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi highlighted areas of disagreement with Senate Republicans, although she added on Sunday that progress was being made.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.19% to 105.53.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.34% to 0.7187 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.20% to 0.6648 ahead of Auckland lifting COVID-19 restrictions by midnight on Oct. 7.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.12% to 1.2946. The U.K. and the European Union (EU) are entering the final round of Brexit negotiations, with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, agreeing to ‘intensified’ talks during a phone call on Saturday. Johnson added on Sunday that although he wished to reach a trade deal with the EU ahead of the transition period’s expiry in December, a no-deal Brexit is an outcome that the U.K. could accept.
The USD/CNY pair was flat at 6.7908, with Chinese markets closed for a holiday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held tight ranges against its peers on Monday as investors awaited clarity on the health of U.S. President Donald Trump after he tested positive for the coronavirus, sending markets into safe-haven assets.
""With not a lot of major economic indicators released this week, the focus all comes down to Trump’s illness,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
""There is a welter of information about the severity of his condition, and that is making it difficult for market participants to make a move,"" Uno said. 
Just weeks before the Nov. 3 election, Trump was flown to hospital for treatment for the coronavirus on Friday, adding another layer of uncertainty and market volatility as Trump’s re-election campaign seeks to fend off Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
Doctors treating Trump for COVID-19 told reporters on Sunday they are monitoring the condition of his lungs after he received supplemental oxygen, hours before Trump surprised supporters outside the hospital by riding past in a motorcade.
The news came the day after contradictory messages from the White House caused widespread confusion about the president's condition.
""Earlier, some traders bought back dollars and U.S. stock futures immediately after the news came out about Trump briefly leaving the hospital,"" Sumitomo Mitsui Bank’s Uno said. ""But I don’t think it means that he has been completely cured.""
The dollar index (=USD) was little changed at 93.789, while traders adjusted their positions in safe-harbour currencies. 
Against the safe-haven Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.2% to 105.515 yen , after making its sharpest fall in more than a month to reach a one-week low of 104.95 on Friday.
But the greenback edged lower against the Swiss franc to 0.918 , near a one-week low of 0.9163 it marked on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, sterling investors awaited cues from final round of Brexit trade negotiations as the expiry of the transition period at the end of December approached.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of the EU's executive, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed in a phone call on Saturday to step up negotiations on a post-Brexit deal.
Johnson said on Sunday while he does not want the transition period to end without a new trade deal, he believes that Britain could live with such an outcome.
The British pound last stood at $1.2942  while the euro changed hands at $1.1723 (EUR=EBS).
Investors also await the upcoming vice president presidential debate on Wednesday.
Expectations that U.S. Congress will pass a stimulus package to support the pandemic-stricken economy remain low ahead of the presidential election in November.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said progress was being made on coronavirus relief legislation but had earlier flagged key areas of disagreement.
The focus in markets this week shifts to central bank events and any clues they offer about the health of the global economy.

The Reserve Bank of Australia holds its policy meeting on Tuesday while the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank release the minutes of their September meetings.

178,"<span>Oct 04, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Australian dollar may give up its recent gains against the yen as President Donald Trump’s virus infection increases the uncertainty from the U.S. presidential election.
The currency pair dropped as much as 1.2% on Friday after Trump said that both he and the First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for the virus. That follows a 3.3% slump in September after posting its longest winning streak in more than a decade.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar has benefited from nations heading toward an economic recovery after a coronavirus-led downturn but the market is turning cautious and starting to favor the haven value of the yen.
“We see a risk that AUD/JPY is headed lower,” says Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank in London. “Elevated political risk in the U.S., concerns that some restrictions related to Covid-19 will be with us for longer and China/U.S. tensions could all mean a move back into safe-haven currencies.”
The Aussie rose for five straight months against the yen in its longest-winning streak since 2009, before bearishly breaching its 50 and 100-day moving averages last month. Its moving average convergence-divergence, a momentum indicator, has fallen below zero and its signal line, in a sign that that the currency pair’s faces further downside.
The Aussie’s weakness can also be attributed to expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia may further ease its policy this year. While a Bloomberg poll shows that it may leave rates unchanged at Tuesday’s review, markets are pricing a cut in the RBA cash rate to at least 0.10% as soon as its November meeting.
The federal budget announcement, also scheduled on Tuesday, will be in focus as the government is expected to announce tax cuts and infrastructure spending to support an economy facing its first recession in almost 30 years.
Meanwhile, there are signs that money managers are favoring the yen in the lead-up to the U.S. election. Asset managers boosted bullish positions in the Japanese currency to a record high in the week ended Sept. 22, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Below are the key Asian economic data and events due this week:

179,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection may provide the catalyst for hedge funds to catch up with asset managers’ bullish bets on the yen.
Leveraged funds are likely to buy the Japanese currency as the diagnosis triggers a surge in haven bids, reversing the small bearish position they held last week. This would bring them in line with portfolio managers who held a record amount of bullish bets. The yen rallied against all its major peers on Trump’s announcement Friday as investors sought refuge in the safest of assets.
The infection is rattling markets as traders seek to assess the possibilities, ranging from who else may have been infected to the impact on the U.S. presidential election. Nordea Investment Funds SA says it may cause the Trump administration to further harden its stance toward China. All the noise is likely to boost demand for the haven yen.
“A step up in yen buying along with equity markets potentially lining up with betting odds or polling that have Joe Biden in the lead suggest further yen strength is on the cards,” said Prashant Newnaha, a strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. “Although President Trump has indicated he will continue to fulfill his duties, many questions remain.”
The yen gained as much as 0.6% to 104.94 per dollar in afternoon trading in Asia on Friday.
The currency has broken major resistance levels in the past five months -- first 106 in May followed by 105 in July, before testing 104.00 on Sept. 21. Options pricing indicates there’s an almost 80% chance that the Japanese currency will drop below 104 before the year-end.
“Technicals signal a rising likelihood of dollar-yen retrying 104 again in the coming days,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “In the near term, we will see more of those bets coming.”"
180,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s foreign trade imbalance continued to worsen last month as cheap credit and retail investors’ search for a hedge against inflation continued to fuel demand for gold.
Trade deficit rose to $4.88 billion in September from $1.67 billion a year earlier, according to preliminary data published on Friday. The gap during the Jan.-to-Sep. period was $37.9 billion, 80% higher than 2019.
Households and businesses turned to hoarding gold and foreign currencies earlier this summer, a method popular among Turks trying to protect value of assets at times of currency volatility and elevated levels of inflation. The rush for the precious metal risks further deterioration in Turkey’s current account and might add to forces destabilizing the lira, which lost more than a fifth of its value against the dollar this year.
Below are some of the highlights from the trade ministry report:
The lira was nearly flat at 7.7483 per dollar as of 2:05 p.m. in Istanbul. The currency was the worst performer among emerging market peers during the third quarter with more 11% of depreciation.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is set to gain more than 2% against its U.S. counterpart in a year as an expected recovery in the global economy from the coronavirus crisis improves the outlook for commodity prices, a Reuters poll showed.
The loonie  is expected to strengthen 0.6% to 1.32 per U.S. dollar, or 75.76 U.S. cents, in three months from about 1.3280 on Thursday, the poll of more than 40 currency strategists showed. 
It is then expected to climb to 1.30 in one year, matching last month's forecast.
""We expect oil and other commodity prices to rebound, particularly in the second half of 2021,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ""That should pull CAD higher as well.""
Oil (CLc1), one of Canada's major exports, has slumped about 37% since the start of the year to less than $39 a barrel as global economic activity collapsed due to the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown measures. But a separate Reuters poll this week predicts very little upside for the price of crude in the near term.
Next year could be a different story. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development projected this month that the world economy would expand by 5% in 2021 after an expected 4.5% contraction this year.
Economists expect Canada's economy to suffer a smaller hit from a resurgence in infections than earlier this year, as provinces strive to avoid broad-based lockdowns and after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to double down on pandemic-related spending.
Ottawa has forecast a budget deficit of C$343 billion ($258 billion) for this fiscal year, which at about 16% of GDP is the largest shortfall since World War Two.
Government spending along with record low interest rates set by the Bank of Canada have helped support the economy, including home prices.
They have increased more sharply than expected this year, but are set to rise by less than consumer inflation in 2021 as higher unemployment and lower immigration levels cool down the market, a separate Reuters poll showed.
The Canadian dollar could also benefit from broader weakness in the U.S. dollar (DXY) if the greenback loses some of its fundamental support.
""We expect the USD to soften broadly over the next 12 months, reflecting the compression in (economic) growth differentials and yield spreads,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.
Those shifts could ""drive investor diversification away from the USD,"" Osborne said.

182,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, who rose to power by painting himself a fiscal bulldog, is suddenly pushing to ramp up social spending, leaving markets startled and budget experts confounded.
After doling out some $57 billion in cash this year, the president on Monday revived plans to make part of that aid permanent. To pay for the monthly handouts, he pitched tapping into education funds and pushing payments on legal settlements down the road.
The backlash was fast and fierce: Brazil’s real is the world’s worst-performing major currency this week, and his own economy minister criticized the plan as a bad workaround. At the heart of the market’s panic is a widening primary deficit that Brazil badly needs to shrink.
“The problem is there’s no money,” said Gustavo Rangel, chief Latin America economist at ING Financial Markets.
Brazilian stocks and its sovereign debt rebounded Wednesday and Thursday as investors dug deeper into the numbers and decided Bolsonaro wouldn’t carry out the plan.
“The way it would be financed wasn’t seen as credible,” said Camila Abdelmalack, chief economist at Veedha Agentes Autonomos de Investimentos. “You can’t finance a welfare program with a liability.”
While Bolsonaro faces an uphill battle in getting his plan approved, his newfound appetite for social spending still spooked budget hawks. They can forgive him for the unprecedented stimulus needed to offset the coronavirus crisis -- governments around the world pumped trillions of dollars into their economies and few can argue it wasn’t needed -- but there’s little wiggle room for much more in Brazil. Already, Latin America’s largest economy is forecast to post a record budget gap of 12% of GPD this year.
“It’s clear that Bolosonaro doesn’t have the necessary conviction about the importance of fiscal discipline,” said economist Zeina Latif.
Improving Ratings
Bolsonaro’s embrace of state spending comes as his approval ratings have been steadily rising ever since the government ushered in what came to be known as corona-vouchers. The monthly aid for informal workers benefited some 67 million people, or about 32% of all Brazilians, and actually lifted large swathes of the population out of poverty.

It’s credited by economists for saving Brazil from the deeper recessions that have rocked neighboring countries. But its astronomical price tag -- 320 billion reais ($57 billion) -- has stoked concerns the South American nation is headed toward a financial cliff even as it began paring back the aid this month. Bolsonaro’s latest pitch, which is known as Citizen Income, comes with a price tag of 50 billion reais.
The plan is “creative” but inviable, said Daniel Rico, Latin America currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York. “It’s becoming harder and harder for the government to find sustainable ideas to fund the social programs without breaching the cap” on spending that’s constitutionally mandated, Rico wrote in an email to clients.
The move, meanwhile, has also become the latest flash point between Bolsonaro and Paulo Guedes, economy minister and market darling. After stocks and the currency tanked Monday, Guedes batted down the idea of diverting money from legal funds.
“We’re here to honor fiscal commitments and debt,” he said in a news conference Wednesday.
Guedes’s decision to withdraw support to finance the Citizen Income program ​​using court-ordered payments annoyed government leaders in congress and took negotiations back to square one, according to four people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because discussions are private. The economic team now sees any solution to the impasse coming only after municipal elections in November.
In any case, Bolsonaro said on late Thursday that his confidence in the economy minister remains at 99.9%. And major voting blocs of lawmakers have signaled their opposition to raising the fiscal-spending celling again, after already boosting it once this year.
“We don’t think wholesale abandonment of the spending cap is likely,” said James Barrineau, head of emerging-market debt at Schroder Investment in New York. “Ultimately the economic team and Bolsonaro are closely attuned to market disquiet when it erupts.”

183,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumer prices in the 19-nation euro area fell more than economists forecast in September, keeping up pressure on the European Central Bank as it debates whether to add stimulus to support the recovery from the coronavirus recession.
The inflation rate came in at -0.3%, slightly below the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Prices for services were a particular drag in September, with some food and energy also cheaper than during the previous month. Core inflation fell to a record-low 0.2%.
While weak inflation can in part be explained by technical reasons, such as a temporary sales-tax cut in Germany, it also highlights the risks of subdued demand and an appreciation of the euro, which damps import costs.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has flagged that prices in the region will decline in coming months, but said they should turn up again in early 2021. Earlier this week, she said the anchoring of longer-term market-based inflation expectations might have “softened,” in what might be a signal that more monetary stimulus is in the pipeline.
The ECB sees inflation averaging just 1.3% in 2022, far below its goal of just under 2%. It’s currently looking into adjusting this target as part of its strategic review.
Some policy makers have started to prepare the ground for providing more support. Executive Board member Fabio Panetta argues that the risk of delivering too much stimulus is smaller than being “too shy,” and Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos has said weak price pressures show there is “no room for complacency.”
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos this week downplayed the prospect for imminent action however, saying there’s no need to take a decision immediately. If necessary, the central bank’s 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.58 trillion) emergency bond-purchase program could be recalibrated in the future, he said.
Economists predict the program will be increased by 350 billion euros this year -- most likely in December when new economic projections are announced.
Other recent data have been mixed. While virus infections are picking up and raising the threat of new restrictions, manufacturing in the euro zone is expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years.

184,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Asset Management needs more than just the promise of a late-stage Brexit deal to turn bullish on U.K. assets.
The fund is betting that Britain and the European Union will strike a “thin” trade pact toward year-end, yet maintains a “broadly neutral” position in the pound, gilts and nation’s corporate credit market regardless.
The economy faces “Covid-19 and Brexit headwinds, with markets oscillating between developments on both,” Hugh Briscoe, global fixed-income portfolio manager at the firm, said in an interview Sept. 25.
GSAM has held these views through the year, and Briscoe’s comments were left unchanged after Bloomberg contacted an external public relations representative on Thursday.
On Friday, the pound swung to a gain after the U.K. announced Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold talks on Saturday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. It’s been a volatile week for the currency amid conflicting signals about the outcome of a final scheduled round of Brexit negotiations that could determine whether Britain avoids a messy divorce at year-end.
“Despite fragile and often volatile negotiations, I do think the EU and U.K. will reach a deal,” Briscoe said.
Yet four years of uncertainty over the U.K.’s future outside the bloc have already taken their toll on the economy. And the latest spike in coronavirus cases are further muffling the significance of every twist and turn in the drama for some investors.
Financial services firms operating in the U.K. have shifted about 7,500 employees and more than 1.2 trillion pounds ($1.6 trillion) of assets to the European Union ahead of Brexit -- with more likely to follow in coming weeks, according to EY, one of the world’s largest accounting firms.
Despite the bleak outlook for the economy, GSAM doesn’t expect the Bank of England will cut interest rates below zero. Economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said in September that failure to reach a trade deal could be among the factors that would push rates into negative territory.
“The central bank’s commentary has been somewhat nuanced, perhaps because policy makers would like to preserve optionality in event of an untidy Brexit,” Briscoe said. “In any case, we have scaled back our underweight position in U.K. rates.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar and yen rose on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump's positive test for COVID-19 spooked investors, just a month out from November's presidential election.
Trump said on Twitter that he and his wife Melania had COVID-19 and would begin quarantine and recovery immediately.
The yen  made its sharpest gain in more than a month to reach a one-week high of 104.95 per dollar after the Tweet and the greenback rose as much as 0.7% on the risk-sensitive Australian dollar.
Both then pulled back as traders puzzled over how it might affect the election, underscoring market uncertainty around the implications for the November vote.
""The president of the United States has got a disease which kills people. People are de-risking because of that,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""But we're not sure how much this changes the election. The prospect of Donald Trump surviving this is incredibly high,"" he said, adding that the selloff could soon reverse.
Losses in the euro (EUR=) were more modest and it was last down 0.2% at $1.172. The yen pulled back to 105.16 per dollar.
Sterling advanced after Downing Street announced British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen would meet on Saturday to discuss next steps in acrimonious Brexit talks.It was last 0.2% higher at $1.2913 .
The Aussie  recovered about half its losses by the end of the Asia session and was last down 0.2% at $0.7165. The New Zealand dollar  was down 0.1% at $0.6645. 
Both lost half a percent against the yen (AUDJPY=) (NZDJPY=) but lifted from session lows. U.S. stock futures also pared some losses, though commodities remained under pressure. 
Analysts said the next moves would depend on Trump's health, how far the virus has spread amongst top U.S. officials and politicians and on voters' response.
""As far as we know Trump is not gravely ill. It is possible that by the time we reach New York trading that markets will have calmed down,"" said Yako Sero, strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank in Tokyo.
""However, this does damage Trump's ability to campaign and time is running out before the election.""
Against a basket of currencies the dollar tacked on 0.1%, but remains down 0.8% for the week - its softest weekly performance since late August - as hopes for U.S. stimulus have had investors in the mood for riskier bets.
JITTERS
Still, even before Trump's diagnosis, investors had begun to fret that the hoped-for U.S. fiscal stimulus package had stalled in Washington, and were nervously awaiting U.S. jobs data due at 1230 GMT.
With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at odds over what Pelosi described as differences over dollars and values, doubts are now creeping in over whether a deal can be done before the election.
The recovery is also slowing down, and economists expect data due at 1230 GMT to show U.S. hiring increased by 850,000 jobs in September, a smaller gain than August.
Concerns are also growing that coronavirus infection rates are climbing in Europe and the United States.
Madrid will become the first European capital to go back into lockdown in coming days to fight a steep surge in cases.
A record increase in new cases in Wisconsin on Thursday fanned fears of hospitals there being overwhelmed.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Friday, along with the Japanese yen, as U.S. President Donald Trump testing positive for the Covid-19 virus hit risk sentiment, resulted in demand for safe haven currencies.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.797, while USD/JPY fell 0.4% to 105.11, its lowest level this week.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1732, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.2870, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.3% to 0.7160.
President Donald Trump said on Friday, via a tweet, that he and his wife Melania had tested positive for the coronavirus, and were going into quarantine. This follows Hope Hicks, a trusted adviser, also testing positive earlier on Thursday.
“We’ve seen a massive risk-off response with shares down, futures down, dollar is up, yields down. So it’s a very clean risk-off response and that makes sense,” said Ilya Spivak, head Asia Pacific strategist at DailyFX, in a Bloomberg report. “Investors don’t know what to do with it so they’re just dumping and going to cash.”
The virus is making broader inroads across the U.S. as seasonal factors start to work in its favor again. New cases of Covid rose in 27 out of 50 U.S. states in September compared with August, according to a Reuters analysis. Infections are up 4.4% on a seven-day rolling average.
""What this does say is that the risk of the virus picking up is still quite real,"" said Bank of Singapore FX analyst Moh Siong Sim, in a Reuters report. ""The U.S. infection rate is not going down anymore. This reminds people that the virus is still around.""
Risk sentiment had already been damaged by the idea the new U.S. fiscal stimulus package was stalled in Washington. The House passed a $2.2 trillion Democrat-only fiscal stimulus package late Thursday, but this bill is extremely unlikely to pass through the Republican-dominated Senate
At the same time the latest block of economic data has tended to suggest that the U.S. economic recovery could be stagnated. With this in mind, attention will also turn to the official U.S. jobs report for a gauge on the strength of the labor market in the world’s largest economy.
“Evidence from high-frequency data, such as payrolls tracking figures from Homebase suggests a plateauing in private sector employment while purchasing managers’ indices suggest only modest gains,” wrote analysts at ING, in a research note.
News of Trump's condition has overshadowed what was set to be the centerpiece of the day's action - the release of the U.S. labor market report at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

Investing.com – The pound swung between gains and losses against the dollar Thursday as traders mulled differing headlines that suggest little progress on the U.K. and EU breaking the deadlock in Brexit talks.
GBP/USD fell 0.28% to $1.2891, though had been as high as 1.2979 and as low as $1.2820.
The U.K. and EU continued talks in Brussels to iron out key issues holding up the potential post-Brexit deal, but differing reports of progress suggest both sides remain wide apart on reaching a consensus.
Reuters reported, citing an EU official, that were no signs of a ""landing zone"" on key sticking issues, including fisheries and the level playing field in the latest trade negotiations with the U.K.
That cooled optimism from an earlier Financial Times report, citing unnamed sources, that a landing zone on state aid has been identified but ""fishing is the last sticking point.""


The U.K. has made it clear it is unlikely to cave in on demands to take control over access to its waters and fish when the Brexit transition period ends, rather than stick with the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, which set fishing quotas among EU member states. ""So now, we're going to be absolutely crystal clear with the EU …. if you're not going to talk turkey with us, that's fine. We can leave, we can say that's it, no negotiated outcome. We're ready, come what may,"" Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said.
The latest round of trade talks kicked off against a souring backdrop after the EU followed up on its threat to take legal action against the U.K. after it failed to scrap its internal market bill that undermines the withdrawal agreement.
Pressure on negotiators to break the stalemate is building ahead of the European summit in mid-October, when EU negotiator Michel Barnier is slated to provide the EU with an update on Brexit negotiations."
188,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) has notified members of a second case of the novel coronavirus on its eurodollar trading floor, fueling concern that the exchange may seek to close the options pit once again.
The Chicago-based bourse said “an individual in our trading floor community has tested positive for Covid-19,” according to a memo sent to members. The infected person last accessed the eurodollar options pit Wednesday and continues to be asymptomatic, it said. The pit continues to operate.
This is the second time CME has had to notify traders of a Covid infection in the eurodollar options pit since the bourse reopened it on Aug. 10, following a nearly five-month closure. The exchange notified members Monday of the first case, involving someone who had recently spent time on its trading floor. It said at the time that the person had reported symptoms that morning and was last in the pit on Friday.
“We are contacting those who may have been in close contact with this individual, requesting that they self-quarantine,” CME said in the Wednesday memo. “In addition, as part of our regular cleaning protocols, the trading floor has been disinfected since this individual was last in our building.”
CME had already warned that social distancing was difficult in open-outcry trading environments and required anyone trading on the floor to sign a waiver accepting the risks of catching the coronavirus. Pit access is limited to members and their employees, plus CME trading floor staff, who all undergo a temperature screening when entering the building. Face masks are required, and movement within the pit is restricted.
A second case could threaten to force CME to close the trading floor again. The bourse had only brought back floor trading in eurodollar options, while other pits including for corn and soybeans remain closed. When asked whether the CME would consider a second shutdown, a spokeswoman said, “We continue to monitor the circumstances of any confirmed case on our trading floor and will communicate that information to our trading community.”
The company is far from being the only organization grappling with a return to the office. But with its pits representing one of the last bastions of open-outcry trading globally, the exchange faces its own unique challenges with trades traditionally negotiated by people congregating and calling out to each other across a room.

The pound tumbled after a report that Brexit talks were failing to close differences on a trade deal and the European Union planned legal action against the U.K.
Sterling snapped a three-week winning streak after news that the U.K. and EU remain split on the issue of state aid, a sticking point in the trade negotiations. The currency deepened losses after a report that the EU would take the first step in a legal process against the U.K. for breaching the terms of its Withdrawal Agreement from the bloc.
“There is further downside ahead for the pound,” said Neil Jones, head of foreign-exchange sales to financial institutions at Mizuho Bank.
The impasse comes after several days of a more conciliatory tone from British and European officials that had helped the pound rally from a two-month low last week.
The pound fell 0.8% to $1.2822 by 9:50 a.m. in London, and also dropped 0.8% to 91.44 pence per euro.
Negotiators are due to discuss state aid later Thursday, after Britain submitted a new round of proposals on how its rules will work after Brexit.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Thursday, falling to a one-week low as fresh hopes of new U.S. fiscal stimulus prompted traders to seek out the perceived riskier currencies.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.875, just off the one-week low of 93.680 hit earlier. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.1731, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2884, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.50.
This renewed optimism for a new Covid relief package has been based on comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said Wednesday that talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made progress, prompting the House of Representatives to postpone a vote on a Democratic coronavirus plan to allow more time for a bipartisan deal to come together.
Mnuchin said later on Fox Business News that he would not accept the Democrats' proposed $2.2 trillion aid package, rather something closer to $1.5 trillion, adding that an agreement had been reached on direct payments to Americans.
These two positions are largely unchanged from where the parties left things before the presidential conventions. But the need for economic stimuli has become very apparent, with several large U.S. companies now embarking on extensive firing rounds, and the markets have reacted to the fact they have started talking again. 
Helping the risk-on tone has been some healthy economic data out of the U.S., with Wednesday seeing strong U.S. labor and manufacturing data.
The data slate is pretty full Thursday as well, with most eyes on the weekly unemployment measurements, particularly after Wednesday's better than expected ADP private payroll gains and before Friday’s last official government data on jobs before the general election.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY fell 0.6% to 7.6678, with the lira rebounding after falling to a record low of 7.8568 per dollar on Tuesday. 
This follows Turkey’s decision to cut a tax on foreign currency purchases and also cut the withholding tax on new or renewed lira deposit accounts for the rest of this year.
These are the country’s latest steps to ease market restrictions introduced over the past year that have hurt investor sentiment and failed to stop the lira’s depreciation.
 Also, USD/CNY traded largely flat at 6.7908, with the yuan having earlier climbed to its highest level since May last year.
This follows strong PMI data out of China on Wednesday, showing the world’s second-largest economy is still on a recovery track. That said, volumes are thin with the onshore market closed for holidays until Oct. 9.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive at a one-week low on Thursday, as robust U.S. data and fresh hopes for U.S. fiscal stimulus had investors confident enough about economic recovery prospects to seek out riskier currencies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""made a lot of progress"" on long-awaited COVID-19 relief legislation.
Along with strong U.S. labour and manufacturing data, that helped stocks to rally and the mood pulled the dollar to a one-week low of 93.664 against a basket of currencies (=USD). 
Early in the Asia session the New Zealand dollar  extended gains to a one-week peak of $0.6623. The Aussie  rose 0.1% to $0.7170, a fraction below a one-week top of $0.7175 made overnight. 
Mnuchin said later on Fox Business News that he would not accept the Democrats' proposed $2.2 trillion aid package, rather something closer to $1.5 trillion, adding that an agreement had been reached on direct payments to Americans.
""The two sides have come a long way,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow.
""The rhetoric is reasonably conciliatory, I think we're getting closer,"" he said, adding an agreement would help the mood in equity markets and likely spill over into currency trade, boosting riskier currencies at the dollar's expense.
At the same time, jobs figures that showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring harder than forecast last month and that midwest manufacturing grew faster than expected also fed in to the positive sentiment.
Chinese data on Wednesday had also shown the recovery on track in the world's second-biggest economy.
The yuan  edged up to a week-high 6.7804 in offshore trade on Thursday, though volumes are thin and the onshore market closed for holidays until Oct. 9.
Nevertheless, firmness in the safe-haven Japanese yen indicated that plenty of underlying caution still remains. The yen  held at 105.45 in Asia on Thursday, after climbing in the wake of a chaotic first U.S. presidential debate.
It ended its quarter since mid-2019 on Wednesday with a 2.4% gain over the three months to Sept. 30 as some of the exuberance in risk assets wore off, particularly in September.
Gains in the euro overnight were also muted after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde hinted that a strategy overhaul, and a more accommodative approach to inflation, could be possible.
The euro (EUR=) edged up 0.2% on Wednesday and held at $1.1726 on Thursday. The pound  was steady at $1.2921.
Final purchasing managers index figures are due in Europe and Britain later on Thursday, followed by the ISM manufacturing survey in the United States and jobless claims data - all providing an update on the progress of the global coronavirus recovery.

Speeches from Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane, at 1020 GMT, and ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane, at 1545 GMT, will also be closely watched for hints as to the next monetary moves.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Volatility across asset markets is fueling a bounce in the battered dollar, showcasing the currency's safe-haven status amid worries over growth abroad and U.S. political strife. 
The buck is up nearly 2% in September as of Tuesday against a basket of currencies, on track for its best monthly gain in 14 months and outpacing the performance of many other traditional destinations for nervous investors in what has been a turbulent period for stocks.
Gold , for example, is down nearly 4% in September, while the S&P 500 utility sector (SPLRCU) is little changed, and the Japanese yen  is flat. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury notes (US10YT=RR), which move opposite to prices, started the month at 0.67% and last traded at around 0.64%. The S&P 500 (SPX) is off nearly 5% in the same period.
Several catalysts are stoking the dollar's rebound, which has put the greenback at its highest level since late July. The U.S. currency's 8% decline from its highs in March has left it looking comparatively cheaper than assets like gold, which stood at all-time highs last month. The yen's haven status, meanwhile, may have suffered in the wake of a pandemic-era collapse in global rates.
""The dollar's resurgence has ... to do with the response of the capital markets to the global wave of de-risking,"" said Thanos Bardas, managing director and co-head of global investment-grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman. 
At the same time, many of the factors that made the dollar less attractive in recent months appear to be dissipating. COVID-19 cases are accelerating in Europe, threatening expectations of growth that boosted the euro, while worries over a hard Brexit have weighed on the British pound. 
Additionally, speculation over the possibilities of negative interest rates in the UK and Australia have dimmed the allure of those currencies to some investors, although such a move seems far off. In the United States, uncertainty stemming from the Nov. 3 presidential election and the shrinking likelihood of lawmakers agreeing on a fiscal stimulus package this year have fueled haven demand.
Bardas said Neuberger added to bets that the dollar will rise against the euro, a currency he believes is overvalued after a 10% run since March. 
Chester Ntonifor, foreign exchange strategist at BCA Research, said spikes in equity market volatility have tended to boost the U.S. currency, as does turbulence in foreign exchange markets after long periods of placid trading.
Broader currency market volatility, as measured by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) <.DBCVIX>, shot up to 8.4 on Tuesday, from 5.93 in late July.
The dollar index has risen by an average of roughly 2% in the two most recent upsurges of volatility.
Others see the rally as a chance to take profit on the dollar or place bets against the currency, believing it will resume weakening once markets grow calmer. 
""I have been a dollar bull. But I am using this opportunity to sell dollars when everybody is buying,"" said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management, who is selling dollars to buy yen.
The dollar's rally received a tailwind from a ""nasty short squeeze,"" as investors betting on a weaker U.S. currency were forced to unwind their bets in recent weeks, said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management. 
The possibility of further positioning unwinds remains - net bets on a weaker dollar in futures markets stood at $33.6 billion in the latest week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed, near a nine-year high.
But Upadhyaya has added to his fund's anti-dollar bets by buying the euro and Czech koruna. 

""This is a healthy correction that is needed to ensure that a further depreciation in the dollar has legs,"" he said.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, with traders having to absorb the competing influences of healthy economic data from China as well as the contentious presidential debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 94.017. EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1729, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.55.
President Trump and his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Biden, faced off in their first debate of the campaign in Cleveland on Tuesday, a debate which saw both sides trade insults while they attempted to discuss issues such as Trump’s leadership, the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy, and taxes.
“We expect a Trump re-election to be a USD-positive, although the non-negligible risk of a contested outcome (along with the ultra-dovish Fed) may keep the the dollar’s upside somewhat capped in the run-up to the vote, even if Trump’s perceived chances rise,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Earlier Wednesday, Chinese purchasing managers indexes for September had impressed, staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and showed the second largest economy in the world continues to recover from Covid-19's impact. USD/CNY fell 0.1% to 6.8124.
Data in Europe also painted a healthier picture. German retail sales rose much more than expected in August, potentially a guide for the country's unemployment data later in the session, while French consumer prices were flat in September over a twelve month period, as a sharp fall in the cost of energy offset higher food and tobacco prices.
This news would usually also help a ‘risk-on’ tone in the markets, but, as Nordea analysts wrote in a research note, “Covid-19 case-counts and the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election result could lead to a few tricky weeks ahead for risk assets.”
The global coronavirus death toll surpassed a million on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. It has taken just three months for Covid-19 deaths to double from half a million, an accelerating rate of fatalities since the first death was recorded in China in early January.
Investors are also focusing on the U.S. Congress’ progress towards passing the latest $2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus bill proposed by Democrats on Monday, although this is still seen as unlikely to pass through the Republican-controlled Senate.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% at 1.2843, but not far off a one-week high on continued hopes over a Brexit deal as the final round of scheduled trade discussions got underway Tuesday.
That said, these gains could be short-lived as ""nothing has changed,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.  The forex market, however, ""seems to be taking a more optimistic view,"" at the ""risk of bitter disappointment if the negotiations this week do not result in any progress,"" it added.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, with investors digesting economic data from China as well as the presidential debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.05% to 93.977 by 12:53 AM ET (4:53 AM GMT). However, gains were capped by month and quarter-end currency flows.
The debate, the first of three scheduled in the run-up to the presidential election on Nov. 3, saw Trump and Biden chaotically debate issues such as Trump’s leadership, the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, and taxes.
But investors could not decide on a winner, with neither candidate scoring a decisive advantage.
“It’s like as if they are both just insulting each other. There is not much impact on the markets,” J.P. Morgan head of Japan market research Tohru Sasaki told Reuters.
Investors are also focusing on the U.S. Congress’ progress towards passing the latest $2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus bill proposed by Democrats on Monday, after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that a deal with the Trump White House could be possible by this week, with further talks scheduled with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later in the day.
However, some investors were not optimistic that the bill would be passed by Congress in its current form.
“We believe it is unlikely the stimulus bill progress in its current form. The House Democrats stimulus bill is more than $1 trillion above what key Republican policymakers are willing to consider … the U.S. economic recovery is at risk without more fiscal stimulus and as a result, USD is vulnerable to additional upside in the short term,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy said in a note.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.12% to 105.52.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.05% to 6.8119. Chinese purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for September, released earlier in the day, stayed above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and showed the Chinese economy’s continued recovery from COVID-19's impact.
Although the manufacturing PMI was 51.5, beating the forecast 51.2 and August’s 51 readings and the non-manufacturing PMI was 55.9 against August’s 55.2, the Caixin manufacturing PMI of 53 was slightly under the forecast 53.1 and August’s 53.1 figures.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.13% to 0.7117, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 0.6588, with an ANZ Bank survey showing that New Zealand business sentiment improved in September as COVID-19 numbers in the country remain low.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 1.2839. Although the pound initially saw gains as hopes for a Brexit deal with the European Union (EU) rose on Tuesday, the gains reversed on Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey’s stated openness to introducing negative interest rates if needed."

Investing.com – The pound hung onto gains against the dollar on continued hopes over a Brexit deal despite some experts suggesting the optimism could be misplaced amid fresh U.K.-EU trade talks that got underway Tuesday.
GBP/USD rose 0.25% to $1.2877, after rising above $1.29 intraday.
The strong start to the week for sterling may hint at progress over a post-Brexit deal in the wake of cautiously optimistic comments from both the U.K. and EU, but ""nothing has changed,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.  The FX market, however, ""seems to be taking a more optimistic view,"" at the ""risk of bitter disappointment if the negotiations this week do not result in any progress,"" it added.
The U.K.-EU talks come in the midst of souring U.K.-EU relations after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson proceeded with an internal market bill that undermines the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
In an attempt to extend an olive branch, the U.K. has submitted new draft negotiating papers to find a way past the key sticking issues including fisheries, the ""level playing field,"" and social security coordination, according to media reports.
Brexit talks aside, the Commerzbank also warned that upside for the sterling would likely be limited by the second wave of the virus that has forced the U.K. government to renew restrictions that could be be ""stepped up"" to curb the outbreak.
Further restrictions would hurt the economic recovery and likely prompt the Bank of England to take a deeper look at negative rates despite Bank of England member David Ramsden pushing back on the idea on Monday.
""If we do not see some relief on the corona front in the UK soon speculation about further expansionary measures and negative interest rates might increase again and put pressure on sterling,"" Commerzbank bank said."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus epidemic - and the collapse in global interest rates it has sparked - may have blown a hole in conventional market wisdom that Japan's yen strengthens during crises, triggering a warning bell for investors.
The yen has long been among the assets in greatest demand during disasters, when waves of overseas-held capital traditionally flee back to Japan, pushing the currency higher. 
And for more than two decades, the trend has held.
Since 1997, a 5% fall in the U.S. S&P500 index was accompanied 76% of the time by yen appreciation, according to a study by Nordea. 
In mid-March, when the pandemic shock was at its height, that didn't happen. U.S. equities tumbled 9% and 15% in successive weeks but the yen fell too. In subsequent selloffs, including this month's 4% (SPX) equity slump, the currency has barely budged.
""The correlation with stocks didn't hold during the corona crisis, which is a game changer as to how everyone looks at the yen,"" Andreas Steno Larsen, chief global FX strategist at Nordea Markets, said. 
The inverse 90-day yen-S&P500 correlation has since weakened to near decade-lows, he noted.
(Graphic: Yen stock correlations - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdjownpo/yen%20stock%20correlations.JPG)
Between Jan 20 and Sept 9, the yen firmed 2% against a basket of major currencies,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) calculates - a stark contrast with its 27% surge during the July-March 2008-9 crisis. 
Any lasting shift carries profound implications. 
For Japan's export-reliant economy, having frequently contended with sudden yen spikes, it is a positive. Investors though, face a hunt for other safe havens, should the yen lose that status.
It's a source of unease for investors such as Aaron Hurd, senior currency portfolio manager at State Street Global Markets, who uses the yen as a counterweight to risky assets in some investment models.
While Hurd doesn't believe the yen has shed its safe-haven role, he said its gains during recent risk-off episodes had been ""a bit disappointing"" and needed monitoring.

(Graphic: Japanese yen-funded carry trades in decline - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeejzrpr/vanishingtrade.png)
CARRY NO MORE
The yen's reputation stems from Japan's stash of foreign assets, at $3.5 trillion the world's largest international investment position. But it is also linked to a well established market trend - the carry trade, where low-yield currencies are borrowed and then sold for higher-yield assets overseas.
That makes the yen prone to periodic spikes; when world markets go into reverse, so do carry trades, fuelling a mass rush back into the funding currency to limit losses.
But yen-funded carry trades declined to around 8 trillion yen ($75.5 billion) in July, estimates Tohru Sasaki, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s head of Japan market research, down from a steady 10 trillion yen or so in recent years and a 2007 peak around 23 trillion yen.
What's changed is that this year's worldwide collapse in short-term rates has eliminated the yield discount the yen has held since 1995, when Japanese benchmark rates fell to 0.5%.
Oliver Brennan, macro strategist at TS Lombard, noted Swiss and euro zone interest rates were below Japan's, so ""if yen shorts from carry trades are going to be much smaller ...then the yen would no longer act as a risk-off currency."" 
While Japanese three-month money market rates  are at -0.1%, equivalent U.S. rates  have fallen to -0.2% versus 2% a year back and euro rates  are at -0.52%, down from -0.4%.
(Graphic: Borrowing costs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbjokovq/borrowing%20costs.JPG)
EURO HAVEN?
It's still early days; after all, acute dollar shortages in March saw all other currencies being brushed aside. But guessing the identity of the next haven currency is already ""the hottest topic in FX markets"", says Nordea's Steno Larsen.
The shifting FX dynamics may test the European Central Bank.
With -0.5% interest rates, a balance of payments surplus, large capital markets and recent improvements in European cohesion, the euro might well be a candidate to replace the yen.
One central bank official recalled the euro's sudden spike to 14-month highs in March, driven possibly by carry traders who had used it for funding before turmoil erupted.

""It may be due to the fact that running up to the COVID-19 stress there had been some shifts in the preferred funding currency for carry trades and the euro emerged as the currency you want to be short,"" he said.

The Bank of Russia said it would sell an additional $2 billion in foreign exchange over the next three months, not enough to reverse the ruble’s slide but a move that could be seen as a signal of support for the embattled currency.
“The announcement should help the market start stabilizing, but we’re not out of the woods yet,” said Yury Tulinov, head of research at Rosbank PJSC in Moscow. “The volume isn’t decisive.”
A multitude of geopolitical risks has combined with a surge in Covid-19 cases to erode investor confidence in Russian assets. The ruble is the worst-performing currency among major emerging markets this month, plunging 7.1% in large part due to concern that the Kremlin will be hit by fresh sanctions.
The currency sales will total 2.9 billion rubles ($36 million) a day in October through December, the Bank of Russia said in a statement published on its website on Tuesday. The transactions “won’t have a significant impact on the domestic market,” according to the statement.
The central bank says it doesn’t intervene to target the ruble rate, since moving to a free-floating exchange rate in 2014. The additional sales are to convert the Bank of Russia’s proceeds from the sale of its stake in Sberbank PJSC, according to the statement.
Part of the selloff has been caused by investors taking out hedges against the ruble to protect overweight positions in Russian government bonds, Tulinov said. Foreigners own about 29% of the outstanding debt, with holdings worth the equivalent of about $37 billion, according to central bank data.

At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.233, after retreating from a two-month high of 94.745 reached last week.
Additionally, EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1681, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.64.
Overnight, Democratic lawmakers unveiled a new $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which was described as a compromise measure. It’s true this price tag does bring the total cost nearer to the levels Republicans have said they would be prepared to accept, but the gap is still wide and trust between the two sides appears to be in short supply.
All eyes will turn later Tuesday onto the first U.S. presidential election debate between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, with the vote just over a month away.
“The stakes are high and the result is far from clear in the U.S. November elections,” wrote analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “A decisive Democratic victory would probably hit the USD and support European assets, while another Trump term would be full of uncertainties.”
“We think the race is much closer than the polls imply, and even if a Biden victory is the most likely outcome, such a scenario is far from a given,” Nordea added.
Markets are also awaiting a plethora of economic data releases to gauge the health of the world's biggest economy, including Tuesday's consumer confidence number, but more importantly, the jobs report on Friday - the final one before the election.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.2864, hitting a one-week high, following promising noises as the final round of scheduled Brexit trade discussions got underway. The Times reported that EU negotiators had signaled a willingness to begin work on drafting a detailed legal text, and that U.K. negotiators had agreed to present detailed proposals for fishing quotas and state aid.
While both the EU and Britain said a post-Brexit agreement was still some way off, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said a deal was still possible.
“GBP positioning remains quite interesting to watch as it is now in neutral territory (+2% of open interest), but remained unchanged in the week 16-22 September,” said Francesco Pesole, an analyst at ING.
“We now estimate the risk of a no-deal outcome at 50%, and we, therefore, see GBP neutral positioning as highly complacent -  highlighting a non-negligible downside risk for sterling.”
Helping the tone for the pound were comments from Bank of England deputy governor for markets and banking governor policymaker Dave Ramsden, who pushed back at the idea that the central bank was committed to negative interest rates.
""For me, I see the effective lower bound still at 0.1% which is where Bank Rate is at present,"" Ramsden said in an interview with Britain’s Society of Professional Economists posted online.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira slid to a fresh all-time low, as the support from a surprise central bank rate hike last week evaporated. The dollar rose 0.4% to 7.8421 lira. It also rose 0.5% against the Russian ruble, on mounting concern that both Turkey and Russia could be drawn into the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, as the U.S. presidential debate and developments on the latest U.S. stimulus measures continue to remain in the spotlight.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 94.278 by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT), slipping from the two-month high seen during the previous week.
With November’s presidential election drawing closer, investors are focusing on the debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden, due to take place later in the day.
“If the debate puts Trump on the back foot and Biden keeps his lead, I think it could lead people to let go of their dollars,” Mizuho Bank chief market economist Daisuke Karakama told Reuters.
“The dollar market has been broadly bottoming out from low prices since mid-September. The question is what the trend in October would be,” Karakama said, adding that investors are also keeping a close eye on stimulus measure developments.
On that front, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday that Democratic lawmakers would unveil a new $2.2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, with the package’s price tag reduced as a compromise measure.
The U.S. will also release economic data throughout the week, starting with September’s Conference Board (CB) consumer confidence index later in the day, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on Thursday, and jobs data on Friday. Investors will be looking at the data to gauge the health of the world’s largest economy.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 105.52.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7084 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.6565.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.19% to 6.8235. China will also release economic data, including the manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) as well as the Caixin manufacturing PMI, on Wednesday.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.14% to 1.2845. The pound extended gains from the previous session as the European Union (EU) and the U.K. begin a week-long round of talks. Although both parties cautioned that a post-Brexit agreement could take time to reach, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen was hopeful that a deal could still be possible."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies on Tuesday as traders looked out to the first U.S. presidential debate and developments on the U.S. stimulus bill.
The dollar index stood unchanged at 94.150 (=USD), drifting away from a two-month high of 94.745 reached last week, as stock markets made solid gains partly on upbeat China data with Wall Street rebounding following last week's selloff.
All eyes are on the first U.S. presidential election debate where Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump will square off later in the day (Wednesday 0100 GMT).
""If the debate puts Trump on the back foot and Biden keeps his lead, I think it could lead people to let go of their dollars,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.
“The dollar market has been broadly bottoming out from low prices since mid-September. The question is what would be the trend in October,” Karakama said, adding that market participants are also keeping a close watch on any stimulus package plans.
House speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday the Democratic lawmakers were unveiling a new $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which was a compromise measure that reduces the costs of the economic aid.
Markets are also braced for a slew of data to gauge the health of the world's biggest economy ahead of the election, analysts say, including Tuesday's consumer confidence, a manufacturing survey and consumer data on Thursday as well as jobs report on Friday. 
Sterling outperformed other currencies, extending overnight gains on optimism about a Brexit trade deal as the European Union and Britain kicked off a decisive week of talks. 
The British pound was fetching $1.2875  in Asian trade, having touched $1.2930 overnight. 
Against the euro, sterling changed hands at 90.74 pence (EURGBP=D3). 
While both the EU and Britain said a post-Brexit agreement was still some way off, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said a deal was still possible.
Separately, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said he thought the floor for the central bank's key interest rate was 0.1%, but the BoE was ""duty-bound"" to consider pushing the rates below zero.
The euro changed hands at $1.1678 (EUR=), with gains capped by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's remarks that the external value of the shared currency has an impact on inflation, and that policymakers will monitor currency movements.
As Europe grapples with a surge in new COVID-19 infections, traders will be looking out for euro zone consumer confidence and industrial sentiment data for September for signs of any impact on the region’s economic recovery.
Elsewhere, the dollar edged lower against the yen at 105.43 yen . Data on Tuesday showed Tokyo’s core consumer prices fell 0.2% in September, the latest evidence of the lingering impact of the coronavirus on business activity.

The Antipodean currencies gained moderately, with the Australian dollar  last trading at $0.7093 while the kiwi  sat at $0.6566.

201,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 03:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Virgin Islands suspended a nearly $1 billion debt sale after a group of retirees filed a lawsuit challenging legislation that authorized it, extending the territory’s exile from America’s bond market.
The cancellation of the deal was necessary because of “the negative impact of ill-intentioned litigation deliberately filed in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands on the eve of bond pricing and closing,” Governor Albert Bryan Jr. said in a statement on Monday.
The deal was intended to refinance outstanding debt through a securitization corporation backed by the nearly $250 million a year the Virgin Islands receives from the U.S. government, the territory’s cut of the excise taxes on rum it ships to the mainland. Last week, the government delayed the deal, which was expected to price Sept. 24. The lawsuit was filed Sept. 22.
The sale had been expected to be a major test of the $3.9 trillion municipal bond market, where investors have continued to snap up riskier securities as benchmark yields hold near the lowest in decades. The territory hadn’t sold long-term debt publicly in the U.S. for years as it wrestles with the same economic forces that drove its bigger neighbor, Puerto Rico, into financial ruin.
A debt service payment the island owes on Oct. 1 will be made on schedule, according to Bryan’s statement.

Investing.com – The pound rallied to a one-week high on Monday as the Bank of England pushed back against the prospect of negative rates, while hopes the UK and EU can reach a deal post-Brexit deal also improved sentiment.
GBP/USD rose 0.90% to $1.2849.
Bank of England deputy governor for markets and banking governor policymaker Dave Ramsden said that while the BoE was ""duty bound"" to review negative rates as a potential policy tool, it was not expected to cut rates below zero ""imminently.""
""For me, I see the effective lower bound still at 0.1 which is where Bank Rate is at present,"" Ramsden said in an interview with Britain’s Society of Professional Economists posted online.
The move helped calm investor jitters the BoE is on a path to cut rates below zero after the bank's monetary policy committee Silvana Tenreyro said there was evidence that negative rates had proved effective.
Sentiment on the pound was also helped by tentative hopes the EU and UK will be able to resolve their differences as both sides are set for a final round of trade talks underway before the EU summit in mid-October.
The United Kingdom continues to reiterate that it is unlikely to budge over key sticking points including fishing policy and the commitment to a ""level playing field"" in competition.
The U.K. has made it clear it wants to regain control over access to its waters and fish when the Brexit transition period ends, rather than stick with the EU's common fisheries policy, which sets fishing quotas for EU member states.  
While the EU has hinted it is willing to compromise on some issues, the economic bloc has reiterated it would not agree to any measures that threaten the four freedoms - goods, people, capital, services -  of the single market.
The UK-EU relations has also been further soured by the British prime minister Boris Johnson's move to push through an internal market bill that undermines the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
There might be 'hints' of progress ahead of the European Council meeting on 14-15 October, but it may end up being more posturing before the can gets kicked down the road again for another two weeks a la Brexit tradition, Forexlive said."
203,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds that have racked up the largest bets against the dollar in almost three years may be running headlong into a short squeeze.
With markets on edge over resurgent coronavirus cases and a contentious U.S. presidential election, predictions of the currency’s demise as the world’s number one haven appear premature. Investors went into the greenback’s strongest rally since April last week expecting losses in all-but-one of the Group-of-10 currencies versus the dollar, the first time since 2013, according to  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV data.
Few of those bets have been covered, according to the latest data. Speculative positions in futures linked to the ICE (NYSE:ICE) U.S. Dollar Index turned the most negative since November 2017, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data through Sept. 22. That suggests speculators may only be beginning to enter a world of pain.
“Dollar shorts were at multi-year highs, you surely cannot assume they have all been trimmed last week,” ING currency strategist Francesco Pesole said by e-mail. “There is definitely more room for the dollar to benefit from position-squaring.”
It serves to highlight the perils of taking wagers out against the dollar against the multitude of uncertainties reaped by the global pandemic.  Toronto Dominion Bank  (NYSE:TD) described international foreign-exchange markets as between “rock and a hard place” while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. said last week that the seasons had shifted into a “dangerous” year-end trading cycle, which promised to be “two-directional” for the dollar.
Throughout the summer, talk of a V-shaped recovery and trillions of dollars of stimulus had boosted reflation trades over defensive assets like the dollar. But the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting fell short of any concrete steps for more stimulus even while pandemic restrictions threaten to stifle economic green shoots.
“I wish we had been long,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management who turned neutral after closing his short position on the dollar last month. “Economic data has shown signs of disappointment, Covid is getting worse and additional stimulus is not forthcoming.”

Sterling outperformed major currencies to rise as much as 0.8% to $1.2842, the biggest surge in nearly two weeks, as investors digested a more conciliatory tone from officials on both sides.
“Sterling is benefiting into the start of the week from mildly positive tone ahead of Brexit negotiations,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of G-10 currency research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. “The general risk-on tone is also good for sterling.”
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart, David Frost, will hold a final round of scheduled discussions starting Tuesday. Both sides have expressed cautious optimism a deal can be reached.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Monday, with riskier assets to the fore after signs of economic recovery in China, but the greenback remains near a two-month peak as coronavirus cases continue to rise and political uncertainty in the U.S. reigns.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.552, after climbing to a two-month high of 94.745 last week and posted its biggest weekly rise since early April.
Additionally, EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1633, having dropped to 1.1612 on Friday, its lowest in two months, while USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 105.36. 
Data over the weekend showed an increase in profits at China’s industrial companies for the fourth consecutive month in August, helping those seeking risk to move into equities and out of safe havens like the U.S. dollar.
However, it’s debatable how long this stance lasts as the number of new cases of the Covid-19 virus continue to rise. A number of countries in Europe, including France, Spain and the U.K., have extended restrictions given high infection rates, while four U.S. states in the Midwest reported record one-day increases on Saturday as infections rose nationally for a second week in a row.
Data on U.S. currency futures positions released on Friday also pointed to more upside potential in the dollar's recovery, with speculators holding a big net short position in the greenback.
Investors will be looking to the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden scheduled for Tuesday, with the presidential election just over a month away.
Ahead of the debate, the New York Times reported on Sunday that Trump paid virtually no income taxes in recent years as heavy losses from his business enterprises offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income.
“FX markets in Asia Wednesday morning may be the first litmus test of how the dollar will fare in the run-up to the election. One school of thought is that a strong Trump performance is equity positive/dollar negative. We have the view, were Biden to win, the dollar could decline in 2021 on a benign world view,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% at 1.2770, above Wednesday's two-month low of $1.2676, with the final round of scheduled Brexit trade discussions between the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, beginning in Brussels on Tuesday.
Markets are pricing in a 40%-45% chance of Britain exiting the EU trading bloc without any alternative arrangements at the end of 2020 after the U.K. government threatened to ditch parts of its European Union divorce deal this month.
“Given the roughly 50:50 chance of deal vs no deal, we continue to see GBP as inadequately priced for the risk presented, with limited risk premium built into GBP. We thus see risks to GBP on the downside,” ING added.

206,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- When Tottenham Hotspur striker Son Heung-Min put the ball in the back of the net early in the second half against Crystal Palace in April of last year, he etched his name into history as the first player to score at his soccer club’s glistening new 62,000-seat north London home. Less than a year after his team’s triumphant 2-0 win that day, the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) stadium sat eerily empty as a coronavirus lockdown brought sports, and much of normal life, to a halt across the U.K.
Then came another milestone. In June, Spurs became the first club in the English Premier League to qualify for Bank of England support. It tapped a £175 million commercial-paper facility to help cushion the estimated loss of more than £200 million in revenue from canceled matches and other events between then and June 2021
If BOE support for Spurs sounds improbable, it shouldn’t. The central bank was hardly the only one to mount extraordinary rescue operations in response to the pandemic. In less exceptional circumstances, that money would be used to bail out banks or other lenders to stave off financial contagion. With Covid-19 hammering economies, that changed this year.
For the first time in its history, the U.S. Federal Reserve bought a wide variety of corporate debt issued by blue-chip borrowers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., as well as junk bonds from riskier companies. The Bank of Japan, the petri dish for central banking after more than two decades of extraordinary stimulus, launched a $940 billion package of loan support for businesses.
Those moves are just a few examples of how central banks are digging deeper and deeper into their monetary toolboxes to cushion the Covid-19-induced shock to the global economy. The pandemic cast aside the notion that the banks were already at full stretch. Instead, it’s accelerated the transformation of monetary mandarins focused on inflation into guardians combating inequality, climate change, and more—leaving less and less scope for a return to a simpler existence.
It’s a policy spiral that began after the 2008 financial crisis and has shoved central banks more profoundly into politically treacherous territory. “The more tasks you give to central banks, the more they’re dealing with trade-offs associated with political choices,” says Stephen King, senior economic adviser at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). “In the old days, monetary policy was very much a story about price stability. One tool: interest rates. One objective: price stability. Easy!”
As the virus spread, central banks from Washington to Wellington flooded financial markets with liquidity. They backstopped companies. They helped to finance massive government stimulus. The blitz included 164 interest-rate cuts in 147 days, according to a tally by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).; altogether, the banks pumped in $8.5 trillion in monetary support and governments an additional $11.4 trillion in fiscal stimulus—almost $20 trillion in total.
What made the rescue all the more remarkable was this: Before the pandemic struck, a pressing concern at gatherings such as those in Davos, Switzerland, and Jackson Hole, Wyo., was that central banks were in no shape to fight a crisis given that interest rates were already so low. Not everyone was convinced pouring more cheap liquidity into financial markets would work again, given that a decade of easy money hadn’t been enough to ward off the threat of secular stagnation.
But within weeks of the central banks’ interventions this year, global markets began to recover, and by August stocks worldwide had reached record highs, powered in large part by the ultra-easy money. “The global track record and responses to the current pandemic show that central banks have very extensive capabilities to shape financial conditions,” says Philip Lane, an executive board member of the European Central Bank who, as ECB chief economist, crafts policies including its €1.4 trillion ($1.65 trillion) pandemic bond-buying program.
What’s less clear is whether the real economy will get the same kind of boost. That’s why Lane’s boss, ECB President Christine Lagarde, warned European governments that failure to pump in fiscal stimulus risked an economic calamity.
Similarly, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has spoken of the limits to the U.S. central bank’s abilities, stressing that it can lend money but not spend it. Prior to the pandemic, Powell was justly proud of the job the bank had done in managing the economy. By pushing the unemployment rate to a half-century low of 3.5%, the Fed was allowing the benefits of the record-long U.S. economic expansion to reach many Americans who’ve historically been left behind. Black and Latino unemployment fell to the lowest levels on record. Americans with disabilities or prison records—long shut out of the labor market—were finding jobs.
Then “the world turned upside down,” as Amanda Cage, a workforce development expert, told Powell at a Fed Listens public outreach event in May. Unemployment was spiking to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Low-paid minority and women workers were being particularly hard hit—a development Powell called “heartbreaking.”
Cage, president and chief executive officer of the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, based in Washington, says she fears many of the millions of jobs lost in the hospitality and health-care sectors during the crisis won’t be coming back—jobs disproportionately held by workers of color. She also says she sees another “tsunami” of job losses coming at state and local governments, a sector where, again, Black workers are overrepresented. “The crisis has shone a light on the disparities that were there before but most people were blind to,” Cage says.
Patrick “Duke” Dujakovich, a former firefighter and now president of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO, also participated in the May Fed Listens event. A member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, he praises the central bank for its response to the Covid-19 crisis. But he has a message from workers. “We talk about price stability and stability in all the financial markets, but we never talk about employment stability,” he says. “Maybe that should be one of the focuses.”
Economists Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Joe Biden, and Janelle Jones, managing director for policy and research at Groundwork Collective, have called on the Fed to target the Black unemployment rate when it makes policy decisions to narrow the unemployment gap with Whites. In February, the peak of the last expansion cycle, the Black jobless rate was more than 2.5 percentage points higher than that of White Americans. Brookings Institution fellow Aaron Klein says the reaction to the pandemic has been off-kilter. “The Covid disease plagues American families, particularly communities of color,” he says. “Our response has been to save markets, particularly high-end, wealthy investors.”
At a Princeton webinar in late May, Powell vehemently denied that the Fed’s policies are widening the income gap between rich and poor; he said they’re aimed at restoring the stellar job markets that existed pre-Covid-19. To do more for the real economy, Powell and his fellow policymakers came up with the Main Street Lending Program earlier this year. It guarantees payment on 95% of the value of loans made by banks to eligible small and midsize businesses. The Treasury used money appropriated by Congress to provide $75 billion to the Fed to cover potential losses resulting from defaults on the $600 billion program.
For all its ambition, the Main Street program has been slow to get off the ground partly because of the Treasury’s reluctance to make it too generous. It had attracted just eight borrowers as of July 27, according to a report released by the central bank. The largest recipient identified was a casino in Mount Pocono, Pa., that got $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under the program’s priority loan facility.
In another apparent effort to combat charges that its policies favor the rich, the Fed in late August unveiled a long-run monetary policy strategy aimed at achieving a goal of maximum employment that’s “broad-based and inclusive.” It also adopted a more relaxed posture toward inflation, saying it would welcome temporary, moderate price gains above its average 2% target. The result of the subtle yet significant changes in the Fed’s operating framework: Interest rates are likely to stay lower for longer.
The ECB has had more success than the Fed in promoting bank lending to businesses. It’s using a program it launched six years ago when it was grappling with a euro zone that’s far more reliant on such financing than the U.S. Instead of pushing down short-term market rates and hoping they would flow through to loans, it gave ultracheap long-term funding to banks. The condition was that they use it to provide credit to companies and households, excluding mortgages. That program now stands at about €1.5 trillion, equivalent to over a tenth of the region’s economy.
Annelise Riles, a professor of law and anthropology at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University, has observed that central bankers, especially in the past year, seem more aware of the need to explain their actions and respond to concerns among the general public. That’s partly because of the latest crisis, she says, but also because of heightened public interest, including through channels such as social media.
She’s spent more than 20 years studying central banks, having been drawn to the subject by the role monetary policy played in calming the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. “We have seen a much more fundamental shift in the way that central bankers understand their mission and their role. We have seen new ways of thinking and talking and new values coming in,” says Riles, author of Financial Citizenship: Experts, Publics & the Politics of Central Banking.
As part of its first strategic review since 2003, the ECB, for example, planned events similar to this year’s Fed Listens, but the pandemic forced Lagarde to delay the exercise. She’s said she wants to make the central bank think more about popular issues such as climate change.
Nowhere is the dependence on central banks more visible than in financial markets. The biggest central banks, excluding the People’s Bank of China, now own assets worth almost one-quarter of the world’s stock market capitalization—about four times the pre-2008 level.
Those holdings are only going to grow, according to an analysis by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in August, which estimated that since February the central banks of the U.S., U.K., euro zone, and Japan expanded their balance sheets by almost $5.7 trillion. According to JPMorgan, further asset purchases and credit-easing policies should increase these banks’ balance sheets from $21.5 trillion, or 57% of their gross domestic product, to almost $27 trillion, 67% of GDP, by the end of 2021.
Stephen Diggle knows firsthand how paradigm shifts in central banking upend markets and business models. He spent almost a decade running what eventually became one of the biggest hedge funds in Asia, Artradis Fund Management, making $2.7 billion on volatility bets during the financial crisis as markets swooned. By 2010 that strategy was dead: Major central banks had slashed interest rates, adopted quantitative easing, and flooded markets with liquidity, squeezing out volatility in the process.
So Diggle liquidated Artradis, and in 2011 set up a family office, Vulpes Investment Management Pte, to manage his own wealth and work with other family offices. For a generation, rich people such as Diggle could invest in U.S. Treasuries and other bonds to generate steady and safe returns, then juice the portfolio with riskier assets such as equities or property. But since the financial crisis, bonds have offered meager income as central banks anchored yields, forcing funds like Diggle’s toward new corners of the investment landscape.
Vulpes, for instance, invested in New Zealand’s biggest avocado farm, where a successful crop can cover costs and return a dividend for investors, yielding income that bonds these days just can’t replicate. “A lot of the things we have been looking at have been trying to solve this bond problem,” says Diggle, an Oxford University graduate who worked at Lehman Brothers before co-founding Artradis. “So, for example, we’re farmers now.”
Diggle’s agrarian turn is just another example of how the continued Japanification of economies and financial markets—a world of low growth and low inflation and, by extension, low rates and low volatility—is affecting investors. “I never would have thought, when I first set up my hedge fund in 2002, that our morning meeting would spend the first 15 minutes of every day talking about what central banks are doing,” he says. “That used to be something that these nerds in the corner of the repo markets spent all their time thinking about.”
The snowballing power of the central banks is a source of great frustration for investors like Diggle. “At some level the markets don’t make sense anymore,” he says. “You are playing poker against the man who can make his own chips. It’s a very bad idea.”
Economics textbooks tell us the cheap money gushing out of central banks should eventually get people spending again and businesses hiring, pushing up prices and wages and forcing interest rates higher. That would then allow central banks to slow their intervention, halt their stimulus, and maybe even unwind it once the recovery is strong enough. But recent economic history tells a different story.
After more than two decades of purchasing public debt, the Bank of Japan now has a balance sheet larger than the country’s economy, and yet inflation is back around zero. The Fed and ECB haven’t gone that far yet. This suggests that if their economies follow a Japanese trajectory, it could be many years—even decades—before they’d have to impose limits on their QE programs.
But does anybody expect the power of central banks to return to pre-2008 days? The demands on them are growing and evolving in ways that keep challenging them to do more, not less: Solve the financial crisis, address climate change, avert the pandemic-driven economic collapse, restore inflation, combat income and racial inequalities.
As central banks perform roles that once resided with governments, their independence from politicians comes into question. Coordination during times of crisis is vital, but the worry in the case of those central banks that have historically set monetary policy at arm’s length from government is that it will be tough to wrestle back that independence when (and if) the tide of crises subsides.
A hopeful scenario is that if the impact of the pandemic fades and economies start to grow again, there may be a way for monetary authorities to unwind at least some measures. Central bankers generally insist they could do that—the ECB’s Lane says the challenges “should not be overstated”—but it could be a long and bumpy process if politicians continue leaning on the banks to dig deeper.
In the process, says Teresa Kong, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia in San Francisco, the world may be getting hooked. Central bank support, she says, is “like a drug: The more you take, the higher your tolerance and the deeper your addiction. It’s going to take a lot to get us out of this.” —With Alaa Shahine and Paul Gordon

207,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Battle lines are being drawn at the heart of the European Central Bank over whether to add monetary support soon to head off any economic slowdown, or wait for stronger evidence that it’s needed.
Executive Board member Fabio Panetta raised the prospect of a preemptive burst of stimulus last week when he said “the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy.”
That echoes Chief Economist Philip Lane, who has suggested more must be done to revive inflation even if the worst of the economic crisis has passed. He said on Twitter last week that “ample” stimulus is still required.
Yet their colleague Yves Mersch, who steps down in December, said in a Bloomberg interview that the downside risks have lessened and he sees no deterioration in output or prices. He even said a huge improvement in the outlook should prompt the “opposite” of monetary easing.
“There is some sort of a clash of clans boiling under the surface between those who want to act pre-emptively and those who prefer to be reactive,” said Frederik Ducrozet, chief strategist at Pictet & Cie in Geneva. “Every time we are in a gray area, we may see this type of conflict return.”
Divergent views on the six-member board may be at an early stage, but they augur potential disputes in the decision-making Governing Council. Mersch’s opinions could find support there from policy makers such as Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who has already warned against relying for too long on the 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) pandemic bond-buying program, and Austria’s Robert Holzmann.
Tricky Phase
The ECB is entering an especially tricky phase in its crisis response. Financial markets have stabilized and the economy is growing again, but the rebound is uneven and inflation is languishing below zero. Pump too much liquidity in and it risks destabilizing the financial system, yet do too little and the recovery could crumble.
Most economists predict the pandemic program will be expanded this year, probably in December when new economic projections are published. Any sign that might not happen could cause investor unease that tightens financial conditions.
“It’s very difficult environment to operate in with lingering uncertainties,” said Piet Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank A/S. “The problem with disagreement and compromises is that it won’t lead to a strong policy response compared to the situation where you have unanimity.”

Pivotal to how the debate proceeds is ECB President Christine Lagarde, who joined 11 months ago promising to be a consensus-builder after disagreements on the Governing Council under her predecessor, Mario Draghi.
So far she’s been cautious, saying last week that “the uncertainty of the current environment requires a very careful assessment of the incoming information.” She appears before the European Parliament on Monday.
The two other members of the board, which designs and proposes monetary policy, are also being circumspect in public. Isabel Schnabel has echoed Lagarde in saying more information is needed. Both she and Vice President Luis De Guindos have stressed that while the ECB can and will act if needed, fiscal support is critical.
The ECB’s economic projections -- which assume a “medical solution” to the virus in mid-2021 -- include huge variability, covering three scenarios from mild to severe.
The central bank said this month that the upturn is in line with its baseline projections but the risks “remain on the downside.”
Since then, infections have jumped -- as Mersch acknowledged -- yet governments are trying to avoid the national lockdowns that caused this year’s record recession. Data last week showed manufacturing improving while services are shrinking again.
Moreover, the inflation rate is below zero for the first time in four years, and isn’t expected to return to the goal of “below, but close, to 2%” for a long time. Even that target is being reassessed, following in the footsteps of the Federal Reserve’s strategic review, adding to the uncertainty.
“Much will depend on how the data evolve over the next 2-3 months,” Greg Fuzesi, an economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., said in a report for clients. “The differences between Panetta and Mersch suggest that the Governing Council is only at the beginning of the next consensus-building process.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a two-month peak against a basket of currencies on Monday, as doubts about recovery persisted ahead of a barrage of economic data and political developments in the United States. 
While a rebound in U.S. stocks on Friday has helped to curb the ascent of the dollar, deemed as a safe-haven, signs of slowdown in the nascent recovery from the pandemic and political uncertainties have kept investors on guard.
The dollar index stood little changed at 94.530 (=USD). It hit a two-month high of 94.745 last week and posted its biggest weekly rise since early April.
The euro changed hands at $1.1635 (EUR=), having dropped to $1.16125 on Friday, its lowest in two months.
The British pound stood at $1.2767 , slightly above Wednesday's two-month low of $1.2676.
""The dollar's rise reflects unwinding of (dollar short) positions. There were two main drivers, rise in real U.S. yields and risk-off trades,"" said Tatsuya Chiba, manager of forex trading at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Trust Bank. 
The yield on U.S. inflation-linked bonds (US10YTIP=RR), known as real yields, have risen almost 20 basis points after touching a record low earlier this month. 
On the whole, higher yields, real or nominal, tend to support a currency. Traders have noted there has been a particularly strong correlation between the U.S. real yield and the dollar over the last few months.
Data on U.S. currency futures positions released on Friday also pointed to more upside potential in the dollar's recovery, with speculators holding a big net short position in the greenback.
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculators held a net short position of $33.989 billion , up from $31.524 billion the week before and near the highest level in almost ten years.
The flip side of that was a still very large net long positions in the euro, which showed a slight increase last week to $27.922 billion .
""We need to be wary of a weaker euro due to further unwinding of euro long positions. We have no shortage of concerns in Europe including rise of coronavirus infections in France and so on, attempts by European Central Bank policymakers to talk down the euro and Brexit,"" Makoto Noji, chief currency strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said in report.
Against the yen, the dollar was more subdued at 105.46 yen .
Investors now look to the first U.S. Presidential debate on Tuesday as the election in early November has started to loom large. 
""Few people will be trying to bet on the election outcome. At least they will wait until tomorrow's TV debate,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Ahead of the debate, the New York Times reported on Sunday President Donald Trump paid extremely little in income taxes in recent years as heavy losses from his business enterprises offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income.
Few investors now expect the U.S. Congress to pass any stimulus package, seen as vital to support the pandemic-stricken economy, before the election.
But there are growing worries the economic recovery is slowing as many of the stimulus programmes have expired, curbing consumer spending.
The week provides markets with more U.S. data to gauge the health of the world's biggest economy, including consumer confidence on Tuesday, a manufacturing survey and consumer data on Thursday and jobs data on Friday.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira briefly dropped 1.6% to a record low of 7.8000 per dollar .

The lira had enjoyed a rare bounce in the wake of an interest rate hike late last week, but gains faded quickly on investor scepticism about how this will filter through into financial market rates.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with a lack of big moves ahead of the U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday and the release of U.S. economic data later in the week.
Although boosted by a rebound in U.S. stocks during Friday’s session and hovering near a two-month peak, signs of a stall in the U.S. economic recovery and the continuous political uncertainty in the run up to the country’s November’s presidential election capped gains.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.04% to 94.588 by 10 PM ET (2 AM GMT). The dollar hit a two-month high during the previous week, the biggest weekly rise since early April.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.14% to 105.45.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.37% to 0.7053 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 0.6555.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.8213 and the GBP/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 1.2765.
With November’s election drawing closer, investors will be looking to the first presidential debate scheduled for Tuesday amid the uncertainty.
“Few people will be trying to bet on the election outcome. At least they will wait until tomorrow’s TV debate,” Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) director of FOREX Kyosuke Suzuki told Reuters.
Although hopes for the U.S. Congress to pass the latest stimulus measures before the election are dimming, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, expressed hope on Sunday that a deal can be reached as talks continue between the Democrats and the Republicans.
Investors are also looking to the week's U.S. data, including September’s Conference Board (CB) consumer confidence index on Tuesday and the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on Thursday, which are expected to show a slowdown in the recovery as many of the stimulus measures have expired, cutting consumer spending.
In other data news, Friday’s data on U.S. currency futures positions released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed investors holding a big net short position of $33.989 billion in the dollar.
Although the amount was up from the previous week’s $31.524 billion, and near the highest level in almost ten years, the data also showed a large net long position in the euro, which increased slightly during the previous week to $27.922 billion.
“We need to be wary of a weaker euro due to further unwinding of euro long positions. We have no shortage of concerns in Europe, including the rise of COVID-19 infections in France and so on, attempts by European Central Bank policymakers to talk down the euro and Brexit,” SMBC Nikko Securities chief currency strategist Makoto Noji said in a note."
210,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Significant monetary stimulus should stay in place and steps to boost it further shouldn’t be discounted if they become necessary, European Central Bank Governing Council member Pablo Hernandez de Cos said.
Inflation foreseen to be well below the ECB’s target and recent exchange-rate moves mean there is “no room for complacency,” Hernandez de Cos said in an article in Spain’s La Razon newspaper. It’s also “crucial” to stay flexible in the execution of asset purchase programs to avoid problems of financial “fragmentation,” he said.
With his call for the need to be flexible, the Bank of Spain governor joins other ECB officials making the case for more action should it be needed. Executive Board Member Fabio Panetta said in a Sept. 22 speech that policy makers should err on the side of doing more to keep the rebound on track.
Hernandez de Cos warned that Spain’s economic recovery from the impact of Covid-19 is still partial and fragile. He said some government support programs for the economy should remain in place in a selective and focused way.
He said the authorities should monitor credit risk closely. In Spain there is still room for more consolidation in the banking industry, Hernandez de Cos said.

Investing.com - The dollar rose to fresh two-month highs on Friday, and is set to close out the session with its biggest weekly increase since March, underpinned by safe-haven momentum amid weaker-than-expected economic data and ongoing worries about the economic fallout from a lack of further federal stimulus.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.05%, to 96.60.
The Commerce Department reported durable goods orders increased just 0.4% in August from the prior month, missing economists' forecasts of 1.5%. A deeper look into the details from the report, however, were more positive than the headline number suggests, though the pace of orders is unlikely to be sustained, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
""Sustaining this momentum beyond Q3, however, will be very difficult. The financing environment is very supportive, but low capacity utilization rates and election uncertainty are likely to weigh on capex, at least in the near-term. Businesses typically ramp up investment when utilization rates are tightening. That's clearly not the case today; capacity utilization is still historically low at 71.4%, which is down 6.4 ppts compared to last year,"" Jefferies said in a note.
Elsewhere, the dollar was also supported by weakness in the euro and the pound as a second wave of Covid-19 infection threatens further lockdowns in the EU and U.K.
EUR/USD fell 0.40%, to $1.1625, and GBPUSD fell 0.26%, to $1.2715.
""The US dollar is proving to be the market's preferred safe-haven currency as Europe is hit by a second wave of the virus. But political risks are likely to limit its appreciation potential,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Others, however, suggest there is still more upside for the greenback. ""We estimate there is some room left for the USD to move higher in the coming weeks as we look for certain retests, measured moves or Fibonacci levels to be reached. The rally in the USD this month is viewed as the start of a stretched short position washout and resolution of oversold momentum conditions,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research said."
212,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira rallied for a second day after the banking regulator eased trading restrictions for foreign investors, a move that could help stem the capital flight that’s made the currency one of the worst performers in emerging markets this year.
The lira jumped as much 1.4% to 7.5134 against dollar after the watchdog increased the amount of currency swaps and derivative deals that local banks can carry out with foreign counterparts.
When buying lira from clients abroad, Turkish banks’ swaps and derivative positions can reach as much as 10% of their equity, up from 1% previously, the regulator said in a decree published Friday. When selling liras, the limit has been increased to 2% for transactions that will mature in seven days, 5% for those coming due in 30 days and 20% for those that mature in one year.
The decision is fueling speculation that policy makers are starting to unwind a slew of trading caps that have made it virtually impossible for investors abroad to hedge and finance their positions in Turkish assets. The clampdown reached an apex in May, when regulators briefly banned local banks from trading with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
The limits were first introduced after a currency crisis in 2018 and were designed to stand in the way of investors betting against the lira. But they’ve given way to periodic liquidity crunches that drove overnight borrowing costs to as high as 1,000%, and forced foreign investors to dump their bond and equity holdings.
Faced with an unpredictable trading environment, non-resident investors have pulled more than $13 billion out of the bond and stock market this year. Their share in local-currency government debt has dropped to a record low of less than 4%.
“Encouraging moves - suggests the Turkish authorities finally get it,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “The answer to foreigners trying to sell lira is not make it harder to sell, as this just encourages people to get out while they can and will deter them coming back.”
The decision follows a surprise interest-rate hike on Thursday that is also shoring up confidence in the lira. The currency has borne the brunt of a monetary easing cycle that drove borrowing cost below inflation and fueled demand for dollars in the local economy.
The lira is still down more than 20% against the dollar this year, the most in emerging markets after the Brazilian real.",,,,,
213,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy maker Francois Villeroy Galhau signaled that he’s open to letting inflation rise above the institution’s goal and changing the language it has used for nearly two decades to set its objective.
The Bank of France governor said that the current target for price growth of “below, but close to, 2%,” is often incorrectly interpreted as a ceiling that would mechanically trigger tighter policy. Instead, it should be seen as “symmetric,” he said at an online conference on Friday.
“As a consequence we might be ready to accept inflation higher than 2% for some time,” Villeroy said. “We should examine whether the current formulation casts doubt on this.”
The comments are the latest salvo in the ECB’s strategic review, the first since 2003. The Frankfurt-based institution is arguably on the back foot after the U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its own assessment with a pledge to target an average inflation rate of 2%, meaning it’ll probably keep policy looser for longer.
That shift could make the ECB’s job harder by putting downward pressure on the dollar. A relatively stronger euro depresses inflation by cutting import costs and making exporters less competitive.
Euro-area inflation is now below zero for the first time in four years because of the coronavirus crisis. The Frankfurt-based central bank has spent most of the past decade failing to hit its goal, despite injecting massive liquidity and cutting interest rates below zero.
Each time price growth has moved much above 1.5%, more-hawkish governors have started a debate on whether to unwind the stimulus.
Villeroy said the ECB should judge inflation over the medium term and “cannot ignore the past” when assessing whether it’s meeting its price-stability mandate.
“All this is not explicit average inflation targeting ex ante, but would achieve very similar outcomes ex post,” he said. “We will have to discuss that.”
The Bank of France head also hinted at the possibility of more monetary stimulus ahead. Most economists expect the pandemic bond-buying program to be expanded this year.
“If needed, the ECB has ample room for maneuver,” he said. “Have no doubt about our determination to act as much as needed, and about our capacity to act.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, after earlier hitting a two-month high, as renewed talk of additional U.S. stimulus eased investors' concerns about an economic recovery.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.317, after climbing to a two-month high of 94.601 in Thursday's U.S session.
Additionally, EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1674, after having hit a two-month low of $1.1626 on Thursday, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.30. GBP/USD rose 0.2% at 1.2771, helped by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s scaled-back support for workers hit by Covid-19’s second wave.
Talk that the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives were working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week helped boost risk sentiment. This reversed earlier gains by the greenback after disappointing weekly employment numbers had pointed to a stagnating economic recovery.
That said, just because talks could resume between House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin doesn’t mean any form of compromise is likely. Particularly with trust between the two sides in short supply in the wake of President Donald Trump refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost the election.
“Downgrades to growth expectations, the lack of imminent fiscal stimulus and U.S. election uncertainty is not the mix under which cyclical FX would thrive. In the near-term, we think USD and the safe-haven JPY are likely to outperform,” wrote analysts at ING, in a research note.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY dropped 0.1% to 6.8194, with the yuan posting gains after FTSE Russell announced it will add Chinese government bonds to its flagship World Government Bond Index starting in 2021.
“I think this is another important landmark in China’s ... internationalization of their domestic financial markets,” Ben Powell, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute’s chief investment strategist for Asia Pacific said on CNBC earlier Friday.
Additionally, USD/TRY fell 1.3% to 7.5196, with the lira extending gains following a jump from Thursday's record low after the country's central bank unexpectedly hiked interest rates by 200 basis points.
“Exchange rate developments will likely remain one of the key determinants of the CBT's policy in the period ahead, though the hike should support the Turkish lira in the near term,” said ING.

215,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. government borrowing soared to 173.7 billion pounds ($222 billion) in the first five months of the fiscal year as the costs of coronavirus pandemic continued to mount.
The budget deficit in August alone was 35.9 billion pounds, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. Britain now has borrowed more since a national lockdown was imposed in March than during the whole of the year following the 2008-09 financial crisis.The figures come a day after Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a 5 billion-pound plan to rescue millions of jobs and businesses from a winter crisis as a resurgence of Covid-19 threatens to derail the economy.The pandemic has wrought havoc with the public finances. Debt is now above 2 trillion pounds and the deficit –- the amount the government needs to borrow to fund its spending -– is set to be approaching 400 billion pounds in the current fiscal year.
At almost a fifth of gross domestic product, it would represent the largest gap in British peacetime. In 2009-10, the deficit hit 158.3 billion pounds, or around 10% of the economy.
With Bank of England bond-buying keeping borrowing costs at record lows, the deficit is affordable for now but Sunak has said the public finances will have to be returned to a sustainable footing once the crisis is over -– a hint that Britain faces tax rises in the medium term.
Tax revenue was down 14% in August compared with a year earlier and spending jumped by a third. Spending was boosted by 500 million pounds paid to restaurants under Eat Out to Help Out, a Treasury-sponsored initiative to help the beleaguered hospitality industry, and 11 billion pounds for workers idled as a result of the pandemic.
Even before Thursday’s announcement, the Office for Budget Responsibility put the cost of direct support for the economy in 2020-21 at over 190 billion pounds.
Net debt was 2.02 trillion pounds last month, or 101.9% of GDP, the highest debt ratio since 1961. A cash-based measure of the deficit used to determine government bond issuance was an unprecedented 221.2 billion pounds in the fiscal year to date.

216,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The market will need to wait another day to know if Turkey’s surprise interest-rate increase will achieve the intended effect.
The key one-week repo rate the central bank raised to 10.25% on Thursday has for weeks been a benchmark in name only as policy makers used other funding channels to raise the cost of money and try to contain the lira’s weakness.
More than a month of such tightening by stealth has pushed up the average cost of cash provided by the central bank to 10.69% on Thursday from as low as 7.34% in July. It’s been higher than Turkey’s new benchmark level since Sept. 11.
Should the central bank stop funding lenders from its more costly tools on Friday and provide all of the necessary liquidity through its one-week repo window instead, the rate hike could therefore effectively morph into a cut. The bank’s funding choices in the days ahead will determine how much tightening -- if any -- it will deliver to the economy.
Since a new round of currency depreciation started last month, the monetary authority has been modifying the amount of liquidity available to lenders across its various rates.
If policy makers restart the benchmark one-week repo auctions in the days ahead, the weighted average cost of funding could even start dropping from current levels, marking a reversal in tightening measures.
“It all depends on the day-to-day funding conditions that they will implement going forward,” said Cristian Maggio, the head of emerging-market research at TD Securities in London. “Even if it is a case of real tightening, how long will it last for? We have no guarantee that the Turkish central bank won’t start reverting to repo funding as soon as the lira enters a more stable path toward appreciation.”

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, after earlier gains were reversed over lingering doubts about the latest U.S. stimulus package. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan was boosted by the inclusion of Chinese debt to FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond (WGBI) index.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 94.365 by 9:52 PM ET (1:52 AM GMT).
U.S. markets rose on Thursday over increased hopes that the U.S. Congress would break a months-long impasse to pass the latest COVID-19 stimulus measures. Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced that they are working on a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package that could be voted on next week. There is also a suggestion that House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin could resume stalled stimulus talks.
But some investors remained skeptical on whether Congress will overcome the impasse. U.S. President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he fail to be re-elected in November’s presidential elections, increasing the chances of a disputed election.
Meanwhile, data released on Thursday showed that the number of Americans claiming unemployment over the past week increased to 870,000, indicating a slowdown in the economic recovery and highlighting the pressing need for Congress to pass the support measures.
“We have seen lately the dollar gaining as risk assets are sold off. We need to see whether this will continue beyond the end of this month,” Daiwa Securities senior strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.07% to 105.47.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.22% to 6.8123. The offshore yuan reversed its decline over the past week after FTSE Russell’s announcement that Chinese government bonds will be added to the WGBI index starting in 2021.
“Foreign ownership of Chinese government bonds has picked up steadily. The inclusion in the WGBI benchmark will prompt additional foreign flows into the Chinese bond market and support the yuan,” Commonwealth Bank China economist Kevin Xie told Reuters.

218,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- A nascent revival in the dollar, after a summer of predictions about its demise, is highlighting why it’s still the ultimate haven currency.
After abandoning the greenback due to the Federal Reserve’s accommodative policy, some investors are piling back in, leading to a squeeze of short positions. Liquidity, yield advantage and a lack of alternatives have helped to rekindle interest just as the U.S. starts to get a handle on the coronavirus pandemic in some places.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is poised to gain more than 1.5% this week, the biggest five-day advance since April. Technicals suggest more gains are in the pipeline. The gauge had dropped over 10% from its March highs to this year’s low in September, with hedge funds turning bearish on the dollar for the first time since May 2018.
“The dollar is the safe haven of choice until we get new information on the vaccine, earnings, election and stimulus,” said Thomas J. Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. “Until then, the dollar is likely to have bottomed in the short term.”
Still, history cautions that a further advance is far from certain. The greenback also rallied in June but quickly gave back its gains as concerns about the global economic outlook receded.
Here’s a look at the dollar’s advantages in retaining its status as the supreme haven currency:
Yields
While futures indicate the Fed will keep the policy rate near zero at least until the end of next year, that isn’t as dovish as the negative-rate policy adopted by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.
At about 0.2%, the greenback’s three-month interest rate is the highest among Group-of-10 currencies after the New Zealand dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The dollar is expected to take pole position if the Reserve Bank of New Zealand goes ahead with a plan to deploy sub-zero rates to support growth.
Lack of Better Alternatives
A dearth of alternatives is another factor in the dollar’s favor. Gold, which has gained almost 20% since end-March to outperform the greenback, offers no yield and, in some cases, costs money for storage.
The yen is another traditional haven, but a collapse of its positive correlation with equity volatility suggests that this status is weakening.
Liquidity
The liquidity factor also supports the greenback. The currency’s daily average turnover is five times that of the yen’s and more than twice that of the euro, according to a report from the Bank for International Settlements in April 2019.
During the height of the coronavirus pandemic in March, a rush for the dollar triggered a spike in the greenback and a surge in its borrowing costs in foreign-exchange swap markets. That in turn prompted the Fed to boost dollar supply in cooperation with other central banks.
“There’s still a great deal of confidence in the U.S. dollar being the go-to currency when markets become very volatile,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “A lot of investors are just being ready for a period of increased volatility which drives the dollar stronger.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dipped from a two-month peak early on Friday as renewed hopes of U.S. stimulus eased investors' concerns about economic recovery, while the Chinese yuan gained after the country was added to a global bond benchmark.
The dollar index edged down to 94.313 (=USD), after scaling a two-month high of 94.601 in Thursday's U.S session amid a bout of risk aversion.
Currencies and stocks reversed direction, with U.S. equities gaining as traders latched on to hopes that stalled stimulus talks could resume between House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week.
The move came after the latest data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week in a sign the economic recovery was running out of steam.
Many market players were cautious, however, as there remain doubts over whether the U.S. can overcome divisions to agree on a package.
U.S. political uncertainties are also keeping many investors on edge，with a disputed election becoming more likely after U.S. President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost the election. 
""We have seen lately the dollar gaining as risk assets are sold off. We need to see whether this will continue beyond the end of this month,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Rises in U.S. real yields have also underpinned the dollar. The yield on 10-year U.S. inflation-protected Treasuries rose to minus 0.911% (US10YTIP=RR), the highest since late July.
The euro changed hands at $1.1671 (EUR=) after having hit a two-month low of $1.16265 on Thursday.
The dollar was little moved at 105.41 yen , having risen to 105.53, its strongest level in a over week, on Thursday.

""Foreign ownership of Chinese government bonds has picked up steadily. The inclusion in the WGBI benchmark will prompt additional foreign flows into the Chinese bond market and support the yuan,"" said Kevin Xie, China economist at the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney.

220,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese sovereign bonds have won inclusion into FTSE Russell’s benchmark bond index a year after they were rejected.
The index compiler owned by the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) said the debt would be added to its flagship World Government Bond Index. The inclusion will start in October 2021, according to a statement after U.S. markets closed Thursday.
The inclusion gives foreign investors yet another way to invest in Chinese debt and should prompt inflows into the world’s second-largest bond market.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it would probably attract as much as $90 billion from September next year. FTSE Russell becomes the last of the three main index compilers to add Chinese debt after Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Bloomberg Barclays is owned by Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.
The higher yields on Chinese sovereign bonds have been attractive to investors from around the world given the returns on most notes in developed nations are near zero. China’s rate premium over the U.S. debt is near the highest level on record.
Inflows into the nation’s debt market from abroad have jumped nearly 40% each year since 2017 to a record $383 billion as of the end of June, data from the People’s Bank of China show. Foreigners still account for less than 3% of the $16 trillion market.
When FTSE Russell rejected Chinese debt for inclusion a year ago it cited the need for greater secondary market liquidity, as well as increased flexibility in foreign exchange execution and the settlement of transactions. China has made a number of reforms to its bond market since then, some of them touching on those issues. In April, the index compiler acknowledged that China had addressed calls to increase market accessibility and provided investors with greater currency trading options and improvements to liquidity.
Chinese government bonds have fallen for five straight months, taking the yield to around 3.10%. The notes have been under pressure amid concern about tighter liquidity, a central bank that has avoided cutting interest rates and growing appetite for riskier assets as an economic recovery from the virus pandemic accelerates. The nation’s benchmark CSI 300 Index is trading near the five-year high it reached in July.
Expectations that FTSE Russell would add Chinese bonds to its indexes have helped sentiment for China’s yuan. The currency has surged about 3.5% this quarter, the most in Asia.

Investing.com – The pound found its footing against the dollar Thursday, after the U.K. unveiled fresh measures to protect jobs and businesses that helped ease fears about the impact of newly imposed lockdown measures on the economy.
GBP/USD rose 0.39%, to $1.2772.
As the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps across the U.K., forcing the government to take action to curb infections that would likely hurt the recovery, the U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak attempted on Thursday to ease the economic fallout.
Unveiled in the new plans, the U.K. will subsidize the pay of employees who have not returned to work full time but are working at least a third of their usual hours. The plan will start in November.
Ahead of the announcement, U.K. business - fearing that a second wave will trigger a surge job losses - had been calling on the government to renew support for the furlough scheme, which is set to expire at the end of October.
The new measures come as the U.K. reported a near-record rise in cases of 6,634 on Wednesday.
The move was welcomed by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, though he appeared less optimistic on the economy. ""It's reasonable to think the fast pattern of the recovery over the summer is not going to continue in the same way,""  Bailey said, according to a report from Reuters.
The reprieve in the pound could be short-lived, however, as the focus is set to turn uncertainty around U.K. and EU trade talks.
The EU has threatened to take legal action against the U.K. over plans to press ahead with the so-called internal market bill that seeks to undermine parts of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. The EU has set a deadline of the end of this month for the U.K. to scrap the bill."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, as concerns about the global economic recovery given a second-wave of Covid-19 infections prompted traders to desert riskier assets in favor of safe havens.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 94.505, around levels last seen two months ago.
Additionally, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1653, just shy of a two-month low high reached on Wednesday, GBP/USD fell 0.2% at 1.2694, near levels last seen in late July, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.34.
“The dollar is holding onto gains as global sentiment remains fragile amid rising Covid cases and renewed lockdown measures in Europe,” according to analysts at ING, in a research note.
France became the latest country to tighten restrictions on social gatherings on Thursday, announcing a 10 PM curfew on bars and restaurants as well as other measures. 
Also helping the flow away from riskier assets, a number of Federal Reserve policymakers wared that further government aid is needed to bolster the economy, with that stimulus looking very unlikely in the near term. The drop in IHS Markit's U.S. PMI, while less closely tracked than the Institute for Supply Management's survey, didn't help. 
Focus is set to turn to the German Ifo survey, due later Thursday, which is forecast to show an improvement in business morale in Europe's largest economy.
Elsewhere, USD/CHF traded 0.1% higher at 0.9240, while EUR/CHF dropped 0.1% to 1.0767 ahead of the Swiss National Bank’s latest policy-setting meeting.
The central bank is widely expected to keep its key deposit rate at -0.75%, as the franc has declined around 1% since the SNB’s last policy meeting in June, relieving pressure on the central bank to counter the disinflationary effects of a rallying currency.
Central bank meetings in Egypt and Turkey later Thursday will also be studied carefully by foreign exchange traders, given the risk of large currency moves: the Turkish lira hit another new all-time low in early trading before bouncing.
All but one of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict Egypt’s central bank will hold its benchmark deposit rate at 9.25%, with the bank’s last move being a cut of 300 basis points in March.
The central bank’s focus remains on keeping capital inflows high, with Egypt’s real interest rate among the world’s highest.
In Turkey, the situation is more fluid, but only three of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict the key one-week repo rate will rise from 8.25%. That said, six institutions, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), forecast an increase in the late liquidity lending rate -- the central bank’s highest -- of between a quarter-percentage point to 100 basis points.
At 2:55 AM ET, USD/TRY traded 0.1% lower at 7.5869, while USD/EGP rose 0.3% to 15.7500.

223,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",,,"(Bloomberg) -- Euro-zone banks are gearing up for another dose of ultra-cheap funding as the European Central Bank gives them every possible incentive to lend to the pandemic-stricken economy.
Thursday’s installment of targeted loans, known as TLTROs, will give banks long-term loans for an interest rate as low as minus 1% -- meaning the ECB pays them to borrow -- as long as they lend the cash onto companies and households.
Attractive as the offer is, banks are already well-funded after taking a record 1.3 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) in the previous operation three months ago. Estimates this time range from 10 billion euros by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc to 200 billion euros at NatWest Markets Plc. The result will be announced at 11:30 a.m. in Frankfurt.
“More than 100 billion euros would mean we’re in business,” said Rishi Mishra, an analyst at Futures First.
The TLTRO has become one of the ECB’s most-important tools because it more than compensates banks for the official policy rate of minus 0.5%. The policy rate is a charge on banks’ deposits, undercutting profitability and potentially dissuading them from lending.
Some economists reckon the ECB has stumbled on a dual-rate system that allows it to cut borrowing costs with no practical limit without damaging the banking system.
Still, the extraordinary access to cheap cash -- combined with other monetary stimulus such as massive bond-buying programs -- does raise the prospect of side effects such as elevated asset prices and risky lending.
It could even undermine the ECB’s influence over short-term market rates. Three-month Euribor -- the rate at which banks can theoretically borrow from one another -- fell to a record low of minus 0.508% this week.
When it dropped below the ECB’s policy rate last week, that was a phenomenon that had happened only once before, in August 2019, shortly before the central bank cut its deposit rate.
Excess liquidity in the euro zone, the money over and above that needed to finance the economy, will probably soon pass 3 trillion euros for the first time.
More stimulus could be ahead. The ECB projects that the economy will contract 8% this year, and the inflation rate has fallen below zero for the first time in four years. Rising coronavirus infections could worsen the outlook.
Economists predict the 1.35 trillion-euro pandemic bond-buying program will be expanded again this year. Markets aren’t pricing another 10 basis-point rate cut until October 2021.
Piet Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, estimates that excess liquidity will rise by another 600 billion euros to 800 billion euros by the summer of 2021.
“We think this dovish view should and will prevail,” said Frederik Ducrozet, chief global strategist at Banque Pictet & Cie in Geneva.

Investing.com – The dollar inched down on Thursday morning in Asia, giving up gains from the previous session over U.S. Federal Reserve officials’ warnings over the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 and disappointing data from both the U.S. and Europe.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.02% to 94.422 by 10:04 AM ET (2:04 AM GMT). The dollar has seen a rally during the past week as the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe diminished investor optimism over the progress of a potential COIVD-19 vaccine.
A slew of Fed officials stressed the need for more fiscal stimulus to sustain the recovery on Wednesday, as investors continue to lose hope that the U.S. Congress would pass the latest support measures.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell led the charge during a congressional hearing, where he stated that more support was likely to be necessary. Other officials adding their voices were Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. Rosengren said that it would take another wave of infections to prompt action, and this not likely until next year.
Alongside the Fed’s warning, data released on Wednesday showed that U.S. business activity slowed in September and several Fed policymakers warned that further government aid is needed to bolster the economy.
In Europe, the Markit Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and the services PMI saw falls in September, with the services PMI slipping below the 50-mark separating contraction from expansion to 47.6. With the continent currently battling a fresh outbreak of COVID-19, investors are looking to the Ifo survey, due later in the day, to gauge German business sentiment.
However, some investors said that the greenback could continue to be bolstered as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise and the Fed’s comments prompt investors to repatriate funds from riskier assets.
“Risk is being sold across the board, and there is a big unwinding of dollar shorts,” Daiwa Securities foreign exchange strategist Yukio Ishizuki told Reuters.
“Questions surrounding COVID-19 and the need for even more stimulus are turning flows back to the dollar,” Ishizuki added.
The USD/JPY pair inched 0.05% to 105.42.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.19% to 0.7060 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.09% to 0.6540. The Antipodean currencies are expected to come under pressure due to a recent decline in commodity prices and a growing expectation of additional monetary easing, some investors said.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.13% to 6.8177.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 1.2725, after hovering near its weakest levels since late July."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains against most currencies on Thursday as signs of economic slowdown in Europe and the United States renewed concern about a second wave of coronavirus infections.
The euro, which has already taken a hit due to worries about a return to severe lockdown restrictions, faces an additional hurdle later on Thursday with the release of data on German business sentiment.
The dollar is likely to continue to rise as another spike in coronavirus cases and the Federal Reserve's warnings that the U.S. economy needs more fiscal stimulus cause investors to repatriate funds from riskier assets.
""Risk is being sold across the board, and there is a big unwinding of dollar shorts,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""Questions surrounding the coronavirus and the need for even more stimulus are turning flows back to the dollar.""
The dollar traded at $1.1658 per euro (EUR=D3) on Thursday in Asia, just shy of a two-month low high reached on Wednesday. 
The pound  bought $1.2714, near its weakest level since late July.
The dollar was quoted at 0.9240 Swiss franc , which is near a nine-week high.
The U.S. currency bought 105.40 yen , holding onto a 0.4% gain from the previous session.
The dollar has rallied this week as rising coronavirus infections in Europe and Britain undermined investor optimism about vaccine progress.
The Ifo survey due later on Thursday is forecast to show an improvement in business morale in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
However, sentiment for the euro has already suffered a big blow after surveys released on Wednesday showed new restrictions to quell a resurgence in coronavirus infections slammed the euro zone's services industry into reverse.
The mood for riskier assets has also soured after data on Wednesday showed U.S. business activity slowed in September and several Fed policymakers warned that further government aid is needed to bolster the economy.
The dollar index (=USD), which pits the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, stood at 94.336 on Thursday, close to a nine-week high.
There are no major economic data releases scheduled during the Asian session, so trading could be subdued, analysts said.
Some investors are watching the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which have come under pressure due to growing expectations for additional monetary easing.
A recent decline in commodity prices is expected to increase downside risks for the Antipodean currencies, some traders say.
The Aussie  traded at $0.7069, near its weakest since July 21.

Across the Tasman Sea, the kiwi  bought $0.6549 after tumbling by 1.3% in the previous session.

226,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Foreign investors are likely to have a new channel to invest in China’s government bonds.
FTSE Russell will announce whether it will add the nation’s sovereign debt into its indexes after U.S. markets close on Thursday, a year after rejecting the notes.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) puts the odds of inclusion this time round at 90%.
With yields near zero for most developed nation bonds, the 3.1% offered by China’s benchmark 10-year bond has been pulling in investors from Singapore to the U.K. Inflows into the nation’s debt market from overseas investors jumped nearly 40% a year since 2017 to a record $383 billion by the end of June, central bank data as of the end of June showed. That’s yet to have much impact on the bonds given foreigners account for less than 3% of the $16 trillion market.
According to Morgan Stanley, inclusion by FTSE Russell will likely spur inflows of as much as $90 billion from September 2021. FTSE Russell is the last of the three main index compilers to consider adding Chinese debt after Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Bloomberg LP owns Bloomberg Barclays and Bloomberg News.
Last time around, FTSE Russell cited the need for greater secondary market liquidity, as well as increased flexibility in foreign exchange execution and the settlement of transactions to meet inclusion criteria. In April the index compiler acknowledged that China had addressed calls to increase market accessibility and provided investors with greater currency trading options and improvements to liquidity.
“All of this additional flexibility and feasibility of hedging are making offshore investors more comfortable about entering into the onshore bond market for capital investment,” said George Sun, head of global markets for Greater China at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) China Ltd.
Despite inflows from foreign investors, Chinese bonds are poised to fall for a fifth straight month in September, making them the worst performer in the Asia Pacific region. The notes have been under pressure amid concern about tighter liquidity, a cautious central bank that has refrained from cutting interest rates and growing appetite for riskier assets as an economic recovery gathers pace.
As a result, China’s 10-year government note offers a yield premium of about 240 basis points over U.S. peers, near a record high. That could help attract “persistent and large” fund inflows,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said in a note this week.
Optimism that the nation’s debt will be added to the FTSE Russell index has been among factors driving a rally in China’s currency, which is on track for its biggest quarterly gain since 2008.
“China’s bond market internationalisation is happening regardless of FTSE Russell inclusion which is but an endorsement of a structural shift well underway,” said Wilfred Wee, a portfolio manager at Ninety One Singapore Pte Ltd.

Investin.com – The euro fell to a nearly two-month low against the dollar as data on Wednesday signaled the resurgence of Covid-19 is hurting the bloc's economic recovery as services fell into contraction territory for the first time in three months.
EUR/USD fell 0.26% to $1.1676, to remain near lows of the day of $1.1664.
The IHS Markit flash eurozone purchasing managers’ index for services fell to 47.6 in September, from 50.5 in the previous month, data published on Wednesday showed. It was the first time in three months that the reading had dropped below a reading of 50, signifying a contraction, and was the lowest level since May.
""The second wave of corona infections in many euro countries appears to be slowing down the recovery in the services sector,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said, pointing to a recent report showing weakened activity in the eurozone.
Some of the eurozone's biggest economies have seen a steady rise in cases over the past two weeks, with Spain, France and the Netherlands among the countries feared to be dealing with a second wave of infection.  The Netherlands reported that infections hit a record high on Wednesday, with 2,357 confirmed over the previous 24 hours.
Eurozone manufacturing activity improved, however, rising to a reading of 53.7, its highest in two years. But against the backdrop of rising coronavirus infection, governments may be forced to impose tighter restrictions that could stall the pick-up in manufacturing.
""(G)iven the increased number of cities being subject to tighter restrictions in an attempt to contain the spread of Covid-19, there is certainly the risk of a further weakening in services in the coming quarter, which might in due course take its toll on the manufacturing sector too,"" Daiwa said.  "

LONDON (Reuters) - After years of intervening to dampen the Swiss franc's exchange rate against the euro, Switzerland's authorities may be embarking on another, potentially tougher battle as dollar weakness starts to test their tolerance.
While the Swiss National Bank is unlikely to take any action at its meeting on Thursday, it will almost certainly have considered how to adapt its currency intervention policy to the prospects of a long period of dollar weakness after the Federal Reserve's recent pivot to an ultra-dovish stance. 
The problem for the export-reliant Swiss economy is that the trade-weighted franc has surged to five-year highs, making the country's exports more expensive overseas.
The euro, the currency of Switzerland's main trade partner, has firmed this year, suggesting the franc's rise is largely down to its 4.6% year-to-date gain versus the greenback, although on Wednesday it dipped to a seven-week low.
(Graphic: Franc at five year highs link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmbaebvr/Pasted%20image%201600868562049.png)
""This is a story not only about the euro, but also it is important for the SNB to mitigate the depreciation of the dollar,"" said Valentin Bissat, senior economist at Mirabaud.
Part of the SNB's dilemma, and the main reason for its intervention policy, is that everyone rushes to buy the safe-haven franc when a crisis hits. 
Now, with interest rates at minus 0.75% and in view of its twin mandates of ensuring price stability and supporting exports, the SNB has few other effective options but to intervene to keep a lid on the franc.
But this policy, particularly if seen as targeting the dollar, carries risks, above all that the United States could label Switzerland a currency manipulator, a designation it assigns to countries it thinks are engaging in ""unfair currency practices"" for a trade advantage.
The latest U.S. report on currency manipulation is due in the coming weeks
Bissat reckons the SNB is already acting against the dollar. While it does not disclose what currencies it is buying, sight deposits at commercial banks – a proxy for SNB interventions – have risen even as the euro strengthened.
(Graphic: SNB sight deposits vs euro link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxqxzjvx/Pasted%20image%201600869168598.png)
Bissat estimates the SNB has bought around $20 billion in foreign exchange since the end of June. 
Meanwhile, the dollar has become more important for Swiss trade, in particular its large pharma sector, and the United States is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner, accounting for 42 billion francs in exports last year.
Volatility around the U.S. November elections may also lead to safe-haven flows into the franc.
Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy at UBP, expects the franc to strengthen to 0.89 versus the dollar by the end of 2020 and 0.81 by the end of 2021, up from 0.92265 now .
""It's (the U.S.) dollar but it's a Swiss problem,"" said Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy at UBP, referring to former Treasury secretary John Connally's remark at a 1971 meeting of finance ministers that the dollar is ""our currency but your problem"".
MANIPULATOR
Analysts believe the SNB buys euros, then uses those to buy other currencies, though it has also intervened directly in dollar-franc, notably during a 2015 franc surge.
The SNB declined to comment on its dollar strategy, but Chairman Thomas Jordan says he has explained its position to the United States.
Officials have said in the past that interventions are aimed at limiting the appreciation of an ""overvalued"" currency, rather than at deliberate devaluation to help exporters.
Nonetheless, Mirabaud's Bissat reckons it will be branded a currency manipulator at the Treasury's next review. 
""Until now Switzerland met only two (criteria) - their current account balance which is higher than 2 percent of GDP, and the bilateral trade surplus with the U.S., but now they will have the final part – 2% of GDP of net FX purchases,"" he said.
The implications for Switzerland are unclear but when the United States added China to the list, it then pledged to engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate what it called Beijing's unfair competitive advantage. Import tariffs could eventually follow.
And adding to the SNB's headaches, the ECB has made clear it will not tolerate too much euro appreciation.

Meanwhile the euro's run to two-year highs has run out of steam following ECB policymakers' warning. Possibly, the SNB's respite on that front too may have been short-lived.

229,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound extended its decline to a two-month low as investors fretted over the possibility of a new lockdown in Britain.
The currency declined as much as 0.4% to $1.2680 after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that he can’t rule out a nationwide shutdown. Government bonds rallied, sending the yield across tenors down about two basis points.
Less than 12 hours earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set new rules to curb the rise in coronavirus cases, including a 10 p.m. closing time for pubs and restaurants and a recommendation for office workers to work from home if they can.
These announcements don’t “inspire confidence in U.K. services or the economic outlook,” said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. Strength in the dollar and short covering are another contributing factor to the pound’s weakness following hawkish comments from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.
The new U.K. restrictions have put an abrupt end to the government’s drive to open its economy and revive growth. The first nationwide lockdown that shuttered social and commercial activity in March triggered the U.K.’s worst recession in more than a century. But infection numbers have been spiking after the summer holidays, with daily confirmed cases around 4,000 over the past week.
Economic Pain
The new restrictions unveiled by Johnson -- combined with the withdrawal of some fiscal stimulus and risks of a messy exit from the European Union when the transition period ends -- mean there could be no economic growth in either the fourth quarter or the first three months of next year, according to Bank of America Global Research.
And if the government opts for a two-week shutdown of the U.K. hospitality sector, it may knock at least 2% off the nation’s gross domestic product and trigger further stimulus from the Treasury and Bank of England, according to {{0| JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase}} & Co.
Raab was “doing his best to sink the pound,” said Valentin Marinov, the head of Group-of-10 foreign exchange strategy at Credit Agricole. “The pound should remain vulnerable ahead of today’s PMIs that could show first signs of outlook deterioration following the post-Covid-19 rebound over the summer.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Faced with the costs of competing in a world of electronic and algorithmic trading, many banks are outsourcing parts of their foreign exchange businesses, a trend that may cement big lenders' dominance of global currency trading.
Loose, informal relationships where smaller players rely on bigger peers for the best prices and liquidity have long existed in the $6.6 trillion-a-day FX market. But as high-tech trading supercharges competition for the fastest speeds and tightest prices, more formal tie-ups are becoming common.
Given the importance of forex to corporate clients, few banks would opt to drastically reduce FX operations, the way they could with equities trading, for example. They are choosing instead to pull back from areas where they cannot compete but still want to sell to their customers.
""UK and European banks have had to focus on areas of strength and an inevitable consequence of this is to look for partnerships. Naturally it makes sense to sub-contract some,"" said Simon Manwaring, who heads currency trading at NatWest Markets.
This can involve accessing liquidity provided by multiple other banks, or more formal agreements to rely on a specific institution for certain currencies, or during a specific time of the trading day.
While outsourcing constitutes a small part of NatWest's trading volume, Manwaring said it makes sense for currencies or time zones where the bank has little geographic presence.
The opacity of FX markets makes it impossible to measure the scale the practice, which is often called white labelling because the end client always trades with and has exposure to their own bank.
But what is clear is the growing concentration of trading, with the FX market share of the five top banks rising to 41% in the first half of 2020, versus 37% in 2016, data from Coalition shows. 
Sweden's SEB looks to other banks to supply liquidity in emerging market currencies, certain FX option products and to help execute computer-run algo trading, its global head of FX, Svante Hedin told Reuters, adding that the progression of technology had accelerated outsourcing.
Other factors behind the shift include shrinking profit margins and regulations like Europe's Mifid II, which require banks and investors secure the best execution prices for clients.
Measuring prices paid on FX deals through third-party transaction analysis is far easier now than five years ago, market participants note.
BATTLING THE BANKS
The big lenders dismiss fears that outsourcing will further tighten their grip, noting that their dominance and creditworthiness allow them to offer clients the best prices in the safest way. 
Graphic - Market share FX markets: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqnwrmvx/market%20share%20FX%20markets.png 
There are also real hurdles to clear. Industry insiders say conversations often lead nowhere, while formal agreements between two institutions are particularly tough as banks and clients baulk at exclusive arrangements that restrict their ability to trade with others.
Newer electronic market-making outfits such as Citadel Securities and XTX Markets are in the meantime battling with the banks, although their role is largely limited to spot trading.
Kevin Kimmel, Global Head of eFX at Citadel Securities, said market-makers had to show ""exceptional execution quality"" so that banks -- who will still have the reputational risk of offering uncompetitive prices -- felt comfortable offering those prices to clients.
The newer entrants compete directly with banks on multi-dealer trading platforms, as well as offering outsourcing tie-ups so banks can use their liquidity.
Citadel Securities has increased the number of white labelling partnerships it has with banks this year, according to a source familiar with the matter, while XTX recently launched an FX execution algorithm marketed to investors, banks and trading platforms.
So what's next? Despite the recent growth, outsourcing in FX remains limited. But Vincent Bonamy, head of global intermediary services at HSBC, believes more and wider agreements are on the cards.

""The interesting part of this is the potential expansion into broader outsourcing among different players in the market,"" he said. ""It's not only about distribution but (also) FX settlement and execution potentially.""

Helping the greenback was U.S. data showed that existing home sales surged to 6 million in August, the highest level in nearly 14 years. This puts September’s PMI sentiment data, due later Wednesday, firmly in focus.
Comments from Chicago U.S. Federal Reserve President Charles Evans also pushed the dollar higher, after he struck a hawkish tone and said further quantitative easing may not provide additional lift to the U.S. economy. He also hinted that it might be possible for the Fed to raise interest rates before inflation starts to average 2%.
A third factor helping the dollar, to the detriment of the euro and sterling, has been worries about surging coronavirus infections in countries like the U.K., France and Spain. On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced further restrictions for a possible six months to try and curb a rise in cases.
That said,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) sees these dollar gains as being temporary, as “a combination of the most negative real rates on record and the widest peacetime twin deficit leaves the dollar vulnerable to further weakness,” the bank’s analysts wrote in a research note. “The two key event risks for the rest of the year risk accelerating these trends.”
The bank sees these two key risks as being the races to win the White House and to produce a Covid-19 vaccine.
For Deutsche, a Democratic sweep in November would leave the dollar most vulnerable because it could lead to more economic stimulus, increasing deficits. And progress on a vaccine would boost expectations for global growth and support risk appetite, undermining the dollar.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 6.7901, after the People’s Bank of China’s yuan fixing was weaker than expected for a second day.
“The fixing has been weaker for two days, which might be a signal that policy makers want to somewhat manage the pace of the rally,” said Hao Zhou, an economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), in a Bloomberg report. “It is time for investors and policy makers to take a break and think about the pros and cons of the rally.”
NZD/USD dropped 0.5% to 0.6603, despite New Zealand’s central bank maintaining the size of its quantitative easing program and kept interest rates at a record low.
The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said it was “prepared to provide additional stimulus,” adding that it is making progress on additional tools including negative rates to use if more stimulus is required.

232,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan fixing was weaker than expected for a second day, reinforcing speculation that the central bank wants to slow the currency’s biggest quarterly rally since 2008.
The People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate at 6.7986 per dollar on Wednesday, after the greenback strengthened overnight. That was 43 basis points weaker than the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey, following a gap on Tuesday that was the widest in about two months. The yuan dropped as much as 0.23% to 6.7975 per dollar in early trading.
The Chinese currency has been rallying due to a slumping dollar, signs the economy is recovering from the virus pandemic, a yield premium over U.S. assets and optimism the country’s debt will be added to global indexes. The onshore yuan has jumped about 4% against the dollar this quarter, on track for its biggest such gain in 12 years.
“The fixing has been weaker for two days, which might be a signal that policy makers want to somewhat manage the pace of the rally,” said Hao Zhou, an economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “It is time for investors and policy makers to take a break and think about the pros and cons of the rally.”
The Chinese currency is flirting with its biggest quarterly advance in data going back to 1981, with the gain now just shy of a 4.2% surge to start 2008. The rally has come as the dollar slumped, sending the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index to its lowest in two years last week. That measure of greenback strength was last up 0.13%, climbing for a fourth session to head for its highest in six weeks.
A rate premium over the U.S. is another factor bolstering the yuan. The yield on Chinese government bonds due in a decade over comparable U.S. notes is near the highest on record. Also helping sentiment are expectations that FTSE Russell will say this week that it plans to add China bonds to its flagship indexes.
Beijing took a relatively hands-off approach to yuan appreciation during its recent surge. That’s a departure from a few years ago when it tried rein in gains due to fears a strong currency would hurt exporters. This time around, China has changed its strategy for boosting growth, preferring to focus on cheapening imports and bolstering domestic consumption.

“Monetary policy will need to provide significant economic support for a long time to come to meet the inflation and employment remit,” the Reserve Bank said Wednesday in Wellington after holding the official cash rate at 0.25% and keeping its Large Scale Asset Purchase program at NZ$100 billion ($66 billion). The Monetary Policy Committee is “prepared to provide additional stimulus,” it said.
New Zealand’s recovery from its worst economic contraction since the Great Depression is being hampered by a second coronavirus outbreak in largest city Auckland, and the jobless rate is expected to rise as the nation’s closed border cripples the key tourism industry. RBNZ officials are developing a stimulus package combining a negative cash rate and wholesale bank funding that will give the monetary policy committee options if its inflation and employment targets remain under pressure.
The bank said today that a funding for lending facility will be “ready before the end of this calendar year” and that tools could be deployed independently.
Economists expect the RBNZ to outline its stimulus plans at the next Monetary Policy Statement on Nov. 11, when it will publish fresh forecasts for the economy and the cash rate. The central bank reiterated guidance today that it intends hold the OCR at 0.25% until at least March.
The New Zealand dollar rose on the statement. It bought 66.28 U.S. cents at 2:10 p.m. in Wellington. Short-dated New Zealand bond yields have already turned negative as investors ramp up bets that the RBNZ will cut rates next year.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, holding onto gains from the previous session on the back of positive economic data from the U.S. and concerns over the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe.
COVID-19 cases also continue to rise in the U.S., with the number of deaths in the country surpassing 200,000 and the number of cases approaching 6.9 million as of September 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged up 0.18% to 94.162 by 9:38 PM ET (1:38 AM GMT), after reaching eight-week highs on Tuesday.
The U.S. data showed that existing home sales surged to 6 million in August, the highest level in nearly 14 years. But investors are also digesting comments from Chicago U.S. Federal Reserve President Charles Evans, who said on Tuesday that the U.S. economy risks a longer, slower recovery and “recessionary dynamics” if Congress fails to pass the latest fiscal stimulus package. He also hinted that it might be possible for the Fed to raise interest rates before inflation starts to average 2%.
All eyes are on whether the Senate will pass the stopgap funding bill to keep the federal government running through December 11, which was passed by the House of Representatives on Tuesday.
Although the dollar is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the short term as European COVID-19 cases continue to rise, continued uncertainty over November’s U.S. presidential elections could potentially expose the greenback to volatile swings.
“Some people are betting for more dollar strength against the euro, which looks overvalued,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
“The picture in Europe has completely changed, because the economic recovery is stalling and there is a second wave of the virus, but I’m also worried about U.S. politics,” he warned.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.21% to 105.14 as Japan returned from a national holiday.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.54% to 0.7136. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair was down 0.47% to 0.6603. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will meet later in the day and is widely expected to leave its official cash rate at record low levels, as well as give an updated assessment of the economic outlook.
The USD/CNY pair edged up 0.15% to 6.7881. The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 1.2725, after touching lows not seen since late July, after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced new restrictive measures. The measures are likely to be in place over the next six months, with Johnson urging Britons to work from home."

The Bloomberg dollar index has steadied in September after a five-month slide fueled by a slimming interest-rate advantage and improving risk appetite as global economies gradually reopened.
But “a combination of the most negative real rates on record and the widest peacetime twin deficit leaves the dollar vulnerable to further weakness,” the report said. “The two key event risks for the rest of the year risk accelerating these trends.”
The question of what the election will mean for the dollar is a key topic of debate on Wall Street. At least one analysis holds that the greenback may gain after the vote, no matter who wins.
For Deutsche, a Democratic sweep in November would leave the dollar most vulnerable because it could lead to more economic stimulus, increasing deficits. A Democratic victory might also spur greater global cooperation and a pivot away from tariffs, which “has the potential to be very dollar negative,” the report said. Meanwhile, progress on a vaccine would boost expectations for global growth and support risk appetite, undermining the dollar.
“For our view to be right, global growth and risk appetite need to do well after the U.S. election, even if the next few weeks are very bumpy,” according to the bank. “We will be wrong if a deadly second Covid wave or a big new trade war breaks out.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held onto gains against major currencies on Wednesday, supported by positive U.S. economic data and concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and Britain.
The New Zealand dollar is in focus before a meeting later on Wednesday where the country's central bank is expected to leave its official cash rate at record lows and update its assessment of the economic outlook.
The greenback is likely to continue to grind higher in the short term as the coronavirus rattles sentiment in Europe, but uncertainty about this year's U.S. presidential election means the dollar could be prone to more volatile swings. 
""Some people are betting for more dollar strength against the euro, which looks overvalued,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The picture in Europe has completely changed, because the economic recovery is stalling and there is a second wave of the virus, but I'm also worried about U.S. politics.""
The dollar was quoted at $1.1708 per euro (EUR=D3) on Wednesday in Asia, close to a two-month low hit in the previous trading session. 
The pound  bought $1.2744, near the lowest since late July, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled new restrictions on business activity to tackle a second wave of the coronavirus.
The dollar was quoted at 0.9198 Swiss franc , holding onto a 0.6% gain from Tuesday.
The U.S. currency was little changed at 105.06 yen .
On Tuesday the greenback was bolstered by data showing U.S. home sales surged to their highest level in nearly 14 years in August, but comments from a prominent Federal Reserve official sent mixed signals.
The U.S. economy risks a longer, slower recovery and ""recessionary dynamics"" if Congress fails to pass an additional fiscal stimulus package, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said on Tuesday.
It is possible for the Fed to raise interest rates before inflation starts to average 2%, Evans also said.
The dollar index (=USD), which pits the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.4% on Tuesday to 93.975.
Sentiment for the euro has slowly weakened as investors grow increasingly worried about surging coronavirus infections in countries like France and Spain, raising the risk of lockdowns.
Many euro zone countries have reintroduced travel restrictions, forcing airlines to scale back passenger services after a relatively quick run up over the summer.
Traders in the pound and the euro are also worried that Britain and the European Union will fail to agree a free trade deal, which would cause additional economic strain.
The New Zealand dollar  was quoted at $0.6631 ahead of policy decision by the country's central bank on Wednesday.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to hold off on further stimulus but traders want to see how the central bank assesses the impact of the coronavirus.

The Australian dollar  held steady at $0.7172, but the tone was slightly weak after a senior central banker on Tuesday flagged the prospect of currency market intervention and negative interest rates.

Investing.com – The pound slumped to a nearly two-month low Tuesday as the U.K. government imposed new lockdown measures that could halt the pace of economic recovery as the second wave of Covid-19 gathers pace.
GBP/USD by 0.62% to $1.2734, its lowest since July 27, to test 100-and 200-day moving averages at around the 1.2720 level.
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the country was at a “perilous turning point” and reversed the lifting of some lockdown measures in England.  
The warning comes as the UK reported 4,926 new infections, up from 4,368 on Monday.
The new restrictions include a curfew on pubs and a tightening of the 'rule of six,' which limits social gatherings up to a maximum of six people. The measures are likely to remain in place for six months, Johnson suggested.
As well as Covid-19 worries, the pound has been pressured by ongoing concerns about a no-deal Brexit. Johnson's internal markets bill, which undermines parts of the Brexit deal, has soured UK-EU relations.  
The bill is not expected to be debated in the House of Lords until after a key summit with EU leaders in mid-October, according to media reports.
The pound had earlier found some reprieve after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey pushed back against expectations the bank was considering cutting rates below zero. ""Yes [negative rates] it’s in the tool bag, but that does not imply anything about the probability of us using negative interest rates at the moment,"" Bailey said.
The weak start to the week for cable comes in the wake of data suggesting bullish bets on the currency pair is running out of steam.
""The second most sizable move in G10 positioning last week was the erosion of GBP net long positioning with a drop from 7% of open interest to 2%,"" ING said in a note. ""Still, GBP net shorts are nothing but a fraction of what we witnessed in other period where a no-deal outcome appeared as tangible as it is now."""
238,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Global commodity currencies and the pound are poised to suffer most among Group of 10 currencies if the dollar makes a more strident comeback.
The Norwegian krone, sterling, the Swedish krona, Australian and New Zealand dollars will cop the biggest losses, and in that order, a study of G-10 currencies suggests. The study, based on the sensitivity of currencies to changes in the U.S. Dollar Index over the past year, shows the Canadian dollar will be the least affected.
The study illustrates why the yen was less than perturbed by the swings in the market Monday amid considerable head-scratching by market observers as to why the haven currency didn’t rally amid the risk-off. Clearly, for currency traders, Monday’s move was more about the dollar’s comeback as a haven currency rather than a broad risk-off signal.
While it’s too early to call the greenback’s move a trend, the rebound comes barely two weeks after readers were warned about a wide divergence in fair values of key G-10 currencies. At 93.644, the dollar index is still undervalued in a currency fair-value model by well more than 3% and has a long way to go before that gap can be closed.
Only time will tell whether the dollar’s comeback is here to stay, but what is clear is that some crosses have more to lose than others if Monday’s moves morph into a trend.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, holding on to overnight gains as traders value its safe haven status while equity markets slump amid renewed virus concerns.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.727, climbing to a six-week high. 
Additionally, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1746, falling to a six-week low, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2792 after the U.K. government advised people to work from home, effectively abandoning its efforts to get people back into their usual workplaces and seemingly condemning the service sector in many big cities to further weeks of stagnation.
USD/JPY was largely flat at 104.63.
""The equity selloff gathered quite dramatic momentum during the European day and the risk-averse characteristics of the U.S. dollar really came to the fore,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX Ray Attrill, in a Reuters report.
This followed hefty losses in equity markets in Europe, with the German DAX dropping 4.4%, dragged down by selling in financial stocks after a fresh dirty money scandal. Weakness on Wall Street followed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1.8%.
Adding to the woes were fresh outbreaks of the Covid-19 virus in Europe, where the new restrictions only add to an existing pattern.
""A lot now depends on whether or not what we've seen in the last 24 hours is sustained,"" said Attrill. ""There's good reason to think that we could be in for a multiweek period where the dollar at least stops declining.""
This would mark a change in attitude by the foreign exchange market, as ING reported that the latest CFTC positioning data, as of Sept. 15,  “keeps adding evidence to the widespread USD bearish narrative.”
“For the first time since 2013, all but one of the G10 currencies reported by the CFTC show net long positioning vs the USD,” ING’s Francesco Pesole wrote in a research note.
Attention, now shifts to U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, as he makes the first of three appearances on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the raft of emergency measures the central bank has taken to help the country’s economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will also testify.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY fell 0.2% to 6.7934, with the yuan continuing to strengthen. This comes despite the People’s Bank of China fixing its reference rate at a weaker-than-expected level, the first signal that policy makers may want to rein in this quarter’s rapid appreciation in the currency.
The yuan was on track for its biggest ever quarterly gain, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1981, before the recent rebound in the dollar. It’s still up 4.1% since the end of June.

The People’s Bank of China’s reference rate was set at 6.7872 on Tuesday, after the spot rate weakened 0.51% overnight. That’s almost 60 basis points weaker than the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey, the largest gap on the weak side in about two months.
Still, the currency strengthened 0.22% to 6.7897 per dollar as of 9:35 a.m. in Shanghai.
“The market is growing increasingly concerned that the PBOC will guide the yuan weaker due to the rapid rally in the currency recently,” said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea Chinese Banking Corp. “We need to see a few more days’ fixings to see if the central bank can no longer tolerate the advance. Right now, investors still like to long the yuan given the strong fundamentals.”
The yuan was on track for its biggest ever quarterly gain in Bloomberg data going back to 1981, before a rebound in the greenback triggered a three-day slide in the Chinese currency. While a slump in the dollar has helped, Chinese media has attributed the gains to the nation’s economic recovery. It’s still up 4.1% since the end of June.
The PBOC had also helped by not standing in its way, which for some in the market was an incentive for the currency to push higher. The fixing limits the yuan’s move to 2% in either direction.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, clinging on to gains from the previous session as COIVD-19 fears and worries over the U.S. Congress’ stimulus impasse drove a heavy selloff in almost all other assets.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, inched up 0.04% to 93.602 by 9:48 PM ET (1:48 AM GMT).
“The equity selloff gathered quite dramatic momentum during the European day and the risk-averse characteristics of the U.S. dollar really came to the fore,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX Ray Attrill told Reuters.
Financials bore the brunt of the selloff, after HSBC (HK:0005) and  Standard Chartered  (HK:2888) were among 90 banks named in a leak of more than 2,100 suspicious activity reports (SARs) for moving over $2 trillion of reportedly illicit funds between 1995 and 2017, despite concerns over the funds’ origins.
A fresh outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, with the looming spectre of fresh lockdowns, and jitters over the continuing impasse in the U.S. Congress over the latest stimulus measures as the U.S. presidential election draws nearer, also saw investors turning to the greenback.
U.S. President Donald Trump said during a political rally on Monday that his questions about adjusting the dollar’s exchange rate to counter what he referred to as Chinese currency manipulation, were rebuffed.
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.12% to 104.52, after the safe-haven yen reached a six-month high during Monday’s Asian session.
The yen’s losses continued to bewilder investors.
“It’s not uncommon with sudden yen moves that it’s driven by domestic asset managers coming in to buy foreign assets at the lows, and buying dollars to pay for them,” Nomura executive Stuart Oakley told Reuters.
“But I don’t really know what is behind this particular bounce … my own personal view is this is all just a correction within a major trend for stronger asset prices in the U.S. and a weaker dollar, with the uber-easy U.S. monetary policy the overwhelming driver of everything,” Oakley added.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.17% to 0.7210, while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.6667 ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s rate decision on Wednesday.

Trump told thousands of supporters at a political rally in Dayton, Ohio, that his policies were saving jobs in the political battleground state after years of inaction to confront China's aggressive behavior in global markets.
""I go to my guys, 'What about doing a little movement on the dollar?'"" he said, but they countered that was not possible. ""'Sir, we can't do that. It has to float naturally.'"" 
The Republican president, who is seeking reelection to a second term in the Nov. 3 national poll, repeated his claim - which China denies - that Beijing deliberately changes the value of its currency to gain competitive advantage in global markets.
China's central bank has denied intervening to weaken the yuan and lower the cost of its exports to the United States. The yuan has firmed for eight weeks straight against a softening dollar.
Trump gave no details on his conversation about tweaking the dollar's value, and no comment was immediately available from the U.S. Treasury Department, which is expected to release its long-delayed semi-annual currency report in coming weeks.
The United States, like most global economies, allows the price of its currency to float, meaning it is set by the foreign exchange market based on supply and demand relative to other currencies.
Trump in May reversed course and backed a ""strong dollar"" after years of railing against the dollar's relative strength as a factor harming U.S. competitiveness.
The Treasury Department in January dropped its designation of China as a ""currency manipulator"", days before U.S. and Chinese officials signed the Phase 1 trade deal, saying Beijing had agreed to refrain from competitive devaluation.
Washington's unexpected decision in August 2019 to label China a ""currency manipulator"" came at the height of trade tensions between the world's two large economies, but was widely criticized as not based in fact.

Before that, Treasury had not labeled China a currency manipulator since 1994.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A resurgent dollar held on to overnight gains on Tuesday after virus fears and worries about U.S. stimulus drove a wave of selling in just about everything else.
The dollar rose 0.6% against the euro, 0.9% against the Aussie and even made gains against the safe-haven currencies of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. 
Against a basket of six major currencies (=USD) the greenback hit a six-week high and held just below that in early Asian trade at 93.547. Gold fell against the rising dollar.
""The equity selloff gathered quite dramatic momentum during the European day and the risk-averse characteristics of the U.S. dollar really came to the fore,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX Ray Attrill.
The heaviest selling was in financials, after a fresh dirty money scandal embarrassed global banks, but soon spread to other sectors and asset classes amid worries about possible new lockdowns as COVID-19 cases spread.
Investors are also fretting that the chances of more fiscal stimulus in the U.S. are ebbing as campaigning dominates the political landscape. [MKTS/GLOB]
""A lot now depends on whether or not what we've seen in the last 24 hours is sustained,"" said Attrill. ""There's good reason to think that we could be in for a multi week period where the dollar at least stops declining.""
Some of the dollar buying moderated as stocks rallied off session lows into the Wall Street close, but a clearer picture may have to wait until the London open, with another public holiday in Japan lightening volumes in Asia. 
The Australian dollar  last sat at $0.7230, just above a two-week low touched on Monday. The New Zealand dollar , which fell 1.3% in the rout, nursed losses at $0.6668.
The Norwegian krone , which was slammed 2% lower as oil prices also slid, sat near a two-month low hit overnight.
The euro (EUR=) held just above a six-week trough at $1.1766, while sterling  was fragile at $1.2818 amid talk of fresh restrictions in Britain as virus cases grow.
Britain will face an exponentially growing death rate within weeks unless urgent action is taken to halt the outbreak, the country's senior medics said on Monday.
The Telegraph newspaper reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson will encourage Britons on Tuesday to go back to working from home.
Perhaps the most confounding move overnight was the swift unwinding of gains in the yen made during Asian trade.
The Japanese currency has been among the best performing majors this month as jitters in stock markets have driven safe-haven demand. But it slipped from a six-month high of 104 per dollar to 104.68 as investors crowded into dollars .

Investing.com – The dollar rode a slump in the euro to a more than one-month high on Monday, and appeared to reclaim its safe-haven status amid jitters over global growth amid rising odds of Europe re-imposing lockdown measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.80% to 93.69, its highest since Aug. 13.
“Expect lots more restrictions over the days and weeks ahead, especially in Europe,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note Monday. ""The fact that the virus is already spreading quite rapidly is a big worry.""
European health ministers have raised the alarm bells on the impact of a second wave, with German Health Minister Jens Spahn reportedly warning Monday that Germany could see infection spikes following a spread in countries such as France, Austria, and the Netherlands.
In the UK, Patrick Vallance, Britain’s chief scientific adviser, said that there could be 50,000 new infections every day by mid-October if the virus continues at its current rate.
EUR/USD fell 0.66% to $1.1759 and GBP/USD fell 0.89% to $1.2801.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Monday in thin trading with Japan on holiday and with investors cautious ahead of a number of U.S. Federal Reserve speakers this week.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.862, the EUR/USD rose 0.2% at 1.1860, GBP/USD up 0.4% at 1.2961, while USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 104.34.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s stated policy of keeping interest rates at near zero levels for a prolonged period remains a drag on the dollar, but close attention will be paid to remarks from committee members this week for any more clues on the new approach to inflation.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to appear before Congressional committees later this week, while Fed committee members Lael Brainard, Charles Evans, Raphael Bostic, James Bullard, Mary Daly and John Williams (NYSE:WMB) also make public speeches.
“Inflation will be allowed to overshoot but we still don’t know by how much and for how long,” said Nordea’s Andreas Steno Larsen, in a research note. “We have interpreted it as a de facto 2.4% target as PCE prices have averaged around 1.6% over the past 5-10 years, but we are essentially still kept in the dark by the Fed.”
Aside from these Fed speakers, the U.S. data calendar is quite light this week, but August existing home sales could well be strong given record low mortgage rates. 
Also of interest this week will be whether FTSE Russell, a leading global provider of stock market indices, includes China in its World Government Bond Index on Thursday, a move that would likely trigger even more inflows into the country and support the yuan.
""The assets under management tracking this index is big … so we are seeing some pre-positioning taking place,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim, in a Reuters report.
""But it's not just the index, the bigger picture here is that the (Chinese) economy is doing well, there's an interest-rate differential that is supporting the currency and a Biden victory (at the U.S. election) might provide further relief.""
USD/CNY dropped 0.1% to 6.7583, hovering just above a 16-month low it hit last week. The yuan has gained more than 4% since the end of June.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira remained under pressure at 7.5723 to the dollar, close to the all-time low it hit last week.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar slipped and yen and yuan led Asia's currencies a little higher on Monday, as investors looked ahead to a slew of U.S. Federal Reserve speakers this week and to a decision on the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in a global index.
Moves were slight and volumes light due to a public holiday in Japan. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, dipped 0.2% to 92.779.
The yen and yuan rose about 0.3% each, with the yen  touching a seven-week peak of 104.27 per dollar and the yuan  hovering just below a 16-month high it hit last week. 
Foreigners' Chinese bond buying has helped put the yuan on a tear, lifting it nearly 6.5% in four months.
Investors are expecting FTSE Russell will include China in its World Government Bond Index <.SBWGU> on Thursday, likely triggering even more inflows and supporting the currency.
""The assets under management tracking this index is big...so we are seeing some pre-positioning taking place,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim.
""But it's not just the index, the bigger picture here is that the (Chinese) economy is doing well, there's an interest-rate differential that is supporting the currency and a Biden victory (at the U.S. election) might provide further relief.""
The yuan edged back toward last week's 16-month high in Asia, rising to 6.7570 in onshore trade  and pulling with it the Australian, Singapore, New Taiwan dollars as well as the Malaysian ringgit.
The Aussie  rose 0.4% to $0.7319, near the top end of its range of the last few weeks. The ringgit  hit a seven-month high of 4.1100 on the dollar and the Singapore dollar  made an eight-month peak of S$1.3543 per greenback.
The Taiwan dollar  jumped 0.7% to a seven-year high of 28.935 per dollar, a move analysts said might be due to a combination of equity inflows and authorities seeking to project calm amid heightened cross-straits tensions.
YEN STRENGTH
The euro and sterling crept toward the top of ranges they have occupied for a couple of weeks, with the euro (EUR=) last at $1.1867 and sterling  at $1.2958.
The yen looked to break new ground, extending a week of solid gains amid trepidation about the global economic outlook and perhaps a shift in the yen's drivers as central banks pin rates around the world at or below zero.
The yen is up nearly 2% in five consecutive weeks of gains.
""The yen is deeply undervalued on standard metrics, private sector portfolio outflows appear to have slowed, and the Bank of Japan seems to have little appetite for more deeply negative rates,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note.
""For these reasons we see downside risk to our 12-month dollar/yen target of 105.""
In the short term, analysts said the Fed's lower-for-longer commitment on rates would drag on the dollar, though close attention will be paid to remarks from committee members this week for any more clues on the new approach to inflation.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to appear before Congressional committees later this week while Fed committee members Lael Brainard, Charles Evans, Raphael Bostic, James Bullard, Mary Daly and John Williams (NYSE:WMB) also make public speeches.
""The dovish Fed will remain a background negative for the dollar,"" said Terence Wu, strategist at Singapore's OCBC Bank. 
""Powell's testimony (on Tuesday) will draw attention, but for now the Fed is likely done playing their cards.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with U.S. Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak later in the week and a decision due on the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in the FTSE Russell World Government Bond Index (RWGBI).
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.16% to 92.870 by 9:55 PM ET (2:55 AM GMT).
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.06% to 6.7633, with the yuan rising more than 1% in September thanks to foreigners buying Chinese bonds. The bonds’ entry into the RWGBI is expected to boost inflows and support the yuan.
FTSE Russell will announce its decision on Thursday, and “people are trying to get in ahead of that,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.
Ahead of the decision, the ICBC CSOP FTSE Chinese Government Bond Index ETF started trading on the Singapore Stock Exchange earlier in the day. Widely touted as the world's largest China government bond ETF, it has already raised up to $676 million in seed funding,
The USD/JPY pair edged down 0.15% to 104.40, with moves light due to a public holiday in Japan. Investors have turned to the safe-haven asset over recent uncertainty, such as November’s U.S. presidential elections and the ever-increasing number of global COVID-19 cases, with the yen not far from a seven-week high on Friday. Lower U.S. real yields also gave the yen a boost.
“The yen is an attractive currency, I see no reason to sell it,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters. He also noted that real yields in Japan are positive, which “makes the yen very attractive, especially against the pound and dollar, where real rates are not just negative but in the case of the Fed, they are actively seeking lower rates out.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak before Congressional committees later this week, while Fed committee members Charles Evans, Raphael Bostic, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Mary Daly and John Williams (NYSE:WMB) are also scheduled to deliver speeches later in the week.
Should they clarify on how the Fed will implement looser monetary policy settings in the wake of its relaxed approach to inflation, it could give the yen an even further boost.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.26% to 1.2949, although continued uncertainty over Brexit and a spike in COVID-19 cases in Europe capped gains.
The U.K. is contemplating implementing a new national lockdown, with other European countries such as Denmark and Greece announcing new restrictions during the previous week.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.18% to 0.7302, and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.15% to 0.6769. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is scheduled to meet on Wednesday.
Although the central bank is widely expected to make no policy changes, its hints at negative rates and adjustments to its large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) bond-buying program could see volatility in the New Zealand dollar.
“We don’t expect any change on policy, but the tone will be dovish and they may signal an intention to flex the pace of the LSAP more to help flatten the curve, which would take pressure off the NZD,” ANZ analysts said in a note."
248,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","DUBAI (Reuters) - The Iranian rial fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market on Sunday, a day after the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration declared all United Nations sanctions on Tehran had been restored. 
The dollar was offered for as much as 273,000 rials, up from 267,800 rials on Saturday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com, which tracks the unofficial market. 
Iran has dismissed the U.S. move as ""void and illegal"" and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council on Saturday he cannot take any action on the U.S. declaration because ""there would appear to be uncertainty"" on the issue.
The three European parties to the nuclear deal - France, Britain and Germany - said in a statement on Sunday that any decision or action taken to reimpose U.N. sanctions ""would be incapable of legal effect"" because Washington used a mechanism agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which the United States quit in 2018.
However, Trump plans to issue an executive order allowing him to impose U.S. sanctions on anyone violating sanctions against Iran. 
The Iranian foreign ministry described Washington's efforts as ""futile"", adding that ""the U.S. approach is a major threat to the international peace and security and an unprecedented threat to the U.N. and the Security Council"". 
“Iran emphasizes that if the U.S., directly or with the cooperation of a number of its allies, makes any move in line with these threats, it will face a serious reaction and should account for all its dangerous consequences,” the ministry said in a statement, without elaborating. 
Washington has unilaterally reimposed sanctions on Iran since 2018, which combined with a drop in oil prices have crippled the economy in Iran, which also has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the Middle East with 24,301 deaths. 

Iran's rial has lost about 49% of its value in 2020.

Investing.com - The dollar is set to snap a two-week losing streak, raising concerns about whether the greenback has really found its footing after five-straight months of declines, with lower for longer interest rates expected to persist.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was flat at 92.97.
The dollar's sluggish end to the week comes just days after the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged and tied monetary policy guidance to inflation rising above 2% for some time. But the decision was accompanied by projections that suggest rates hikes would remain on hold at least through 2023, and inflation unlikely to get above the 2% level by then.
""As long as market expectations of an economic rebound hold, we’d say negative real yields will keep the dollar bear trend intact and investors will use position adjustments (like today) to reset dollar short positions"" ING said in a note.
Adding to the dollar woes, the prospect of the economy receiving another shot of stimulus from congress appears murky, at best, even as economists warn that a lack of fiscal support could halt the current economic rebound.
EUR/USD traded flat $1.1850, while GBP/USD fell 0.37% to $1.2924, with the latter shrugging off better-than-expected retail sales data amid ongoing fears that the odds of a no-deal Brexit are rising.
USD/JPY traded fell 0.13% to 104.59 while USD/CAD added 0.27% to $1.3199."
251,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is emerging as an early favorite in the all-out showdown to rekindle inflation in the world’s major economies.
With the Federal Reserve planning to hold interest rates near zero until at least 2023 and Congress working on another fiscal boost, a pocket of the debt market is starting to see consumer prices modestly over 2% in years to come. That’s in stark contrast to Europe where deflation fears have reawakened, and Japan, which has battled moribund price pressures for decades to no avail.
It’s early days, of course, and investors are still quibbling over whether the Fed will succeed in spurring price gains. But they’re ramping up bets that its new inflation policy, aggressive bond buying and its slate of liquidity programs will help the U.S. reflate its economy more convincingly than in other developed nations. With many central banks backed into a corner with ultra-loose monetary policy even before the crisis, the U.S. has quickly out-eased its peers, squelching criticism -- from the president, among others -- of earlier rate hikes and widening the gap between price expectations in the U.S. and euro area to a decade high.
“The U.S. is reflating, but Europe and Japan are struggling,” said Robin Brooks, chief economist of the Institute of International Finance. It’s “unambiguously” a big deal that the Fed has shifted policy, and “that creates headaches for the ECB and the Bank of Japan, who are both facing a challenging inflation picture,” he said, during a Bloomberg TOPLive blog.
Moderate price gains are generally seen as a positive for an economy as they encourage consumers to spend now, rather than save for another day.
The Fed has made reviving inflation a cornerstone of its recovery playbook, announcing a new framework last month that would allow prices to exceed its 2% target to offset periods of depressed gains. That policy gained sharper teeth this week when the Fed said it would look to see this level of inflation -- as well as full employment -- before hiking rates.
Inflation won’t return overnight. A Fed survey of economists shows most see limited price pressures as far out as a decade. And even the central bank itself sees inflation only hitting 2% in 2023, according to its median projection -- although at least one committee member thinks it could be as soon as next year.
Investors are clamoring for more detail on how the Fed will encourage inflation, but they’ve already paid attention to the change in tone.
While U.S. breakevens -- the difference between nominal rates and those on inflation-linked bonds -- remain subdued, a swaps-market measure of five-year price expectations in five years time has climbed above 2% since the Fed’s policy adjustment. The gauge, which references the consumer-price index rather than the Fed’s preferred PCE price index -- is still a long way from the highs it reached after the 2008 financial crisis. But last month it booked its biggest gain since November 2016.
By contrast, headline inflation in the euro area is negative for the first time since 2016. And ECB President Christine Lagarde warned last week that the situation may get worse in the near term, despite the central bank moderately raising its forecast for price gains in 2021. The gap between similar inflation swaps in the U.S. and euro-area hit a decade high in the past week, excluding a brief March spike amid abnormal market conditions.
The Bank of Japan is in a similarly tight spot. The differential between 10-year U.S. breakevens and Japanese equivalents is near the widest in over a year.
“We remain relatively skeptical of European inflation,” said Thomas Walker, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, who has an overweight position in inflation-linked U.S. Treasuries. “There are a multitude of factors at play here, but Europe has been struggling to generate inflation for quite some time now. Even before Covid-19, the ECB has struggled to generate inflation.”
It’s a long-standing dilemma for the euro-area’s policy makers, as well as investors. The ECB is reviewing its inflation target, but flagging price pressures could potentially stymie consumer spending, worsening the economic shock from the coronavirus and cementing fears of Europe’s “Japanification” -- a state of near-permanently low inflation and reliance on institutional support.
In the worst case, price declines can become entrenched and spur a slump in wages, in a downward spiral of deflation that has historically wrecked economies.
While some of the reasons for Europe’s troubles are structural -- an aging population, for example -- others are far more recent, such as the euro’s more than 10% appreciation since a low in March. The currency’s strength is a double-edged sword; on the one hand, it reflects trader optimism in the region’s economic recovery, as well as fading fears of an EU breakup, but it also makes achieving the central bank’s 2% inflation goal a tall order.
When the euro broke above $1.20 this month for the first time since 2018, the central bank’s Chief Economist Philip Lane was quick to talk it down, and Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Huw Worthington and Bhumika Gupta say euro strength raises the threat that prices in the euro area will fall.
“A strong euro can stoke deflationary pressures in the EU,” they wrote in a note. “The currency is working against Lagarde’s inflation target, but options are limited, with QE having little impact on the exchange rate and rate cuts becoming toothless.”
Still, a reduction of 10 basis points or more in the ECB’s deposit rate -- already at a record low of minus 0.5% -- may prevent euro appreciation fueling deflation fears, they added.
Christoph Rieger, a strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), sees investor bets on a further ECB rate cut persisting. Traders in money markets currently expect such a move in the second half of next year.
“Unless inflation starts to rise or the euro starts to tumble on its own, this should keep rate-cut speculation alive,” Rieger wrote in a note to clients. “The genie is out of the bottle.”

252,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s central bank paused its monetary easing cycle after a surprise inflation uptick, but said that a rate cut was possible at one of its next meetings.
The benchmark interest rate remains at 4.25%, the central bank said in a statement on Friday, in line with expectations. Only four out of 42 analysts forecast a rate reduction, the rest saw no change, according to a Bloomberg survey. Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a news conference at 3 p.m. Moscow time.
While a weak ruble and increased demand have lifted the pace of price growth, the central bank said it sees the potential for economic recovery slowing with time. “If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings,” the regulator said in its statement.
The Bank of Russia joined other emerging economies in slowing down its monetary easing, as peers such as Brazil and South Africa kept rates unchanged this week. Russia’s economy is recovering faster than initially expected from the impact of measures to combat the coronavirus epidemic, and inflation continues to accelerate.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, weighed down by disappointing employment and housing data and with the tech sector continuing to suffer strong selling in the equity markets.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.823, the EUR/USD rose 0.2% to trade at 1.1865, while USD/JPY was largely flat at 104.70, but still on course for a gain of 1.5% over the week.
Employment data, released on Thursday, showed that initial jobless claims fell by less than expected. At the same time, data from the housing market showed that part of the economy cooling off after three months of an extremely strong rebound.
So while the U.S. economy is recovering, the rebound seems to be slowing. This prompted the Federal Reserve to pledge to keep rates near zero until at least the end of 2023, but the central bank also called for more fiscal help from Congress, which still looks unlikely.
“As long as market expectations of an economic rebound hold (second wave lockdowns and the fiscal response will have a say here), we’d say that negative real yields will keep the dollar bear trend intact and investors will use position adjustments to reset dollar short positions,” wrote ING’s Chris Turner, in a note.
Additionally, U.S. tech stocks suffered another rout Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index falling 1.3%, which contributed to a weak dollar. 
“For the dollar to regain its upward trend, it’s necessary for the market to make sure that the U.S. stocks take a pause from a correction in stock prices,” said Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto, in a Reuters report.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2964, despite retail sales rising by 0.8% in August, slightly above the 0.7% forecast, as parts of the sector enjoyed a much faster rebound than most of the economy.
However, the focus of sterling traders is elsewhere as policymakers in the Bank of England indicated Thursday that they’re considering using negative interest rates as the central bank prepares for the possibility the U.K. government fails to reach a trade deal with the European Union by the end of this year.

255,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England’s preparations for the aftermath of a potentially messy Brexit could include a new weapon by the end of the year.
Policy makers have given the strongest signal yet that they’re considering using negative interest rates, saying they’ll work with bank regulators on how they might implement such a policy for the first time in the central bank’s history. A failure by the U.K. government to reach a trade deal with the European Union by the end of this year could tip them over the edge.
They’re saying “you’ve got to get your ducks in a row because we may be forced to use it,” said Cathal Kennedy, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada. “They’ve come an awfully long way in a short space of time.”
Stepping up work -- just over a month since Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized that there were no plans to follow most of Europe and Japan with negative rates -- comes amid an increased likelihood of a chaotic end to the post-Brexit transition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s move to renege on the withdrawal agreement with the EU threatens to scupper talks on a new trade accord with the bloc.
Such an outcome would add a new dimension of pain to the economy through customs checks, tariffs and higher costs for businesses.
The U.K. is already grappling with a resurgence in coronavirus infections, fresh social restrictions to counter them, and fears that unemployment could spike when government support for wages is withdrawn next month. All that would be compounded by a disruptive Brexit, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Bond purchases will likely remain the BOE’s main immediate policy tool, with economists forecasting an expansion later this year. But the chance of negative rates in 2021 is rising. U.K two-year bond yields, those most sensitive to rate-cut speculation, declined Thursday for the first time in four days.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“It’s becoming increasingly likely that if the economy is blown off course next year, the central bank could employ sub-zero rates.”
-Dan Hanson. Read his BOE REACT
The prospect has put British banks on alert. A foray below zero would further drag down net interest margins and squeeze the supply of the riskiest mortgages, denting house prices and consumer confidence, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jonathan Tyce.
The pain that negative rates cause to finance-sector balance sheets is one reason why the BOE resisted considering them until recently. The tool has had mixed success elsewhere, and Sweden opted to end its own experiment with the policy last year.
BOE officials highlighted sub-zero borrowing costs even though the economy hasn’t been as weak as anticipated. But the risk that the recovery could be undone means they’ve had to start looking hard at a previously unthinkable measure.
Thomas Costerg, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva, says a messy Brexit is the only thing that would make the BOE likely to pull the trigger on negative rates. For  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), it’s the difference between no easing at all and a stimulus package of cutting rates to zero and an additional 100 billion pounds ($130 billion) in bond purchases.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). economists see a rate cut to zero in February, but a collapse of EU trade talks could prompt the U.K. central bank to go even further.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was steady in early Asia trading on Friday after falling overnight as downbeat U.S. data cast a shadow over the economic outlook, while the Japanese yen stabilised after rising against the greenback and the euro the previous day.
The dollar (=USD) gave up gains made after the Federal Reserve upgraded its 2020 GDP forecast this week to trade in negative territory on Thursday. It was last quoted at 92.866 against a basket of major currencies, and was on track for a 0.3% weekly loss. 
A stream of U.S. data showed jobless claims remained elevated at 860,000, while both housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed business index fell. The Fed this week said it expected the U.S. economy to shrink by far less than previously forecast in 2020 and promised to keep rates ultra-low for a prolonged period.
The safe-haven yen last traded at 104.76 per dollar , after hitting a seven-week high at 104.52 on Thursday. Against the euro, the yen hovered near the 1-1/2 month high of 123.29 touched overnight, changing hands at 124.14 (EURJPY=).
""The dollar/yen dropped overnight almost too much, although it's been falling since Monday,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
He said losses in U.S. stock futures (NQc1)  were also contributing to a weaker dollar. U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as technology-related shares slid for a second day and as the downbeat economic data weighed on the wider market.
""For the dollar to regain its upward trend, it’s necessary for the market to make sure that the U.S. stocks take a pause from a correction in stock prices,"" he said.
Sterling bought $1.2986 , having lost around one cent on Thursday after the Bank of England said it was looking more closely at how it might implement negative interest rates amid rising coronavirus infection cases, higher unemployment and a possible new Brexit shock.
But the cable later erased losses after the Financial Times reported that European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was convinced a trade deal with Britain was still possible.
The euro, meanwhile, was little changed at 1.1853 per dollar on Friday (EUR=). The euro zone PMI data next week will be a key focus, with some analysts saying a strong PMI could take the common currency back to the 1.19 level versus the dollar.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were marginally stronger in Asian trade, with the Aussie 0.15% higher at $0.7323  and the kiwi trading up 0.34% at $0.6778 .
The offshore yuan  was trading at 6.7524 per dollar after hitting a high of 6.7332. The yuan has risen more than 6% from lows against the dollar in late May as China's economy has recovered from the fallout of the coronavirus crisis, although its rapid rise has raised some concerns.

The Bank of England kept rates at 0.1% and the asset purchase target at £745bn and hinted that reiterated that it stands ready to ""adjust"" monetary policy to meet to support the recovery.
The central bank pointed to U.K. economic data as justification that its policies were supporting the recovery and acknowledged that GDP and inflation had recently been running above the estimates given in the August monetary policy report.
“Recent domestic economic data have been a little stronger than the Committee expected at the time of the August Report, although, given the risks, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out,” The Bank of England said in its monetary policy statement.
Despite the faster pace of economic recovery, the bank left the door open for negative interest rates as additional policy measures to keep the economy on track should a second wave of coronavirus or a wobble in the labor market trigger a slowdown.
Still, the overarching narrative from the Bank of England was less dovish than some had hoped, cooling expectations that easing in November is a forgone conclusion.
“There was little in this assessment to validate near-term expectations of more easing at the November meeting,” ING said in a note. The central bank's main scenario is premised on the UK signing a comprehensive trade deal with the EU before 2021. In light of recent developments, this assumption is likely to be challenged by investors, thus resulting in more dovish pricing than today's MPC might imply."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen rose to a seven-week high against the dollar and a 1-1/2-month peak versus the euro, amid another batch of generally weak U.S. data and overall uncertainty about the economic outlook, backing the Federal Reserve's concern on Wednesday about the pace of recovery.
The dollar index rose to a one-week high, but was last little changed on the day, as risk appetite diminished. Shares on Wall Street were lower and U.S. Treasuries were fairly well-supported.
At Wednesday's policy meeting, the Fed pledged to keep rates near zero until the labor market reaches ""maximum employment"" and inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the 2% target, with most policymakers seeing rates on hold through at least 2023. 
""What we've seen in the aftermath of the Fed meeting is a bit of a risk-off tone and one of the things that's come back into play since early September is a realignment of FX and equity correlations so the consolidation of the dollar remains intact and there's some negative bias in the risk space,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities. ""It's helping to put a little more downside pressure on some of the majors.""
Wednesday's set of U.S. data also added to the gloom in risk sentiment.
U.S. jobless claims remained elevated at 860,000, while both housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed business index fell.
""Taken together, this morning's data releases suggest that – despite positive momentum – there is a long way to go until pre-pandemic levels of activity are achieved,"" said Matthew Eidinger, market strategist, at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN). 
He added that against a soft economic backdrop, the Fed's commitment to hold rates near zero for some time appears well-justified.
""It is clear that the economy needs all the help it can get, from monetary and fiscal policymakers alike,"" Eidinger said.
In late morning trading, the dollar fell 0.3% against the yen to 104.62 yen , after sliding to a seven-week low of 104.52.
The euro dropped 0.3% to 123.60 yen (EURJPY=EBS). Earlier it touched a low of 123.33 yen, its weakest level since late July.
The dollar index, a measure of its value against six major rivals, was last little changed at 93.12 (=USD), but hit a one-week high earlier in the session. 
The euro (EUR=EBS) briefly hit a one-month low earlier at $1.1737 before trimming some losses to stand 0.1% lower on the day at $1.1809. 
The Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars   , tied to commodity prices as well as the ebbs and flows of risk appetite were all weaker on the day.
That said, with the new guidance from the Fed focused on keeping U.S. interest rates at current record lows until employment and inflation reach its targets, some strategists argue any dollar strength is likely to be temporary.

The pound fell 0.4% to $1.2916  after the Bank of England said it had been briefed on how a negative interest rate could be implemented effectively, should it be needed..

 
"
259,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England will step up talks on negative interest rates as the economy enters a period of unusual uncertainty.
Policy makers, led by Governor Andrew Bailey voted unanimously to maintain their key interest rate at 0.1% and asset purchase target unchanged at 745 billion pounds ($966 billion) on Thursday. But they also said they’ll hold “structured engagement” with the Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority later this year on how subzero rates could be implemented.
The pound slid to an intraday low, trading down 0.6% at $1.2892 at 12:12 p.m. in London.
Officials said that while recent data has been a little stronger than expected, they still think there is “a risk of a more persistent period of elevated unemployment than in the central projection.”
“The Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit,” the BOE said.
The U.K. is facing a resurgence in virus infections and restrictions, as well as fears unemployment could spike when government aid programs are withdrawn next month. At the same time, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s threats to redraw his Brexit deal with the European Union could scupper any chance of a trade accord before the Dec. 31 deadline, further boosting economic turmoil.
Economists predict the bond-buying program will be boosted by 50 billion pounds in November, and investors have been betting on rate cuts next year.
Hours before the decision, the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan both kept rates unchanged, with the Fed signaling U.S. rates will stay near zero for at least three years. The BOE repeated its pledge not to tighten until U.K. inflation, currently at 0.2%, is sustainably moving to its 2% target.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are betting that a bout of election-induced volatility may be just the thing to give the battered dollar a reprieve from its months-long decline. 
The dollar stands near its lowest level in 16 months after falling more than 9% from its March peak on lower U.S. yields and expectations of comparatively slower U.S. growth. Net futures bets on a lower dollar totaled $32.67 billion, close to their highest point in a decade, the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.
But the buck tends to rally around U.S. presidential elections, with the dollar index up seven out of 10 times between early September and early December for an average gain of 2.5% since 1980, said Ben Randol, G10 FX and rates strategist at BofA Global Research. 
Such a move could be even more dynamic this year, as investors brace for the Nov. 3 election in which results may be uncertain or contested, potentially pushing market participants to sell their riskier investments and head for havens such as the dollar.
""A very tight election and contested result will probably be the spark to get people nervous,"" said Amo Sahota, executive director at currency advisory firm Klarity FX in San Francisco. ""That's positive for the dollar.""
The heap of bets on a lower dollar could potentially exacerbate an upside move if a sharp rally forces bearish investors to unwind their trades and buy back the U.S. currency in a phenomenon known as a short squeeze.
""A narrowing race and historical seasonal trends
invite more uncertainty and potential drawdowns in crowded trades. Yet that's a squeeze, not a reversal,"" analysts at TD Securities said in a recent note.
John Floyd, head of macro strategies at Record Currency Management in New York, is betting that the U.S. dollar will rise against its Canadian counterpart, due in part to election-related volatility spurring investors into haven assets. 
Randol, of BoFA Global Research, said the dollar is around 4% undervalued according to the bank's model, which calculates valuation based on interest rate differentials and terms of trade. The bank recently recommended buying the dollar against the Swedish krona and Canadian dollar.
Longer term, the dollar has fewer fans. Expectations that U.S. rates will stay near record lows have dimmed the dollar's attractiveness https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-markets-dollar-analysis/u-s-dollars-woes-are-only-beginning-some-bears-say-idUSKBN25S3KN to income-seeking investors. Others believe that perceptions of a more coherent response to the coronavirus crisis in Europe and Asia will keep investors away from dollar-denominated assets. 
Analysts at Oxford Economics, for example, said any volatility-driven upside in the greenback would likely be temporary, predicting a multi-year decline for the dollar.
Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments Ltd, is short the dollar against the euro and is betting the currency will continue to depreciate in coming months. 
That move, however, could be interrupted if it appears that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is giving up his lead in the polls against President Donald Trump, he said. The president is less apt to deliver fiscal expansion and more likely to roil markets with a hard line toward China, making a Trump victory a more bullish outcome for the dollar, Benson said. 

""If Biden screws up at a debate or if we get some catastrophic Biden moment, that will cause a short-term knee-jerk appreciation in the dollar, and we're going to have market volatility,"" he said.

261,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s decision to change its inflation goal will have consequences for the European Central Bank, Governing Council member Olli Rehn said.
The Finnish central banker said his interpretation of the Fed’s new approach, unveiled by Chairman Jerome Powell at the end of August, is that it will respond more emphatically to inflation rates that are below target, while being more tolerant to risks signaling a rise in price pressures.
“The Fed’s new strategy will inevitably also have an impact on the operating environment of the ECB’s monetary policy -- we are not operating in a vacuum,” Rehn wrote in a Bank of Finland bulletin on Thursday. “The ECB’s strategy review is thus even more necessary than before.”
The Frankfurt-based central bank’s first comprehensive review in almost two decades was started by President Christine Lagarde before being delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. It covers a wide range of topics including the inflation goal -- currently “below, but close to, 2%” -- with the first results expect around the middle of next year.
Rehn’s comments come after the ECB’s former chief economist, Peter Praet, last week urged the institution to accelerate the review in the wake of the Fed’s decision, which he said has contributed to the euro’s recent rally to the strongest level in more than two years.
Lagarde said last week her institution is restarting the strategic overhaul after the initial delay. Price stability will be the key focus, which she called “a cornerstone of any strategy of any central bank around the world.”"
262,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s central bank kept borrowing costs unchanged, reflecting confidence in an economy where the stock market is near a record high, exports are booming and the Covid-19 pandemic is being held at bay.
Policy makers kept the benchmark interest rate at 1.125%, as predicted by all of the 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 1.6% from the 1.5% it forecast in June.
It was the second quarter of holding the rate steady since cutting it in March, when Taiwan’s exports began falling and the stock market dropped due to the pandemic’s impact on the global economy. Since then, exports have jumped to a record-high $31.2 billion in August, while the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s main index has rebounded to reach a record high Wednesday.
The central bank is unlikely to change rates through the end of 2022, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists conducted over the past week.
The central bank’s focus is likely to be on the currency, which appreciated sharply against the dollar in the first half of the year, impacting both exporters as well as Taiwan’s massive life insurance sector, which manages $1 trillion in assets. The central bank has been stepping in during trading to “smooth” gains made by the local dollar against the greenback, although it denies this is intervention.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Thursday, after the Federal Reserve failed to deliver any suggestion of more monetary stimulus in the near term. However, further currency weakness looks likely further ahead.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.4% at 93.450, while the EUR/USD dropped 0.4% at 1.1768, hitting a one-month low.
At its first policy meeting since introducing a more tolerant stance on inflation, the Fed pledged to keep rates near zero until at least the end of 2023. This was widely expected, but the central bank also lifted its growth forecast for 2020 to show a contraction of 3.7%, compared with an estimate for a 6.5% decline previously. 
While growth expectations in 2021 and 2022 were revised lower to 4% and 3% from 5% and 3.5% respectively, this all still represents an upbeat assessment of the economic recovery. Particularly as the Fed also lifted its expectations for both employment and inflation.
That said, “there was nothing really in the FOMC statement or the projections to un-nerve the conviction view that reflationary Fed policy is a dollar negative,” wrote analysts at ING, in a research note.
“Key components to this summer’s dollar decline have been the sense of recovery (today’s Fed upgrades to 2020 GDP and employment forecasts help here) and ultra-low rates (unchanged policy Fed policy through 2023 also help) resulting in real yields deep in negative territory,” ING added.
Analysts at Nordea also argued that any boost to the dollar from this latest Fed statement will be a short-term phenomenon. 
“A (much) weaker USD will be a focal point in the Fed’s fight for higher inflation. Not so much due to the directly imported inflationary impulse, but much more due to the easier financial conditions that follow,” wrote Nordea’s Andreas Steno Larsen, in a research note. 
“If the Fed wants to be seen as credible in its fight for inflation, the USD simply needs to weaken from here.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2943, but still well above this week’s lows after Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to cut off a rebellion in his own party, giving parliament a say over the use of post-Brexit powers.
Focus is now on the Bank of England’s policy-setting meeting, due to conclude later Thursday. Market expectations are for no change, but the vote split and minutes of the meeting will be carefully studied for insight into the bank’s intentions going forward given the economic challenges the U.K. faces.
USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 104.99 after the Bank of Japan kept its key interest rate at -0.1% and left its asset purchases unchanged, as widely expected.
The bank did upgrade its economic assessment for the first time since the virus hit, saying the economy has started to pick up with activity resuming gradually.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, with investor sentiment boosted in the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.45% to 93.543 by 12:24 AM ET (5:24 AM GMT).
“With regard to interest rates, we now indicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current zero to 0.25% target range for the federal funds rates until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, with the continuous tolerance for higher inflation pushing bond yields higher.
The greenback saw losses in the wake of the Fed’s comments and disappointing U.S. retail sales data, but slowly reversed after the Fed predicted economic growth to improve on the COVID-19 influenced drop in June's projections.
“The dollar shifted a little, but the market overall did not show a huge reaction,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) senior strategist Shinichiro Kadota told Reuters.
Powell will testify before the U.S. House of Representatives' Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on September 23, where he will expound on the Fed’s response to COVID-19.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 105.07. The Bank of Japan will keep its monetary policy steady as it handed down its decision earlier in the day, as well as upgrading its economic outlook slightly and putting paid to further stimulus measures to combat COVID-19.
Investors will be watching to see how the central bank will work with newly elected Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who is widely expected to continue predecessor Shinzo Abe’s Abenomics policy.
The AUD/USDpair was down 0.54% to 0.7266, with Australian jobs data released earlier in the day showing a better-than-expected 111,000 surge year-on-year in August, but also a drop in the jobless rate to 6.8% from July’s 7.5%. Across the Tasman Sea, the NZD/USD pair fell 0.64% to 0.6688. New Zealand reported a record slump in the second quarter earlier in the day, with gross domestic product falling 12.2% quarter-on-quarter and 12.4% year-on-year respectively.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.36% to 6.7775.
The GBP/USD pair fell 0.37% to 1.2918. Brexit tensions continue to be a focus for the pound, with the Tories striking a deal on Wednesday, avoiding a revolt within Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s party and giving Parliament a say over how to use post-Brexit powers.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision later in the day and is widely expected to introduce further stimulus measures into the COVID-19-hit economy."
265,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan left its aggressive monetary stimulus untouched while upgrading its view of the pandemic-hit economy the day after Yoshihide Suga took over as prime minister pledging to continue his predecessor’s stance on monetary and fiscal policy.
The BOJ kept its key interest rate at -0.1% and left its asset purchases unchanged, according to a statement from the bank Thursday. The result was expected by 95% of 44 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Suga, who was elected Wednesday for Japan’s top job, has indicated he sees no need for any immediate changes in BOJ policies that have helped keep financial markets stable and get credit to companies amid Covid-19. The bank upgraded its economic assessment for the first time since the virus hit to reflect a bottoming in Japan’s slump.
The BOJ revised its assessment of conditions, saying the economy has started to pick up with activity resuming gradually. The bank said overseas economies were improving from a state of significant depression and this had helped turn production at home and exports toward a pickup.
Still, with the pandemic continuing to impact countries worldwide, the pace of improvement in Japan’s economy was likely to be only moderate, the bank said.
“The BOJ has played its role in fighting the pandemic,” Tokai Tokyo Securities strategist Kazuhiko Sano said before the decision. “Suga is coming in pledging continuity so there won’t be much impact on monetary policy.”
Analysts see gross domestic product rebounding an annualized 15.1% this quarter, a big jump, but not enough to make up for the record contraction in the three months through June.
The Tough Job Facing Japan’s Next Prime Minister in Five Charts
The BOJ decision comes just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled its latest policy guidance, committing to inflation that averages 2% over time and forecasting near-zero rates to continue through 2023.
The yen was trading at 105.06 against the dollar, little changed from before the decision.
While the Fed and European Central Bank look likely to adopt new easing measures within the year, the BOJ will hold off unless gaps between the policies causes the yen to gain sharply, according to economist Kentaro Koyama at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB).
“The BOJ has already crafted its policy on the assumption of long-term low inflation and has minimal room for further easing action,” Koyama wrote in a report.
Markets have been reassured by Suga’s pledge to continue the policies of his old boss Shinzo Abe and 95% of economists say the new prime minister won’t pressure the BOJ to make any changes.
Still, Suga’s vocal campaign against the high cost of mobile phone service for consumers suggests he may place less importance on the BOJ’s 2% inflation target than Abe did. Data due Friday is expected to show the consumer price index dropping back into negative territory.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a press conference at 3:30 p.m. in Tokyo. Investors will watch for any subtle shift in his tone now that Abe, who hand-picked him to be governor, has stepped down.
Kuroda is likely to emphasize a desire to keep coordinating policy with the government under Suga’s leadership. Japan has the heaviest public debt load among developed nations, so Suga needs interest rates to stay low.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“The BOJ is hardly off the hook. It has put its 2% inflation target aside for now but hasn’t given up on reaching it eventually. The trouble is, inflation is headed the wrong way.”

The central bank, led by its President Roberto Campos Neto, kept the Selic rate at 2% on Wednesday, as expected by all 36 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The monetary authority had cut 450 basis points from borrowing costs over the past nine meetings.
The decision came hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero and signaled it would hold them there through at least 2023.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.17% to 93.24.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and tied its policy guidance to inflation rising above 2% for some time.
""(I)t will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time,"" the Fed said.
Policymakers backed rates to remain unchanged through 2023, according to the Fed’s summary of economic projections.
""The dot plot shows only 3 of the 17 policymakers with a dot above the 0-25 bps target range by the end of 2023, and taking their guidance and inflation forecasts together, it suggests that the more likely time for liftoff is at least 2024,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

A sustained break below it could see the rand targeting the 50% retracement at 15.43, followed by the 61.8% level at 14.50.
The rand is the best-performing emerging-market currency this month after Mexico’s peso and Brazil’s real, buoyed by the highest real yields among developing nations and speculation that the South African Reserve Bank’s record policy-easing cycle may be coming to an end.

269,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Yoshihide Suga announced Japan’s new cabinet Wednesday, hours after being formally elected prime minister by parliament. Like the one it replaces, the cabinet is dominated by Liberal Democratic Party stalwarts.
More than half of the new cabinet ministers are older than 60, only two are women and no one from the private sector made the cut. Suga takes over from his former boss, Shinzo Abe, who served a record term of almost eight consecutive years as premier, before stepping down due to poor health.
Here are some takeaways on the new lineup:
1. ‘Abenomics’ Stays
Long-serving Finance Minister Taro Aso stays in his role, indicating that Suga will stick to his pledge of maintaining and pressing forward with Abe’s ultra-easy monetary policy and flexible fiscal stance, known as “Abenomics.” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the economy minister who has overseen the country’s response to the coronavirus, also retains his post, as does Trade Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama.
2. ‘Womenomics’ Stalls
The number of women remains at two from the old cabinet, or about 10% of total posts. That falls short of Abe’s “womenomics” goal of having them represent 30% of leadership positions by this year, not to mention his promise to help women “shine.” Suga made little mention of policies to reduce one of the biggest gender wage gaps in the developed world during his party leadership campaign. The LDP has struggled to recruit and promote women, and only about 7% of its lower house members are female. The median age of cabinet members is about 61, with three members in their 70s, including Suga himself.
3. Bureaucrats Beware
Suga, the author of a book on how to control Japan’s bureaucracy, has repeatedly said he wants to break down barriers between the ministries and agencies. He appointed the outspoken Taro Kono as administrative reform minister, putting one of the LDP’s heavy hitters in a role to effect change. As defense minister, Kono this year canceled the deployment of a missile defense shield on cost concerns, a move that proved popular with the public. Suga has picked Takuya Hirai, known for his IT expertise, to head a drive to digitize the government.
4. Farming Out Foreign Policy
In contrast with Abe, who visited some 80 countries as premier, Suga has scant experience with diplomacy. After almost eight years of leader-to-leader foreign relations, more responsibility may now fall on the shoulders of Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. His resume includes negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and more recently the Japan-U.K. trade agreement.
5. Taiwan Connection
Suga picked Abe’s younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, to be defense minister. The appointment could irritate China, since Kishi is known for his close ties to Taiwan, which Beijing sees as part of its territory. Kishi most recently visited Taipei in August as part of a lawmaker group that met President Tsai Ing-Wen during a trip to mourn her late predecessor, Lee Teng-Hui.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Japanese yen inched higher on Wednesday as traders bet an ultra-accommodative U.S. Federal Reserve would weigh on the U.S. dollar, while the Chinese yuan extended gains one day after data pointed to better prospects for the world's No. 2 economy.
The Fed is due to make its first policy statement since adopting a more tolerant approach to inflation later on Wednesday.
Traders bought yen on the belief the U.S. central bank may promise further stimulus, which would likely weaken the U.S. dollar and push Treasury yields lower. The Fed is not expected to move on rates but adjustments to bond purchases are possible.
The yen  touched a two-week high of 105.25 per dollar, but investors reduced dollar shorts, or bets that the dollar would fall, after months of weakness in the greenback.
Against other majors, the dollar drifted lower or held steady -- last trading 0.1% softer against a basket of currencies (=USD) and a tad weaker on the Aussie and kiwi.
""Dollar/yen is one of the more attractive ways to play for a dovish Fed,"" said Westpac currency analyst Sean Callow, adding that the yen was particularly sensitive to the U.S. bond market given Japanese investors are large buyers of U.S. debt.
""You can brace yourself for some choppy price action around the announcement, but when the dust settles you would think that we'll be seeing a Fed that's leaning towards looser policy to match what they've already announced,"" Callow said.
Through the Asia session, the yen rose 0.2%. The Australian dollar  rose by the same margin to $0.7317 and the New Zealand dollar  edged higher to $0.6727.
The euro (EUR=) was steady at $1.1847 and sterling  crept higher to $1.2914 on hopes that a British plan to break its Brexit treaty will not come to fruition.
The Fed decision is due at 1800 GMT followed by a news conference from chairman Jerome Powell half an hour later.
Besides immediate policy, a major focus will be on the Fed's economic projections, especially if it spells out where it sees inflation headed and what exactly that means for rates under its new regime.
Paucity of detail could lift the dollar a little, though analysts felt that would probably be short-lived.
""The market overall knows that the Fed wants to be dovish. It's just that the timing may not match what the market wants in terms of giving details in this meeting,"" said Bank of Singapore FX analyst Moh Siong Sim.

The strongest fixing of the yuan's onshore midpoint  since May 2019 was also seen as signal that policymakers don't mind a strong currency amid a broader policy shift towards growing China's domestic economy. 
The yuan has risen more than 5% over the past four months.
""The Chinese currency is, for me, the surprise of the year since May,"" said Davis Hall, head of capital markets in Asia at Indosuez Wealth Management.
""People are starting to embrace a new theme, which is that China is managing much, much better than anyone else,"" he said.

""China, effectively, while they move their business model towards an internal demand story, wants to have a stronger currency to reduce their commodity import bill,"" he said. ""They can live now, with a stronger currency, with much less need to devalue.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, but trading ranges are tight as traders fine-tune their positions ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.067, with EUR/USD up 0.1% at 1.1852.
This Fed meeting is the main event in town, being the central bank’s first get together since Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced a more relaxed approach to inflation at the Jackson Hole symposium in late August.
“The Fed’s latest policy shift has fueled expectations that rates will stay lower for longer, and is therefore offering – and will likely continue to offer in the foreseeable future – a reason to stick to USD shorts and hold a sell-the-rally approach on any USD signs of reprise,” wrote ING’s Francesco Pesole, in a research note.
The dollar rebound in September has done little to change CFTC positioning data, Pesole said, as dollar positioning against G7 currencies “has stayed on a steadily downward-sloping trend, with no evidence of speculative investors cutting their short positions on the greenback.”
With this in mind, USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 105.37, not far off its two-week low of 105.25 reached earlier Wednesday, with yen buying reflecting a belief that the Fed may weaken the dollar with further stimulus.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2894, helped by inflation falling by less than expected in August, as well as signs of potential compromise over the bill proposing to break the U.K.’s Brexit treaty with the European Union.
U.K. consumer prices rose by 0.2% in August, the lowest since 2015, helped by the government's subsidies for people eating out last month.
The Bank of England holds a policy-setting meeting on Thursday. While most economists don’t see any action then, they widely predict the BOE’s bond-buying program will be expanded again before the end of the year. 
Additionally, USD/CNY traded 0.2% lower at 6.7694, heading towards its largest quarterly rally on record as recent strong Chinese economic data points to a recovery in the second largest economy in the world. 
The yuan has strengthened 4.2% since the end of June to 6.772 per dollar, set for the biggest ever quarterly gain in Bloomberg data going back to 1981.

272,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s policy makers are in no rush to rein in a rapid advance in the yuan, as traders push the currency toward its largest quarterly rally on record.
The yuan has strengthened 4.2% since the end of June to 6.772 per dollar, set for the biggest ever quarterly gain in Bloomberg data going back to 1981. The currency is the best performer in Asia in the third quarter, with the buying momentum being close to the strongest since January.
The yuan is being supported by a slump in the dollar, while Chinese media has been attributing the gains to the nation’s economic recovery.
The central bank has also helped by not standing in its way, which for some in the market is an incentive for the currency to push higher. Beijing’s daily fixings have tracked the spot rate, and officials have not expressed any concern over the currency’s strength.
“There is scope for further yuan gains before the authorities start to become concerned about excessive strength,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., adding that a lack of pushback from Beijing has encouraged him to become more bullish. “It is very likely for the yuan to hit 6.7 in the near term.”
Beijing’s apparent blessing of the rally is a far cry from a few years ago, when the People’s Bank of China sought to rein in gains for fears that it would hurt exporters. What’s different now is the country has changed its strategy for boosting growth. It’s now more focused on cheapening imports and bolstering domestic consumption, and a stronger currency could help achieve that.
This doesn’t mean the PBOC will allow the yuan to gain too fast. One indicator traders follow is the Bloomberg CFETS RMB Index Tracker, which measures the currency against 24 peers. While it shows the yuan has climbed 2.2% this quarter, it is still well off this year’s peak in March.
The yuan is also close to the weakest level in six years versus the euro, the currency of a major trade partner. That suggests there’s room for further gains.
Beijing will likely slow the appreciation by issuing weaker fixings and relaxing capital controls if the yuan basket rises another 2%, Goh said.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Wednesday in Asia, with investors fine-tuning their positions ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.03% to 93.085 by 9:76 PM ET (2:57 AM GMT), giving up some earlier gains. The USD/JPY pair was down 0.15% to 105.28.
The Fed will meet later in the day to hand down its policy decision, its first meeting since Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced a more relaxed approach to inflation at the Jackson Hole symposium on August 27. This stance is widely expected to be continued and may weaken the greenback with the introduction of further stimulus measures.
However, some investors disagreed with those expectations.
“There’s a feeling in the market that maybe the Fed will try to act on its dovish tilt,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior currency analyst Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
“Our sense is that there’s a risk there that the Fed doesn’t do much more than what it’s done already,” he added, possibly lifting U.S. yields and weighing on the yen.
The policy decision is also expected to introduce longer tenors for the Fed’s bond-buying program. Other areas of interest to investors are the Fed’s economic projections, particularly on inflation and its direction.
“The three to 3.5-year projection horizon will give (Fed members) an opportunity to indicate how big an overshoot they expect will be required to get to the 2% average inflation target … it will also give (them) an opportunity to indicate how much of an overshoot they are willing to tolerate,” Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) head of FX research Steve Englander told Reuters.
The Bank of Japan and Bank of England will also hand down their respective policy decisions on Thursday.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.7309 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6722.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.15% to 6.7699. The yuan continued to bask in the wake of Tuesday’s economic data indicating growth in industrial production and retail sales year-on-year, as well as pointing to China’s continuous economic recovery from COVID-19. The data also boosted investor hopes for a global recovery from the pandemic.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.22% to 1.2915. The pound rose on the back of Tuesday’s better-than-expected job figures, as well as opposition to a bill proposing to break the U.K.’s Brexit treaty with the European Union (EU). The U.K. will release a slew of data for August, including the consumer price index, later in the day."
274,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of England officials are expected to lay the groundwork this week for yet more monetary stimulus as optimism over the U.K.’s economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic fizzles out.
While economists and investors don’t see immediate action, they widely predict the BOE’s bond-buying program will be expanded again before the end of the year. The latest policy decision, released at noon London time on Thursday, will likely back that view.
With job losses mounting, new social restrictions to counter rising infections, and trade talks with the European Union in peril, Britain looks set for a turbulent end to 2020.
“The BOE’s not done,” said James Rossiter, an economist at TD Securities who used to work at the central bank. “More quantitative easing is necessary and this meeting does provide a bit of an opportunity to shift things in that direction. The big cliff coming is on the employment side.”
Investors are likewise betting on action. In the past week, interbank lending rates tumbled to record lows, and six-month Treasury bills sold at a negative average yield for the first time.
Economists expect another 50 billion pounds ($64 billion) to be added to the 745 billion-pound bond-buying program in November. That’s when updated economic projections will be published, and just weeks before the end of the U.K.’s transition period for leaving the EU.
While a rate cut probably won’t be the BOE’s first choice, money markets are pricing in a reduction as early as February. Economists at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). say the main rate could fall to minus 0.5% if Britain fails to strike a trade deal with the EU.
The “cliff” cited by Rossiter is the end of the government’s furlough scheme on Oct. 31. Many governments in the rest of Europe have extended their own programs, but the U.K. insists that businesses must adjust to the post-Covid economy.
That may change -- Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday acknowledged that businesses need help, in the strongest signal yet that he may offer more support.
Hours before he spoke, data showed employment slid by more than 100,000 in July despite shops, bars and restaurants reopening. Britain’s job losses now total almost 700,000 since the start of coronavirus lockdowns in March.
Workers face more than twice as many job losses in the coming months than in the recession following the global financial crisis, according to the Institute for Employment Studies. The BOE anticipates the unemployment rate almost doubling to 7.5% by the end of the year.
“Rising unemployment may be not a temporary, demand-deficient, phenomenon,” said former BOE policy maker David Miles, now a professor of financial economics at Imperial College London. “Some industries are going to be affected for a long period of time.”
Prices are also under pressure. Figures published Wednesday are predicted to show inflation at zero, the weakest in almost five years. The BOE’s goal is 2%.
Only last month, central-bank officials said Covid-19’s hit to output was shallower than initially thought, with Chief Economist Andy Haldane particularly keen to counter pessimism.
Still, Governor Andrew Bailey and Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden have stressed that they have plenty of firepower, and their Monetary Policy Committee colleague Michael Saunders said it is “quite likely” that more easing will be needed. Gertjan Vlieghe and Silvana Tenreyro have said the initial economic rebound isn’t a good guide to the longer term.
“Uncertainty from both Covid-19 and Brexit will be a double whammy,” said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), who expects a dissenting vote for more asset purchases this week. “What I think we could get in the September meeting are the first signs of more policy easing on the horizon.”

While equities and gold benefited from the trillions of dollars in fiscal spending and monetary injections, those efforts are debasing the currency and have raised the possibility that the U.S. will go too far in testing the limits of government stimulus, Dalio said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
“There is so much debt production and debt monetization,” Dalio said.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has dropped 10% from its peak in late March as investors responded to the pandemic and efforts by central bank and government officials to contain the economic fallout. All of the world’s major developed currencies have gained against the dollar as have precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum.
Dalio said in July that investors should favor stocks and gold over bonds and cash because the latter offer a negative rate of return and central banks will print more money. Bridgewater has been moving into gold and inflation-linked bonds in its All Weather portfolio, diversifying the countries it invests in and finding more stocks with stable cash flow.
Bridgewater’s flagship Pure Alpha II hedge fund has had a tough year, tumbling 18.6% through August, amid the market turmoil fueled by the pandemic. The firm took a hit at “the worst possible moment” because its portfolios were positioned at the start of the year to benefit from rising markets, Dalio told clients in mid-March.
The Westport, Connecticut-based firm manages about $148 billion, down from roughly $160 billion at the start of the year.

Investing.com – The dollar moved off session lows Tuesday, but traders appeared wary of biding up the greenback as the Federal Reserve is expected to reiterate its commitment to keep rates low for longer to ensure the economic recovery continues.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.07%, to 93.13, after falling to a session low of 92.79.
The Federal Open Market Committee is set to kick off its two-day meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to culminate in a decision to keep interest rates in a 0-to-0.25% range.
""We expect only cosmetic changes to the statement and a dovish dot plot. We do not expect any major surprises on either forward guidance or QE and anticipate only cosmetic statement changes to reflect the new inflation framework announced at Jackson Hole,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The policy statement will also be accompanied by an update on the central bank's economic projections that will likely back the Fed's ongoing outlook for a protracted economic recovery.
""Changes to the SEP are likely to be more significant in the near term, but the projections over the median term are likely to further underscore that the median FOMC participant foresees a lengthy recovery and prolonged period with the federal funds rate in the current target range,"" Morgan Stanley added.
The sluggish move in the dollar comes as its rebound in September has done little to persuade traders to drop their bearish bets on the dollar.
""The Fed’s latest policy shift has fueled expectations that rates will stay lower for longer, and is therefore offering – and will likely continue to offer in the foreseeable future – a reason to stick to USD shorts and hold a sell-the-rally approach on any USD signs of reprise,"" ING said in a note."

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, with traders keeping a risk-on tone ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
 At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.920, with EUR/USD up 0.2% at 1.1889, ahead of the release of Germany's ZEW index for September, the first of the major business surveys to be released this month.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) resuming the U.K. clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) looking to expand phase 3 trials for their own candidate have helped the market take a much more positive attitude towards risk.
“It was uplifting that Pfizer has made clear a target of vaccines. As risk assets bounced back, the dollar has lost momentum,” Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) director of forex Kyosuke Suzuki told Reuters.
Still, investors will exhibit some caution ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, starting later Tuesday, after it adopted a new approach last month to meeting its 2% inflation target. 
The Fed will also update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD edged up 0.1% to 1.2858, despite the continuing turmoil surrounding Brexit negotiations and a weakening in the country’s employment market.
 An initial parliamentary vote on the U.K.’s controversial bill to violate the Brexit agreement with the European Union passed on Tuesday, but not without heated debate. The EU has warned that the passage of the U.K.’s bill would lead to a collapse in negotiations, increasing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
Britain’s labor market took a turn for the worse in the summer, even as the economy gradually reopened. Employment fell by 102,000, the first decline since April, while the July unemployment figure climbed to 4.1%, from 3.9% the previous month.
Additionally, USD/CNY traded 0.3% lower at 6.7856, after posting a 16-month low of 6.7793 earlier Monday. Helping the tone were the latest Chinese economic data, suggesting the second-largest economy in the world was recovering from the Covid-19 hit. 
Retail sales increased 0.5% year-on-year in August and industrial production jumped 45.6% year-on-year. Both figures beat expectations, with retail sales, in particular, reporting their first increase in 2020.
The Turkish lira posted a new low versus the dollar, with USD/TRY 0.1% higher at 7.4861, just off the 7.4969 level reached earlier Tuesday. The Turkish currency is still suffering from Moody’s decision late Friday to downgrade Turkey’s long-term credit rating further into speculative grade.

Employment fell by 102,000, the first decline since April, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday. The single-month unemployment figure reached 4.4%, the highest since 2018.
While restaurants and pubs started to reopen after coronavirus lockdowns, the figures are a reminder that the upturn in spending masks deeper fragilities.
The number of employees on payrolls in August is down 695,000 from March, compared with 659,000 in July. The number of people claiming for jobless benefits has risen to 2.7 million, an increase of 121% since March.
That’s left the government facing mounting calls to extend its furlough programs -- as other European nations have done -- after the worst economic contraction in centuries. The U.K. faces a triple whammy of a spike in unemployment as aid ends, new restrictions on activity as infections mount, and a turbulent Brexit at the end of the year.
Most economists predict the heightened uncertainties will prompt the Bank of England to increase its monetary stimulus later this year. Policy makers may lay the groundwork for that when they meet this week.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak has so far insisted that the furlough programs must be allowed to expire so that the economy can adjust to the post-Covid reality.
Yet companies are already notifying authorities about layoffs to come, putting the U.K. on course for twice as may job losses as in the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the Institute for Employment said Monday.

279,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 01:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank said the appreciation of the currency was consistent with higher commodity prices -- particularly Iron ore -- while providing no indication that additional monetary measures are imminent.
“While members noted that the Australian dollar was broadly aligned with its fundamental determinants, a lower exchange rate would provide more assistance to the Australian economy in its recovery,” the Reserve Bank of Australia said in minutes of its September meeting in Sydney Tuesday.
The currency advanced after the release as the central bank reiterated that it would “continue to consider how further monetary measures could support the recovery” without suggesting it was poised to do so. The Australian dollar traded at 73.04 U.S. cents at 11:57 a.m. in Sydney from 72.73 cents just prior to the release.
The RBA this month announced an expansion of its lending facility for banks and signaled a renewed willingness to explore additional measures to support the economy. Gross domestic product contracted by the most on record last quarter, officially pushing Australia into its first recession in almost three decades.
The Australian dollar has soared more than 27% from a low on March 19, the day the central bank announced emergency measures that included cutting the benchmark interest rate to 0.25% and setting a target for the three-year yield on government bonds at the same rate.
Under the RBA’s increased Term Funding Facility, banks will have access to additional funding equivalent to 2% of their outstanding credit, at a fixed rate of 25 basis points for three years. Banks will be able to draw on this up until the end of June 2021. The change brings the total available to around A$200 billion ($145.5 billion).
One by-product from increasing the facility is that should banks find firms aren’t willing to take out loans -- possible with the economy in recession -- they can use the funding to buy government bonds.
The RBA is coordinating with the government’s stimulus program by purchasing bonds to keep borrowing costs down across the economy. The central bank has bought over A$63 billion of government securities since it initiated the bond-buying program.
“Public sector balance sheets in Australia were assessed as being strong,” the RBA said. “In an environment of record low borrowing rates and significant spare capacity in the economy, this meant fiscal policy was well placed to continue to support the recovery.”
Both the government and central bank are focused on bringing down unemployment that probably rose to 7.7% in August, economists predicted ahead of data Thursday. The RBA expects the jobless rate will reach 10% by year’s end."
280,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s new approach to setting interest rates will probably be hard to divine from the economic projections it’s set to publish on Wednesday.
That’s because those forecasts, released alongside its policy decision, only encapsulate Fed officials’ views about the next few years. The new framework -- which dictates a less-aggressive response to rising inflation than in the past -- likely won’t be put to the test until later on.
The Fed isn’t expected to offer clearer guidance about the conditions it wants to see before raising rates in the statement it releases at 2 p.m. As a result, Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will be asking the public to believe them when they say that this time will be different, because of their strategy shift.
“The change in the framework really doesn’t come into play until you actually get to full capacity and until you actually get some inflation pressure,” said Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. financial economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in New York. “It’s about how the Fed responds to that. And unfortunately, right now, the projections just don’t extend far enough to capture that.”
The committee slashed its benchmark interest rate to nearly zero at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March and announced there would be no hikes until the economy was “on track” to meet the Fed’s twin goals for maximum employment and price stability. It’s debated strengthening that guidance in recent months, but Fed-watchers mostly don’t expect that to happen this week because officials have downplayed any sense of urgency in making such a decision in recent public remarks.
New Framework
Since March, however, the goals have changed. Powell announced on Aug. 27 that the Fed would now view its inflation target of 2% as something to hit on average over time. That will mean allowing inflation to rise above 2% following periods of below-target inflation -- like the one projected to persist for the next few years, thanks to the blow the pandemic has delivered to economic activity.
The shift leaves open the question of what the new approach means for the timing of future tightening, which in turn has an effect on financial markets. Officials’ economic projections have at times contributed to market turmoil since they were introduced in 2012 because they weight the views of everyone on the committee equally despite their relative influence in the policy debate.
The projections are also compiled in advance of the committee’s policy meetings, which means they don’t incorporate the latest thinking to come out of the meetings themselves. Even so, the Fed chair tends to refer back to the projections in post-meeting press conferences when reporters ask for more clarity on the conditions that will guide future rate decisions.
2023 Dots
When the last set of projections was issued in June, it showed that all but two of the 17 committee participants expected to keep rates near zero through the end of 2022. The projections to be released Wednesday will extend the forecast horizon to the end of 2023.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the median projection will still show no liftoff in 2023, though they were about evenly split on whether or not the central bank would actually begin raising rates by then. Meanwhile, about three quarters of respondents said they didn’t expect policy makers would be able to declare victory on their new average-inflation target until 2024 or later.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said in an Aug. 31 speech the committee would discuss potential refinements to the format of the projections with the aim of reaching a decision on possible changes by the end of the year. He didn’t say whether that would include extending the forecast horizon.
Andrew Levin, a former Fed economist who assisted Powell’s predecessors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, in designing the projections, said that makes the central bank’s job of convincing people it’s serious about its new framework more complicated.
“You’ve got to forecast five and 10 years ahead if you want to talk about average inflation targeting,” Levin, now a professor at Dartmouth College, said. “Professional forecasters think we’re going to be short of the target for the next few years, which really raises the question, what’s the Fed’s longer-run plan?”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against riskier currencies on Tuesday as hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine and big corporate deals improved investor appetite for assets such as the yuan and the euro.
The dollar index (=USD) dipped to 93.029, slipping further from a one-month high of 93.664 touched last Wednesday, with its low last week of 92.695 seen as an immediate support.
The euro inched up to $1.1867 (EUR=), having gained for four straight sessions until Monday.
Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar traded at 105.73 yen , having touched a two-week low of 105.55 yen on Monday.
Helping sentiment, AstraZeneca (L:AZN) resumed British clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, one of the most advanced in development while  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) proposed expanding their Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial.
""It was uplifting that Pfizer has made clear a target of vaccines. As risk assets bounced back, the dollar has lost momentum,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Wall Street shares bounced back also as several multi-billion dollar deals -- including Nvidia's (O:NVDA) purchase of chip designer Arm and a deal between Oracle (N:ORCL) and China's ByteDance on TikTok -- lifted confidence.
The British pound bounced back to $1.2851 , following a fall of 3.66% last week, showing limited reaction after the UK government won an initial Parliamentary vote on its controversial bill to violate the Brexit deal with the European Union.
Still, traders said the currency looks vulnerable as the EU warns British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's bill would collapse trade talks and propel the United Kingdom towards a messy Brexit. 
Elsewhere, the offshore Chinese yuan hit a 16-month high of 6.8053 yuan per dollar on Monday and last traded at 6.8098 .
China's retail sales and industrial output data for August due later in the day is its immediate focus.
The yuan's strength helped to lift MSCI emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) to a six-month high.
The Australian dollar slipped 0.2% to $0.7270 , as odds narrowed for further monetary policy easing by the country's central bank.
Traders also look to central bank policy meetings in the United States on Wednesday and in Japan and Britain on Thursday.
In particular, this week's Federal Reserve meeting will be its first since Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled a shift toward greater tolerance of inflation, effectively pledging to keep interest rates low for longer.

Projections from Fed policymakers that inflation will remain below 2% in their economic forecasts, to be extended to 2023 this time, could strengthen expectations that interest rates will stay low for a long period of time, analysts say.

Ahead of a first parliamentary vote on The Internal Markets Bill at 22:00 GMT today, Boris Johnson suggested the legislation was needed to avoid a situation in which ""our EU counterparts seriously believe they have the power to break up our country.”
The bill, published last week, seeks to create common rules that apply across the whole of the U.K. including England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It would likely clash with key terms of the withdrawal agreement requiring that Northern Ireland, in the post-Brexit period, follow EU rules in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. 
The legislation is expected to pass the first parliamentary process despite the several members from Johnson’s Conservative party refusing to tow the party line and back the bill.
The vote comes just days after European leaders threatened to abandon a U.K.-EU trade deal if the prime minister moved ahead with the legislation.
The pound’s move higher could prove to be short-lived ahead of Bank of England’s meeting later this week.
Experts have suggested the central bank could renew its cautious outlook on the economy, and lay out the welcome mat for more easing in November.
“If recent communication is any guide, the central bank will signal that QE remains the marginal tool of choice which should translate into a small downward move in gilt yields, likely to be drowned out by day-to-day Brexit noise,” ING said in a note. “In short, the debate on further monetary easing is adding downward risk to a very shallow recovery in GBP interest rates.”"

The bank said in a note late on Friday the market was pricing 40%-45% odds of Britain ending its post-Brexit transition period without reaching a free-trade agreement with the European Union. 
While those odds could rise further, Goldman Sachs said the UK government was aware how damaging a no-deal outcome would be to the economy.

""For investors willing to look through some near-term volatility, current levels for sterling longs now look attractive, in our view,"" it added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The British pound flirted with a 1 1/2-month low against the dollar on Monday on fears about no-deal Brexit while investors waited for Japan's ruling party to choose a successor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The British pound ticked up slightly in Asia to $1.2819 , after having hit $1.2767 on Friday, its lowest since July 24. It has lost more than 4% so far this month, the worst among G10 currencies.
Against the euro, it slid to a 5 1/2-month low of 92.90 pence per euro (EURGBP=D4) and last stood at 92.39.
The pound was under pressure from fears that Britain will end its post-Brexit transition period with no trade agreements.
London explicitly acknowledged last week that it could break international law by ignoring some parts of its European Union divorce treaty, prompting a rapid rebuke from the EU's chief executive.
Former British prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major said on Sunday Britain must drop a ""shocking"" plan to pass legislation that breaks its divorce treaty with the European Union, in a breach of international law.
The dollar stood at 106.13 yen , stuck in its familiar territory in the past couple of weeks.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga is poised to become head of Japan's ruling party on Monday and prime minister on Wednesday, succeeding Shinzo Abe, the nation's longest-serving leader.
Because Suga has long been a loyal aide to Abe and has vowed to continue his policies, few market players expect radical changes.
""The focus is on the line-up of his cabinet as well as whether he will call a snap election,"" said Minori Uchida, chief FX strategist at MUFG Bank. ""He is saying he will continue and advance Abenomics but it is questionable how much advancement he can make."" 
The euro held firm after three straight days of gains at $1.18455 (EUR=).
The common currency was supported after the European Central Bank showed no apparent sign of stemming the single currency's appreciation.
Still, it faces an uphill battle in tackling the $1.20 barrier, with investors wary euro zone policy makers may not want to see the currency strengthen much beyond that level.
Some euro zone countries, such as France and Spain, are reporting rises in coronavirus infections, in contrast to falls in the United States, clouding the outlook for economic recovery.
The dollar's index against a basket of currencies stood little changed at 93.317 (=USD), with focus on the Federal Reserve's policy announcement on Wednesday.
Expectations of further monetary easing by the Fed have been a drag on the dollar. The dollar index has lost more than 4% so far this quarter.
The Fed has announced late last month that it has adjusted its policy strategy, noting that it wants inflation to average 2% over time.
But some analysts say markets may have gone too far in expecting further Fed stimulus. 

""Having set aside yield curve control (YCC) as a near-term policy option, the FOMC does not seem to have an operational consensus on how to use the balance sheet,"" New York-based strategists at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank wrote in report. ""This may disappoint investors.""

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, but the focus centered on the British pound and Japanese yen.
The pound rallied from its fall during the previous session over increasing fears of a hard Brexit. In Japan, the ruling party will vote in a new leader later in the day, with the winner widely expected to replace incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.16% to 93.192 by 11:57 PM ET (4:57 AM GMT) and rolled over to the December contract on Sunday.
Investors await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, with further monetary easing widely expected. But some investors cautioned against setting those expectations too high.
“Having set aside yield curve control as a near-term policy option, the FOMC does not seem to have an operational consensus on how to use the balance sheet,” Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank strategists said in a note.
“This may disappoint investors,” they added.
Other central banks, including Bank of Japan and Bank of England, are due to announce their policy decisions on Thursday.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.22% to 1.2821, despite fears that the U.K. would exit from the European Union (EU) with no trade deal mounting and putting pressure on the pound.
London acknowledged during the previous week that it could break international law “in a very specific and limited way.” The comments led to backlash from European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, as well as former prime ministers. Tony Blair and John Major said on Sunday Britain must drop the “shocking” plan to pass legislation breaking its divorce treaty with the EU, in a breach of international law.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.04% to 106.09 ahead of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s vote for a new leader, due to take place later in the day. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga is predicted to win in a landslide victory, with the successor to Abe expected to be appointed on Wednesday.
Investors expect few radical changes, with Suga widely expected continue Abe’s current policies if appointed.
“The focus is on the line-up of his cabinet as well as whether he will call a snap election,” MUFG Bank chief FX strategist Minori Uchida told Reuters.
But he added, “He is saying he will continue and advance Abenomics but it is questionable how much advancement he can make.""
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.7281 while the NZD/USD pair was up 0.46% to 0.6694.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.04% to 6.8301. China is scheduled to release industrial production and retail sales data on Tuesday."

Investing.com -- Turmoil involving Britain’s negotiations with the European Union over their trading relationship has hit sterling hard this week.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson now threatens to break the divorce agreement with the EU, prompting threats of legal action. The odds of a no-deal Brexit are increasing, along with the likelihood of an ugly outcome. The pound has fallen against the euro, plunging again on Friday to 1.08.
Investing.com's Geoffrey Smith argues the bull case for sterling, while Peter Nurse counters with reasons why it will continue to fall. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
It’s not often that you get to make an argument like this, but the bull case for sterling rests largely on the sheer spinelessness and brazen opportunism of the British government.
To sell sterling at these levels, you have to believe that the U.K. government is as stupid as it has pretended to be this week. You have to believe that it will go through with its threat to end the post-Brexit transition period without  any deal at all to ensure smooth trade with the EU after Dec. 31 , and that it's willing to risk the anger of the U.S. by wrecking the Northern Ireland peace process in the bargain.
You have to believe that Johnson and his team seriously think they can win another election after pursuing a course of action that – for all the various arguments over sovereignty – can only result in more acute short-term pain for the British economy, and probably a higher level of chronic pain thereafter. You also have to believe that the EU, in the depths of its worst economic contraction ever, will willfully make things worse for the sake of an abstract faith in its Single Market.
The market has not believed that for most of the last four years, and its skepticism has been well founded on a succession of messy compromises that has delayed the hard choices between smooth trade and sovereignty. More of those compromises lie ahead, despite all the negotiating bluster to the contrary this week.
Certainly, the Withdrawal Agreement that was supposed to be the basis of a comprehensive post-Brexit deal appears dead. But ending the transition period without a comprehensive deal, regulating all the things that EU membership used to regulate from fisheries to international arrest warrants, is not the same as leaving without any mitigating arrangements at all.  
It is already clear that the Bank of England and European Central Bank get on well enough – and are mature enough – to ensure that financial flows, underpinned by enforceable contracts, will carry on in January whatever happens. It is not hard to imagine a patchwork of sector-specific agreements being stitched together out of various short-term fixes to cover essentials such as perishable food and medicines. With time, such stopgap fixes can be smoothed out into more coherent and durable structures.
Barring hyperinflation – which is not a risk for the foreseeable future - currencies don’t go to zero. Over 20 years, EUR/GBP has never been able to sustain a level beyond 0.9250 for any length of time. Barring a failure of statecraft without parallel since the 1930s, the odds are on the pound’s side at these levels. 
The Bear case
It’s true the recent turmoil surrounding Britain’s negotiations with the European Union over their trading relationship has hit sterling hard this week, but this doesn’t mean more losses aren’t possible, or indeed likely.
After all, while the pound has reversed some of its gains against the dollar after setting a high for the year at the start of this month, it remains higher than its 2019 average and well above the March low.
The move by the U.K. government to table a bill that would breach the existing withdrawal agreement, a move London openly says would contravene international law, has seen trust between the two sides largely disappear.
Indeed, investment bank Morgan Stanley increased the likelihood of Britain and the European Union ending up trading on World Trade Organisation terms to 40% from 25%.
""The risks are skewed to a harder outcome... bumping up the probability of our bear case of a WTO-style outcome to 40%. We still expect a delay in implementing the deal,"" the bank’s analysts said, in a note.
Even then, 40% isn’t 100%. Which means unless one of the sides is prepared to eat an awful lot of humble pie, sterling has room to move a lot lower.
Aside from the turmoil with the Brexit negotiations, worries surrounding the Covid-19 virus are on the rise. 
A new study by Imperial College suggested the spread of the coronavirus is speeding up across all parts of England, with the number of cases doubling about every week. 
That suggests Wednesday’s new restrictions on bars and restaurants will just be the start of a new series of lockdowns.
Britain has suffered the highest number of deaths from Covid-19 in Europe, and lockdown measures imposed meant the economy contracted a record 20.4% in the second quarter, by far the weakest quarter of the major industrialized countries in Europe.
Output did expand by 6.6% in July. But the furlough program, under which the government has paid as much as 80% of the wages of some 9.6 million workers, is due to be wound down altogether at the end of next month. More redundancies and thus a further hit to output are likely.
“We're likely to see the pace of expansion slow in August/September and stall as we head into the winter as the 'mechanical rebound' ends and unemployment rises,”  said analyst James Smith at ING, in a note Friday.
This puts next week’s Bank of England meeting firmly in focus.
BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said last month the central bank has plenty of room to add more monetary stimulus, and it’s beginning to look like he may need to use this, a sterling negative.
“We think the overall size of the U.K. economy is unlikely to return to pre-virus levels until late 2022, or perhaps later. This in turn will increase the pressure on the Bank of England to increase their stimulus package at the November meeting,” Smith added.

Investing.com – The pound is set for second-straight weekly slump on Friday, as no-deal Brexit fears persist after the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly pushed ahead with a bill that would seek to override the withdrawal deal despite threats from the EU.
GBP/USD fell 0.07% to $1.2738, and looked set for it worst week since March.
Johnson attempted to whip up demand for the internal market bill on Friday, telling lawmakers the legislation was ""necessary to stop a foreign power from breaking up our country,"" and insisting there was ""no time for questions,"" the Guardian reported. The prime minister faces rebels from his own party, who have tabled an amendment that would give Parliament the right to veto the bill.
The move comes just as European leaders threatened to abandon a U.K.-EU trade deal if the prime minister moved ahead with the legislation.
The bill, published on Wednesday, seeks to create common rules that apply across the whole of the U.K. including England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It would likely clash with key terms of the withdrawal agreement requiring that Northern Ireland, in the post-Brexit period, follow EU rules in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.  
Emergency talks this week to break the deadlock appear to have stalled, with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier conceding that ""significant differences remain in areas of essential interest for the EU.""
In another sign that both sides are preparing for a no-deal, or hard Brexit, Barnier said that while talks would continue over the coming days, the ""EU is intensifying its preparedness work to be ready for all scenarios on 1 January 2021."""
291,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. federal budget deficit surpassed $3 trillion in the current fiscal year, nearly triple the 2019 gap and leaving the shortfall as a share of the economy on pace to be the largest since World War II.
August’s $200.1 billion deficit, which little changed from the same month in 2019, pushed the fiscal year’s total past $3 trillion, Treasury Department figures showed Friday. Last year, over the same 11 months, the nation’s budget shortfall was a little more than $1 trillion.
Spending so far this year has exceeded $6 trillion amid a massive government fiscal push to cushion Americans from the pandemic-related lockdown of the economy months ago. At the same time, revenue is slightly less than what it was in the first 11 months of fiscal 2019. The Congressional Budget Office projected earlier this month that the 2020 deficit would be 16% of gross domestic product, the biggest since 1945.
Receipts in August fell 2.1% from a year ago, while spending declined 1.2%, the Treasury’s report showed.
Outlays for federal additional unemployment compensation program totaled $22.5 billion, compared with $73.4 billion a month earlier, after the $600 supplemental weekly jobless payments ended in July. Outlays for state unemployment benefits totaled $31.2 billion after $36.1 billion in July.

292,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are now paying for the privilege to lend cash to the U.K. government for short periods of time, adding to conviction for rate cuts by the Bank of England.
The Debt Management Office sold six-month bills with an average yield of minus 0.0005% in an auction on Friday. It’s the first time investors have agreed to buy the short-term debt with negative rates.
The subzero yield is yet another sign that investors see the BOE easing policy further, given the possibility that trade talks between the U.K. and European Union may fail. The rate on two-year government debt this week fell further into negative territory to an all-time low, and money markets on Friday priced in a cut below zero as soon as February, with a reduction of almost 20 basis points by the end of next year.
Unless a deal is struck, companies will be subject to EU tariffs, quotas and customs checks.
A messy transition adds to a plethora of risks looming over the U.K.’s economy. These include the government’s plan to end its furlough program, which may spur a jump in unemployment figures, and the rising number of coronavirus cases in the country. They dampen optimism over the 6.6% monthly growth in gross domestic product in July.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“There’s still room for the markets to price the outcome of BOE having to cut to zero if Covid-19 worsens and no-deal seems more likely by the November meeting. The negative rate debate may intensify next year.”
-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist
BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said last month the central bank has plenty of room to add more monetary stimulus to fight the U.K.’s economic slump. Three-month sterling Libor -- the rate banks can borrow from each other -- fell to a record on Wednesday and is below the BOE’s benchmark, a move that often precedes a rate cut.
This may further reduce the U.K.’s six-month funding costs, which fell to an all-time low of 0.09088% on Thursday.

293,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government is paying less as it borrows more, one reason investors appear more comfortable than Congress about funding another leg of stimulus.Interest payments in the federal budget declined about 10% in the first 11 months of this fiscal year, when America was running up its biggest deficit since World War II. Over the next few years, servicing the national debt will be cheaper than any time in the past half-century when measured against the size of the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
That’s because yields in the $20 trillion U.S. Treasury market plunged to record lows early in the pandemic -- and they’ve risen only slightly since then, even though the supply of debt has surged to a record.Borrowing probably won’t always be this cheap, but for now the U.S. government is far from running up against any financial limits, as it seeks to shore up the economy after a wave of shutdowns and layoffs. Concerns that the country can’t afford much more spending have been voiced by officials from both political parties in recent weeks, as stimulus efforts ground to a halt.
“While there’s been a lot of concern about the mounting debt, it hasn’t caused the problems that were anticipated by the doomsters,” says Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research Inc. “It’s not just a question of how much debt is outstanding, but what is the cost to service that debt.”
The CBO predicts a deficit of about $3.7 trillion this year, or 16% of GDP, more than triple the year-earlier figures. Bonds issued to fund the shortfall have pushed the U.S. public debt past $20 trillion –- more than the economy’s annual output.
‘Not Stretched’
Yet the average yield on the debt has dropped to 1.7%, from 2.4% in December, and it’s set to fall further.
Even after a few auctions that saw signs of faltering demand, the government can borrow for 30 years at below 1.5%. And the Treasury has tilted sales toward such longer-term securities, helping lock in historically low rates. The latest long-bond auction on Thursday drew a solid bid.
“The U.S.’s debt affordability is quite OK, not stretched by any means,” says Felipe Villarroel, a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management in London. “We also look at what is the perceived use of the money a government is borrowing, which is now widely accepted as necessary.”The idea that governments need financial-market approval for their budget policies has in any case been called into question.
Anti-Vigilante
Yardeni coined the term “bond vigilantes” in the early 1980s. It described investors who were supposed to exert power over governments by selling their bonds, or merely threatening to, and thus making deficit-spending more expensive.
But now the dominant presence in markets is a kind of anti-vigilante, which does the opposite of all those things: the Federal Reserve.
Fed purchases have siphoned about $1.8 trillion of government debt out of the market since March, while the Treasury was issuing some $3 trillion of new bonds. The central bank is currently adding about $80 billion of Treasuries a month. It’s also promised to keep short-term rates at zero for the foreseeable future and tolerate above-target inflation, while urging the government not to ease up on fiscal stimulus.There’s a broad consensus among bond investors that if rates on longer-term government debt start to creep up, as they’ve occasionally threatened to, then the Fed can and will step in.
‘Still Out There’
“If there were some bond vigilantes still out there to push the bond yields higher,” is how Yardeni puts it, “then the Fed will target the bond yields.”
In an Aug. 31 speech, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida left the door open to a policy of capping Treasury yields at some point, though he indicated it’s not imminent.
Even the potential for such a move is helping to keep the government’s borrowing costs down, investors say.The 10-year Treasury note has been trading around 0.7% for weeks, and it’s forecast to end the year within a few basis points of that level, according to Bloomberg surveys.
‘Look Different’
In the financial world there are plenty who argue that the low interest bills America currently pays on its growing debt are just a short-term respite –- like a teaser rate on a jumbo mortgage.
“The Fed is greasing the system to make sure the financial markets are functioning well,” says Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income for private wealth management at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). “But at some point in time the world will look different, and all of a sudden we are going to be stuck with a huge bill.”That view still carries some weight in Congress too, even if deficit hawks –- Washington’s version of bond vigilantes –- aren’t the force they once were.President Donald Trump’s Republican Party has used its Senate majority to push for scaled-back measures in the next pandemic bill. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has promised more spending if he beats Trump in November’s election, but a senior aide told the Wall Street Journal last month that it’s not clear what America can afford because “the pantry is going to be bare.”
‘Not Worth Anything’
Taking the opposite view is the emerging school of Modern Monetary Theory. It argues that countries like America, which borrow in their own currency, can set the interest rates on their debt as a policy variable –- and don’t really need to sell bonds anyway. The risk is overheating the economy rather than running out of market funds.Also cited by the dovish camp is Japan, which has a national debt about two-and-a-half times bigger than America’s (by comparison with their economies). After more than two decades of low interest rates, its debt-servicing cost is approximately zero.
David Levy, chairman of Jerome Levy Forecasting Center LLC, says that ultimately there are limits to government debt –- but the U.S. is nowhere near hitting them, and has room for more borrowing to pull its economy out of the coronavirus slump.“It would take a long time to get to the type of inflationary scenario where people thought the dollar was not worth anything,” he says. “You can keep this process growing without it breaking down.”

Investing.com - The dollar slipped in early European trade Friday, with the euro showing strength as traders took heart from Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. Sterling rebounded after a robust bounce in activity in July, but further losses look likely.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.285, with EUR/USD up 0.2% at 1.1831.
The euro had a volatile ride during Thursday’s ECB meeting and subsequent press conference, but the overall tone Friday remains positive.
“The ECB presented almost no serious hurdles to renewed euro strength as economic forecasts were more upbeat than expected while comments on the exchange rate were fairly soft,” said analyst Petr Krpata at ING. 
“Given the outlook, it is hard for ECB to lean against currency strength and with bearish USD dynamics firmly in place, the medium-term upbeat EUR/USD outlook for 2021 remains intact.”
That said, possibly to counter the impression that the bank had been unduly optimistic, the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane wrote in a blog post on Friday that: ""There is no room for complacency.""
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2824, and EUR/GBP gained 0.1% to 0.9228, after Britain's economy expanded by 6.6% in July from June, for its third month of growth as the country tries to recover from its coronavirus lockdown crash.
However, sterling remains weighed by the fraught state of negotiations with the European Union over its trading relationship after Britain fully leaves the bloc.
The pound has lost 3.6% against the dollar this week and about as much against the euro as Brexit turmoil resurfaced.
EU diplomats said the bloc could take legal action against Britain after U.K. officials presented a draft law earlier this week that would break the divorce treaty and in all likelihood end four years of Brexit talks. 
“The chances of a UK-EU trade deal being struck are now 50:50 at best, given the events of the past few days, “ ING said. “The very limited risk premium factored into EUR/GBP at the moment suggests further downside lies ahead for the pound.”
Turning back to the dollar, traders will focus on the inflation figures for August, which are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). 
They are expected to show core CPI rising 0.2% month-on-month and 1.6% on a year-over-year basis, still way below the 2% level the Federal Reserve has set as its average target.
 "
295,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The recent appreciation of the euro dampens the inflation outlook and the European Central Bank is ready to act if needed, chief economist Philip Lane said.
Inflation will remain negative for the rest of the year and upward revisions in core price growth because of the economic rebound have been “significantly muted” by the stronger exchange rate, he wrote in a blog post on Friday.
“It should be abundantly clear that there is no room for complacency,” he wrote. “The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves toward its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.”
President Christine Lagarde spurred a rally in the euro on Thursday after she delivered relatively mild comments on the euro’s surge. The single currency has jumped more than 10% against the dollar since March and is near its strongest level in more than two years.
The exchange rate must be monitored for its impact on prices, she said after the ECB left its monetary policy unchanged and unveiled a slightly more optimistic outlook for euro-area economy.
The currency fluctuated on Lane’s remarks and was at $1.1834 at 8:17 a.m. Friday, up 0.2% on the day.

296,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Britain recorded strong growth in July as coronavirus restrictions eased, but mounting job losses and the risk of a messy Brexit are threatening a turbulent end to the year.
Gross domestic product rose 6.6% from June, when it gained a record 8.7%. After restaurants and bars started to reopen in early July, the figures show the country has clawed back just over half of the output lost during the lockdown. Economists had forecast 6.7% growth.
While the rebound is welcome after the 20% contraction in the second quarter, the U.K. is facing a triple hit that could force policy makers to increase monetary and fiscal support for the economy. Cases of the virus are rising, the government’s plan to end its furlough program could cause a jump in unemployment, and a disruptive split from the European Union hangs over the outlook.
All sectors grew strongly in July, led by construction, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. But output is still 11.7% lower than it was in February, and analysts warn a return to pre-pandemic levels may be a long way off.Risks include mass job losses as government wage support is withdrawn; renewed curbs to tackle a recent spike in Covid-19 infections; and the end of the Brexit transition period. Firms will see the imposition of tariffs, quotas and customs checks unless Britain and the EU strike a trade deal before the end of the year.The GDP figures come in a week that saw the prospect of an agreement recede dramatically, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to break international law and re-write the divorce deal he struck last year. That has sent the pound lower in recent days.
Stimulus Pressure
The threats are piling pressure on officials in the U.K. to do more to shore up the economy. The Bank of England, which has expanded its asset-buying program and cut interest rates to near zero, has declared it has plenty of room to add monetary stimulus, even including negative rates if needed.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak meanwhile is facing calls to extend wage support for workers in the hardest-hit sectors. The fear is that well over a million people could lose their jobs if the program ends in October, as the government currently proposes.
The impact could derail the economy’s revival from its 22% contraction in the first half -- the deepest slump among major advanced economies.Recent activity reflects pent up demand and government stimulus such as a temporary tax cut on home-buying and subsidies for eating out during August.Such spending has pushed government debt above 2 trillion pounds ($2.6 trillion) for the first time. That’s affordable for now because of ultra-low borrowing costs, but Sunak has warned of “difficult decisions” ahead -- a hint that tax rises will be introduced once the economic crisis has abated.The dilemma of how to wind down aid, yet still support growth and contain the virus, is also playing out across Europe. Most governments oppose reinstating widespread lockdowns to control the pandemic again after severe restrictions earlier in the year pushed the continent into an unprecedented recession.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, ending the week by giving up earlier gains. Investors had turned to the safe-haven asset after U.S. markets saw yet another stocks selloff overnight.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.10% to 93.295 by 9:40 PM ET (2:40 AM GMT). The euro also seesawed, initially rising over comments made by European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the bank does not target exchange rates. But Lagarde’s comments contradicting her earlier statement as well as the exchange rate’s impact on inflation, saw a subsequent retreat to dollars and slump in the single currency.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.02% to 106.16.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.19% to 0.7269 and the NZD/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 0.6657. However, both risk currencies could fall a little further during the day amid the fragile investor sentiment, Westpac analysts said in a note.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.05% to 6.8371.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.03% to 1.2807. The pound faces further volatility, potentially its worst week since March, over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.
The European Union threatened legal action against the U.K., encouraging the latter to abandon plans announced earlier in the week to break the Brexit divorce treaty. But with the U.K.’s insistence on moving forward with draft legislation potentially breaking international law “in a limited way”, threatens to undo four years of negotiations between the two parties.
The pound, which has already grabbed headlines throughout the week, looks set to remain in the spotlight for a bit longer as the end-of-year Brexit deadline approaches.
“The high risk of no trade deal between the U.K. and E.U. is a major drag for the pound against most major currencies,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy told Reuters.
The ECB is set to release its outlook later in the day, with investors also looking to the U.K.’s GDP data as well as U.S. inflation for further guidance over the global economic recovery from COVID-19."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar clung to gains on Friday after a rout in stocks sent nervous investors to its safety, while sterling was poised for its worst week since March as British plans to break a divorce treaty with Europe rekindled the spectre of a no-deal Brexit.
In a volatile session overnight the pound languished while other majors whipsawed in tandem with moves in the euro and the U.S stock market.
The common currency <EUR=EBS at first zoomed 1% to $1.1917 after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde insisted the bank does not target the exchange rate.
But her subsequent remark that the bank indeed monitors it, and its effect on inflation - together with a tumble in U.S. stocks - brought investors rushing back to dollars and sank the euro back to $1.1825, where it sat in morning trade.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  tracked the move and was up as far as $0.7325 before retreating to $0.7263 early in the Asian session. The New Zealand dollar  fell to $0.6648 and was under gentle pressure on Friday.
Both could fall a little further during the day, Westpac analysts said, as the mood remains fragile and equities are likely to take the lead with little on the data tap in Asia.

The safe-haven Japanese yen  held steady at 106.12 per dollar, having inched higher overnight. Against a basket of currencies the dollar (=USD) hung on to modest gains and looks set to finish a second consecutive week ahead.
The main laggard has been the pound . It tested an overnight low of $1.2773 early in the Asia session and has lost 3.6% on the dollar this week and about as much against the euro (EURGBP=) as Brexit turmoil resurfaced.
The European Union told Britain on Thursday it should urgently scrap a plan to break their divorce treaty. But Britain has refused to budge and pressed ahead with a draft law that could sink four years of Brexit talks.
EU diplomats and officials said the bloc could take legal action against Britain, though that would not resolve anything before the end-of-year deadline for Britain's full exit, which is looking increasingly messy.
""The high risk of no trade deal between the UK and EU is a major drag for the pound against most major currencies,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy.

Investors are looking to a slew of ECB speakers later today for further guidance on the bank's outlook, as well as British GDP data and U.S. inflation for further clues to the progress of the global recovery from coronavirus lockdowns.

Ardern’s Labour Party would set aside 10% of New Zealand’s managed isolation capacity for critical workers to enter the country, Ardern said in a statement Friday. Her government would also seek to exploit New Zealand’s success in containing Covid-19 by targeting high-value international investment, she said.
“Careful management of our border, backed by one of the strictest managed isolation and quarantine systems in the world, has seen New Zealand keep Covid-19 contained at levels that only few countries have managed to achieve,” Ardern said. “It has given us the opportunity to capitalize on New Zealand’s strong record and reputation globally. We will ensure people with unique experience and technical or specialist skills that are not readily obtainable in New Zealand can enter the country safely.”
New Zealand succeeded in eliminating community transmission of the virus earlier this year. Its Covid-free run came to an end with new cases in largest city Auckland, but that outbreak now appears to have been contained. The election will be held on Oct. 17.
Only New Zealand citizens and residents can currently enter the country and they must serve two weeks in a managed isolation or quarantine facility. Almost 50,000 people have so far been through the facilities, which have capacity for about 14,000 a month.

Investing.com – The pound is on track for its biggest weekly slump in nearly six months Thursday as the EU threatened to pursue legal action against the U.K. if it doesn’t drop a bill that aims to undermine the Brexit divorce agreement.
GBP/USD fell 1.56% to $1.2799, and remains on track to post its largest weekly slump since March 15.
The EU demanded the U.K. drop its internal market bill by the end of the month or risk jeopardizing negotiations and legal action.
The bill, published on Wednesday, seeks to create common rules that apply across the whole of the U.K. including England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It would likely clash with key terms of the withdrawal agreement requiring that Northern Ireland, in the post-Brexit period, follow EU rules in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.  
Cabinet minister Michael Gove insisted the country will not withdraw the bill.
The acrimonious shift in relations comes just days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain would walk away from talks if there was no agreement in place by the Oct. 15 deadline, when European Council is set to convene.
With both sides seemingly content to dig in their heels, hopes of some progress in the latest round of trade talks are fading, while the prospect of the U.K. leaving the EU without a deal, a ""hard Brexit,"" grows by the day."

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed 0.6% lower in London, with mining and construction sectors pacing the drop. The euro rose 0.7% to $1.1880 after ECB President Christine Lagarde avoided expressing concern over the exchange rate, and stated repeatedly that the common currency was not a “policy target for us.” The FTSE 100 outperformed, down 0.2% as the pound sank against the U.S. dollar on fears of a no-deal Brexit.
“The ECB only gave a minor nod the euro’s appreciation, mentioning only that it is part of the flow of information that the ECB assesses,” said Joost van Leenders, senior investment strategist at Kempen Capital Management. “Lagarde stressed that the euro appreciation was discussed extensively during the Council meeting and pointed out that the exchange rate had not been mentioned in previous introductory statements, but this failed to turn market sentiment on the euro.”
That, combined with a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in Europe and the prospect of new pandemic-related restrictions, means investors are facing a dilemma over whether to take profit on the equity rally or to stay invested.
“Investors still have a lot of dry powder” said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Berenberg. “We are constructive for the remainder of the year and favor cyclical stocks and in particular European small caps.”
“The tech selloff was a healthy correction in my view given the fast and strong rise in August,” he said. “In the long run, tech stocks remain still very attractive for many investors given their strong earnings growth and that most of them are still supported by share buybacks compared to the rest of the market.”

Such an initiative may be critical to ensure the bloc isn’t left behind in the move to digital currencies and global changes in payments, she said in a virtual event with Germany’s Bundesbank Thursday evening. New technology could improve the efficiency of financial transactions and put Europe at the edge of innovation, but it can also bear risks.
“The Eurosystem has so far not made a decision on whether to introduce a digital euro. But, like many other central banks around the world, we are exploring the benefits, risks and operational challenges of doing so,” Lagarde said. “The findings of a Eurosystem task force are expected to be presented to the public in the coming weeks, followed by the launch of a public consultation.”
The ECB president added that while it’s not necessarily a concern that Europe is dominated by foreign payment service providers, the “evolving global context” and “increase in protectionist policies” presents new risks of disruptions to transactions.
“We have a responsibility to ensure that our citizens have choice and cannot be excluded from the payments ecosystem due to the unilateral actions of others,” she said.

Speaking after the ECB’s Governing Council decided to keep their pandemic bond-buying program unchanged at 1.35 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) and the deposit rate at -0.5%, Lagarde said the ECB will “careful assess incoming information, including developments in the exchange rate, with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.”

Bloomberg earlier reported that the Governing Council agreed to adopt a weaker phrasing about the euro’s appreciation than it did during the last bout of gains.
The single currency jumped to an intraday high, trading up 0.8% at $1.1902 at 2:54 p.m. Frankfurt time. That’s close to the two-year high it reached when it climbed above $1.20 last week.
The euro has soared more than 10% against the dollar since March, helping to depress prices by making imports cheaper. Inflation has turned negative for the first time in four years.
“The strength of the recovery remains surrounded by significant uncertainty as it continues to be highly dependent on the future evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies,” Lagarde said. “Clearly to the extent that the appreciation of the euro puts negative pressure on prices we have to monitor carefully such a matter, and this was extensively discussed.”
In a survey before Thursday’s decision, analysts predicted the ECB will increase its emergency bond plan by around 350 billion euros later this year and extend it by six months. The program is currently scheduled to run through June 2021.
Such a decision may need to overcome differences of opinion on the Governing Council. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and Estonian central-bank Governor Madis Muller have both said recently that emergency support must be withdrawn once the crisis has passed.
Chief Economist Philip Lane has stressed that the ECB is ready to do more if needed, and that once the economy has overcome the immediate shock of the coronavirus pandemic, and that fueling inflation be the next priority.

Investing.com -- The euro rose on Thursday after the European Central Bank chose not to revise down its longer-term forecasts for growth and inflation, while President Christine Lagarde said the eurozone economy is seeing a ""strong rebound"" after its collapse in the second quarter.
By the end of Lagarde's press conference at 9:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), the euro was at $1.1898, up 0.8% on the day.
Lagarde said in the introductory statement to her press conference that the rebound was proceeding in line with the bank's previous expectations. The bank now expects a slightly smaller drop in gross domestic product this year, of 'only' 8%. 
Answering questions later, she added that there had been no discussion of any possible increase to the 1.35 trillion bond-buying scheme that is the cornerstone of its response to the pandemic. However, she said that she expected the full ‘envelope’ of 1.35 trillion euros to be used. The so-called Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program is set to run through June of next year.
While saying that short-term price pressures were largely negative, the bank left unchanged its forecast for inflation in 2022, at 1.3%, a choice that suggested it saw no immediate need to ease its monetary policy any further. Some analysts had speculated that the bank could revise down its longer-dated forecasts, preparing the ground for a possible extra round of stimulus in the future.
""Clearly, there is no deflationary risk"" implied in the 2022 forecasts, Lagarde said in response to a subsequent question. 
Separately, newswires reported unnamed sources as saying that Lagarde had agreed that there was 'no need to over-react' to the euro's rally, which has taken it to its highest in over two years against the dollar.
There was no clear expression of concern in Lagarde's statement about the euro's strength, although she acknowledged it as one of a handful of factors putting downward pressure on prices in the short term. 
When pressed on the exchange rate later, Lagarde acknowledged somewhat more forcefully that: ""Obviously the appreciation of our currency has an impact"" on the medium-term outlook for inflation. ""The external value of the euro is an important element of price setting in the euro area.""
Analysts expressed concern at what appeared to some to be a distraction from the threat of too-low inflation. 
""The major risk coming into this press conference was downplaying low inflation and getting hung up on the Euro,"" said Robin Brooks, an economist with the Institute for International Finance in Washington. ""Unfortunately, it looks like that is playing out.""
Others were more sanguine, however.
""I don’t see anything particularly hawkish today in revising up the GDP forecast,"" said Gilles Moec, group chief economist with AXA, via Twitter. ""The ECB was significantly below consensus in June.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba will soon devalue the peso's one-to-one exchange rate with the U.S. dollar for the first time since the 1959 revolution, according to three sources who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.
As part of the reforms, due before the end of this year, authorities will also unify Cuba's two domestic currencies, according to two Cuban sources and a foreign businessman, all with some knowledge of the plan. 
The peso will be kept and the convertible peso, which is fixed on par with the dollar for state business but exchanged with the public at 24 pesos to buy and 25 pesos to sell, will be eliminated, the sources said.
Cuba's government has said it will respect the peso's current rate with the public for a time to allow residents to change their convertible pesos for pesos and do so automatically for convertible peso bank accounts. 
""The most important measure is going to be changing the official exchange rate used by the state companies,"" Omar Everleny, one of Cuba's best-known economists, told Reuters. 
""There are several proposals. It will never be one on one ... It is between 10 and up,"" he said.
The peso's value versus the Canadian dollar, euro and other convertible currencies also is expected to be adjusted downward based on international market rates. 
The Cuban economy is largely owned and run by the state, and exchange rates are set by the government.
The measures are part of a package of reforms aimed at fighting an economic crisis caused by tough U.S. sanctions under President Donald Trump and exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the bureaucratic inefficiency of the island's Soviet-style economy.
Shortages of basic goods have worsened this year, with long lines a common sight at many stores around the country. The closure of the tourist sector has left many Cubans without work, although flights from Canada resumed last week.
DOLLARS CIRCULATING
The government hinted in July it would adopt the monetary reforms and other measures such as loosening centralized planning and restrictions on small businesses, first called for by the Communist Party a decade ago.
According to the three sources, there will be a significant increase in state wages, pensions and prices due to the devaluation of the peso by as much as 95%, or to around 20 pesos to the dollar. 
Everleny said the devaluation meant companies would have much higher costs and prices would increase, requiring increased wages and pensions.
Economy and Planning Minister Alejandro Gil said in July that reforms were needed to stimulate exports and reduce imports as the local currency is not exchangeable on the international market to purchase goods and pay debt.
Experts forecast Cuba's economic activity will drop by nearly 10% this year, after stagnating in 2019. Government officials have admitted the lack of a convertible currency has forced postponement of debt payments and drastic cuts in fuel, food and other vital imports.
Economists have long argued that the one-to-one official exchange rate - as well as the different rate of the convertible peso and various exceptions by sector - have stymied exports and encouraged imports because a dollar earned is accounted for as a peso and vice versa, making it difficult to decipher if a company is profitable.
The government began allowing the dollar to circulate electronically with a bank card a year ago and is opening dollar stores offering everything from used cars and domestic appliances to food and hygiene products.
The sources said they expected the dollar stores to increase at least in the short term to provide stability and capture greenbacks to import goods.
Many Cubans receive hard currency from abroad and from servicing the tourism industry.

""The monetary reform is very close. This is the moment,"" said Everleny, who supports the measures even though he warned they could be traumatic for some.

Investing.com - The dollar slipped in early European trade Thursday, with the euro gaining ahead of greenback ahead of a policy meeting of the European Central Bank later in the session.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 93.090, with EUR/USD up 0.2% at 1.1829.
The euro has pushed higher, helped by Bloomberg News reporting that ECB officials are growing more confident in the bloc's economic outlook. However, EUR/USD remains some way below the 1.20 level it briefly touched last week before European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane’s comments that the exchange rate 'mattered' to monetary policy.
With this in mind, traders will be following this ECB meeting closely. While changes in interest rate policy are unlikely, Lane’s remarks suggest officials are growing uncomfortable with the euro's almost 6% appreciation against the dollar from its June low. The Financial Times reported that the ECB intends to insert a sentence about the exchange rate into the introductory statement at the start of Christine Lagarde's press conference, but gave few other details.
The ECB is under pressure again after Eurozone consumer prices turned negative in August for the first time since 2016, and the U.S. Federal Reserve changed its monetary policy strategy in such a way as to weaken the dollar further. 
“Despite a challenging economic outlook, we think the ECB will keep its monetary policy stance unchanged at the September meeting,” said analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a research note. “It is nonetheless likely to exhibit an explicitly dovish tone, notably aiming at talking down the EUR. We think further stimulus could come in December or later.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3022, recovering from a dip to a six-week low of $1.2839 on Wednesday, helped by the more risk-on tone seen in the equity markets, but EUR/GBP rose 0.1% to 0.9085, near to its six-week high.
The European Union is now studying the possibility of legal action against the U.K. over Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plans to breach the  'Withdrawal Agreement' that is the baseline for talks on the future trading relation between the two sides. 
This raises the possibility of the U.K. exiting the EU single market in four months time with no trade agreement in place. Negotiators are due to meet again on Thursday.
“The lack of risk premia priced in suggests further downside to the currency in coming weeks, particularly if little progress is made ahead of the 15 October deadline,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “The neutral speculative GBP positioning should also help to facilitate a move down in the currency as shorts are likely to build up as / if little progress is made in coming weeks.”

The carmaker is doing a multi-tranche deal including three-year and 10-year notes, according to people familiar with the matter. The Yokohama-based company has already received financial backing from the state-controlled Development Bank of Japan Inc., according to local media reports over the weekend, and in July priced 70 billion yen ($659 million) of notes in its home market.
Nissan, which allied with Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) in 1999 and later also with Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp., is cutting jobs and capacity as the pandemic hits demand, while seeking to revive an aging lineup and improve margins at the same time. For the current fiscal year through March, Nissan is forecasting a 470 billion yen operating loss.
The automaker has been mired in turmoil since the 2018 arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. The company’s ratings have also suffered and S&P Global Ratings cut Nissan’s credit score to just one level above junk in July.
The three-year notes are being marketed at an initial price guidance of about 325 basis points over Treasuries, and 10-year bond at 437.5 to 450 basis points, according to the people. The benchmark-sized deal also includes five-year and seven-year securities.

310,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson’s government published legislation Wednesday allowing it to re-write parts of the Brexit divorce deal it signed with the European Union last year. The move to tear up part of an international treaty has sparked consternation in Brussels and could scupper efforts to secure a key trade agreement between the two sides. It puts Britain at risk of becoming a “rogue state,” according to Ian Blackford, a Scottish lawmaker.
Here’s why the new law is so controversial.
Will the U.K. break international law?
Yes, the government says. It is seeking power to undo sections of the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement it signed with the EU in January.
Crucially, the bill states it will “have effect notwithstanding inconsistency or incompatibility with international or other domestic law.”
Senior Conservatives have warned that reneging on an international treaty could damage the U.K.’s standing in other disputes overseas, including with China over its imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong.
What specifically has Johnson done?
He is rowing back from the policies affecting Northern Ireland he signed up to as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The protocol is designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, at the cost of creating a customs border in the Irish Sea.
The Internal Market Bill will give U.K. ministers powers to:
These three issues are highly sensitive for the EU and, prior to Johnson’s intervention, were still being thrashed out in joint discussions. The bloc is particularly concerned that goods could enter its single market unchecked via the 310-mile land border with Northern Ireland. It’s also worried that U.K. subsidies will put EU firms at a competitive disadvantage.
How has the EU reacted so far?
With measured anger. The EU has called for emergency talks, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the move “undermines trust.” The question now is whether it will poison the wider trade negotiations between the U.K. and the bloc. Expect Michel Barnier to comment on the legislation when the latest round of discussions break up later this week.
What more could the EU do?
It could refer a breach of the Withdrawal Agreement to a tribunal and ultimately the European Court of Justice. While such a dispute would last years, a finding in favor of the EU would allow the bloc to suspend any provision of any treaty it has with Britain.
The EU already sees a case for opening infringement proceedings, according to a preliminary analysis of the U.K. bill.
Why Is Johnson taking such a risk?
Johnson has repeatedly said that trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain must be unfettered after Brexit, and he sees this move as necessary to secure that goal. If the U.K. and EU don’t come to an agreement by the year-end, all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain may have to pay tariffs, a situation the U.K. government says is unacceptable.
But the prime minister also wants to break away from the EU’s state aid rules -- a position that has become the biggest obstacle to reaching a wider accord with the bloc over their future relationship.
Downing Street is concerned that the Northern Ireland protocol could threaten its plans to provide state aid to British businesses. Potentially, the EU could block a subsidy to a company in England, Wales or Scotland on the grounds it might help or hurt a business in Northern Ireland, which will still have to follow the bloc’s state aid rules after Dec. 31.
It could also be a negotiating tactic to encourage the EU to back down from its demand that the U.K. sign up to its state aid rules in return for any trade accord.
Could Parliament stop him?
Unlikely, given that Johnson enjoys an 80-seat majority in the House of Commons. But he could face a fight in the House of Lords. Former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine told Times Radio on Wednesday the legislation hasn’t got “a ghost of a chance” of being approved by the upper chamber -- but it doesn’t have an absolute veto; under the Parliament Act, it can only delay legislation approved by the House of Commons for a year.
Could he face a legal challenge in the U.K.?
It’s unlikely, at least in the immediate future. One of the key lawyers who brought the successful challenge against Johnson’s plan to suspend -- or prorogue -- Parliament last year, say it would be harder this time. Jolyon Maugham said Britain’s unwritten constitution rests upon the concept of parliamentary sovereignty. If lawmakers approve the legislation, the judiciary’s ability to get involved is “very limited indeed, if not non-existent,” Maugham said.
Gina Miller, a campaigner who has successfully challenged the government over Brexit in the courts, said she is on “high alert,” speaking on ITV’s “Peston.” But she also said she is waiting to see what happens, and the government may just be posturing.
Another route might be to question whether any breach of international law infringes the Ministerial Code, the standards of conduct that all government ministers must adhere to. That rulebook is, however, enforced by the prime minister.
What else is in the Internal Market Bill?
The draft law also contains measures to prevent trade barriers being erected within the U.K. after Brexit. When Britain was in the EU, policy areas that were devolved to the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland broadly had to follow EU law. Out of the bloc and able to exercise their powers, Westminster faced the prospect of the different nations setting their own rules -- something which could inhibit internal trade. Blackford’s Scottish National Party, which campaigns for independence, has already criticized the bill as an attack on devolution.

311,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Philippine borrowers are looking to raise fewer bonds overseas in the coming months, taking away a pillar of strength for the peso.
The peso led the advance among Asian currencies this year with 4.1% gains as the nation’s borrowers raised a record $11.4 billion dollars via international bond sales in 2020. However, the tide is turning as cheaper funding costs in the domestic market keeps borrowers from venturing abroad.
Overseas borrowings are one of the factors that have made the peso Asia’s best performing currency this year, said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. “We’re not seeing that next year, and if imports rise as the domestic economy recovers, the peso could go back to 50 per dollar next year.”
San Miguel Corp., is prioritizing the local market for fund-raising. “The peso’s strength all the more makes it more prudent to borrow from the domestic market,” Eduardo Edeza, treasury head at the Philippines’ largest company, said in a mobile-phone message. The peso is hovering around a four-year high of 48.48 per dollar recorded on Sept. 1.
The government also pared its foreign-currency funding plan for 2021 to 15% of its borrowing needs from 25% this year.
That’s bad news for the peso as some of the funds repatriated from offshore bond sales contribute to foreign inflows into the country. “It’s a factor but not the main one,” Jun Trinidad, a consultant for market strategy at Union Bank of the Philippines said, referring to foreign bond sales. The currency may remain supported if demand-driven consumption stays weak, he said.
In a sign of comfort with the currency’s gains, Philippine central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said late last month that the peso’s performance has helped keep import costs low and that the currency could benefit as coronavirus curbs are eased and the economy further reopens.

312,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s latest threat to bar companies with ties to U.S. officials who visit Taiwan points to a weakness for Beijing in its sanctions battle with Washington: It can control its own borders, but the greenback rules the world.
In recent months, the Trump administration has levied sanctions against more than a dozen Chinese officials and restricted access to scores of the country’s companies. The penalties have caused credit card headaches for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper, forced the former British colony’s police credit union to relocate an estimated $1.4 billion of assets to Chinese banks.
Meanwhile, the “firm countermeasures” that Beijing has threatened against U.S. officials including Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas have yet to be felt across the Pacific. None of the dozen American individuals sanctioned since July have received notice of what the penalties would entail, other than the assumption that they wouldn’t be welcomed in China.
“I wear it as a badge of honor, but Beijing’s actions don’t have any impact on me,” said Rubio, a frequent China critic who has been named in sanctions announcements twice this summer.
While China has calibrated its response to minimize the risk of further escalation by President Donald Trump, it’s also limited by the U.S. dollar’s dominance in international finance. The greenback accounted for almost 40% of all SWIFT transactions in July, compared with less than 2% for the renminbi, as the Communist Party resists calls to ease currency controls. That makes it more difficult for multinational banks -- including China’s state-run lenders -- to avoid compliance with U.S. sanctions.
The U.S.’s dollar advantage could become even more important if the Trump administration sanctions financial institutions in Hong Kong as authorized by congressional legislation in July, or takes direct action against Chinese banks. Beijing’s strongest weapon remains blocking access to its vast market: Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the party’s Global Times newspaper, said Wednesday such a move was being considered for companies with ties to U.S. officials who visit Taiwan.
“China doesn’t have too many tools to implement the sanctions because the U.S. payment system is so prolific and pervasive,” said Edwin Lai, a Hong Kong University of Science and Technology economics professor who specializes in renminbi internationalization. “China is disadvantaged in the sanctions game because its payment system is underdeveloped and yuan internationalization is decades away.”
The U.S.’s financial sanctions also carry fewer risks of backfiring than China’s usual tactic of cutting off market access. The Chinese economy is still reliant on foreign investment and Beijing is wary of moves that could scare off multinationals and scuttle its phase-one trade deal with Trump. Chinese diplomats have in recent weeks expressed a desire to de-escalate tensions ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
Both sides have so far steered clear of sanctioning top officials, with Trump ruling out measures against potential targets including Vice Premier Han Zheng, people familiar with the matter said in July. While the U.S. has penalized Lam and Politburo member Chen Quanguo over alleged human rights violations, China has targeted lower-level officials such as Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and six members of Congress.
Cruz spokeswoman Maria Jeffrey said the exchange showed that the U.S. has a much stronger sanctions framework, including having a procedure for notifying people that they’ve been targeted. “I guess he can’t go there anymore,” Jeffrey said. “When we ban someone from visas, there’s a human whose job it is to send them a letter saying, ‘Don’t bother coming.’”
The latest U.S. decision to sanction 24 Chinese companies over their alleged roles building military facilities in the disputed South China Sea signals further expansion of the strategy. Major lenders with operations in the U.S., including the Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp., and China Merchants Bank Co., have taken tentative steps to comply with U.S. sanctions.
Yuan Overhaul
Further escalation could involve seizures of U.S.-based assets, Yu Yongding, a senior fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told a forum organized by the Beijing News newspaper on Aug. 12. “This possibility can’t be ruled out,” Yu said, citing penalties imposed on the Bank of Kunlun in 2012 over Iran ties.
The U.S. also has the nuclear option of cutting China off from the U.S. dollar system, said Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China and north Asia at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which would leave China unable conduct any transactions in dollars. This option was unlikely to materialize given the financial damage it would cause to U.S. companies based in China and Hong Kong, Shuang said.
“The danger of this occurring is one of the key reasons that China may accelerate the renminbi internationalization,” Shuang said. “U.S.-China tensions targeting the financial industry has been the catalyst in re-accelerating the momentum for renminbi internalization.”
China has other tools to deploy, if ties deteriorate badly enough to justify broader economic damage, including unloading Treasuries or blocking exports of rare earths and other key manufacturing components. Beijing could also roll back cooperation on sanctions against North Korea and Iran.
For China to gain global financial leverage, it needs to open its capital account to encourage greater use of the yuan, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The cost would be giving investors some ability to influence China’s exchange rates.
“Until Beijing changes the underlying calculus, China will not be able to incorporate financial restrictions into its coercive diplomacy toolkit,” Kennedy said.

Investing.com – The euro eased from highs against the dollar Wednesday, as sentiment on the single currency remains cautious on concerns the European Central Bank is set to jawbone the currency lower in its latest policy update and economic outlook due Thursday.
EUR/USD rose 0.20% to $1.1802, easing from session highs of $1.1831.
The European Central Bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark rate on hold at 0.00% and its deposit rate unchanged at 0.50%.  
But because of concerns over the slowing pace of the recovery in the wake of resurgent Covid-19 cases, and the threat a surge in the euro poses to inflation, the central bank could put out the welcome mat for further easing down the road.
A stronger currency generally weighs on export growth and curbs import prices, leading to a slowdown in inflation.  
“In June, the ECB expected an inflation rate of 1.3% for 2022. Any downward revision will increase the likelihood of additional monetary stimulus,” ING said in a note.
The strength of the euro has already caught the bank’s attention. Just over a week ago, ECB's Chief Economist Philip Lane said that the euro’s level ""does matter"" for monetary policy.  
“There seems to be little doubt that a resolutely dovish tone will be struck at the (ECBP) meeting  … with President Christine Lagarde expected to once again remind markets that it remains ready to loosen monetary policy whenever it will think appropriate” ING added."

LONDON (Reuters) - A stronger Japanese yen was the product of a build-up of worries in financial markets on Wednesday, after U.S. tech stocks sold off the previous day and a leading coronavirus vaccine candidate faced delay. 
The U.S. dollar also found some support as the stock market slide spooked investors into selling riskier currencies, while worries about the fate of Brexit talks pushed the pound down to a new six-week low.
In the early European session the dollar was mostly steady, pulling back from early gains against most majors as U.S. equity futures pared losses - with Nasdaq 100 futures (NQc1) swinging to trade 0.4% higher and S&P 500 futures (ESc1) rising 0.6%.
AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) said it had paused global trials, including large late-stage trials, of its experimental coronavirus vaccine due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
Roll-out of an effective vaccine is seen as key for economies to overcome the effects of the pandemic.
""Positioning in FX and other asset classes had been biased towards 'risk on', higher equity prices, steeper yield curves and a weaker dollar.  A lot of that positioning is now simply getting walked back and tweaked as we enter the 'autumn crunch',"" said Stephen Gallo, currency analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
Traders, returning from summer holidays, are faced with a bouquet of risk factors as they enter the autumn period of trading - the U.S. election in November, Brexit, U.S.-China trade tensions, central bank policy decisions, rising cases of the coronavirus - many of which would dent the appetite for riskier assets and inject strength into safe-havens.
Gallo, however, does not ""yet think this move lower in the dollar is a complete shift in the downward trend, but we will continue to watch it very closely,"" he said. The dollar has been sliding since March.
Euro/dollar was last trading steady at $1.1772 (EUR=EBS), having fallen earlier to a near three-week low of $1.1757 as the dollar rose. 
Dollar/Japanese yen fell 0.1% at 105.92  after touching an eight-day low of 105.78.
Investors await Thursday's European Central Bank meeting with some trepidation.
The common currency has lost about 2% since posting a 28-month high above $1.20 on Sept. 1, spurred lower by comments from ECB chief economist Philip Lane who said the exchange rate mattered to monetary policy.
Any hint of concern at the currency's rise, or that low inflation will require ultra-easy policy for a very long time could whack the euro lower again and boost the dollar.
""Lane appears to have succeeded in drawing a line in the sand at $1.20 at least for the time being,"" said Rabobank senior FX strategist Jane Foley. ""We see scope that euro/dollar could dip further towards the $1.17 level on a one-month view.""
An overnight slump in the oil price dragged down oil exporters' currencies. The Norwegian crown  extended an overnight fall to hit a more than six-week low of 9.1810 per dollar and was last down 0.3% at 9.1205.
The Canadian dollar  dropped to a three-week low, though steadied in European trading ahead of a Bank of Canada policy decision due at 1400 GMT. Investors expect no changes to interest rates and will focus on the tone around the outlook.
Sterling was unable to shake pressure as fears grow that Britain is preparing to undercut its Brexit divorce treaty. It dipped 0.3% to $1.2948 , after touching its lowest since July 29. The pound also languished at a six-week low of 91.06 pence against the euro (EURGBP=D3).

Britain will set out its blueprint for life outside the European Union on Wednesday, publishing legislation a government minister acknowledged would break international law in a ""limited way"".

Investing.com - The dollar gained in early European trade Wednesday, with the sharp selloff in U.S. equity markets prompting traders to ditch riskier currencies in favor of the world's reserve currency. 
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.562. The index has risen just short of 1% over the last week, climbing from the more than two-year lows it touched earlier in the month.
""The tech selloff has caught the market by surprise and it is a bit jittery as to whether there are broader implications,"" said Bank of Singapore currency analyst Moh Siong Sim, in a Reuters report.
""It might force some position unwinding in other parts of the market, and that's probably what we're seeing right now,"" he said.
EUR/USD slipped 0.1% to 1.1768, continuing to retreat from the 1.20 level it briefly touched last week before European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane’s comments that the exchange rate mattered to monetary policy.
With this in mind, Thursday’s ECB meeting looms large, with investors looking to closely monitor any comments on the euro given it has still risen 10% since coronavirus lockdowns started in March, even with the recent retreat.
“We think it is too early for the ECB to forcefully talk down the euro this week,” analysts at ING said, in a research note. “We don’t look for Trichet-like comments on a ‘brutal’ EUR appreciation. Rather, President Christine Lagarde may highlight that the central bank monitors the euro closely while reiterating that the exchange rate isn't seen as a target.”
Elsewhere, worries about Brexit trade negotiations have pushed the pound down to levels last seen at the end of July. GBP/USD dipped 0.4% to $1.2939, while EUR/GBP rose 0.3% to 0.9093.
Britain will set out its blueprint for life outside the European Union later Wednesday, publishing legislation a government minister acknowledged would break international law in a ""specific and limited way"".
This is unlikely to be received favorably in European circles, increasing the likelihood of a messy end to the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year.
“While we still see an above 50% probability of a deal, the lack of risk premia priced in suggests further downside to the currency in coming weeks, particularly if little progress is made ahead of the 15 October deadline,” said ING, in a research note.

316,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey can capitalize on the legacy of this year’s global health crisis by putting a competitive lira at the heart of a new strategy to move toward a more export-focused economy, according to Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak.
Albayrak said Turkey expects a spurt of economic growth in 2021. The lira, down over 20% against the dollar this year, may give Turkey an edge as it looks to reboot an economy long vulnerable to imbalances.
“A key objective of our economic program is to have a balanced current account in the medium term and reduce reliance on foreign financing,” Albayrak said in response to emailed questions from Bloomberg.
“We’re going to achieve this by increasing our exports and tourism income, domestically producing the goods and services that are being imported, raising our savings rate, channeling most of our resources to production and maintaining a competitive foreign-exchange rate policy,” he said.
By looking to turn the lira to its advantage, Turkey is staking out a path to recovery just as speculation builds across the global economy that a fresh currency war might be on the horizon. Albayrak’s vision reflects ambitions of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government to prioritize local production in some goods over imports in recent years. Such programs include Turkey’s plans to develop its own car and produce all building materials for housing domestically.
Albayrak said last month that Turkey’s economy will likely fare better than many of its peers this year, estimating its performance at between a contraction of 2% to a 1% gain. Before the health emergency, the government set the goal of 5% for 2020-2022.
Topping 5%
“Our growth rate will be significantly above 5% in 2021 if there won’t be another major wave in the outbreak,” the minister said. Additionally, “more good news may come soon” after the recent gas discovery in the Black Sea, he said.

Albayrak, who’s been in the job since a cabinet reshuffle in 2018, also signaled backing for the central bank, which has tried to stabilize the lira in recent weeks.
While avoiding an outright interest-rate hike, policy makers have started tightening liquidity by using fringe tools and ceasing to provide funding at their cheapest rate. Inflation picked up less than forecast in August. It remains close to an annual 12%.
The central bank’s reliance on liquidity tools will be effective in limiting price growth and “inflation will return to a deceleration path in the upcoming period,” Albayrak said.
Borrowing Program
The focus on protecting the economy this year has forced a change in the borrowing strategy just as Turkey faced an outflow of foreign capital.
The Treasury has significantly increased its hard-currency borrowing in the domestic market instead of raising money abroad. It hasn’t sold a 10-year lira bond in over two years.
Albayrak said the approach may soon change and the Treasury plans to restart its sales of five- and 10-year lira securities. The ministry recently announced that it’s planning to offer 10-year fixed-coupon bonds on Nov. 17.
Turkey also hasn’t revised this year’s target for borrowing $9 billion from international markets, Albayrak said.
“We’ll continue to take advantage of good opportunities with regards to price dynamics just as we did in the past,” he said.

317,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro’s rally to a two-year high is making European Central Bank policy makers nervous, and putting investors and economists on the lookout for some kind of intervention.
The currency’s 10% jump since coronavirus lockdowns started in March makes ECB President Christine Lagarde’s job harder by putting downward pressure on inflation. Combined with signs that the economic recovery is slowing, it boosts the case for more monetary stimulus.
Such action looks unlikely when the Governing Council sets policy on Thursday, but Lagarde and her colleagues might decide to start laying the groundwork in case they do need to act. Here are some of the options:
Talk It Down
While the ECB repeatedly says it doesn’t target the exchange rate, policy makers know their words can have an effect. After the euro rose above $1.20 last week, chief economist Philip Lane knocked it back by saying it “does matter” for monetary policy.
The single currency dropped for six straight days through Tuesday to below $1.18, though Bloomberg’s options pricing model points to a greater chance that it will trade above $1.22 in the next three months, than below $1.14.
Economists at banks including  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. say Lagarde may emulate Lane after Thursday’s meeting. Her predecessor, Mario Draghi, made multiple verbal interventions.
“For now I think they’ll stick with jawboning,” said Charles Diebel, a money manager at Mediolanum International Funds. “But the euro level is important in terms of European recovery prospects so ultimately they will have to take it into account and respond.”
Signal More Easing
Lagarde may even want to hint at what the ECB would do. She might link the currency’s impact on inflation to the possibility of stepping up the pace of the 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program, says Gilles Moec, chief economist at Axa SA. Another option could be to note the potential for an interest-rate reduction.
“The chances are rising that Lagarde floats a rate cut as a policy option as soon as this week,” said Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist for Pictet & Cie.
Cut the Deposit Rate
No economists expect lower rates this week, but money-market traders this week priced in a 10 basis-point cut in the deposit rate to minus 0.6% for September next year. Two months ago, they weren’t forecasting such a step until 2022 at the earliest.
Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho International Plc, expects the move by the second quarter of next year.
“By that time the euro will have exceeded $1.30,” he predicted. “The loss of export competitiveness and dis-inflationary dynamics will at that point justify it.”
Cut Targeted Long-Term Rates
The ECB didn’t join in with the wave of rate cuts during the pandemic. Its deposit rate has been at a record-low minus 0.5% for a year, since the final weeks of Draghi’s tenure.
Lagarde’s Governing Council seems more sensitive to the risk that the policy -- a charge paid by banks on the deposits they keep at the ECB -- squeezes lenders’ profit margins so much that it disrupts credit supply.
Officials have another option though, thanks totheir recent innovation: Dual rates.
Under new terms announced in March for its targeted long-term loans, the ECB will give banks cash for as little as minus 1%, on condition they lend it on to companies and households. That more than offsets the negative deposit rate.
Economists Eric Lonergan of M&G Investments and Megan Greene of Harvard Kennedy School wrote last week that the policy means “monetary stimulus has no practical limit” because rates can be cut without damaging the banking system.
“It could also be easier to sell to less-dovish members of the Governing Council,” said Anders Svendsen, chief analyst at Nordea A/S in Copenhagen.
Avoid a Currency War
Whatever policy makers do, they’ll be careful to describe their actions in terms of the outlook for inflation, rather than the exchange rate.
Major economies have long agreed not to indulge in competitive devaluations, and U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently accused the ECB of keeping the euro artificially low to aid exporters.
“It could not focus any action on the currency,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “This would immediately trigger a backlash from the U.S. administration and risk a currency war.”

319,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As New Zealand’s central bank prepares plans for taking interest rates negative to support its recession-hit economy, Sweden’s experience is emerging as the most relevant guide.The Reserve Bank is studying the other countries that have employed negative rates and the Scandinavian kingdom -- a small, open economy like New Zealand -- is drawing particular attention. Sweden’s Riksbank imposed negative rates for five years to head off the threat of deflation.
The controversial monetary policy tool has been used by only a handful of central banks in Europe and Japan. Australia’s Reserve Bank is cool on the idea, but there is renewed interest internationally as policy makers seek new ways to bolster their virus-battered economies.
Negative rates were successful in Sweden because they achieved the aim of returning inflation to target without causing any significant distortions in the economy, said Lars Svensson, an economics professor in Stockholm and a former deputy governor at the Riksbank.
“The short answer is that negative rates worked well, in that the pass-through to market interest rates was over time almost one-to-one,” Svensson said in an emailed response to questions. “I agree with the assessment of our supervisory authority that the risks to financial stability associated with household indebtedness are relatively small.”
RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr has warned of the dangers posed by “low inflation or deflation” and expressed a preference for negative rates combined with loans to banks to get borrowing costs lower if required. The aim would be to push wholesale bond yields and swap rates negative, dragging retail rates closer to zero and thereby stimulating greater demand for debt.
Most economists expect the RBNZ to cut its official cash rate to minus 0.25% or minus 0.5% by April next year, and some see the chance of an earlier move. Orr is expected to provide an update on the RBNZ’s plans in his Monetary Policy Statement in November.
The RBNZ said it’s in constant communication with other central banks as it prepares a package of additional stimulus measures and declined to comment further.
The Swedish Experience
On the opposite side of the globe, Sweden provides a roadmap for what may be in store. There are some obvious similarities between the two export-reliant nations. Both have small populations -- about 10 million in Sweden and 5 million in New Zealand -- and currencies that are among the 10 most-traded in the world.
The Riksbank sent its policy rate into negative territory in early 2015, reaching a low of minus 0.5% before raising it back to zero late last year.
Swedish mortgage rates dropped below 2%, causing house prices to surge to double-digit annual gains, but unemployment fell and the economy grew. Crucially, headline inflation rose steadily from minus 0.4% in mid-2015 to meet the central bank’s 2% target two years later. Inflation expectations also rose.
While central banks in Denmark, Switzerland, the euro area and Japan are all using negative interest rates, the policy isn’t without side effects. Very low rates squeeze lending margins, reducing profitability for banks, and can pose threats to financial stability by incentivising riskier investments.
In Sweden, the subzero-regime was advantageous for borrowers but brutal for the country’s pension industry, which struggled to generate the returns needed when government bond yields turned negative.
‘Risky Experiment’
That could also become an issue for New Zealand entities, such as the government-owned insurer Accident Compensation Corp., which need to generate returns on pooled funds to cover future claims, said Jarrod Kerr, chief economist at Kiwibank in Auckland.
“The economy is simply not in a bad enough place to justify the risky experiment that is negative rates,” said Kerr. “The distortions thrown up by negative rates more than offset the stimulatory benefit.”
Svensson said negative rates weren’t without controversy in Sweden. There was “quite a bit of misleading and unsubstantiated criticism” of the policy setting, including gripes about a weaker currency that made trips abroad more expensive.
“Critics were upset by the weak krona, not understanding that the weak krona was an inherent part of the transmission of expansionary monetary policy,” he said.
The prospect of negative rates in New Zealand has kept a lid on its currency in recent months. The kiwi dollar is up about 16% against the weaker greenback since its March low compared with almost 26% for the Aussie dollar.

Johnson has said there would need to be an agreement in place by the Oct. 15 deadline, when European Council is set to convene,  or warned that the U.K. would walk away from the negotiating table.
The tough talk is feared to be more than a negotiating tactic, as the U.K. has already angered EU members by unveiling plans to introduce a law that seeks to undermine the withdrawal agreement, which has already been signed into law and sets out the terms of the U.K.'s exit from the EU.  
The internal market bill, which aims to create common rules that apply across the whole of the U.K., could clash with terms of the withdrawal agreement requiring that Northern Ireland, in the post-Brexit period, follow EU rules in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.  
The seemingly controversial move by the U.K. comes as post-Brexit talks are to resume with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who is arriving in London on Tuesday. The EU has said it will be ready for a no-deal Brexit when the transition period ends on Dec. 31. 
""No deal is the most possible and probable and only outcome of the negotiations,"" warned former president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker."
321,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- There is new evidence that the once-mighty dollar effect -- when markets traded everything in relation to the U.S. currency -- has faded.
The 120-day rolling correlation between gold and a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) gauge of emerging-market dollar bonds has fallen below zero for the first time since July 2016. That means the two assets have stopped responding in similar ways to the gyrations in the dollar.
For years, investors traded both gold and emerging-market bonds as dollar-denominated assets, taking the correlation coefficient between them to as high as 0.54 in February this year. With sentiment depending on the dollar’s direction at any point, this overrode the normal expectation that a riskier asset like emerging-market debt should move differently from a haven like gold.
But the dollar’s rebound this month from a 28-month low is failing to signal a risk-off shift in global markets. The selloff in stocks is, by and large, concentrated in the technology and consumer-discretionary sectors, allowing old-age industries like commodities to outperform.
This has resulted in the gold rally looking tired and ripe for a correction. The precious metal was heading for four-week low Tuesday, declining even in the face of renewed tensions between the U.S. and China.
Meanwhile, emerging-market bonds are extending their gains to a sixth month, halving their average yield since March to 4%. Expectations for a growth rebound in Asian economies, easing of debt-distress bets and central-bank liquidity are driving the rally.

322,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s hard-line negotiating tactics with the European Union are once again unsettling U.K. markets.
The pound slumped for a fifth day, the longest losing streak since May, and weakened as much as 1.1% to $1.3022. Money market traders are stepping up bets on negative interest rates and the FTSE 100 Index dipped 0.4%.
Johnson has threatened to walk away from Brexit talks without a new trade deal, despite warnings that a hard split would cripple economic growth. Investors were also spooked by comments from the Bank of England’s chief economist in support of ending the wage-support programs.
“The tense start to the next round of Brexit negotiations has provided the main catalyst for the move,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of foreign-exchange strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “There remain underlying concerns about the strength and sustainability of the U.K.’s recovery.”
Money markets are betting the central bank will cut rates by 12 basis points in May, which would push them into negative territory. As recently as Monday, traders were factoring in rates remaining above zero for as late as September 2021.
Currency option prices signal that traders are concerned about the pound over year-end when the Brexit transition period will expire. Bearish bets over the next three months have risen by the most since mid March.
Heightened tension between the U.K. and the EU is also driving investors to seek the safety of government debt. On Tuesday, Britain held its first syndicated debt offering since June. The country’s 15-year debt attracted bids in excess of 76 billion pounds ($99 billion), according to a person familiar with the sale, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak about it.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher in early European trade Tuesday, with sterling nursing losses as uncertainty over the likelihood of a post-Brexit trade deal grows.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.4% at 93.062. 
Fresh negotiations between the EU and the U.K. over a potential trade deal are set to start again later Tuesday, but the U.K. lit the touchpaper over the weekend by threatening to undermine the exit agreement unless free trade terms are agreed by next month. 
Talks have been at an impasse for months over two key issues - state aid and fisheries.
“The Brexit heat is back on and sterling is, in our view, unprepared. We estimate that there is no risk premium priced into the currency, while speculative positioning is neutral. Both should facilitate GBP's downside this month as negative headline news likely gains traction,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
U.K.-focused equity funds saw record outflows of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.58 billion) over the past three months as investors worry about a no-deal Brexit and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, data from fund network Calastone showed on Tuesday.
By 2:55 AM ET, GBP/USD had dropped 0.1% to 1.3148, and EUR/GBP had risen 0.2% at 0.8988.
Additionally, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1813 as investors look ahead to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting later this week amid growing expectation of a dovish message.
Most analysts don't expect a change in the central bank's policy stance, but are looking to the message on its inflation forecasts and whether it seems concerned by the euro's strength - especially after the single currency posted a two-year high just above $1.20 at the beginning of the month.
“Our baseline is no new actions yet next week, but it is a close call and risks are clearly skewed towards more easing,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “We also believe the ECB will go a long way to prevent a repeat of the disappointing March meeting and will bring loads of promises of action to come, if not concrete actions.”
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was largely flat at 106.24, after Japan's economy shrank an annualised 28.1% in the second quarter, more than a preliminary reading of a 27.8% contraction.
Additionally, Yoshihide Suga, the frontrunner to succeed incumbent Shinzo Abe as prime minister in leadership elections scheduled for the following week, has  hinted at snap elections.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady on Tuesday as investors weighed whether an accommodative turn from the European Central Bank later this week could hit the euro, while the pound nursed losses due to Brexit uncertainty.
A day after thin holiday trade, the greenback was slightly stronger against a basket of currencies (=USD) at 93.128 and firmed marginally against the euro (EUR=EBS) at $1.1809.
Moves in the Asian day were modest, but had the dollar back under gentle pressure as risk appetite appeared to return to equity markets. [MKTS/GLOB]
The Australian dollar  stood at $0.7276 and the New Zealand dollar  was little changed at $0.6685, having hit lows overnight following a Sunday statement from the central bank which again raised the prospect of negative rates. [AUD/]
The main focus this week is on the European Central Bank's policy decision on Thursday.
Most analysts don't expect a change in the central bank's policy stance but are looking to the message on its inflation forecasts and whether it seems concerned by the euro's strength.
The meeting comes after the single currency marked a two-year high just above $1.20 at the beginning of the month, until comments about its level from ECB chief economist Philip Lane knocked it lower.
""The ECB could raise more concerns over a further appreciation in the euro and make some downward revisions to its inflation projections,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy, which would flag easier policy.
""In our view, the dollar can lift further over the remainder of the week because of the possibility the ECB takes a sharper dovish turn.""
Elsewhere, the dollar traded firmly against the Japanese yen amid talk of a snap election - something that Yoshihide Suga, frontrunner to succeed Shinzo Abe in next week's leadership ballot - signalled in a newspaper interview.
Analysts say many currency market participants no longer consider the leadership race as a catalyst, as the next leader is likely to follow Abe's policy path.
""Around eight years ago (when Abe took over), the yen was stronger at around 70 per dollar. But with the current dollar/yen level, there's nothing much the successor can do currency-wise,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market strategist at Mizuho Bank. 
""The stronger local equity market should be more of a concern instead,"" he said.
The yen  last changed hands at 106.29 per dollar.
The British pound , meanwhile, was the laggard amid a fresh crisis in EU-UK trade negotiations. [GBP/]
A Financial Times report suggesting Britain might legislate to override its Brexit withdrawal agreement prompted the EU to warn there would be no deal if that happened, raising the prospect again of a hard Brexit.
New talks are due to begin in London later on Tuesday.
The pound edged 0.2% lower to $1.3146, after shedding 0.8% overnight, and sat a fraction above a two-week low against the euro at 89.76 pence (EURGBP=).
Some traders also sold sterling against the yen (GBPJPY=), last traded at 139.63, hovering near a two-week low of 139.58 it hit in the previous session. 
""The key question for markets is whether the remarks are still mostly brinkmanship as negotiations near the finish line,"" said NAB economics director Tapas Strickland. ""The mild market reaction suggests markets think so and still sniff a deal.""
Meanwhile, data in Australia showed employment eased over the month to Aug. 22, while last month's business confidence gained but remained fragile.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 28.1% in April-June, worse than the initial estimate of a 27.8% contraction, revised data from the Cabinet Office showed on Tuesday.

Final European GDP figures are due later in the day.

325,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s looking good for the U.K.’s first bond sale through banks since June, not least because of the latest saga in trade talks between the nation and European Union.
This week’s offering of 15-year debt should attract investors seeking safety in sovereign securities amid concern Britain is headed for a no-deal Brexit, according to ING Bank NV. The prospect of increased bond buying by the Bank of England by year-end should also spur demand, said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at the bank.
Benchmark U.K. gilts gained Monday following a report suggesting Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s administration is preparing to end the Brexit transition period without an economic agreement with the EU. Last week, BOE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden told lawmakers that the central bank has the capacity to increase the pace and size if needed.
“On the one hand, the last BOE meeting boosted market hopes of another round of quantitative easing and seemed to downplay the odds of negative rates,” Bouvet said. “On the other, the approaching Brexit deadline and trash talking ahead of the next round of negotiations is dampening risk appetite,” prompting investors to favor safer assets, he said.
Record Borrowing
Such conditions look set to spur a narrowing of the yield premium on longer-maturity gilts over shorter-dated ones -- and that prospect should support demand at the planned issuance, he added. The sale may be held as early as Tuesday.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc estimates the sale size at 4 billion pounds ($5.3 billion).
The offering is the first to be arranged by banks since a 30-year bond was sold in June. A similar syndication of 10-year notes in May attracted record orders in excess of 82 billion pounds. They’re part of the U.K.’s plan to sell an unprecedented 385 billion pounds of debt this financial year to fund a surge in fiscal spending to counter the economic shock from the coronavirus.
Syndications have been an increasingly popular way to issue debt this year as governments ramp up borrowing to fight the pandemic, as the method allows larger-than-usual amounts to be raised. Banks involved in the deal agree to underwrite the offering in return for fees, avoiding the embarrassing possibility of failing to find sufficient demand.
The U.K.’s Debt Management Office said the securities on offer this week will have a 0.625% coupon and mature in July 2035. That compares with a yield of 0.51% for 15-year notes in the secondary market.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, with moves subdued ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank (ECB)’s meeting.
Although ECB’s policy decision, to be handed down that day, is widely expected to remain unchanged, the focus will be on the bank’s inflation forecasts and whether there are concerns over the euro’s strength.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, edged up 0.13% to 93.168 by 9:53 PM ET (2:53 AM GMT), with trades thinned by the Labor Day holiday.
The euro slipped from a two-year high, reached at the beginning of September, in the wake of ECB chief economist Philip Lane’s comments about the single currency’s level during the previous week.
Some investors were optimistic about the dollar’s prospects ahead of the meeting.
“The ECB could raise more concerns over a further appreciation in the euro and make some downward revisions to its inflation projections,"" which would flag easier policy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy told Reuters.
“In our view, the dollar can lift further over the remainder of the week because of the possibility the ECB takes a sharper dovish turn,” Mundy added.

Yoshihide Suga, the frontrunner to succeed incumbent Shinzo Abe as prime minister in leadership elections scheduled for the following week, hinted at snap elections. On the economic front, data released earlier in the day showed that Japan's GDP contracted 28.1% year-on-year during the second quarter, beating the 28.6% drop in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but far below the previous quarter’s 2.2% fall. But other indices, such as July's household spending year-on-year and the current account, missed their forecasts.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.7280 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6691.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.06% to 6.8338. U.S.-China tensions continued to simmer after U.S. President Donald Trump told a White House news conference on Monday that he intends to curb the economic relationship between the two countries.
The GBP/USD pair edged down 0.16% to 1.3146. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly contemplating legislation to override the country’s Brexit withdrawal agreement with the European Union (EU). The news triggered an EU warning that there would be no deal if the U.K. went ahead with the move, increasing the prospects of a hard Brexit yet again. Fresh talks between the U.K and the EU will be held later in the day.
Some investors questioned the motives behind Johnson’s announcement.
“The key question for markets is whether the remarks are still mostly brinkmanship as negotiations near the finish line,” NAB economics director Tapas Strickland told Reuters.
“The mild market reaction suggests markets think so and still sniff a deal,” he added."
327,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A weak dollar is the latest headache for the Swiss National Bank, which relies on foreign exchange interventions as a form of quantitative easing due to the small size of its local bond market.
While the euro has long been its primary focus, the central bank appears to have continued limited interventions even as the franc depreciated versus the common currency, suggesting it’s been casting its net more widely.
A measure of cash commercial banks have with the SNB, considered an early gauge of interventions, rose by 1.4 billion francs ($1.5 billion) last week, data on Monday showed. The SNB’s foreign exchange reserves inched up to 848 billion francs in August, close to the June record.
“They have few alternatives,” said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG economist Maxime Botteron. “It’s less weakening the franc against a single currency and more just to pump more liquidity into the system to show the SNB is committed to a very expansive monetary policy.”
A spokeswoman for the SNB declined to comment on the figures published on Monday.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s shift in strategy to periodically tolerate faster inflation has extended the dollar’s recent decline versus other major currencies and is impacting policy making in Europe.
Economists expect the European Central Bank to step up its crisis response later this year with an increase emergency bond-buying program. The SNB hasn’t been able to go that route, and instead is relying on negative interest rates plus currency interventions to control the level of the haven franc and fight off deflationary forces.
SNB President Thomas Jordan reaffirmed that two-pillar policy last week.
Against the dollar, “the franc is somewhere between fair value and overvalued,” said UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) economist Alessandro Bee. “They’re probably not super relaxed but they don’t see it as as much of a problem as with the euro.”

328,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The currency options market is betting that trade talks between the U.K. and the European Union will go down to the wire, which leaves room for outperformance of volatility gauges spread over different tenors.
Sterling’s volatility surface against both the dollar and the euro as well as risk reversals show there is little panic over immediate maturities stretching from one week to a month, but climb thereafter in time for a key European Union summit.
While the next round of talks between the two sides gets under way Monday, there is little indication either side will give way on fishing rights. The EU wants to keep the access it has to U.K. waters, while Britain wants reduced access and make it conditional on regular negotiations. If the history of Brexit negotiations is any guide, this one will go down to the wire. That would imply that, as things currently stand, the first climax will be set for Oct. 15-16.
Any failure to find a solution in time for the October meeting won’t prove fatal for the pound as the European Council meets again on December 10-11. Political posturing between the U.K. and the EU has never been in short supply in the past, and there is no reason to believe that this will suddenly change.
All of which suggest that implied volatility that stretches beyond a two-month time frame will outperform near-dated gauges.

The pound fell after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ratcheted up the chances of trade negotiations failing with the European Union.
Sterling declined as much as 0.6% against the dollar, extending its drop to the longest since June, as Johnson prepared to tell the EU he’s willing to let talks fail rather than compromise on what he sees as core Brexit principles.
Johnson Gambles on No-Deal as EU Talks Run Short of Time
Talks between the two sides are set to continue this week. The U.K currency had touched the highest this year last week amid broader weakness in the dollar.
Investors are refocusing on Brexit with the two sides accepting they need to reach a deal by October in order to pave the way for a smooth exit at the end of the year, when the Brexit transition period ends. A so-called cliff-edge departure could add to the economic strain on the U.K. from the coronavirus.
“It looks that we are only at the beginning of a painful correction lower in the pound,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA, who sees the pound dropping to $1.20 in the event of no deal.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher in early European trade Monday, while the euro was weakened by disappointing German industrial production data and sterling was weighed on by the revived risk of a messy end to the Brexit transition period at the end of the year.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 92.957. Trade is likely to be thinned due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday.
Data from the U.S. Labor Department released on Friday showed that August’s jobless rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2%, despite government funding drying up and rising doubts about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery. 
“The jobs data, which showed a decline in the unemployment rate, and a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, are supporting the dollar today,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamito told Reuters.
EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1829, weighed by disappointing German industrial output data for July. This rose 1.2%, increasing for the third straight month, but growing by less than forecast by economists. 
The region’s uncertain outlook is set to feature prominently in discussions when European Central Bank officials meet this week. Most economists predict the Governing Council will keep policy unchanged on Thursday, although they expect another increase in asset purchases before the end of the year.
“There are three important issues to watch out for at next week’s meeting. There is a fresh set of ECB projections, related to this lots of attention will be on the ECB’s reaction to the recent strengthening of the euro and finally with last week’s Fed announcement there should be interest in the ECB’s own strategy review,” said ING’s Carsten Brzeski, in a research note.
After the EUR/USD pair briefly hit 1.20 last week, “the interesting part of the meeting and the press conference will be Lagarde’s comments on the euro exchange rate,” Brzeski added.  “What will count most next week is the question of whether the stronger euro has already opened the door for more monetary stimulus in the coming months.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.6% to 1.3201, as the trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union threatened to turn hostile.
The Financial Times reported Monday that the U.K. government is planning new legislation that will override key parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. This would make clinching a new trade deal before the end of a status-quo transition arrangement in December very difficult.
Without a deal nearly $1 trillion in trade between Britain and the EU could be thrown into uncertainty.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar steadied in holiday-thinned trade on Monday after U.S. jobs data showed job growth slowed further in August, while traders shifted their focus to the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday.
The U.S. Labour Department report on Friday showed that U.S. employment growth slowed and permanent job losses increased as government funding started running out, raising doubts on the sustainability of the economy's recovery. Still, the jobless rate fell to 8.4% from 10.2% in July.
In the immediate aftermath, the greenback rallied to its highest in a week at 93.242 against a basket of six major currencies on safe-haven buying, but later retraced its gains as U.S. stock indexes recovered.

The euro (EUR=EBS) stood at $1.18395 on Monday.
The British pound  fell 0.2% to $1.3253, retreating from its highest level in almost a year on fears over a no-deal Brexit. 
Amid an EU-UK trade negotiations impasse, the chances of a no-deal Brexit have risen sharply as negotiations have been threatened by Britain's insistence that it have full autonomy over its state aid plans.
The European Union is demanding a potential veto on Britain's post-Brexit laws and regulations, the British daily The Times reported on Saturday, citing senior government officials.
Against the yen , the dollar traded at 106.37.
On the data front, the United States has producer prices on Wednesday and consumer price data on Friday, while China's consumer prices will be released on Wednesday.
The yuan  was little changed in offshore trade on Monday morning, and last traded at 6.8345 per dollar.
Among the Antipodean currencies, the Australian dollar  edged higher to $0.72895, while the New Zealand dollar  last traded at $0.6711.

Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar  changed hands at C$1.3076. The Bank of Canada is also due to make an interest rate announcement on Wednesday.

Investing.com - The pound fell Friday and looked set for its first weekly loss in a month, with experts warning any potential recovery will be kept in check by the growing threat of a no-deal Brexit.
GBP/USD fell 0.11% to $1.3262 and is set for its first weekly slump since the week commencing Aug. 2.
The pound's recent run higher was partly supported by the U.K. government's success in preventing a second wave of the coronavirus so far, but fears the virus will return in a meaningful way are likely to persist as long as it is not contained in the rest of Europe.
The potential of the virus to re-emerge and the rising prospect that the U.K. could leave the EU without a trade deal at the end of the year, when the Brexit transition period ends, mean the pound may struggle to find its footing.
""(W)e believe that the GBP exchange rate has limited further potential for recovery in the short term,"" … the ""end of the Brexit transition period is approaching, which should also bring the risk of a no-deal Brexit more into focus,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Without a deal, the U.K. would trade with the EU on WTO rules from next year onward, which would be a ""bitter blow for both sides in real economic terms, but above all for the British economy, for which the EU is by far the largest trading partner,"" the bank added.
The monetary policy front has also offered reason for caution on the pound after the Bank of England monetary policy committee members, including Governor Andrew Bailey, suggested negative interest rates could have a role to play should the recovery waiver."
335,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England will probably need to ease monetary policy further to help combat the economic impact of the coronavirus, according to central bank official Michael Saunders.
Saunders, who sits on the BOE’s rate-setting committee, said in a speech Friday that the risks to the central bank’s growth forecasts are to the downside, and the bank should “lean strongly” against such threats. The pound initially slipped and gilts pared losses as Saunders spoke.
“I consider it quite likely that additional monetary easing will be appropriate in order to achieve a sustained return of inflation to the 2% target,” Saunders said. “My hunch is that risks lie on the side of weaker growth and a longer period of excess supply than forecast.”
In response to questions after the speech, Saunders said there was “certainly” scope to expand the BOE’s bond-buying plan, and that officials were still reviewing whether taking interest rates below zero would be an effective form of stimulus.
The comments are the latest in a string of dovish comments from BOE officials as they look to convince the markets they have enough firepower to help address what could be a chaotic final end to 2020.
The government’s furlough plan is due to come to an end next month, despite think tanks warning that millions of workers will still be relying on wage support. That’s putting Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak under pressure to extend aid to prevent a dramatic increase in unemployment.
Other European nations, including Germany, have already taken such a step, although Sunak has thus far ruled it out.
Testifying to lawmakers on Wednesday, Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said the BOE has the capacity to increase the pace and size of its bond-buying program if needed, while Governor Andrew Bailey just last week said the central bank has plenty of room to add monetary stimulus, even including negative interest rates.
The BOE has already unleashed a raft of stimulus measures in the wake of the pandemic, including slashing the benchmark interest rate to a record-low 0.1% and raising its asset-purchase target by 300 billion pounds ($400 billion) to 745 billion pounds.
Stimulus Expectations
Economists and investors expect the bank to expand its bond-buying plan later this year amid concerns over a spike in unemployment. The U.K. saw the biggest contraction among developed nations in the second quarter, and any economic recovery could also be derailed by a resurgence in the coronavirus and a messy Brexit at the end of this year.
Around half of firms expect that the U.K. will have no trading deal in place when the current post-Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31, Saunders said.
Relative to the latest BOE forecasts, “risks probably lie on the side of a thinner trade deal, a less-smooth transition, or more persistent Brexit-related uncertainty. More generally, global trade policy uncertainty remains high,” he said.
Unemployment is set to rise markedly as the government wage-support program ends and demand remains weak, Saunders said. The BOE forecast the jobless rate would almost double to 7.5% by the end of the year in the sharpest jump in at least 50 years, something he said remains “highly plausible.”
Saunders’s views has often proved a bellweather for the committee as a whole. He was among the first to vote for a tightening of policy before hikes in 2017 and 2018, and called for additional easing in May before a move in June.

Investing.com - The dollar traded marginally higher in early European trade Friday, with traders cautious ahead of the release of U.S. jobs data that could shed some light on the strength of the country’s economic recovery.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.838, on course for its best week in more than two months. 
The dollar has managed to halt its recent slide, but the overall sentiment remains one of weakness given the Federal Reserve has strongly implied that it intends to keep rates low for a very long time. On top of this, there remain concerns about the strength of U.S. economic growth.
“If real interest rates are one of the best gauges of monetary policy settings then U.S. monetary conditions are now the loosest they have been since 2012,” said ING analyst Chris Turner, in a research note.
“The dollar bear trend has only just begun,” he added. “U.S. fiscal policy paralysis and a change in monetary policy strategy from the Federal Reserve make the case for the dollar bear trend extending well into next year.”
The bank has raised its end year 2021 EUR/USD forecast to 1.25 from 1.10 previously.
One gauge of the strength of the U.S. recovery will be the employment market, and data due later Friday is expected to show U.S. non-farm payrolls grew by 1.4 million in August, which would be slower than the 1.763 million jobs created in the previous month.
Employment would still be about 11.5 million below its pre-pandemic level, and the slowing growth could add pressure on U.S. policymakers to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1839, extending a pullback from a two-year high hit on Tuesday.
German industrial goods orders rose by a smaller-than-expected 2.8% on the month in July, although an upward revision to the June numbers left the actual level not far off consensus forecasts, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics analyst Claus Vistesen. 
GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3272, retreating from its highest level in almost a year due to a lack of progress in trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union.
Senior U.K. officials see only a 30%-40% chance that there will be a Brexit trade agreement with the European Union due to an impasse over state aid rules and fisheries rights, The Times reported Friday.

337,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Russia’s easing run is looking more and more like a thing of the past.
The poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny with a military-grade nerve agent has triggered the strongest threat of new sanctions against Russia in months, battering the nation’s bonds and currency. While half the economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a quarter-point cut on Sept. 18, the weak ruble is adding to the reasons for Governor Elvira Nabiullina to keep interest rates on hold.
“Geopolitical headlines, such as the Navalny case, as well as the likely increased turbulence ahead of U.S. elections, will continue to weigh on the ruble and local currency bonds,” said Jens Nystedt, a New York-based senior portfolio manager at Emso Asset.
Only the Turkish lira has performed worse than the ruble in the past three months. Even before Germany called for a coordinated response to Navalny’s poisoning, investors were on edge over the possibility of Russia intervening in neighboring Belarus, where protesters have called for an end to President Alexander Lukashenko’s 26-year rule. And the prospect of a win for Joe Biden in the November presidential vote could mean a tougher approach to Russia from Washington.
“If the ruble stays at the current level of 75.5-76 per dollar, then there is an increasing chance the central bank will remain on hold,” Renaissance Capital Chief Economist Sofya Donets said by phone from Moscow.
Russia’s bond and derivatives markets have hinted at the end of easing for weeks. A rally in local debt, which took yields to a record low, ended in late May. Since the last central bank decision in July, when Nabiullina delivered her smallest cut in months, forward-rate agreements have shown rates almost unchanged over the coming three months.
Beyond the geopolitics and weak ruble, there are positive arguments for a pause.
Since the last meeting, the Economy Ministry has improved its 2020 outlook and Kremlin economic aide Maxim Oreshkin has said Russian business should recover without new state support. Gauges of manufacturing and services industries beat forecasts by a wide margin this week. Inflation, while still below target, is predicted to have continued accelerating in August.
The economic recovery, and accompanying rebound in oil prices since April, are a reminder that the nation’s fundamentals are strong. While the ruble’s drop on Wednesday was its biggest since the peak of the market rout this year, any easing in tensions, or international penalties that are deemed mild, could spark a rebound.
“Over the longer term, improved relations between Russia and the West would benefit Russian assets significantly,” said Emso’s Nystedt. “But over the next few months focus will be elsewhere.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will lose some of its recent gains against a weaker dollar as year-end approaches, hurt by Brexit uncertainty and fears surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The pound  hit an eight-month high against the greenback on Tuesday of over $1.34 but has since drifted lower after Bank of England policymakers warned that Britain's economy could suffer more damage than anticipated.
Britain has suffered the highest number of deaths from COVID-19 in Europe and lockdown measures imposed to try to stop the virus spreading further meant the economy contracted a record 20.4% in the last quarter.
The level of Britain's economic output would permanently be about 1.5 percentage points lower than it would have been without the pandemic, BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Wednesday and he warned the number could be higher.
To support the economy, like many its global peers, the central bank has slashed borrowing costs to a record low and ramped up its bond purchases.
On the flipside, the U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled its willingness to keep interest rates low for a prolonged period, weakening the dollar's outlook. 
So while according to the Aug. 28-Sept. 3 Reuters poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists, cable would be trading at $1.31 in a month compared to the $1.33 it was hovering near on Thursday it would be back at $1.34 in a year.
That is higher than the $1.31 median forecast in an August poll but highlighting the uncertainty the 12-month forecast range was wide, going from as low as $1.20 all the way up to $1.47.
""The UK is under pressure from all sides – Brexit, COVID-19 and structural capital outflows,"" noted strategists at Jyske Bank. 
""However, GBP remains undervalued, UK equities are heavily underweighted, and our main scenario is ultimately a limited, 11th-hour trade agreement with the EU.""
Alongside trying to recover from the damage from the pandemic, Britain faces the added challenge of trying to agree a trade deal with the European Union before a transition period following its departure from the bloc finishes at the end of this year. 
Successive Reuters polls have said a deal will be reached but the talks have been fractious and little progress has been made so at the end of November, a month before the transition period ends, sterling will be down at $1.30, the poll showed.
""Despite the current standstill in negotiations, we think that a basic FTA is still narrowly the most likely scenario this autumn. We think it's unrealistic to expect a sudden plunge in GDP once the transition period ends,"" said James Smith at ING.

Against the euro (EURGBP=), little movement was expected. One euro was worth around 89.0 pence on Thursday, and the poll suggested it would be worth 90.0p in a month and 89.0p again in a year.

Investing.com – The dollar was steady on Friday morning in Asia ahead of the release of U.S. jobs data that could shed some light on the quality of the economic recovery.
The US dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies was flat at 92.47 by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT).
The dollar has gained some ground against other main currencies like the euro in recent days but “my main scenario is for the dollar to fall, for stocks to rise and for yields to fall because the Fed is expected to stick with low interest rates,” Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Japan, told Reuters.
Data on non-farm payrolls out on Friday in the U.S. could shed some light on the strength of the economic recovery there. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported initial jobless claims fell to 881,000 for the week to Aug. 28, lower than forecasts of 950,000.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.01% to 106.18. On Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declared his candidacy to lead the Liberal Democratic Party and succeed outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.03% to 6.8417. The Chinese currency is up about 5% against the greenback since May. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.8359 compared to 6.8319 on Thursday.
“A stronger yuan would help China diversify away from the dollar and optimize its resource allocation,” HSBC’s director and senior foreign-exchange strategist Wang Ju told Bloomberg.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.01% to 0.7270 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 0.6704.
The GBP/USD pair was up 0.03% to 1.3285.
On Thursday, both Japan and China released purchasing managers' index (PMI) figures for August with slight dips. Japan’s August services PMI came in at 45, slightly below July’s 45.4. China’s Caixin services PMI for August was 54 against July’s 54.1."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against major currencies on Friday as traders awaited key U.S. jobs data that may cast doubt on the strength of economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Australian dollar clawed back early losses and stabilised after the country's retail sales accelerated in July, easing concern about the economy.
The greenback has managed to halt its recent slide, but analysts warn sentiment remains weak due to concern about the strength of U.S. economic growth and speculation that the Federal Reserve will keep rates low for a very long time.
""The dollar has rebounded against the euro and could continue to rise a little further,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""However, my main scenario is for the dollar to fall, for stocks to rise and for yields to fall because the Fed is expected to stick with low interest rates.""
Against the euro (EUR=D3), the dollar stood at $1.1851 in Asia on Friday, extending a pullback from a two-year low hit on Tuesday.
The British pound  bought $1.3285, retreating from its highest level in almost a year due to a lack of progress in trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union.
The greenback was quoted at 0.9096 Swiss franc 
Against the yen , the dollar traded at 106.18.
Data due later on Friday is expected to show U.S. non-farm payrolls grew by 1.4 million in August, which would be slower than the 1.763 million jobs created in the previous month.
There are growing signs the labour market recovery from the depths of the pandemic is faltering, with financial support from the government virtually depleted.
The U.S. central bank last week overhauled its policy framework to focus more on addressing shortfalls in employment and less on inflation, which would allow it to keep rates lower for longer periods, which is a negative for the dollar.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Thursday the bank could promise to keep interest rates pinned near zero until inflation reaches 2.5%, well above current low levels and modestly above the inflation target of 2%.
The dollar index (=USD) against a basket of six major currencies was little changed in Asia on Friday at 92.759.
The dollar's downtrend will continue for at least another three months due to the outlook for the Fed's monetary policy, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Friday.
The Antipodean currencies initially fell slightly, tracking the broader loss of investor confidence as a sell-off in U.S. tech shares hit Asian stocks and a closely-watched measure of market volatility (VIX) hit a 10-week high.
However, the looming U.S. jobs data brought investors back to a more measured posture.
The Australian dollar  steadied at $0.7275, supported after local retail sales accelerated in July.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's downtrend will continue into next year, driven largely by the U.S. Federal Reserve's shift to a new policy framework, although expectations for a deep fall in a sustained way have waned somewhat from last month, a Reuters poll found.
The interest rate incentive, which was the biggest driver of the dollar's supremacy for well over two years, has fallen as reflected in lower yields on U.S. assets after the announcement last week the Fed would tolerate periods of higher inflation and focus on employment.
That has encouraged traders to sell the greenback and currency speculators to increase bets against it, with the dollar (DXY) slipping to a multi-year low - down about 10% from a March peak, and pushing the euro to break through the $1.20 mark for the first time since 2018 on Tuesday.
With U.S. rates expected to stay low for longer based on the Fed's new plan, the Aug. 28-Sept. 3 Reuters poll of more than 80 foreign exchange strategists showed the dollar would weaken slightly over the coming year.
""The main reason why the dollar has weakened so sharply over the last four or five months has been driven by the Fed's policy actions,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG.
""So they've basically slashed rates to zero, that yield differential in America over the rest of the world is compressed and that obviously helped keep the dollar at such strong levels in previous years, which is no longer the case.""

While U.S. political uncertainty ahead of November's presidential election and concerns about the U.S. economic recovery have also weakened the greenback, most strategists with a view said the Fed's latest shift in policy would be the biggest driver of the dollar for the rest of the year.
A majority of strategists, or 47 of 75, in response to an additional question said the dollar's weakening trend would continue for at least another three months.
But well over a third of respondents said it had already ended or would last less than three months, compared to nearly a quarter in the previous poll.
""We're still looking for further modest downside for the dollar. The bulk of the move has already happened, so we're not looking for another big move lower at this point,"" added MUFG's Hardman.

SINGLE CURRENCY
The euro has been the main beneficiary of that dollar decline, especially after the European Union passed a 750 billion euro package that supports countries hardest hit by the pandemic and involves the bloc selling bonds collectively. 
Since its passage, the single currency has risen over 3.5% against the dollar.
But traders have started to temper stretched bets on the euro after ECB policymakers warned any further currency strength would weigh on exports, drag down prices and intensify pressure for more monetary stimulus - including ECB chief economist Philip Lane, who on Tuesday said the exchange rate ""does matter"" for policy.
In the poll, taken before data showed the euro zone's rebound from its deepest economic downturn on record faltered in August, fuelling demand for EUR/USD downside protection via FX options, the single currency (EUR=) was forecast to gain around 2.5% to $1.21 in a year from about $1.18 on Thursday.
""We continue to see that the new Fed policy feeding through to things like lower real yields in the U.S. relative to elsewhere. The ECB wants to follow the Fed in allowing the economy to run hot for a bit. We may get there at some stage, but it's not something we're looking for in the ECB's meeting next week,"" said Gavin Friend, senior FX strategist at NAB.
""The ECB next week will reiterate its ambitions of doing whatever is needed in monetary policy ... But that won't be enough to turn around this lower dollar trend that continues to unfold because of the change in the U.S. monetary policy.""

342,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Two Federal Reserve officials downplayed the chances of updated public guidance on the path of interest rates at their upcoming policy meeting, suggesting they would need more clarity on the outlook for the economy first.
“If I had a better idea of where we’re going to be next spring, and things like that, I’d know whether or not we need to ramp up extraordinarily accommodative policies like we did during the last recovery,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told reporters Thursday after delivering a speech at a virtual event.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic offered similar comments during an earlier interview broadcast by the Wall Street Journal. They were the last Fed officials scheduled to speak ahead of a blackout period on public comments preceding the central bank’s Sept. 15-16 policy meeting, and their views echoed remarks from other policy makers.
The Fed’s rate-setting committee has said it won’t raise interest rates from nearly zero until the economy is “on track” to achieving maximum employment and 2% inflation. Officials have debated providing more clarity on that guidance “at some point” to offer more support for the economy, according to minutes of their last meeting in July. The idea is that reinforcing expectations for low rates will reduce longer-term borrowing costs as well and boost activity. Such a move doesn’t sound imminent.
Lot of Uncertainty
“Right now I don’t think there’s a lot of uncertainty about the Fed’s commitment to supporting the economy and supporting the recovery so that we get to something that looks like a much more natural progression of the economy,” Bostic said.
“As we get to that period when it’s clear to everyone that we are transitioning out of an emergency setting into a more stable setting, that’s when I think the kind of forward guidance and clarity you are talking about will become more important,” he told the interviewer. “I don’t think we are there right now.”
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Aug. 27 unveiled a major shift in the central bank’s long-term strategy for setting interest rates. In the new framework, officials will allow the inflation rate to rise above their 2% target following periods of below-target inflation with an aim toward averaging 2% over time. That means waiting longer to tighten monetary policy as inflation rises than in the past.
Liftoff Thresholds
Investors are on the lookout for updated guidance that reflects the new strategy, which Fed officials have said may, when it eventually comes, take the form of specifying thresholds for unemployment and inflation that must be achieved before any rate hikes.
Evans compared the current situation to that in 2012 -- three years after the 2008-09 recession had officially ended -- when the U.S. central bank launched its third round of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, and deployed such threshold-linked guidance.
“Remember, the open-ended QE3 and threshold forward guidance that we embarked upon in September and December of 2012 was after we had fiscal austerity and the debt ceiling limit crisis,” the Chicago Fed chief said. “So, I think we have to know more. Can’t make that judgment now.”
Fed officials published quarterly projections in June indicating it was unlikely that they would begin raising rates before the end of 2022. At the conclusion of the Sept. 15-16 meeting, they will publish a new set of projections that extend through the end of 2023.

343,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
Beijing is allowing faster gains in the yuan as it seeks to cheapen imports and bolster weak consumer spending.
That’s one theory touted by DBS Bank Ltd. and Mizuho Bank Ltd., who say a stronger yuan is ideal for Beijing as it aims to boost imports and encourage people to spend more at a time when Chinese President Xi Jinping has pushed for a more self-reliant economy. That marks a shift from when Beijing used to fret about a strong yuan undermining the nation’s exports to the world.
China’s central bank has refrained from sending obvious signals with its daily fixings. That’s even as the yuan gained about 5% since May versus the dollar to its highest level in more than a year. The fixings -- - a tool the PBOC often uses to limit currency strength -- have generally been tracking the market higher as the dollar has weakened.
A stronger exchange rate also helps remove a flashpoint in relations with the U.S., with President Donald Trump having long accused China of keeping the yuan artificially weak. Domestic banks will be more inclined to hold a currency that isn’t depreciating, which in turn would help Beijing reduce the financial sector’s reliance on the greenback.
“Tolerance toward a stronger yuan when it is fundamentally driven is going to be high,” said Wang Ju, director and senior foreign-exchange strategist at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Hong Kong. “A stronger yuan would help China diversify away from the dollar and optimize its resource allocation.”
The currency’s rally since this year’s nadir in late May has made it the best performer in Asia, with the buying momentum still standing close to the strongest since January. The yuan’s large interest-rate premium over the yield on the dollar also helped to boost demand.
Such strength is already helping China, which was reported to be buying a record amount of American soybeans this year as lower prices help it boost purchases pledged under the trade deal. But still, the economy remains fragile -- the country’s imports contracted in all but one month since March, while retail sales came out worse than economists had expected for five months in a row.
“The stronger yuan could stimulate imports and further expand the domestic consumption market,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asia currency strategist at Mizuho. “China’s leaders will be less tempted to use depreciation to stimulate the economy, as the export sector plays a secondary role in growth now.”
But this doesn’t mean Beijing will let the yuan run wild. A key indicator of strength is the CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan against 24 peers. It shows the yuan has appreciated about 2.2% against them since the start of August.
The central bank may set the fixing at weaker-than-expected levels if the gauge jumps rapidly to a point where the strength eats into exports, said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd.
But for now, the yuan has room to advance further said Ong, who sees demand for the greenback being reduced after the U.S. presidential election in November. “A stronger yuan is a better fit for China’s growth model,” he said, predicting the currency to hit 6.7 per dollar by year-end.

Investing.com – The pound tumbled for a second-straight day Thursday, threatening to snap a three-week win on rising expectations the Bank of England could cut rates below zero to support the U.K. economy.
GBP/USD fell 0.54% to $1.3279, to remain close to session lows of $1.3243.
In the run-up to the BoE meeting next, governor Andrew Bailey has wheeled out the possibility that the bank could adopt negative interest rates in a worst-case scenario involving a second wave of Covid and failure to break the current deadlock on post-Brexit trade talks.
While bond buying, or quantitative easing, is the preferred tool for the central bank, in a worst-case scenario ""the case for bringing [negative rates] out of the toolbox would be strong,""  Bailey said.
The BoE governor also warned that fears of a second wave of the virus were weighing on the pace of the recovery, keeping key parts of the economy operating well below normal levels.
The move seemingly marked a bearish shift in tone on the pace of the recovery as it was just under a month ago that the Bank of England revealed a surprisingly bullish outlook. In August, the central bank forecast the economy to contract by 9.5% this year, up from a previous estimate for a 15% reduction.
The comments echoed those of BoE Monetary Policy Committee Gertjan Vlieghe who earlier this week said that it could be years before the economy returned to full capacity.
“(T)here is a material risk in my view that it could take several years for the economy to return to full capacity and inflation to return sustainably to target, even with monetary policy at its current settings,” Vlieghe said in an annual report to lawmakers.  
The coming weeks will likely offer clues on the strength of the U.K. recovery as some of the government's emergency stimulus programs, including the jobs retention scheme, are set to come to an end.
The Bank of England will unveil its monetary policy MPC announcement on Sept. 17."
345,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. service industries expanded at a slower rate in August as orders growth downshifted, indicating a more moderate pace of economic recovery from the pandemic.
The Institute for Supply Management data showed Thursday that its services index fell 1.2 points to 56.9 during the month, in line with median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists. It marked the first decline in four months. Readings above 50 indicate growth.
The purchasing managers group’s gauge of business activity, which parallels the ISM’s factory production index, also retreated from the strongest reading since 2004 to show a more tempered pace of expansion. Even as the economy opens more broadly, the pandemic poses a bigger challenge to many service industries, including retail, dining and travel.
“Respondents’ comments are mostly optimistic and industry specific about business conditions and the economy as businesses are starting to reopen. Industries that have not reopened remain concerned about the ongoing uncertainty,” Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM Services Business Survey Committee, said in a statement.
What’s more, businesses face a variety of hurdles, including still-elevated unemployment, tepid business investment and fledgling global demand.
The ISM report doesn’t detail the actual levels of activity from one month to the next since the survey asks purchasing managers whether activity is increasing, decreasing or stagnant. So the figures are subject to bigger swings during turning points in the economy.
Fifteen service industries reported growth in August, including health care, transportation and construction.
The group’s index of business activity dropped 4.8 points to a still-robust 62.4 in August, while the index of new orders fell 10.9 points to a three-month low of 56.8.
Services Employment
The ISM’s measure of services employment increased to a six-month high of 47.9 from 42.1, signaling some improvement in the labor market. One respondent in the survey said that hiring was “authorized yet slow to materialize.” The Labor Department will release its August jobs report on Friday.
The data also contained some favorable news for the nation’s manufacturers. Inventories contracted at service providers and order backlogs increased, suggesting production will pick up in coming months. The ISM’s manufacturing report showed similar results, with factory stockpiles declining at a fastest rate since 2014.
For wholesalers and retailers, “we see businesses reopening; there’s definitely going to have to be a buildup going forward with the increase of activity,” Nieves said on a call with reporters.
The ISM’s headline factory gauge expanded at the fastest pace since 2018, powered by growth in new orders. Manufacturing has been a recent bright spot in the economy, boosted by strong demand in the housing and auto sectors.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Latin American currencies will pick up somewhat in the near term, as investors watch the U.S. presidential election campaign for any hints about Washington's future approach toward the region, a Reuters poll showed.
Foreign exchange rates of Brazil's real (BRBY) and Mexico's peso  have been volatile in recent months but remained within key levels, facing a mixed outlook of budget worries and improving macro indicators.
Now, signs of recovery from a historic recession in both countries are starting to permeate sentiment despite several domestic risks including the catastrophic human toll of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The real is set to appreciate 2.8% to 5.24 per U.S. dollar in three months from Wednesday, according to the median estimate of 31 analysts and strategists polled Aug. 28-Sept. 2. The weakest and strongest forecasts are 5.80 and 4.58, respectively.
In one year, the Brazilian currency is seen at 4.95 per U.S. dollar compared with the median estimate of 4.85 in August. The unit had a strong start in September after the government offered reassurances about its austerity plans.
Still, some are skeptical. ""Low interest rate spreads, downbeat growth expectations and fiscal deterioration will continue exerting negative pressure on the real,"" Dan Kawa, CIO at TAG Investimentos in Río de Janeiro, said.
Brazil's economy shrank in the second quarter by the most on record as anti-coronavirus lockdown measures slammed activity. Last month, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 2.00% to spur growth.
The local currency is down 25% in 2020, on track for its worst year since a 33% loss in 2015. But it has gained over 4% from a low in August, when Brazilian markets recoiled on spreading fears over the gaping fiscal deficit.
PESO LOOKING AT U.S. ELECTION
In Mexico, the peso will be looking at the U.S. political campaign, with sour memories of a crash during the last leg of 2016 when then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed to build a wall to curb immigration and restrict trade.
""There may be a case for a weaker MXN mainly due to volatility associated to the presidential election in the U.S."" said Víctor Gómez, an economist at Finamex in Mexico City, in reference to the November vote.
Bilateral tensions eased later during Trump's term and his relationship with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador progressed, helping them find common ground on the border issue and refresh a decades-old trade agreement.
For the time being, the survey shows caution over the peso, seeing it around 22.00 per U.S. dollar for the foreseeable future, even if it has enjoyed a steady uptrend from a low in June.
The currency continues to get support from a high benchmark interest rate resulting from the conservative view of Mexico's central bank that contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's vast liquidity injection to fight the impact of COVID-19.
While the peso has shed 13.2% of its value since the start of the year, it is currently up 16.1% from its record low in March.

347,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy makers are concerned about the euro’s appreciation and warned that further gains will weigh on exports and bring down prices, the Financial Times reported. The common currency extended losses.
Several members of the ECB’s governing council said the currency’s gains against the dollar and other peers risk holding back the eurozone’s recovery, the newspaper reported without naming them.
“The message coming from the ECB is of note, as we rarely hear on the currency,” said Patrick Bennett, strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “The specter of deflation is rising across the globe. The consensus is that U.S. real yields have undermined the dollar, but the ECB looks to be pushing back.”
The comments echo what ECB chief economist Philip Lane said Tuesday, when he noted that moves in the euro will impact the common region’s monetary policy setting. While the euro’s gains is part of a broader slide in the dollar, the 19-nation European currency union is particularly exposed because of its relatively heavy reliance on exports and its long record of feeble inflation.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Thursday, as traders trimmed bearish positions on concerns that other central banks, and the European Central Bank in particular, will look to stop their currencies appreciating too far.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 93.058, moving around 1% above the 28-month low it hit against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, and threatening its first back-to-back daily gains since June.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was down 0.5% at 1.3280, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.30, and EUR/USD dropped 0.5% to 1.1793.
Comments Tuesday by ECB's chief economist Philip Lane that the euro-dollar rate ""does matter"" for monetary policy - suggesting the bank might do something about it - has prompted a reappraisal of the extremely long positioning of this pair. CFTC data showed net euro long positions at their highest ever last week.
“Whether this marks the first bout of verbal intervention remains to be seen,” said analysts at ING, in a research note, “but does serve as a reminder that the issue of EUR strength will be posed at the 10 September ECB press conference. Thus 1.20 may prove a temporary cap for the EUR.”
The ECB will have a clear interest in fighting a move above 1.20 in the short-to-medium-term as European inflation is still way too fragile to accept a much stronger euro. 
“It wouldn’t be a surprise to us if the ECB policy review (ETA is currently mid-2021) included a move towards AIT [Average Inflation Targeting],” analysts at Nordea said, in a research note.
That said, “with an average core inflation below 1%, would anyone even take it barely seriously if [ECB President Christine] Lagarde were to announce an AIT regime in Europe?” Nordea asked.
Still, the Federal Reserve board members who have spoken after the U.S. central bank announced its change in policy have all been keen to add color to the view that the Fed will keep rates lower for longer and that it’s ready to add more accommodation if necessary.
“A conviction view is building that the dollar be sold on rallies, “ said ING. “For the short term, the dollar has been finding some support at big figures, such as 1.20 in EUR/USD, 0.90 in USD/CHF and always 105 in USD/JPY. A market very short dollars may be prone to some short-term profit-taking, but FAIT [Flexible Average Inflation Targeting] is a macro theme that will dominate markets for years.”
For now, traders will focus Thursday on key services growth data in both Europe and the U.S., as well as weekly U.S. initial jobless claims data for more guidance.

349,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A wide disparity in performance between European equity sectors this year may be reduced because of the weakening U.S. dollar.
Many of this year’s best-performing subgroups -- think technology, chemicals and health care -- include companies selling most outside the region, and liable to see their sales translate to fewer euros. And with investors saying more gains may well be ahead for the currency after a 12% jump in just five months since the start of coronavirus lockdowns, the prospect increases of laggards such as lenders starting to catch up.
“Technology, health care and staples may be more vulnerable to appreciating currency than sectors like real estate, utilities, retail, telecoms and banks,” said Emmanuel Cau, head of equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc.
So far in the second half of the year, stock performance has been about what the business is, rather than where: technology has continued its market-topping performance in Europe over the past two months, despite it having the highest sales exposure outside of the region. Among subsectors, European semiconductor firms such as ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV and Dialog Semiconductor Plc are the most global, the group’s sales within the region barely exceeding 10%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
A stronger domestic currency “will not be nice to exporters in the euro zone,” according to Robert Greil, chief strategist at Merck Finck. The euro rose above $1.20 on Tuesday for the first time in more than two years, and with real U.S. interest rates falling, it should move toward its “purchasing power parity” at around $1.25 through the end of next year, Greil said.
UBS Wealth Management also expects the dollar to continue weakening, under pressure from Federal Reserve and U.S. administration policies. According to Chief Investment Officers Themis Themistocleous and Solita Marcelli, a Democrat sweep in the upcoming presidential election would help weaken the currency faster, with Republican policies more dollar-friendly.
The European Central Bank is paying attention. Chief Economist Philip Lane said at an online conference late Tuesday that the “the euro-dollar rate does matter” and noted that the rate feeds into monetary policy setting, causing the euro to trim gains.
Best and Worst
While most companies use hedging strategies to minimize the impact from foreign-exchange swings, the changing currency map is likely to influence investors’ thinking as they determine their future sector exposure. And the impact is already being felt.
Denmark’s H Lundbeck A/S, which makes drugs for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and French fighter-plane maker Dassault Aviation SA are among companies with significant dollar sales that have seen their shares slide since the end of June. By contrast, German forklift maker Kion Group AG, which sells its products mainly within Europe, and Denmark’s DSV Panalpina A/S have both risen more than 20% over the same period.
The same is true for British companies, with the pound having also strengthened against the dollar. Among recent U.K.-based winners is  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Plc, which gets the vast majority of revenue from the U.K. and France, and whose shares are up almost a quarter in the past two months.
That said, one may not want to overplay the currency effect just yet. A challenging foreign-exchange climate could lead European exporters to address the challenges through “cost cutting and other increased efficiencies,” according to Fidelity International strategist Carsten Roemheld.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts again upgraded forecasts for the Australian and New Zealand dollars in the latest Reuters poll, but they still lag the market as investor risk appetite gets a boost from hefty central bank stimulus.
Median forecasts put the Aussie  at $0.7200 on a one- and three-month horizon from $0.7000 and $0.7050, respectively in the previous poll.
The market, however, already has the Aussie at $0.7320, having hit a two-year top of $0.7413 just this week. 
Yet the poll shows analysts doubt the rally can get much further, putting the currency at $0.7300 in six months and $0.7400 in one year amid expectations monetary policy will remain accommodative for a long time to come. 
The gains in the Aussie have come even as Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.47 trillion) economy has sunk into its first recession in almost three decades, with unemployment at a 22-year high and wages growth as all-time lows. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has stepped in by slashing the cash rate to a record low 0.25%, launching an ""unlimited"" bond buying programme and offering cheap funding to lenders. It has promised to do more if needed. 
But the U.S. Federal Reserve has gone even more dovish, making the greenback weaker and eroding its previous interest rate advantage over rivals. 
Also supporting the Aussie is the relative outperformance of the Chinese economy, which continues to suck up Australian resources in a boost to prices for key exports including iron ore. 
That has gifted Australia with its largest current account surplus in decades, providing a net trade inflow to the Aussie.
""We continue to see AUD as a relative outperformer in G10,"" Geoff Yu, senior market strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) wrote in a note.
""The RBA has explicitly highlighted the role of fiscal and Australia's favourable borrowing conditions to support the economy in greater scale and scope up ahead. Gradually, if successful, these investment trends will be reflected in AUD valuations.""
The New Zealand dollar has benefited from similar forces, though again analysts polled seem to think it has topped out for the moment, putting it at $0.6600  over three months.
The kiwi was last trading at $0.6764 after rising for five months on the trot and was not too far from a one-year high touched this week.

Investing.com – The dollar was on a downward trend on Thursday morning in Asia, reversing some earlier gains.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.07% to 92.773 by 10:12 PM ET (3:12 GMT).
The dollar saw its first back-to-back daily gains since June earlier in the session over European Central Bank (ECB) worries about the euro’s recent rise. The euro had rallied ever since the European Union in July agreed on a rescue package for its members to fight the impact of COVID-19, but a retreating euro saw investors trim bets against the dollar.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane said on Tuesday the euro-dollar rate “does matter” for monetary policy, thereby suggesting that ECB action on the rate could be forthcoming.
Some investors disagreed, with National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill telling Reuters that “Lane’s comments were the excuse for some traders to take profits on long euro positions” that are beginning to look stretched.
And the move downwards justified some investors’ conviction that the dollar’s upward trend would not last long.
“You could put (the dollar bounce) down to a bit of a trend reversal, it’s had a long run downwards ... but if it is a floor, it’s only a short term one,” BNZ senior markets strategist Jason Wong told Reuters.
“It’s probably just a pause. Everyone’s pretty bearish [on] dollars for good reason,” he added, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy shift that will likely result in very low rates over a longer period.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.06% to 1106.25. Yoshihide Suga formally declared his candidacy to lead the Liberal Democratic Party leadership on Wednesday, thereby throwing his hat into the ring to succeed incumbent Shinzo Abe as Japan’s next prime minister.
Japan and China both released purchasing managers index (PMI) figures earlier in the day, with both countries seeing slight dips. Japan’s August services PMI came in at 45, slightly below July’s 45.4, and China’s Caixin services PMI for August was 54 against July’s reading of 54.1.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.17% to 6.8261.
Investors now await more PMI figures from Europe and the U.S., alongside U.S. payroll figures, later in the day.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.14% to 0.7328 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 0.6771. The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.10% to 1.3338."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar clung to overnight gains on Thursday, as investors trimmed bets against the greenback and sold the euro on concerns that the European Central Bank was worried about its rise.
The bounce has lifted the greenback about 1% above the 28-month low it hit against a basket of currencies on Tuesday and brought its first back-to-back daily gains since June (=USD).
Few analysts expect it to hold for too long but it was steady in morning trade, inching about 0.1% firmer on the Australian dollar, kiwi, euro and pound as investors position themselves ahead of U.S. jobs data due on Friday.
""You could put (the dollar bounce) down to a bit of a trend reversal, it's had a long run downwards,"" said BNZ senior markets strategist Jason Wong. ""But if it is a floor, it's only a short term one,"" he said.
""It's probably just a pause. Everyone's pretty bearish dollars for good reason,"" he added, pointing to the Federal Reserve's policy outlook that will likely keep rates very low for a long time.
The drop in the euro extended its retreat from the $1.20 mark, which had begun on Tuesday after the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane said the euro-dollar rate ""does matter"" for monetary policy - suggesting the bank might do something about it.
Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney said that was unlikely, but that ""Lane's comments were the excuse for some traders to take profits on long euro positions"" that had begun to look stretched.
The value of euro longs stood at a record high last week .
The euro (EUR=EBS) was last at $1.1836, having fallen half a percent overnight, and it made a fresh three-month low of 88.71 pence (EURGBP=). The pound  slipped to $1.3338, but was above an overnight trough of $1.3284.
The Australian dollar  dipped to $0.7331 and the kiwi  was a touch softer at $0.6764, though it has put up the toughest fight against the dollar's bounce and is only about 0.4% below a 13-month high touched on Wednesday.
The Japanese yen  is gradually settling back towards where it was before Shinzo Abe resigned as Prime Minister as his close ally Yoshihide Suga firms as the favourite to succeed him.
Suga formally declared his candidacy for the Liberal Democratic Party leadership on Wednesday and he is expected to persist with Abe's aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus policies.
The yen slipped marginally to 106.21 per dollar.

Ahead on Thursday are purchasing managers index figures in Asia, Europe and the United States. Markets are also awaiting U.S. payrolls figures on Friday.

353,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to win back the trust of his own colleagues after weeks of criticism and policy reversals left his coronavirus strategy in disarray.
As lawmakers returned to Westminster after the summer break, the premier appealed directly to Conservative members of Parliament to help persuade the public to go to work and get the economy back to normal.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak promised Tories there would be no “horror show” of tax rises, but left himself room for temporary hikes to pay off the pandemic debts in the future.
Together, Johnson and Sunak -- the double act at the top of the British government -- spent much of Wednesday in a series of face-to-face meetings with Tories who have been anxious about their handling of the virus crisis. Many Conservatives are worried that potential tax rises will stifle an economy that’s already deep in recession.
Yet even as the prime minister set about trying to regain the initiative, his government announced yet another policy U-turn, this time on plans to ease lockdown restrictions in parts of northwestern England.
Johnson Retreats Again, Leaving U.K. Virus Plan in Disarray
In recent weeks, Johnson’s team has reversed policies on issues including school exam grading, the wearing of face coverings in shops and in schools, its contact-tracing program to contain the spread of the virus.
The latest reversal is a blow to the credibility of Johnson’s broader pandemic strategy and will add to the impression that his government is not in control as he seeks desperately to revive the stalled economy and get the public back to work.
In a private meeting inside Parliament, Johnson told MPs that as community leaders, they should urge their constituents to return to workplaces as soon as possible so the country can get moving again, two people present at the meeting said.
Earlier in the day, Sunak promised there won’t be “a horror show of tax rises with no end in sight,” after Tory colleagues warned that hiking taxes would stifle the already ailing economy.
Sunak’s careful wording suggested he’s not ruling out temporary tax increases to pay off the vast debts racked up during the pandemic, but is still committed to the party’s goal of maintaining a low-tax economy in the longer run.
“We will need to do some difficult things,” Sunak told MPs. He said the Tory party needs to “be honest” with the British public about “the challenges we face,” while “showing them how we plan to correct our public finances and give our country the dynamic, low tax economy we all want to see.”
The cost of responding to the pandemic has sent the U.K.’s national debt to more than 2 trillion pounds ($2.7 trillion) for the first time in history.

Investing.com – The euro fell sharply against the dollar on Wednesday, on growing expectations the European Central Bank will roll out more stimulus after the central bank flagged the sharp rise in the single currency as a concern. 
EUR/USD fell 0.65% to $1.1833.
“The market is likely expecting more stimulus from the ECB,” said Erica Blomgren Dalsto, strategist at Scandinavian bank SEB, according to the Financial Times.
In the run-up to the European Central Bank meeting next week, some members from the bank have voiced concerns over the sharp rise in the euro, adding to expectations that stimulus will come sooner rather than later.
The ECB's Chief Economist Philip Lane said Tuesday that the euro’s level ""does matter"" for monetary policy.  A stronger currency generally weighs on export growth and curbs import prices, leading to a slowdown in inflation.  
Others, meanwhile, have suggested that recent signs of slack in the eurozone economic recovery could prompt the central bank to expand its pandemic emergency stimulus program, which was rolled out in March this year.
""Seeing the strength of the EUR (ECB's Lane commented yesterday that it ""does matter""), more structural elements to the weak inflation and details in yesterday’s PMI manufacturing releases putting question marks behind the persistence of the recovery, it still appears more likely that there will be an increase in the asset purchase envelope at some stage, if only in December,"" ING said.

355,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The $400 billion corner of quant investing known as risk parity has a history of doubt and division, and Bridgewater Associates has started a new chapter.
Ray Dalio’s $138 billion asset manager has tweaked its version of the strategy by moving into alternatives to conventional bonds as yields hit historic lows, a person familiar with the matter has confirmed.
The shift, telegraphed by the firm in a July report, drives a new wedge between Bridgewater and risk-parity purists and speaks directly to concerns that have long dogged the systematic investing approach.
Since the strategy allocates money across assets based on how risky they are -- meaning it buys more securities with lower volatility -- it typically takes a heavy position in sovereign debt.
“It is pretty obvious that with interest rates near zero and being held stable by central banks, bonds can provide neither returns nor risk reduction,” a team led by Co-Chief Investment Officer Bob Prince wrote in the July report.
Bridgewater’s famous All Weather portfolio has therefore been moving into gold and inflation-linked bonds, diversifying the countries it invests in and finding more stocks with stable cash flow.
The idea is to replicate the long-term positive returns typically generated by bonds while finding alternative ways to hedge a downturn in stocks, especially if higher inflation upends low-yielding nominal debt.
Risky Business
Bridgewater’s conviction that ultra-low yields are a game-changer for risk parity will resonate with many on Wall Street, who have also been fretting over the fate of traditional portfolios that allocate 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds.
According to the firm, about 80% of local-currency government bonds have been trading below 1%, which limits the room for such notes to rise in value during a bout of risk aversion since investors can simply hoard cash instead.
That, combined with the potential for losses if yields jump from record lows, means that the world of government debt is potentially losing its function as a safety valve in portfolios.
Not everyone in the industry shares that view. While Dalio is a pioneer of risk parity -- he first crafted it to manage his personal trust in 1996 -- Edward Qian, CIO for multi-asset investments at PanAgora Asset Management, was one of those to help coin the name in a seminal 2005 paper. He’s keeping faith in the traditional version of the rules-based strategy.
“You cannot just say because bond yields are low, they’re going to rise and let’s not invest in government bonds,” said Boston-based Qian. “That’s contradictory to the risk-parity approach.”
There’s plenty of disagreement in the industry over how to define and execute risk parity, but the general idea is to award weightings in a portfolio based on each asset’s volatility and then apply leverage to boost returns. The aim is to achieve similar results to riskier strategies but with a smoother, safer ride.
PanAgora is telling clients to stick with government bonds for their diversification value, rather than try to guess what their future returns will be.
“Predicting inflation is just as difficult as predicting bond yields,” said Qian. “Risk parity is predicated on that predicting asset price is very difficult so you’re better off with a diversified portfolio.”
That approach has boomed in the post-crisis era, as rallies across bonds and stocks helped a benchmark for the strategy gain around 130% over the past decade. At the same time, it also morphed into a whipping boy for critics that argue its volatility-targeting approach exacerbates selloffs.
Yield Debate
The size and scale of Bridgewater’s changes to the All Weather fund are unknown, and the Westport, Connecticut-based giant has been clear that it sees the adjustments as consistent with its risk-parity framework.
“Our balanced approach to beta has never been about a particular asset allocation, nor has it ever been reliant on any particular asset class,” the firm’s investing chiefs wrote in July.
Philippe Ferreira at Lyxor Asset Management has some sympathy for the Bridgewater concerns. In the medium term, should monetary policy makers signal a return to tighter policy, a jump in yields and drop in equities would spell big trouble for the strategy, the cross-asset strategist said. But in the mean time, it is unlikely to lose favor.
“It looks we are far from monetary policy normalization,” he said. “In an environment where valuations are rich in both equities and fixed income, risk parity strategies might even be more attractive for risk control purposes. They have a substantial allocation to bonds which are protected by central bank purchases.”
Bond Buffer
At Mellon Investments, Roberto Croce rejects the doom and gloom about government bonds.
In a July report, the head of risk parity stressed that yields may be low but for the most part curves are still sloping upwards. That means risk-parity funds that trade bond futures can take advantage of what’s known as a roll-down strategy which exploits the shape of the yield curve.
And as PanAgora points out, history suggests that bonds can still provide protection, even at extremely low yields.
Japan’s sovereign debt has defied innumerable calls of a peak for nearly three decades and has mostly continued to hedge stock moves. It’s been a similar story in the euro area in recent years. Inflation famously never showed up in either place.
Bridgewater’s July report warns that the global bond rally may now be reversing. Japanese yields didn’t even revisit their 2019 low amid the pandemic, German yields have recovered much of their March move and U.S. Treasury yields seem to have found a bottom.
Yet for PanAgora, that hasn’t changed the role of sovereign bonds in risk-parity portfolios.
“People have pronounced the death of risk parity many times,” said Qian. “Risk parity can still be used in a way that’s consistent with the past, but you just have to not be afraid of leverage.”

356,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies added fewer jobs than expected in August, suggesting the labor market rebound remains gradual, with employment well below pre-pandemic levels.
Businesses’ payrolls increased by 428,000 after an upwardly revised 212,000 in July, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1 million gain for the latest month.
The latest data suggest companies continue to hire at a more moderate pace than immediately following the lifting of business lockdowns months ago. Amid widespread joblessness, it will take sustained demand growth to rebuild the labor market to what it was before the pandemic.
Yet, headwinds remain. The Paycheck Protection Program, which helped support employment in recent months, expired in August, and lawmakers have yet to pass an another comprehensive stimulus package. Meanwhile, companies continue to announce layoffs almost six months after the Covid-19 shutdowns.
ADP’s figures have differed greatly from the government’s data over the past several months, leading in some cases to sizable revisions reflecting the process of benchmarking its number to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ figure. For instance, ADP’s preliminary May estimate showed a 2.76 million decline in payrolls compared with the government’s initial print of a 3.09 million increase. ADP later revised its May figure to a 3.3 million gain.
“The August job postings demonstrate a slow recovery,” Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in a statement. “Job gains are minimal, and businesses across all sizes and sectors have yet to come close to their pre-COVID-19 employment levels.”
Service-provider employment increased 389,000 in August, reflecting gains in leisure and hospitality and health care, according to ADP. Payrolls at goods producers rose 40,000 last month, largely reflecting a jump in employment at construction companies.
The figures come just before the government’s monthly jobs report on Friday, which is forecast to show private payrolls increased by nearly 1.3 million, the fourth-straight month of gains. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8%, the first single-digit print since March, but the degree of improvement may be impacted by an increase in participation as more out-of-work Americans look for jobs.
Payrolls at small, medium and large businesses all increased, yet the biggest advance occurred at firms employing at least 500 workers. Large businesses added 298,000 to payrolls and small companies took on 52,000.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S."
357,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro is about to extend its advance by another 5% in the coming months, if history is a guide.
The currency seems to be mirroring a pattern from August 2017, when it briefly breached the $1.20 psychological mark, and retreated quickly due to large option barriers. The common currency then advanced as high as $1.2555 within four months.
That suggests the pullback since Tuesday may be a breather amid a bull run, and the euro is probably on course to test $1.25, the next big level on the higher side.
There are several similarities between the euro’s latest moves and its price action three years ago. Both times, the euro rallied after trading below $1.10, only for the advance to stall due to options-related supply. The currency formed a bearish candle pattern, the so-called shooting star, that points to a correction.
The euro retreated below $1.19 sharply, where support by the 21-daily moving average came into play, just like it did three years ago.
Euro Bias
Weekly and monthly charts signal further gains as technical patters show a positive change in momentum. While a correction in the near term may be warranted, the bigger picture is still supportive for the euro.
At the same time, option-market trends show traders are looking beyond spot fluctuations and gamma hedging to bet on another round of dollar weakness.
Risk reversals, a barometer of market sentiment and positioning, still trade in favor of euro topside across tenors, retreating only slightly after European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane offered the first round of verbal intervention this week.
For policy makers, however, the rate of change for the euro matters more than actual level of the currency. As long as the euro appreciates in an orderly fashion, backed by fundamentals like E.U.-U.S. growth and interest-rate differentials, the ECB may not be seen as a strong barrier to euro gains.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, recovering a little from Tuesday’s two-year lows, helped by positive U.S. manufacturing activity and weak German retail sales
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 92.377, having fallen Tuesday to its lowest level since April 2008 of 91.737. GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3368, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.03.
Economic data published on Tuesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated to a nearly two-year high in August amid a surge in new orders. This followed similarly upbeat Chinese and European manufacturing indicators.
However, the overall tone remains one of dollar weakness.
“The Fed-induced narrative of lower nominal and real rates for longer has (a) taken away any prospects of upside potential from the dollar; and (b) allows investors to rotate into investment opportunities elsewhere,” said analysts at ING, in a note to investors.
That said, EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1904 Wednesday, after briefly climbing above 1.20 for the first time since May 2018 during Tuesday’s session. 
Weighing on the euro were German retail sales falling 0.9% on the month in July, dashing hopes that household spending in Europe's largest economy will prompt a recovery in the third quarter.
This followed comments from Philip Lane, the European Central Bank’s chief economist, who linked movements in this pair to the bank’s monetary policy.
“The euro-dollar rate does matter,"" Lane said late Tuesday, at an online conference. “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting.""
This was the first sign of the ECB getting worried about the recent appreciation of the single currency, an important factor as the euro zone is heavily reliant on export markets for growth.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD dropped 0.2% to 0.7358 after Australia officially entered its first recession in nearly 30 years, after its second quarter GDP contracted by a record 7% quarter-on-quarter, its worst economic downturn on record.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar bounced off two-year lows on Wednesday as U.S. data pointed to a firm manufacturing activity, while the euro retreated from its highest levels since 2018 on profit-taking.
Economic data published on Tuesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated to a nearly two-year high in August amid a surge in new orders, with the reading from the Institute for Supply Management highest level since November 2018.
The U.S. data followed similarly upbeat Chinese and European manufacturing indicators.
Analysts said that an increase in pent-up demand has contributed to the rise in the greenback. 
""In hindsight, it was a strong data,"" said Rikiya Takebe, senior strategist at Okasan Online Securities.
""But when you look closely into the eighteen industries, not all of them registered growth in employment... there wasn't an improvement in employment overall,"" he said.
The dollar index (=USD) inched up 0.16% at 92.390, having hit its lowest since April 2018 of 91.737.
Separate data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Australia suffered its worst economic fall in quarterly domestic product on record last quarter as the coronavirus pushed the country into recession.
Following the data announcement, the Australian dollar  fell 0.5% to $0.7348 before retracing some losses at $0.73560.
The greenback has been declining since last week, down about 1%, after the Federal Reserve announced it would focus more on average inflation and higher employment. With the Fed's shift in policy having leeway to keep U.S. interest rates lower for longer, it has encouraged traders to sell the currency.
That view was reinforced on Tuesday as Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank would need to roll out more stimulus to help the economy overcome the coronavirus and fulfil the Fed's new pledge.
U.S. Treasury yields fell following the speech as additional stimulus would likely involve more aggressive bond-buying.
The euro benefited from the initial dollar sell-off, as it rose high as $1.2014 (EUR=EBS) on Tuesday, its highest since May 2018. 
The common currency later reversed those gains to sit at $1.19085.
""After hitting the 1.2 level, the euro fell due to the crowded long posing,"" said Makoto Noji, chief FX strategist at SMBC Nikko.
""For a while, the market talked about how the Fed's new policy weakened the dollar, but the flow of traders buying back the dollar will probably become strong for a week or two,"" he said.
Against the Japanese yen , the dollar was little changed at 106.075 yen.
Japan's Liberal Diplomatic Party formally decided to hold election of Sept. 14, sources told Reuters, but analysts say the market has already priced in the risk.
""The sell-off that followed after (Shinzo Abe's) surprise resignation announcement is over, and with the market assuming (Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide) Suga will win the election, there isn't much factors left to consider,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief FX strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Also supporting a rebound in the greenback, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Senate Republicans are likely to bring up a targeted COVID-19 relief bill next week.
However, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement after a phone call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday that ""serious differences"" remain between Democrats and the White House over coronavirus relief legislation.
Among antipodean currencies, the New Zealand dollar  added 0.3% at $0.6780 after the Reserve bank of New Zealand governor Adrian Orr said the central bank's actions have been effective in broadly lowering interest rates.
Elsewhere in the market, Sterling  traded at 1.3379, just below last year's high that followed the 2019 election of 1.3516.

The Chinese yuan  was little changed, last down 0.08% in offshore markets to 6.8305.

Investing.com – The dollar was on an upward trend on Wednesday in Asia, after the U.S. saw better-than-expected manufacturing data the day before.
The U.S. Dollar Index that measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies inched up 0.03% to 92.362 by 12:33 AM ET (5:33 AM GMT).
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released its manufacturing data on Tuesday. Its PMI, at 56, was above than the expected 54.5 and better than the 54.2 in July. The rosy data came on the heels of China and Japan’s uptick in manufacturing, playing its part to restore confidence for economic recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the rosy data gave the dollar a boost, the greenback still remains at a one-year low on inflation expectations. The dollar has been on a downward trajectory from this year’s high at above 103 recorded in March.
But some investors remain cautious about the data. Daiwa Securities chief FX strategist Mitsuo Imaizumi told Reuters that the ISM data also showed the labour market remained in contraction territory, warning that it is “unnecessary to see the data as entirely great.”
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.03% to 6.8294. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the reference rate of the yuan against the dollar at 6.8376 versus the previous day’s 6.8498.
Similarly, the USD/JPY pair inched up 0.09% higher at 106.05. The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.20% to 0.7357, with the country officially entering a recession, after its second quarter GDP contracted by a record 7% quarter-on-quarter. The GBP/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 1.3380.
That said, the New Zealand dollar remained strong, with the NZD/USD pair still gaining 0.36% to 0.6781.
There could be further rebound in the greenback as the U.S. is working to roll out more relief measures. Senate Republicans are reportedly bringing up a targeted COVID-19 relief bill next week, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration is willing to work on a bipartisan relief package.
""Let's move forward on a bipartisan basis on points we can agree upon,"" Mnuchin urged in a hearing of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. ""The president and I want to move forward."""

The currency declined as much as 0.8%, the most since July, to 31.301 against the dollar. It was at 31.235 at 9:20 a.m. local time.
The resignation of Predee Daochai, a former co-president of Kasikornbank Pcl, comes as the government is trying to overcome what will likely be a record economic contraction. Predee told Thai-language newspaper Krungthep Turakij that he quit due to health reasons, and there wasn’t any conflict with other government leaders.
“The abrupt resignation of Thailand’s finance minister would undoubtedly have added uncertainty to the economic landscape,” said Howie Lee, an economist at OCBC Banking Corp. in Singapore. “I expect the baht to stabilize if a replacement can be found quickly.”
The Finance Ministry has predicted an 8.5% economic decline this year as the nation’s key growth drivers of tourism and trade slump. While the government has announced stimulus worth $60 billion and the central bank lowered interest rates to a record low, it may take the economy at least two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level, according to the Bank of Thailand.
“A quick appointment of a new finance minister, whose competency and merit must be acceptable to the public, is needed,” said Win Phromphaet, Bangkok-based chief investment officer at Principal Asset Management Co. “The new finance minister must also have full and independent authority in implementing economic policies.”

“Consistently below target inflation has its own unique challenges that are best avoided,” Reserve bank Governor Adrian Orr said in a speech Wednesday in Wellington. While low interest rates could lead to undue risk-taking, at this stage in the Covid-19 challenge “we strongly believe that the best contribution we can make to our monetary and financial stability mandates is ensuring we head off unnecessarily low inflation or deflation, and high and persistent unemployment,” he said.
Orr reiterated that the RBNZ, which is has cut its official cash rate to 0.25% and is using quantitative easing to reduce bond yields, is actively preparing a package of additional monetary policy tools to use if needed. The central bank has indicated it could take the OCR into negative territory early next year.
“The policy tools that we’ve used to date and the additional tools that we are considering using as a package in the near future are not new to central banking,” he said. “The instruments include various forms of negative wholesale interest rates, further quantitative easing using large scale purchases of domestic and foreign assets, direct lending to banks, and forward guidance as to what needs to be done under certain conditions.”
The RBNZ knows that these tools are technical and unfamiliar to most New Zealanders and that it has an ongoing communications challenge to ensure people remain confident in its intentions and actions, he said.
“Our next near-term challenge is to outline our future monetary policy strategies and tools, and when we might use them,” Orr said. “We are well prepared for this challenge.”

Investing.com – The dollar rose from session lows Tuesday, as better-than-expected economic data stemmed downside momentum at a time when many expect the near-zero U.S. interest rates are likely to persist. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.20% to 92.32 after slipping to a 28-month low.
The move off the day's lows in the dollar comes despite ongoing dovish remarks from Federal Reserve members. 
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday said the central bank should adopt a more aggressive monetary policy approach to ensure a robust recovery in the labor market, and push inflation toward the 2% the target.
The comments drew a muted move in the dollar, which found its footing earlier in the day, following data showing the recovery in U.S. manufacturing remains on track.
The ISM Manufacturing Index improved to 56.0 from 54.2 in August, topping economists' forecasts for a reading of 54.5.
""Although there are some odd compositional issues within the data, overall they suggest the sector is continuing to pick up steam in its recovery,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. "" We remain confident that manufacturing will be more resilient to COVID-related developments than the service side of the economy, and activity should continue to expand in coming quarters as the recovery takes hold.""
But the uptick in the greenback could be shortlived as recent findings point to ongoing investor appetite to raise bets against the dollar.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said 36% of fund managers in a recent survey named shorting the dollar as their top currency trade for the second half of the year, Reuters reported.
The value of the net short dollar position increased to $33.68 billion in the week ended Aug. 25, compared with a net short of $31.56 billion the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
A fall from euro, which makes up the bulk of the weighting the dollar index, also supported the dollar's recovery from session lows."

Europe’s common currency advanced as much as 0.6% to $1.2011 before settling back to around $1.1990. Investors remain optimistic on its outlook, with speculators holding a record bullish position. In contrast, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index touched a two-year low.
The euro has rallied more than 10% since late March when the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets. The European Union’s policy response to the virus has supported the euro, while the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to slash rates to zero and inject massive amounts of liquidity have undermined the dollar.
Last week, the Fed announced a policy shift that’s likely to keep interest rates lower for longer and the greenback under pressure.
“U.S. money supply expansion and Fed’s QE, along with U.S. deficits are all dollar negative and benefit the likes of the euro, especially in light of the Next Generation EU fund,” said Shyam Devani, chief strategist at SAV Markets in Singapore. “I expect a major rally on EURUSD through the long-term resistance levels just below 1.21, beyond there we would be looking at the 1.25 handle.”

PIMCO's Gene Frieda, Global Strategist, and Sachin Gupta, Head of Global Portfolio Management Desk, noted that in previous depreciation cycles the real trade-weighted dollar had fallen some 15% to 20% relative to current levels, but that even then ""the dollar would still only be marginally undervalued based on our estimates."" 
The dollar on Tuesday hit a new 28-month low (=USD) and the euro approached $1.20 for the first time since 2018. 
The U.S. currency's previous interest rate advantage over rivals has disappeared as the Fed embarked on aggressive policy stimulus, and the PIMCO managers said a huge new recovery fund in the European Union had increased the euro's attractiveness as an alternative to the greenback.
""We believe that Fed policy will remain accommodative for as long as it takes to bring inflation back to target, ""on average,"" Frieda and Gupta said in a statement. 
""Given our expectation that full employment does not return before mid-2024, this would set the Fed on course for a multi-year period of very low policy rates and asset purchases,"" they said, while adding that ongoing uncertainty about the coronavirus pandemic would limit the dollar's decline.

Investing.com - The dollar slumped in early European trade Tuesday, falling to multi-year lows against many currencies, with traders viewing the Federal Reserve’s new stance on inflation as a valid reason to sell the greenback.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 91.860, having earlier reached a two-year low of 91.773. GBP/USD was up 0.3% at 1.3412, near its strongest level in almost a year, while EUR/USD was up 0.4% at 1.1981, at its highest since May 2018. 
The Fed's historic switch last week to focusing more on average inflation and higher employment means it has leeway to keep benchmark rates lower for longer, encouraging those with a negative view on the dollar to sell the currency.
While EUR/USD has posted strong gains so far Tuesday, the pair is struggling to break through the 1.20 level, seen as a key resistance point. Ahead lies important Eurozone data, including manufacturing PMI releases, German unemployment figures and inflation numbers, with the potential for a rebalancing should they disappoint. 
That said, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects a break through the 1.20 level to just be a matter of time.
""Our markets team expects the euro to strengthen further from here - to 1.25 against the dollar in twelve months and roughly 2.5% on a trade-weighted basis—as we expect the euro area economy to outperform other countries and see the euro as under-owned in international portfolios and under-valued in our fair value models,"" said Sven Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs, in a research note late last week.
""Euro appreciation primarily reflects an improvement of the economic outlook and constructive institutional change in the euro area’s fiscal architecture. The stronger euro is, therefore, unlikely to be a significant concern for the ECB at this stage."" 
Elsewhere, AUD/USD gained 0.3% to 0.7399, near a two-year high, after Australia’s central bank left both the cash rate and three-year yield target unchanged at 0.25%, as expected.
Additionally, USD/CNY dropped 0.5% to 6.8161, the strongest level since May 2019, after China’s Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for August increased to 53.1, marking the sector's fourth consecutive month of growth and the fastest rate of expansion since January 2011.

The 10-year government bond yield plunged 18 basis points, the most since May 13 when a new benchmark was introduced, to 5.93%. The yield on the five-year debt also dropped 22 basis points to 5.26%.
The Reserve Bank of India gave banks leeway to hold more government bonds without marking to market, while also announcing plans on Monday to conduct 1.2 trillion rupees ($16.3 billion) worth of repurchase operations and Federal Reserve-style Operation Twists. Benchmark yields rose almost 30 basis points in August, the most since 2018, after a spike in inflation spurred bets that the central bank won’t be able to cut rates.
“The RBI is telling the market that when we say whatever it takes, we’ll follow it up with actions whenever it’s required,” said Arvind Chari, head of fixed income and alternatives at Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Advisors Pvt. “The intent is very clear. The RBI wants yields lower than what they are currently.”
The RBI needs to keep borrowing costs under control with the economy suffering its worst quarterly contraction on record, and the government out to sell a record 12 trillion rupees of debt. The market has been concerned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government will exceed the borrowing targets to revive a virus-ravaged economy.
“The RBI is going all out. I don’t think anybody will have the guts to bet against the RBI in the short run,” said Vijay Sharma, executive vice president for fixed-income at PNB Gilts Ltd.
New measures:
The new measures are on top of the 200 billion rupees of Operation Twists, where it simultaneously buys and sells long and short-term bonds to tame yields, announced earlier.
The central bank on Friday also sent a strong signal over rising bond yields by setting a lower level than most bids at an auction. It then asked underwriters to pick up nearly the entire benchmark bond on sale.
Banks Purchases
The RBI’s approach to address excess bond supply has been more modest than its high-yielding rival Indonesia, which has waded deep into debt monetization. Still, it has cut rates by 115 basis points in 2020 and conducted discreet secondary market purchases.
Banks may now have room to buy another 3.6 trillion rupees of debt without worrying about price fluctuations with RBI’s rule relaxation, according to IDFC Asset Management Ltd.
“This is a multi-pronged response -- reinforcing forward guidance, extending Twist operations, time bound hike in held-to-maturity limits and allowing banks to reprice LTROs,” said Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Asset. “This clearly puts to rest any dissonance in the market.”

The yuan climbed 0.4% to 6.8211 a dollar, the strongest level since May 2019, as the dollar traded at a two-year low. The advance came even after the central bank set its daily fixing for the currency at levels weaker than traders and analysts had expected for three sessions through Monday. Those moves could be taken as a sign that Beijing hoped to slow the gains.
The rally has extended the Chinese currency’s advance since this year’s nadir in May to 5%, as the best-performing exchange rate in Asia. A strong yuan isn’t ideal when the nation’s economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and confronted with escalating tensions with the U.S. because it could undermine the attractiveness of China’s exports to the world.
The yuan’s gain versus its trading partners’ currencies is much milder compared with its move against the dollar. The Bloomberg CFETS RMB Index Tracker, which measures the yuan versus 24 peers, has risen just 2.4% from a record low last year. The gauge currently stands at 92.95.
“The yuan will likely advance further as the dollar weakens,” said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea Chinese Banking Corp. “The central bank could use the fixing to limit the gains when the yuan index climbs to 94 or 95.”
The recent rally marks a turnaround from earlier in 2020, when the offshore rate neared the weakest level ever. The yuan has been resilient as China-U.S. tensions have expanded from a trade war to issues including the tech industry and a national security law in Hong Kong. Its interest rate premium over the greenback is near the highest on record, which attracts inflows to Chinese assets and boosts the currency.

Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida on Monday expanded on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments indicating a shift in focus to average inflation and higher employment. The framework has triggered a retreat from the dollar, with the Fed now given more scope to keep benchmark rates lower for longer.

This would eclipse the 167 trillion won planned for 2020, which came as the impact of the coronavirus forced policy makers to compile three supplementary budgets. It was initially envisaged that issuance this year would be 130.2 trillion won.
“This is a pretty big size,” said Shin Earl, a fixed-income analyst at SK Securities Co. “It’s inevitable for bonds to weaken further as the impact of the mismatch between supply and demand continues to intensify.”
The deluge of supply coming to market was evident in rising yields seen in August, which gathered pace last week when Governor Lee Ju-yeol damped hopes of the Bank of Korea would stepping up purchases anytime soon.
The yield of the nation’s 10-year bond rose for a sixth day, gaining 3 basis points to 1.54% on Tuesday.
Of the total amount planned for 2021, 63.2 trillion won would be used to repay maturing debt, according to a finance ministry statement. This would mean net new issuance of 109.7 trillion won.

Up to 89.7 trillion won would be issued as deficit-financing debt, while up to $1.5 billion would be foreign-exchange stabilization bonds, according to a ministry official who asked not to be named because the person isn’t authorized to speak publicly about the details.
The government will submit its 555.8 trillion won budget bill to parliament on Thursday. The final size of the budget and bond sales will be released after approval from lawmakers, which is expected later this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - There are dollar bears, and then there's Ulf Lindahl.
The chief investment officer of currency manager A.G. Bisset believes the U.S. currency will plunge 36% against the euro over the next year or so, taking it to levels it has not seen in more than a decade. 
The greenback's recent weakness ""is the beginning of a very large move"" that could hurt the droves of investors exposed to it through their holdings in U.S. stocks and bonds, Lindahl said. 
Wall Street is swarming with bearish dollar forecasts, though few are as extreme as Lindahl's. The U.S. currency is near its lowest level in 27 months and is down about 11% from its 2020 peak against a basket of its peers, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UBS and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) among the banks forecasting more losses. (=USD)
Hedge fund bets against the dollar in futures markets are at their highest level in about a decade, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while 36% of fund managers in a recent Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research survey named shorting the dollar as their top currency trade for the second half of the year.

Getting the dollar right is key for investors, as its trajectory sways everything from corporate earnings to the prices of raw materials such as oil and gold. 
Lindahl's research breaks down the dollar's fluctuations over the decades into 15-year cycles that show the greenback weakening sharply against the euro before recovering most of the losses.
Though the dollar's drop has slowed in recent weeks, that's ""really an opportunity to get out of the dollar,"" he said.
Most bearish investors expect the dollar to depreciate on the back of stronger economic growth prospects outside the United States, rock-bottom U.S. interest rates, and concerns that programs to allay the coronavirus pandemic's economic fallout are inflating fiscal deficits.

Goldman Sachs, for instance, believes a steadily improving global economy and negative real rates in the United States are a ""sustained recipe for dollar weakness,"" and forecasts the euro to trade at $1.30 by 2023, from the current $1.196.
Analysts at TD Securities said the Federal Reserve’s revamped policy approach to inflation will keep the dollar under pressure, as it suggests interest rates will stay lower for longer. The greenback is about 10% overvalued against other major currencies, they said.
Robeco, a $174 billion asset manager, believes the dollar will lose ground because of ongoing compression in interest rate and growth differentials, said Jeroen Blokland, a portfolio manager at the Netherlands-based company.
A declining dollar can have a benign impact on markets, as it loosens financial conditions, boosts profits for U.S. exporters and makes it easier for countries to service dollar-denominated debt. 
U.S. investors holding foreign assets are also less apt to buy protection against dollar spikes when the currency is expected to remain weak, potentially increasing the profitability of their trades. 
""My portfolio at this moment is unhedged,"" said Lei Wang, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. ""(I'm) completely riding this strong other currency-weaker U.S. dollar phenomenon.""
At the same time, a prolonged dollar decline could send a more ominous signal, reflecting doubts about U.S. finances and economic growth, as well as a potential weakening of the dollar’s position as the world’s dominant currency.
Nearly half the respondents in the BofA survey said they expect global U.S. dollar reserves to decrease during the next year.
""There's a lot of speculation these days that the dollar will crash and lose its prominence as the global reserve currency,"" said Michael Gayed, portfolio manager at Toroso Investments/ATAC Rotation Fund. 
Others believe a reversal of risk appetite or better news on the U.S. economy could provide support for the dollar. 

Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s global chief investment officer of fixed income, expects the dollar to decline only modestly. The world's dependence on the greenback for trade and commerce will likely prevent a crash for the U.S. currency, he said.

Investing.com – The dollar fell to a more than two-year low Monday, as hopes the lower-for-longer interest rates will continue for a prolonged period were given a boost after Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida stressed the importance of the central bank's recent policy shift allowing inflation to run above target.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.28% to 92.12, to trade near its lowest level since May 2018.
""If policy seeks only to return inflation to 2% following a downturn,"" Reuters reported Clarida as saying, the previous approach ""will tend to generate inflation that averages less than 2%.""
To offset that risk, the Federal Reserve has made changes to its policy framework, with Chairman Jerome Powell in a speech last week laying out a plan to allow inflation to run above the 2% target to boost job growth and the overall economy.
Clarida also suggested that the central bank could revisit the idea of yield curve control – a measure to curb against rates running up too quickly, which would hurt lending activity.
The push to prioritize inflation could keep the dollar in the dark, experts have warned.
The domestic purchasing power of the dollar could to be eroded more quickly by higher inflation and ""it will be difficult to assume that the greenback will maintain its purchasing power on the FX market in the long run (not depreciate),"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The weakness in the greenback came as data showed speculators raised their bearish bets on the dollar.
The value of the net short dollar position increased to $33.68 billion in the week ended Aug. 25, compared with a net short of $31.56 billion the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was set for a fourth straight month of losses on Monday after a U.S. Federal Reserve policy shift on inflation, while the euro was poised to post a fourth month of gains, taking both currencies to levels last seen in 2018.
Investors are adjusting to a speech last Thursday in which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell outlined an accommodative policy change which is believed could result in inflation moving slightly higher and interest rates staying lower for longer.
""Even if U.S. central bankers are likely to be pleased about the interpretation of their measures, it is not good news for the dollar"", Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts commented. 
""If one expects the domestic purchasing power of the dollar to be eroded more quickly (as that is what inflation is) it is difficult to assume that it will maintain its purchasing power on the FX market in the long run"", they argued. 
""That is why EUR-USD is trading above 1.19, with the dollar index (DXY) trading below 92.50"", they concluded.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar rose 0.1% higher to 92.356 in early trading in Europe and is down 1.2% for the month.
If sustained that would be its worst August in five years and make for the longest run of monthly losses since the summer of 2017.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was steady at $1.1903 and on track for a 1% monthly gain, which would be its fourth straight month of increases.
With most of London's traders off on a banking holiday, attention now turns to a handful of Federal Reserve officials due to speak through the week, beginning with Richard Clarida at 1300 GMT Monday, as they put more flesh on the bank's new policy framework.
Eurozone inflation data on Tuesday and U.S. payrolls on Friday will also be closely watched.
Earlier the yen steadied on the view that Japan's next leader will stay the course on the 'Abenomics' economic revival programme.
The yen  eased by about 0.4% in Asia to 105.77 per dollar, having climbed as far as 104.195 on Friday in the wake of Shinzo Abe's resignation as prime minister for health reasons. 
Elsewhere trade was choppy as the boost to Asian currencies from a solid expansion in China's service sector had begun to fade a bit.
The Australian dollar  was down 0.2% after touching a 21-month peak of $0.7381 but remained set to post a fifth straight monthly rise, its best streak in over a decade and a 34% gain from March's trough.
The New Zealand dollar  made a post-COVID high of $0.6749 but also slightly retreated 0.2% thereafter. 
China's yuan hit a 14-month peak of 6.844 to the dollar in offshore trade  as investors cheer the services growth rather than fretting about a stalled rebound in manufacturing.

It later abandoned some gains and was last at 6.8556.

Investing.com -- The dollar was little changed against European currencies in early trading in Europe Monday, but fell to its lowest in 15 months against the Chinese yuan after a stronger-than-expected reading from a key Chinese business survey.
The offshore yuan, which trades more freely than the official rate on the mainland, rose as high as 6.8443 in Asian trading after the country’s official purchasing managers index rose to 54.5 in August from 54.1 in July. In a break with the prevailing pattern since the pandemic erupted, services performed more strongly than manufacturing, bolstering hopes that private consumption is finally recovering.
By contrast, the manufacturing PMI fell a little to 51.1.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China with ING, said in a research note that the figures showed China relying increasingly on domestic factors to drive growth, something made possible by its greater success in keeping the coronavirus under control.
Data from regional business surveys in the U.S. suggested, by contrast, that the recovery is reaching a short-term peak, with the main indexes in surveys for New York, Chicago and Philadelphia all falling last week. That puts the Institute for Supply Management’s national manufacturing index, due to be announced on Tuesday, on course for a modest decline, according to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Trading in Europe is set to be subdued on Monday by the U.K. public holiday, but both the euro and sterling remain well bid against the dollar in the wake of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech to the Jackson Hole symposium on Thursday, in which he announced a shift to what looks like an easier monetary policy for the foreseeable future.
Powell’s speech overshadowed one by the European Central Bank’s chief economist Philip Lane, who argued that the effect of monetary policy so far during the pandemic had been insufficient.
Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan noted that the ECB is likely to increase its bond-buying program further in the face of sub-target inflation, adding that this is all the more likely given the risk that the EU parliament may not approve the proposed European Recovery Fund on Sept. 18.
The euro was flat at $1.1905 at 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), supported by a report from Goldman Sachs saying that $1.25 is possible within 12 months. Sterling was unchanged at $1.3335, having tested a new high for 2020 over the weekend in response to a report that the government is planning a series of tax increases to plug a budget deficit that has exploded due to cover the cost of Covid-19-driven lockdowns.

Investing.com – The dollar inched down on Monday morning in Asia, giving up some earlier gains, with investors still digesting U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium the previous Thursday.
Powell's speech unveiled the Fed’s new approach to inflation, which has been interpreted to mean low rates for a longer period.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched down 0.09% to 92.293 by 10:09 AM ET (3:09 AM GMT).
Some investors remained bearish, with Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategists Kit Juckes and Olivier Korber saying in a note, “It seems clear to us that we are at the start of a multi-year period of dollar decline, from very elevated levels... our doubts, about whether the dollar can suffer a broad-based fall in the midst of risk aversion, global recession and particularly emerging market weakness, have been blown aside by the Fed.”
Meanwhile, investors will look to speeches from a few other Fed officials, with Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic both due to speak later in the day, for more clues on the Fed’s new approach to inflation.
“This week could see continued dollar weakness as the market looks for hints on the new framework... month-end rebalancing could also bring weakness at the beginning of the week.”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts warned in their own note.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.13% to 105.48. The yen saw gains after Sunday’s reports that Yoshihide Suga, Abe’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, intended to run for prime minister, after incumbent Shinzo Abe announced on Friday that he would be stepping down from the position due to poor health. If elected, Suga is widely expected to expand the fiscal and monetary stimulus programs rolled out under Abe.
The AUD/USD pair inched up 0.05% to 0.7369. The NZD/USD pair inched down 0.04% to 0.6740, with Auckland exiting lockdown on Monday after the government announced that the COVID-19 outbreak in the city is under control.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.12% to 6.8563. Earlier in the day, China released a manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) of 51 and a non-manufacturing PMI of 55.2 for August. Although the manufacturing PMI was slightly lower than the forecasted 51.2 prepared by Investing.com, the figures stayed above the 50-mark indicating expansion.

378,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- A rebound might be in sight for the Russian ruble after three straight months of losses.
The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter is one of the worst performers in emerging markets in the period, even as oil rebounded by almost 30%, prompting analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Sova Capital to suggest the ruble is fundamentally undervalued.
Seasonal weakness has been exacerbated by geopolitical risks, which have fueled concern about fresh sanctions against the Kremlin. If those fears don’t materialize, the ruble could go back to trading around the 70-per-dollar mark where it ended May, the analysts said. That implies a roughly 6% appreciation from current levels.
The risk premium has formed in large part due to concern that President Vladimir Putin will intervene in neighboring Belarus where mass demonstrations are calling for an end to President Alexander Lukashenko’s 26-year rule. The recent poisoning of Russian opposition activist Alexey Navalny has also helped fuel bets that the U.S. and European Union are about to slap more sanctions on the Kremlin.
Investors in Russia have good reason to be jittery about sanctions risk -- they’ve been caught out by unexpected turns in Putin’s interventionist foreign policy in the past. But James Barrineau, a veteran emerging-markets money manager at Schroder Investment in New York, argues that this time the market has got it wrong.
He’s holding onto his investments in ruble bonds on the logic that an explicit Russian intervention in Belarus is unlikely, while sanctions aren’t high on the agenda in the U.S. as it heads into election season.
“Whatever Russian influence is exerted in Belarus is likely to be exercised behind the scenes and is not likely to drive the story absent of widespread unrest that threatens to spill out of the country,” Barrineau said.
Finisterre Capital’s Damien Buchet said he has been looking for the right time to buy the currency. “The ruble was cheap at the end of July, and now it’s even cheaper.”
“When it comes to geopolitics, those headlines about Putin helping Belarus – I think it is the least he could do for a friendly country in an economic union with Russia. I’m not reading this as Russia overcommitting and confronting the West.”

379,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 04:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s resurgent common currency is looking powerful enough to get people talking about ‘King Euro’.
The currency has rallied more than 10% since virus turmoil shook global markets in March, buoyed by the European Union’s policy response to the crisis and as rock-bottom interest rates in the U.S. weaken the dollar. Hedge funds are now betting on another jump higher to $1.25 after U.S. elections, with options seeing the most bullish August on record.
It’s part of a wider trend that’s got Mizuho International strategists bestowing the title of king of currencies on the euro -- an accolade normally reserved for the greenback -- as uncertainty around November’s U.S. presidential vote helps to further burnish the appeal of European assets.
While the dollar typically gains in the months after election results, a win for President Donald Trump’s challenger Joe Biden could hurt the currency next year as the Democratic nominee has called for boosting taxes on wealthier Americans and increasing federal spending to spur a U.S. economy battered by the pandemic. Biden is leading in the polls.
“Building expectations for a Democratic sweep have likely played a role in weakening the dollar and strengthening the euro,” said Lee Hardman, foreign exchange strategist at MUFG Bank Ltd. in London. “Whether that continues ahead of the election will depend on whether the race tightens or not.”
Of course, other factors will also determine the euro’s future, not least the extent to which the region’s growth outpaces that of the U.S., and how well both sides of the Atlantic manage to control the continued spread of the coronavirus.
The Federal Reserve’s stance is also in focus, with Chair Jerome Powell announcing Thursday that policy makers will let inflation run higher. That’s a shift negative for the greenback, according to Jim Caron, portfolio manager in global fixed income at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
Still, forecasting market moves after an election is more of an art than a science. Either way, the vote is now the key event on traders’ horizons. Option markets show investors bracing for turbulence in the euro-dollar pair three months from now, then seeing volatility cool off gradually.
That’s not stopping hedge funds from betting the euro will trade above $1.25 after the elections, according to traders and brokers in Europe familiar with the transactions, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Renewed optimism for the euro’s prospects is also being reflected in options trades that have gone through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation this month. August has seen the greatest demand for exposure to euro gains since Bloomberg began compiling data, at twice the volume of bets on a downturn.
“The U.S. election has likely been a dollar-negative story insofar as a Democratic-led government could be associated with higher regulation and more taxation,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank in London, consistently a top forecaster in Bloomberg rankings. “The euro could benefit from this by default -- and probably already has.”
Some investors are placing sizable bets for an even bigger surge to $1.28 next year. That would be an 8% increase from current levels, and would take it to the highest since 2014. Other gauges of market positioning and sentiment for the next two years are flashing levels of bullishness on the euro seen only a few times in more than a decade.
Priced In?
Still, analysts say that in the shorter term the Biden effect may already be priced in. While MUFG forecasts the euro to end the year up about 1.5% at $1.20, it recently suggested tactically selling the euro against the dollar, expecting a correction after the common currency’s sharp gains. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey sees the euro at $1.18 in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020, little changed from its current level.
The euro’s rally could stall or backtrack if Trump wins a second term, unraveling regulation and delivering business-friendly policies. Bad news could also come if the virus leads to renewed lockdowns in Europe and sluggish economic data.
But that’s an increasingly niche view. Regardless of the U.S. election, Standard Bank’s head of foreign-exchange strategy Steven Barrow sees the euro climbing to $1.25 in six months. That would take it back to levels seen in early 2018, before two years of steady declines shook the faith of those calling for an end to the U.S. dollar’s hegemony.
New Haven
“My view is the dollar is going down and it doesn’t matter who wins,” Barrow said. “Countries like the U.S. have developed these huge current-account deficits that require inflows of capital, and the U.S. is going to stretch that further. U.S. assets are perhaps overvalued.”
And on the euro’s side, the agreement among EU leaders over a recovery fund has boosted the common currency’s credibility. That followed a myriad of political troubles that led investors to question if the bloc could stay together, from Brexit to Italy’s budget fights with the EU and pressure on the leaders of France and Germany.
Now the euro is emerging as a haven, according to Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho. The euro’s gains have outstripped the other traditionally safe currencies, the Swiss franc and yen.
“There is plenty of time for the ‘King Euro’ theme to run,” said Chatwell. “It can compete with the dollar for being the western currency of choice for trade purposes, and can compete more generally with other safe haven currencies as being a credible, long-term store of capital.”

380,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank is probably a step closer to aiming for periods of inflation above its goal now that the U.S. Federal Reserve has adopted that strategy, according to economists and its former vice president.
The Fed’s new approach, unveiled by Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, is to seek inflation that averages 2% over time. That would allow it to tolerate a faster pace after periods of weakness, avoiding early interest-rate hikes when price growth moves close to its target.
President Christine Lagarde could find that a tempting option as she resumes an ECB strategy review that was delayed by the pandemic. It would allow her to keep monetary policy looser for longer, worrying less about the hardliners who tend to talk about reining in stimulus even on the rare occasions that inflation has neared the current goal of “below, but close to, 2%.”
“I can’t help but think that the Fed has been setting the tone across major central banks,” said Piet Christiansen, chief strategist at Danske Bank. “I’m sure the ECB would weigh the pros and cons of this measure.”
Low inflation has been a longstanding concern for major central banks. The worry is that it morphs into deflation -- a downward spiral of prices and wages that has historically wrecked economies -- during a shock, such as the current pandemic. They’ve responded by pumping trillions of dollars worth of currency into the financial system, with only limited success.
Former ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio is among those saying his prior employer would benefit from so-called average inflation targeting, especially because price stability is its primary mandate. In contrast, the Fed has in the past pointed to full employment as evidence it has met at least part of its dual mandate.
The ECB will soon have the chance to take such a step. It’s conducting its first strategic review since 2003, expected to conclude in the second half of next year. The Fed did a similar evaluation before deciding on its latest change.
Lagarde’s wide-ranging appraisal includes climate change and digitalization, but the reasons for low inflation -- globalization, aging populations and weak productivity -- are at the core.
The key question is whether the current goal itself is part of the problem, by encouraging policy tightening too soon.
It could prove to be a thorny topic. Officials such as Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who has frequently opposed looser ECB policies, and Austrian Governor Robert Holzmann, who’s suggested a lower inflation target, may have to be persuaded of any shift that allows price gains above 2%.
Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who has previously endorsed a look at average inflation targeting, declined to speculate much when he spoke at an event hours after Powell’s announcement.
“I won’t anticipate the result, but you can be reassured that a credible and symmetrical inflation objective will remain at the heart of our action,” he said.
A change might also be a hard sell publicly. Years of extraordinary monetary stimulus has stoked criticism, with politicians in some countries regularly lambasting the ECB for the impact on savers. Its deposit rate has been below zero for six years.
“The Fed saying this is different from the ECB saying it, because the Fed had actually hiked rates several times,” said Rishi Mishra, an analyst at Futures First. “So they can say ‘hey, we might have been too hawkish last time around. This time, we would wait longer.’ What would the ECB say? ‘Hey, we have been waiting forever, and would continue to wait forever?’”
Economists and strategists including Carsten Brzeski at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and Frederik Ducrozet at Pictet & Cie reckon the ECB will change its goal, but that it won’t follow the Fed entirely, in part because of skepticism on the Governing Council.
More likely, it’ll settle on a so-called “symmetric” goal of 2% with flexibility, they say. In practice, that means it’ll tighten policy when inflation is above that rate, and loosen when it’s below, but won’t rush too quickly to do so.
“There won’t be a majority at the Governing Council to simply copy the Fed’s move,” said Brzeski. “In the euro zone, the concept of average inflation targeting has been more controversial.”"

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Friday, giving back early gains after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell outlined a new strategy to lift employment with an increased tolerance for higher inflation.
At 2:40 AM ET (0640 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.4% at 92.653. GBP/USD was up 0.5% at 1.3263 - just off a new high for the year - while EUR/USD was up 0.4% at 1.1866.
Speaking at the virtual Jackson Hole symposium on Thursday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed would target an average inflation rate of 2%, countering years of super-low inflation.
Powell’s comments prompted U.S. Treasury yields to rise to their highest levels in several months, helping the dollar. However, this support didn’t last long as traders factored in higher inflation going forward and the impact this would have on real yields.
“The Fed keeping rates lower for longer – and showing greater tolerance for higher inflation – is a key ingredient in the current narrative of negative U.S. real yields de-basing the dollar,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“The key barrier to a further immediate sell-off in the dollar, however, is positioning. Net speculative shorts against the dollar and long EUR/USD positioning are close to the extremes of March 2018.”
Elsewhere, the USD/JPY pair fell 0.3% to 106.20, after Reuters reported that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has decided to resign, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Abe was scheduled to hold a news conference at 4 AM ET (0800 GMT).
Public broadcaster NHK earlier said Abe, who has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years, wanted to avoid causing problems for the government due to the worsening of his condition.
“There's some nervousness and concerns because he's the longest serving prime minister and, with him gone, there could be some uncertainty. Perhaps 'Abenomics' is coming to a close. And perhaps we could see some repatriation and this is why the yen has strengthened somewhat,” said Moh Siong Sim at Bank of Singapore, in a Reuters report.
""I'm not convinced it would have a lasting impact on the yen itself, because if the news is true, whoever the successor is likely to come from the LDP and is likely to be a close ally and therefore policy continuity would still be there.""
 "
382,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Although Shinzo Abe is expected to resign over health problems, few are anticipating drastic changes from the next Japanese prime minister. His most likely successors may only tweak Tokyo’s approach to everything from China ties to monetary policy.
Since taking power in 2012, Abe has touted unprecedented monetary easing and a flexible fiscal policy to revive the economy -- a package dubbed “Abenomics.” He has worked to build a personal bond with U.S. President Donald Trump, while at the same time seeking to smooth over ties with Japan’s biggest trading partner, China.
One of the reasons Abe has endured to become Japan’s longest-serving prime minister has been the lack of open dissent in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Some potential candidates may be holding fire while he’s in office, but a large degree of continuity is likely in managing the world’s third-largest economy.
“There is little choice but to continue with aggressive fiscal policy and monetary easing giving the state of the economy, especially after the pandemic,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. “If a new leader wants to upend economic policies, that would cause yen gains and stock falls. No one wants that.”
Here are some of his most likely successors:
Shigeru Ishiba, 63, former defense minister
No national election need be held until 2021, so a new LDP leader would succeed Abe as premier. Polls show Ishiba is the voters’ top choice to take over. He has backed economic policies seen as more populist than Abe’s and said in an interview in April that too much wealth was accumulating in the hands of stockholders and company owners. He has also cast doubt on the sustainability of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy.
On the international front, Ishiba has been aligned with Abe in trying to keep ties with China on a steady path. Ishiba last month urged an LDP group to think about the consequences of its call for the cancellation of a planned state visit to Tokyo by President Xi Jinping. Ishiba, however, has been far more hesitant than Abe about attempting to change the country’s pacifist constitution.
Taro Kono, 57, defense minister
Current Defense Minister Kono is a fluent English speaker and graduate of Georgetown University. He expressed interest in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper earlier this month in working closely with the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which brings together Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. That could suggest he is willing to step up joint pressure on China.
In 2017, Kono urged the Bank of Japan to lay out a strategy for exiting its ultra-easy monetary policy. He is also known for favoring cost-cutting policies and this year canceled plans to deploy the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense shield from U.S. firm  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT)., citing the cost of adapting it to meet Japan’s safety requirements. The move was popular with voters.
Fumio Kishida, 63, former foreign minister
Abe has touted Kishida as a potential leader, appointing him as foreign minister and then to a senior party post. But the mild-mannered former banker has so far failed to build a public profile.
Seen as more dovish than Abe, Kishida sealed an ill-fated deal with South Korea in 2015 that was meant to end a dispute over women trafficked in brothels run by Japan’s military during World War II. But that accord eventually ended in rancor.
In an interview with broadcaster TV Tokyo on Monday, Kishida said he expected interest rates to remain low, given the state of the economy. He called for plentiful spending to combat the economic crisis, but urged caution on the idea of cutting the sales tax. Kishida also mentioned the need to return to fiscal discipline later.
Yoshihide Suga, 71, chief cabinet secretary
Having served as chief cabinet secretary -- or Abe’s right-hand man -- since 2012, Suga is a continuity candidate, who could be tapped as a caretaker if the premier steps down suddenly. In 2007, Abe resigned from an abbreviated first term in office, saying a worsening of chronic ulcerative colitis made it impossible to carry out his duties.
Although Suga hasn’t laid out an alternative policy platform, he has pushed particular issues, including controversial government subsidies for domestic travel during the virus pandemic. “However many times I’m asked, I’m not thinking of it at all,” Suga said in an interview on Thursday when asked if he hoped to succeed Abe.
Taro Aso, 79, finance minister
Aso, like Suga, is part of Abe’s inner circle and is Japan’s long-serving finance minister and deputy prime minister. Given his age, he’s unlikely to serve as premier for more than a caretaker period. He served an unsuccessful year in the post in 2008-2009, at the end of which the Democratic Party scored a landslide election victory over the LDP.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hit a two-week high against Japan's yen on Friday, supported by U.S. bond yields, which rose on the Federal Reserve's aggressive new strategy to lift employment and an increased tolerance for higher inflation.
Investors in Asia are also keenly awaiting a briefing from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later in the day, as worries about his health fuelled wider concerns about his leadership and what that might mean for economic relations with the United States.
The safe-haven yen fell against the dollar, dropping 0.26% to 106.695 per dollar , its lowest since Aug. 14 and edging near this month’s low of 107.05.
Speaking at the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium, which was held virtually this year, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will seek to achieve 2% inflation on average, so that periods of super-low inflation would likely be followed by an effort to lift inflation ""moderately above 2% for some time,"" and to ensure economic recovery and job creation.
""Since FOMC meeting in June, the treasury yields have declined and the dollar fell, but I think that will not be the case for the time being, especially after the Fed's speech. The market is more likely to see higher treasury yields,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. 
The benchmark 10-year (US10YT=RR) yield, which rises when bond prices fall, rose to 0.7700% in Asian trade, a level unseen since June 16.
""It's clear we saw a 'buy the rumour, sell the fact' play out, notably in U.S. Treasuries, which have led broad market moves,"" said Chris Weston, Head of Research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.
""The move higher in Treasury yields post-Powell did promote a USD rally, although we find it flat on the day, with a mixed picture across the well-traded FX pairs.""
Following Powell's comments, the dollar initially fell sharply against the yen and the euro, but reversed as longer-term U.S. Treasury yields bounced back to their highest levels in months.
The yen also fell against the euro (EURJPY=), the Australian dollar (AUDJPY=) and the New Zealand dollar (NZDJPY=) on higher U.S. Treasury yields.
The euro changed hands at $1.18565 (EUR=), after almost hitting last week’s low of $1.17545 overnight.
Against six major currencies, however, the dollar index (=USD) edged down 0.23% to 92.817, erasing its earlier gains.
Traders in the yen now shift their focus to Japanese Prime Abe's news conference.
Ruling party officials have said Abe's health is fine, but his recent hospital visits, one of which ran nearly eight hours, have fanned speculation whether he will be able to continue in the job until the end of his term in September 2021.
""There is no doubt the relationship between Prime Minister Abe and President Trump has stabilised U.S.-Japan ties. That has been a positive factor, or a support for the dollar/yen,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan market research at J.P. Morgan.
""There wouldn't be any immediate, direct impact to the market since politics affect the market only subtly. However, if the possibility arises that such relationship between the two countries could change, that would gradually become an instability factor,"" he said.
Elsewhere in the currency, the offshore yuan last traded at 6.8724 per dollar .
The British pound changed hands at $1.3243 , after hitting its highest since Dec. 31 of $1.3284 on Powell's comments.

The Australian dollar  rose 0.37% to $0.72860 , while the kiwi  gained 0.36% at $0.6662 per dollar.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, giving up some of its earlier gains as the rally from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s new strategy to increase employment, and tolerance for higher inflation, wore off.
Speaking at the Jackson Hole symposium on Thursday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed would target an average inflation rate of 2%, countering years of super-low inflation.
Although the dollar fell against the yen and euro immediately after Powell’s comments, it gained back the losses as U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest levels in several months.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.20% to 92.802 by 12:24 AM ET (5:24 GMT).
Some investors were optimistic that the rising treasury yields would continue to boost the dollar.
“Since the FOMC meeting in June, the treasury yields have declined and the dollar fell, but I think that will not be the case for the time being, especially after the Fed’s speech. The market is more likely to see higher treasury yields,” Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, told Reuters.
But other investors struck a more cautious note.
“It’s clear we saw a ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’ play out, notably in U.S. Treasuries, which have led broad market moves,” said Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston
“The move higher in Treasury yields post-Powell did promote a USD rally, although we find it flat on the day, with a mixed picture across the well-traded FX pairs.”
Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair was up 0.26% to 106.83. Investors are now awaiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s press conference, due to take place later in the day, where Abe is widely expected to address the state of his health and whether he will remain in the post.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.42% to 0.7288 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.34% to 0.6660.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.22% to 6.8770 and the GBP/USD pair gained 0.34% to 1.3243."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was flat Thursday, shrugging off a surge in U.S. treasury yields after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell laid out the central bank's plan to boost inflation and strengthen the recovery. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was flat at 92.99. The sluggish move in the greenback comes despite better-than-expected housing data and a surge in U.S. rates as the 10-year yield rose to a more than 24-month high.
Pending home sales, which measure signed contracts to purchase existing homes, increased 5.9% in last month from the prior month, according to the National Association of Realtors.
In a speech, Powell delivered an update on the bank's monetary policy framework review that would allow a more flexible approach to target inflation and allow labor market to run hot as the central bank seeks to adopt policy strategies to ensure a robust economic recovery. 
Under the proposed tweaks, ""employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation,"" Powell said. On the inflation front, the Fed will use ""appropriate monetary policy"" to a achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""
The proposed changes, barring the move to let the labor market run out, were largely expected, and likely suggests the Federal Reserve will continue keep rates lower for longer to avoid a previous policy misstep of hiking rates too soon. 
""The Fed now obviously judges that it hiked rates too soon and too quickly after 2015, which was a root cause for the persistent undershooting of the inflation objective. To rectify this policy error, the Fed adopts a strategy better suited to a low inflation/low growth/low yield environment,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
After falling sharply since March, the dollar recently has showed signs of stabilizing as the surge in Covid-19 cases across the U.S. appears appears to be abating. The rebound in the greenback may persist as the threat of a second wave of the virus in other countries, which will hurt economic growth, remains likely.
""The economic figures for June and July reflect the significant positive impact of a number of public health restrictions being lifted. However, the situation hasn’t fully returned to normal, and several industries are still struggling to make up for lost ground. What’s more, the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall still appears realistic without a vaccine or an effective treatment. Under these circumstances, investors could be more cautious in the coming months, which leads us to believe in a rebound of the U.S. dollar,"" Desjardins said."

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, with investors looking to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for guidance as to how the central bank might alter its policy framework to help the U.S. recovery.
 At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.942. GBP/USD was flat at 1.3208 while EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1824.
Powell is scheduled to  address the Fed's annual central bankers' conference later Thursday, usually held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but being conducted virtually this year because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
The Fed chief is expected to discuss the results of the central bank's framework review, a study started nearly two years ago to explore how monetary policy should be adapted for a low interest rate environment. He is scheduled to begin his speech at 9:10 AM ET (1310 GMT).
Many expect Powell to reiterate support for an ongoing expansion of monetary policy to ensure the economic recovery remains on track, probably by advocating average inflation targeting. This would see the Fed allowing inflation levels to climb above its 2% target.
“There are, however, a couple of little problems with this. How does the Fed get inflation higher? And how does it make policy even more accommodative,” asked Robert Carnell at ING, in a research note.
“The entire credibility of such a strategy rests on the Fed being able to convince markets that these goals are achievable,” said Carnell. “Indeed, it runs the risk of simply drawing attention to how much inflation targets are being missed - more a credibility damaging shift, than a credibility enhancing one.”
Elsewhere, the USD/JPY pair rose 0.1% to 106.03. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is due to address concerns over his health, and potentially tender his resignation, at a press conference on Friday.
The yen is likely to gain should Abe decide to resign, as his departure could see a shift in the policy of the aggressive monetary easing that has been one of his trademark policies.

387,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A mega share sale by Ant Group is likely to boost demand for the Hong Kong dollar, pinning the currency at the strongest it is allowed to trade and prompting government intervention.
The Hong Kong dollar has repeatedly touched 7.75 versus the greenback this week, the strongest it can technically trade. That has prompted the city’s de facto central bank to sell the local currency for the first time in three weeks to defend its foreign-exchange peg to the U.S. dollar.
The strength comes as billionaire Jack Ma’s fintech giant Ant filed for a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Tuesday that could raise a total of $30 billion and exceed Saudi Aramco’s record initial public offering. Large listings like this often drive up demand for funding because investors need to set aside cash to buy the stocks.
“We expect the Hong Kong dollar to re-test 7.75 in the near future,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank. “More IPOs and secondary listing of firms listed in the U.S. will boost the demand for the Hong Kong dollar. Meanwhile, the upbeat investment sentiment and flush global liquidity may lead to equity inflows.”
The Hong Kong dollar has been hovering near the strong end of its trading band since April, shrugging off the death of a long carry trade and escalating China-U.S. tensions. The strength has prompted the authorities to sell the equivalent of $14.8 billion of the local currency to weaken it. The maneuvers have expanded the interbank liquidity pool to the largest since 2017, sending the one-month interest rate on the currency to a four-year low.
Previous mega listings have also caused dramatic spikes in the interbank borrowing costs, known as Hibor. In 2018, the one-month tenor on the rate soared to the highest level in a decade ahead of Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp.’s $4.7 billion IPO. Funding costs also spiked last year in the months before an $11 billion share sale by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
The Hong Kong dollar was little changed at 7.7503 as of 11:39 a.m. local time. The one-month Hibor was steady at 0.26089% Thursday. The rate affects the cost of everything from mortgages to corporate loans.

Investing.com - The pound continued to rack up gains against the dollar, shrugging off sinking hopes of progress on Brexit talks after Germany reportedly scrapped plans to continue negotiations, citing a lack of recent progress, according to UK media reports.
GBP/USD rose 0.49% to 1.3207. 
The German government scrapped plans to discuss Brexit during a meeting of EU ambassadors on Sept. 2, the Guardian reported. ""Since there hasn’t been any tangible progress in EU-U.K. negotiations, the Brexit item was taken off the agenda,” the Guardian reported, citing an EU diplomat. The news comes as a blow to hopes that both sides will break the deadline in post-Brexit talks, which are set to resume on Sept. 7.
But the pound, which is up about 16% against the dollar since March has been moving in tandem with risk assets like stocks, shrugging off worries over the risk of a no-deal Brexit - the U.K. leaving the European Union without a deal. This resilience in the wake of sullied post-Brexit talks is unlikely to continue for a prolonged period of time, Morgan Stanely warned.

“EUR/USD has been facing some downward correction after an extended rally, but we continue to see the pair’s fundamental drivers pointing at further strengthening and we, therefore, keep our 1-month target at 1.20,” said analyst Francesco Pesole at ING, in a research note.
These fundamental drivers were illustrated Tuesday by the German Ifo survey showed stronger-than-expected business sentiment, while U.S. consumer confidence tumbled to the lowest in more than six years due to concern about the coronavirus-induced job losses.
Overnight, the German government said it will extend its job support scheme through the end of next year, while French Prime Minister Jean Castex said his government will announce new stimulus measures on September 3.
Additionally, data due to be released later in the day is expected to show that U.S. durable goods orders slowed in July, with 4.3% growth month-on-month forecast for July. Orders grew by 7.6% month-on-month in June.
Attention is now focusing on U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and his speech at Thursday’s Jackson Hole symposium, for guidance on the Fed's strategy moving forward.
“I expect Powell to use forward guidance to send a dovish message that rates will remain low for a long time, which feeds into dollar weakness. You could say we are in a long-term correction of excessive dollar strength,” Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank, told Reuters.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD was flat at 1.3150, having risen 0.7% against the dollar on Tuesday, with sterling shrugging off a lack of progress in trade negotiations between Britain and the European Union.
“Sterling’s net positions jumped to a five-month high, moving into net longer territory (+3% of open interest) in the week ending Aug. 18,” said ING’s Pesole.
“In our view, this continues to highlight how GBP is underpricing the risk of a no-deal outcome of current UK-EU trade negotiations, which in turn flags a non-negligible risk of more stress being built into sterling in the coming weeks.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against most currencies on Wednesday as traders braced for U.S. data expected to show a slowdown in durable goods orders and a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
The yuan rose toward a seven-month high after U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal, which eased concerns about a diplomatic standoff between the world's two-largest economies.
The greenback took a hit after data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence tumbled to the lowest in more than six years due to concern about the coronavirus-induced job losses.

The dollar managed to hold onto slim gains against the yen , last trading at 106.51 due to a slight rise in long-term U.S. Treasury yields.
Powell's speech at Jackson Hole - held online due to the coronavirus outbreak - is by far the biggest event of the week, but the data calendar leading up to Thursday has been discouraging.
Data later on Wednesday is forecast to show growth in U.S. durable goods orders slowed in July, following from the U.S. consumer confidence report for August, which fell to the lowest since May 2014 - highlighting policymakers' concerns about the economy.
The onshore yuan  rose to 6.9032 per dollar, approaching a seven-month high after Washington and Beijing affirmed their trade deal.
The mood also brightened after Ant Group,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s fintech arm and China's dominant mobile payments firm, filed for a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai to raise as much as $30 billion in what would be the world's largest initial public offering.
Trading in other currencies could be subdued due to a lack of major economic releases during the Asian session.

The State Bank of Vietnam, the nation’s central bank, facilitated net purchases of about $22 billion worth of foreign exchange last year, which had the effect of undervaluing the dong in a range of 4.2% to 5.2%, according to the letter. The purchases were estimated to have pushed down Vietnam’s real effective exchange rate by 3.5% to 4.8%.
The Treasury’s assessment is part of an investigation by the Commerce Department into alleged subsidies on passenger vehicle and light truck tires from Vietnam. A new federal rule published this year in the U.S. allows the Commerce Department to treat currency undervaluation as a factor in determining countervailing duties on a trading partner.
Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment, while a representative for the central bank wasn’t immediately available to comment.
The Treasury’s move is a sign that the U.S. could cite Vietnam for a second violation in a semi-annual report on foreign exchange policies of major trading partners.
In the January release of that report, Vietnam was judged to have violated just one of three criteria that the Treasury uses to assess a currency manipulator -- namely, it had a bilateral goods surplus of $47 billion, the sixth-highest among the U.S.’s major trading partners. Economies with at least two violations are added to a monitoring list.

Investing.com – The dollar eased on Tuesday, as a fall in consumer confidence stoked investor worries about the pace of the recovery and offset data showing a decline in the number of new U.S. infections.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.22% to 93.88.
The dollar's struggles come in the wake of economic data suggesting the strength of the U.S. consumer, the backbone of the economy, could be on the wane.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge unexpectedly fell to 84.8 this month from 91.7 in July, missing economists’ forecast for a reading of 93.
While the drop is not expected to affect consumption in the third quarter, some warned of a threat to growth in the final quarter of the year.
""The drop in confidence and household cash flows will not prevent a huge increase in Q3 consumption, because the base effect created by the plunge in March and April and the subsequent rebound is enormously powerful, but it does threaten Q4,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The sluggish day for the greenback comes in the wake of declining coronavirus cases in the U.S. from a peak seen a just weeks ago, which many had attributed, in part, to the weakness in the world's reserve currency.
""Since the end of July, the number of cases in the U.S. are showing a significant downward trend. Recently, however, the rate of infection - average new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 7 days - remained constant at around 13, "" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The greenback will come under added focus later this week on Thursday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to present the results of the central bank's review of its monetary policy strategy in a speech at the Fed's virtual conference. Normally, this conference is held annually in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The central bank launched the review nearly two years ago in an effort to meet its policy objectives more effectively, with the sluggish pace of inflation a key concern among policymakers.
Average inflation targeting, which would allow rates to run above the central bank’s 2% target, has been at the heart of the Fed’s policy framework review, with the central bank widely expected to adopt a form of average inflation targeting at the September meeting. The move would see the Fed loosen the reins on its 2% inflation target, which was established in the 1980s in an effort to pursue clearer policy objectives.
Overall, many expect the Fed chief to lean dovish and reiterate support for an ongoing expansion of monetary policy to ensure the economic recovery remains on track."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury has determined that Vietnam's currency was deliberately undervalued in 2019 by about 4.7% against the dollar, according to a new currency valuation assessment sent to the U.S. Commerce Department late on Tuesday.
In the assessment associated with a Commerce anti-subsidy investigation into vehicle tire imports from Vietnam, the Treasury said the undervaluation was the result of Vietnamese ""government action on the exchange rate.""
The assessment is the first issued by the Treasury under a new U.S. rule that allows the Commerce Department to consider currency undervaluation as a form of subsidy when determining anti-subsidy duties, potentially increasing them. 
The determination also could increase the chances that the Treasury designates Vietnam a ""currency manipulator"" when it issues its long-delayed semi-annual currency report. Such a designation would require Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to seek bilateral consultations with Hanoi to try to correct the situation. 
In its assessment letter to Commerce, the Treasury said Vietnam made $22 billion state foreign exchange purchases in 2019, including through the State Bank of Vietnam, which pushed down Vietnam's real effective exchange rate by 3.5% to 4.8%, the Treasury said.
It said the country's action caused the dong exchange rate, which was a nominal 23,224 per dollar in 2019, to be about 1,090 dong lower than levels consistent with equilibrium real exchange rates.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower in early European trade Tuesday, although losses are minor as traders await direction from the latest U.S. consumer confidence readings but also from the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat later in the week.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.245. USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.11, while GBP/USD was up 0.2% at 1.3093.
The market has adopted a ‘risk-on’ stance Tuesday, helped by the aggressive stance from the Trump administration towards the authorization of potential Covid-19 treatments, as well as trade talks occurring between the U.S. and China aimed at resolving concerns around the Phase 1 trade deal reached between the two countries in January.
However, traders are waiting for more concrete guidance after the greenback's recent sharp fall - it's lost over 4% in the last two months. The U.S. August consumer confidence readings, due later in the day, are expected to rise slightly, but it’s the Fed that attracts the most attention.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a speech at Thursday’s virtual Jackson Hole symposium, and is widely expected to flag a looser policy in the future, with tweaks to how it defines its inflation target.
“Powell could hence put the USD in the (Jackson) hole if he aggressively hints of an upcoming combined YCC [Yield Curve Control] and AIT [Average Inflation Targeting] regime. If such regimes were to be announced in tandem, it would likely be USD negative, (extremely) gold positive and a final push for the ‘negative real yields forever’ bet,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. 
Elsewhere, EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1801, as the euro pushed higher against the greenback, helped by an upward-revision to an earlier estimate of German economic output.
Earlier Tuesday, data showed the German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter. A dreadful number, but still better than the first reading that said the economy shrank by 10.1% in the period.
“The only good thing about all this data is that it provides a final glance in the rearview mirror,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “Looking ahead, it does not take a rocket scientist to predict that the economy will have one of its best quarterly performances ever in the third quarter. All activity indicators point to a continuing increase during the summer months.”
Investors will now look to the release of Germany's Ifo Business Climate index, due at 0800 GMT, where a small rise is expected.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, amid the wait for U.S. August consumer confidence readings, due later in the day, which are expected to rise slightly, and firmer guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve on the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a speech at Thursday’s Jackson Hole symposium themed “Navigating the decade ahead: Implications for monetary policy.” Powell’s speech is widely expected to address the Fed’s strategy moving forward, with the focus zeroing in on the 2% inflation target.
“If we don’t get dovishness, I expect you might actually get rates rising and pop up higher in the U.S. dollar,” Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer told Reuters.
“The dollar has had a massive fall since March. I think what we’re seeing now is any excuse to buy it back as the punters who have been short all the way down get quite nervous and take the money off the table,” Speizer added.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies edged down 0.11% to 93.207 by 9:48 PM ET (2:48 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.04% to 105.93.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.22% to 0.7177 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.12% to 0.6533.
The USD/CNY pair edged down 0.13% to 6.9092. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in a “regularly scheduled call,” with both sides seeing progress made on resolving issues in the phase one trade deal between the two countries, the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office said in a statement.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.20% to 1.3089, despite the latest round of Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union showing little signs of progress.
Elsewhere across the pond, disappointing data from the European Union, if coupled with the same from the U.S., could see the euro move in either direction.
“We expect more consolidation in euro/dollar this week because of early signs the Eurozone economic recovery is losing momentum,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy said in a note.
“Rising COVID-19 infections in some European countries is a key downside risk to the Eurozone’s growth outlook,” Mundy added."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Tuesday, shrugging off selling pressure from a move higher in equities, as investors seemed to temper their bearish bets against the greenback ahead of a Thursday speech from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
The dollar, which often falls when stocks rise as investors seek out riskier currencies, had inched higher overnight -repelling the Australian dollar back under 72 U.S. cents and pushing the euro below $1.18.
It hung on to those gains early in the Asia session and the Aussie  last traded at $0.7162 and the euro (EUR=EBS) at $1.1791. It was steady on the yen  at 105.97 per dollar.
Fed Chair Powell on Thursday addresses a virtual Jackson Hole symposium with the theme ""Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for monetary policy."" Investors expect he might address the bank's strategy - especially its 2% inflation target, with speculation that could become an average rather than nominal aim.
""If we don't get dovishness, I expect you might actually get rates rising and pop up higher in the U.S. dollar,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer.
""The dollar has had a massive fall since March,"" he said. ""I think what we're seeing now is any excuse to buy it back as the punters who have been short all the way down get quite nervous and take the money off the table.""
A small overnight rise in yields also supported the dollar and against a basket of currencies (=USD) it held the line at 93.282, about 1.3% higher than a two-year trough it hit a week ago. 
It is about 9.4% below its March peak, though there are signs its decline is slowing as it is broadly steady in August. Net bets against the dollar eased from a nine-year high last week and the U.S. currency has made ground broadly in recent days.
Sterling  was pressured back below $1.31 to last fetch $1.3071, and not helping was lack of progress in the latest round of Brexit talks with the European Union.
The oil-sensitive Canadian dollar  fell about 0.3% overnight to 1.3238 per U.S. dollar, even though oil prices rose. The New Zealand dollar  has been unable to trade above 66 cents for a week and last sat at $0.6524. 
Elsewhere the Indian rupee  had on Monday jumped nearly 1% to a five-month high as traders were surprised by the absence of central bank dollar buying.
Besides Powell's speech, investors are also looking ahead to Germany's IFO Business Climate index, due at 0800 GMT, and expecting a small rise.
U.S. August consumer confidence figures are also due at 1400 GMT and another small rise is expected. Softer-than-forecast data on both continents last week suggests there is downside risk on the data, which could send the euro in either direction.
""We expect more consolidation in euro/dollar this week because of early signs the Eurozone economic recovery is losing momentum,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Kim Mundy in a note.

""Rising coronavirus infections in some European countries is a key downside risk to the Eurozone's growth outlook.""

Investing.com – The dollar cut its losses to trade near session highs on Monday, as investors continued to rein in bearish bets even as many expect Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will continue to reiterate support for further monetary easing.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.08% to 9367.
Speculators reduced their bearish bets on the greenback for the first time in seven weeks, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. The value of the net short dollar fell to $31.56 billion in the week ended Aug. 18, from net shorts of $32.12 billion the previous week.
The slight fall in bearish positions against the greenback comes days ahead of remarks from Powell, who will present the results of the central bank's review of its monetary policy strategy in a speech at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo, on Thursday.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened slightly in early European trade Monday, weighed down a touch by U.S. authorization of a new coronavirus treatment, but losses have been minimal as traders look for guidance to future U.S. monetary policy from the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat later in the week.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.135. USD/JPY was largely flat at 105.81 and GBP/USD was up 0.2% at 1.3107.
The U.S. Food and Drugs Administrations on Sunday said that it had issued ‘emergency use approval’ for the use of blood plasma from recovered patients as a treatment option for certain patients suffering from the effects of the Covid-19 virus. The announcement comes at the start of a week that will see President Donald Trump formally receive the Republican Party's nomination for re-election at its national convention.
This has helped the ‘risk-on’ tone, to the detriment of the greenback, but losses have been minor as many investors are waiting for more definitive news of a credible vaccine.
Additionally, the main focus this week is likely to be on the Federal Reserve, and Governor Jerome Powell’s opening speech at the Jackson Hole conference, even if it’s a virtual event.
Investors are expecting to hear news about the central bank’s long-awaited review of its monetary policy framework. 
“Once again, the market will be on the look-out for any indications that the Fed is close to adopting Average Inflation Targeting and to better understand the conditions that would prompt Yield Curve Control,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
The quantitative easing that the Fed has deployed so far has flooded financial markets with excess liquidity and weighed on the dollar. Last week the dollar index fell to the lowest level in more than two years.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD edged higher Monday, gaining 0.1% to 1.1802, but the single currency has pulled back slightly from a two-year high versus the dollar reached last week following disappointing manufacturing and services sector data for Europe released on Friday, against a backdrop of rising numbers of Covid-19 cases.
“With Covid cases resurgent in many parts of the world, the fear is now that we’ve seen the best of the recovery figures and that V-shape expectations will take a knock in September,” added ING. 
The common currency's next major hurdle is the release of the closely-watched German  Ifo sentiment survey on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against major currencies on Monday as traders looked to more data for a gauge on the health of the global economy and the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole retreat for guidance on the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.
Sentiment for the greenback has improved somewhat due to supportive data on business activity and home sales, but there are still concerns that additional monetary easing may be necessary to keep economic growth on track.
Currencies showed little reaction to U.S. authorization of a coronavirus treatment that uses blood plasma from recovered patients as many investors are waiting for definitive news of a credible vaccine.
Traders in the yuan, and across the broader financial markets, are also nervously watching Sino-U.S. ties as President Donald Trump's wide-ranging diplomatic dispute with China shows no signs of abating.
""There could be a short-term bounce in the dollar, especially against the euro,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""In the long term, the dollar will resume its decline because the Fed has to commit to aggressive easing for an very long time."" 
Against the euro (EUR=D3), the dollar held steady at $1.1795, clinging onto gains made late last week.
The British pound  bought $1.3092 and traded at 90.11 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The greenback fetched 0.9126 Swiss franc , holding onto a 0.5% gain from Friday.
The yen held steady, with the dollar changing hands at 105.87 yen , showing little reaction after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe entered hospital on Monday amid speculation about his health.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will discuss monetary policy on Thursday at the opening day of the Kansas City Fed's annual symposium.
This year the meeting will be held online, and not at the hunting and fishing resort of Jackson Hole, Wyoming because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The quantitative easing that the Fed has deployed so far has flooded financial markets with excess liquidity and weighed on the dollar.
Last week the dollar index (=USD) against a basket of six major currencies fell to the lowest in more than two years. It was last trading at 93.218, little changed from Friday.
The world's policymakers have unleashed an unprecedented wave of monetary easing and fiscal support to offset the economic drag caused by the pandemic.
However, many countries are now battling a second wave of infections, which could further delay a full-fledged economic recovery.
As usual, investors will also be watching out for a further run of data this week for clues on the global economy, including a second estimate of U.S. GDP for the second quarter as well as weekly jobless claims and some second tier Asian indicators. 
The euro was on the defensive following disappointing manufacturing and services sector data for Europe released on Friday. 
The common currency's next major hurdle is the release of the closely-watched Ifo sentiment survey on Tuesday.
The euro has pulled back slightly from a two-year high versus the dollar reached last week, which makes it vulnerable to short-term profit taking, some analysts say.
Net short positions in the dollar declined from a more than nine-year high hit a week earlier, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, which suggests that the greenback's declines could start to slow.
The speculative community has been short the U.S dollar since mid-March.
The onshore yuan  traded at 6.9196, little changed on the day amid lingering doubts about frayed U.S.-China ties.
Trump on Sunday raised the possibility of decoupling the U.S. economy from China as part of a broad-ranging dispute with Beijing over China's role in global trade and advanced technology.
The Australian dollar  held steady at $0.7165 after the state of Victoria reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections in seven weeks on Monday, fuelling optimism that a deadly second wave there is subsiding.

The New Zealand dollar  was little changed at $0.6534 after the government extended a coronavirus lockdown in Auckland by four more days.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is widely expected to discuss monetary policy during the Jackson Hole symposium. The two-day event will open on Thursday.
Some investors were cautiously optimistic that the greenback will see short-term gains if Powell provides clearer guidance on Thursday.
“There could be a short-term bounce in the dollar, especially against the euro,” Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities, told Reuters.
The euro has been gaining at the dollar’s expense, in the afterglow of the European Union passing a recovery package for its members in July.
Globally, central banks, including the Fed, have rolled out unprecedented measures, such as monetary easing, in response to the economic impact of COVID-19. But the pace of global recovery has seen a setback, with countries such as South Korea battling a resurgence of cases, meaning that additional measures could be necessary.
Ishikawa warned, “in the long term, the dollar will resume its decline because the Fed has to commit to aggressive easing for a very long time.”

Singapore’s large pool of fiscal reserves is proving to be a boon for the nation’s currency.
The city state’s dollar advanced to its highest level in six months last week -- erasing its pandemic-driven losses -- after the government unveiled another stimulus package, financed in part by unused expenditure from earlier budgets.
With the total for pledged pandemic aid now over S$100 billion ($73 billion), there could be more gains to come as the spending eases pressure on the Monetary Authority of Singapore to lower the currency band it uses to manage inflation.
“The ability to dig deep into fiscal reserves from years of surplus is unequivocally an advantage,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. He sees the local dollar strengthening beyond 1.36 versus the greenback, from $1.3718 at 7:30 a.m. local time on Monday.
Analysts at Malayan Banking Bhd. forecast the currency to head toward 1.35 while options contracts signal an almost even chance that the Singapore dollar will finish the year stronger than this level.
Singapore’s fiscal buffer is in marked contrast to the situation in many other developed economies, which have relied on increased debt and rate cuts by central banks to fund stimulus.
The MAS, which has two scheduled policy decisions a year, took unprecedented action in March of lowering the midpoint of the currency band and reducing its slope to zero. Deputy Managing Director Edward Robinson said this month that the monetary response remained appropriate.
With central bank’s next scheduled policy decision is not due until October, the immediate focus of the market will be the next round of economic data from Singapore and the broad direction of the greenback.
Mizuho’s Varathan said his current forecast for Singapore;s currency may be conservative, given the “bearish USD impulse” in markets.
Figures due Monday are projected to show core consumer prices fell 0.4% in July from a year ago, versus a drop of 0.2% a month earlier.
Industrial production numbers on Wednesday may paint a more upbeat picture, with output estimated to rebound 4.0% in July from June, while still down 6.4% from a year earlier.

Investing.com – The dollar rose on Friday, and remained set to end the week in the green following stronger-than-expected economic data, but some experts have warned the reprieve for the greenback will likely be short-lived.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.47% to 93.12.
The Commerce Department said existing home sales rose by a record 24.7% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million units., topping forecasts for a 14.7% rise.
A survey of U.S. business activity also helped to ease fears about slack in the economic recovery.
IHS Markit data showed flash Composite Purchasing Managers' index of 54.7 for August, above forecasts of 51.3.
The greenback has come under pressure in recent months as the spread of coronavirus, which has since eased, spiked across the U.S.
But the damage the second wave of the virus has had on the economy will continue to weigh and force the Federal Reserve to continue with stimulus measures, threatening to send the dollar on a wild swing lower again.
""Although infections with the Covid-19-virus have now stabilized in the US, the relatively rapid outbreak of a second wave of the virus there has clearly tarnished the image of the dollar as a safe haven,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.  
With the Federal Reserve in the midst of tweaking its forward guidance to link monetary policy to the achievement of concrete macroeconomic goals, investors continued to expect that the Fed would stick to its ""expansionary monetary policy much longer than was the case after past crises,"" the bank added.

Investing.com - The Russian ruble slumped Friday, falling to a three-month low against the dollar amid renewed political turmoil in the region, fueling fears of additional sanctions. 
At 9:10 AM ET (1310 GMT), USD/RUB was up 1.4% at 74.8355, trading at levels last seen in early May and up over 20% year to date.
Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was hospitalized Thursday, following fears of a suspected poisoning. 
The 44-year-old lawyer has never challenged President Vladimir Putin at the ballot box but is the highest-profile leader of Russia's deeply divided government opponents.
His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, is said to have written a letter to Russian president Vladimir Putin requesting permission for Navalny to seek medical assistance in Germany.
This is increasing attention on the region at a time when the prospect of Russian intervention in Belarus, in support of beleaguered President Alexander Lukashenko following disputed presidential elections, is appearing increasingly likely.  
“The fear of Russian ‘military’ intervention like in the Ukraine and imposition of further sanctions on Russia poses downside risks for the ruble,” said analysts at MUFG Bank, in a research note earlier in the week.

407,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. economy rebounded faster than expected in August but the figures were clouded by warnings of an impending crisis for retailers, a jobs crunch, ballooning public debt, and signs that trade talks with the European Union will fail.
While IHS Markit’s monthly Purchasing Managers Index, which measures private-sector business activity, jumped to a seven-year high, the report showed that business confidence declined and companies continued to cut jobs.
Employment fears also proved a drag on consumer confidence, taking the shine off data showing retail sales volumes recovering to pre-virus levels.
The British Retail Consortium said the sales figures “mask a crisis” in the sector. Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LON:MKS) this week announced 7,000 job cuts, adding to a string of bad news on employment and store closures in recent weeks.
Hours later, U.K. and EU officials said there’s been little progress in talks for a trade deal when the Brexit transition finishes at the end of the year. That sent the pound to fresh lows on the day.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“We expect things to get tougher in the fall as the government’s furlough scheme ends and unemployment increases. The speed of recovery is likely to take a big leg down in the fourth quarter.”
--Dan Hanson. 
The U.K.’s upturn so far has been fueled in part by huge state spending that’s pushed government debt above 2 trillion pounds ($2.6 trillion) for the first time. While that’s affordable for now because of ultra-low borrowing costs, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said “difficult decisions” will be needed.
One of those is what to do with his flagship furlough program, which has protected millions of jobs and is currently scheduled to end in October. That could mean another hit to the labor market, hitting consumer spending and derailing the economy’s revival from its record 20% slump in the second quarter.
The fragility of the rebound means an extension of the furlough program “in some form or another is necessary,” according to economic historian Robert Skidleksy.
“But it can’t be for too long -- you can’t go on paying people for doing nothing,” said Skidelsky, emeritus professor of political economy at Warwick University. Instead, the government should use the extension to prepare for the next phase of policies to bolster growth and create jobs, he said in an interview.
The dilemma of how to wind down aid, yet still support growth and contain the virus, is also playing out across Europe. Most governments oppose reinstating widespread lockdowns to control the pandemic again after severe restrictions earlier in the year pushed the continent into an unprecedented recession.
The euro-area economy received its own warning on Friday, with the composite PMI for the region unexpectedly falling, signaling a slowdown in its rebound after an initial surge.
That justifies the caution among European Central Bank policy makers, who were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the health of the economy from the early signs. The ECB and the Bank of England are both considering whether they’ll need to add more monetary stimulus in coming meetings, with economists largely predicting they will.
In the U.K., another report from the Confederation of British Industry showed manufacturing is “stuck in the doldrums.” It said that factory output is still more than 20% below normal conditions."
408,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- After tapping the bond market at a record-shattering pace in recent months, Corporate America is more indebted today than ever before.
And while much of that fresh cash -- more than $1.6 trillion in total -- helped scores of companies stay afloat during the pandemic lockdown, it now threatens to curb an economic recovery that was already showing signs of sputtering. Many companies will have to divert even more cash to repaying these obligations at the same time that their profits sink, leaving them with less to spend on expanding payrolls or upgrading facilities in months ahead.
The over-leveraging of America’s corporate sector is not a brand-new development, of course. It’s been building for more than a decade, ever since the last crisis -- the housing-market meltdown -- prompted the Federal Reserve to pump unprecedented amounts of cash into the economy, a policy tool that it has taken to new heights during the pandemic as it has supported corporate credit markets.
But in a sign of just how pronounced the borrowing overhang has become, the average junk-rated company had debt levels relative to earnings that were so high in the middle of the year, according to a new analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence, that they almost would have tripped do-not-touch alerts from banking regulators a few years ago. Those warnings back then only applied to a handful of borrowers. Had regulators not opted to drop these warnings, they could today apply to far more.
“An overburdened corporate sector is likely to grow less rapidly and that could slow the whole recovery down,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp.
A slower recovery could have wide-reaching implications in financial markets. Many securities prices reflect investors’ expectation that profits will normalize next year, when in fact it could take at least two or three years, said Lale Topcuoglu, senior fund manager and head of credit at J O Hambro Capital Management in New York. She sees many junk bonds as being overpriced.
“It just seems absolutely incredible how much people are closing their eyes and buying,” Topcuoglu said.
Companies have seen their debt burdens grow in recent months as their earnings have plunged in the pandemic. That pain is expected to increase through the rest of 2020 as sales continue to deteriorate compared with the prior year, even if borrowing levels stay the same.
Corporations have also been borrowing heavily as the Fed has slashed short-term interest rates to near zero and supported credit markets through, for example, buying company bonds. Lower rates have spurred investors to buy higher-yielding, riskier securities, which has allowed even junk-rated firms to borrow more to tide them over during the crisis. High-grade issuers have already sold more bonds in 2020 than any other full year in history. Junk corporations have surpassed 2019’s total already.
Much of the debt sold in recent months has refinanced maturing borrowings at lower rates, and some companies are holding on to the money they raised as cash and may end up not spending it. In general, the fact that companies managed to stay afloat during the pandemic is a good thing compared with the alternative of even more corporations having gone bankrupt. But not all companies can access that credit -- smaller borrowers, for example, are often getting shut out.
And there will probably be a hangover. Many companies were groaning under their debt loads even before the Covid-19 pandemic, and now will have to work harder to cut borrowings as earnings remain depressed. Even if companies are hanging on to the money they borrowed, they must still pay interest on it, and could eventually use the cash if the pandemic drags on.
The ratio of total debt to a measure of earnings known as Ebitda for investment-grade companies was 3.53 in the second quarter for the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Corporate high-grade index, according to an analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s the highest in data going back to 1998, and is up from 3.42 in the first three months of the year, when the impact of the pandemic was only just beginning to show up in earnings. It compares with a 20-year average of 2.65.
For high yield, that leverage ratio stood at a record 5.42 at the end of June, up from 4.93 at the end of March and 4.44 at the end of 2019.  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc., the car rental company, had debt equal to 27 times earnings as of June 30, up from five times at the end of March, as it burned cash in the second quarter, although that figure could improve later this year as its earnings start to rebound. In 2016, banking regulators pushed back against leveraged buyouts that left companies with ratios above six.
With corporations shunting more of their earnings toward paying interest and paying down debt, they will struggle to hire and invest as much as they would at the end of a more conventional recession, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. That could translate to a relatively sluggish recovery instead of the fast, “V-shaped” one many investors hope for.
“The debt overhang is going to be a headwind for capital spending and for hiring, not just in the second half of the year but probably into next year as well,” Feroli said.
Lower Yields
Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (NYSE:BUD) is rated investment grade but had a net leverage ratio in the second quarter of nearly five, a level more commonly associated with junk ratings, as demand for its beer fell in bars and restaurants. At the end of 2019 that ratio was a still-high four, and the company had been trying to cut it to closer to two times. AB InBev’s debt load swelled after its massive acquisition of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc in 2016.
With short-term interest rates having fallen to near-zero levels, borrowing is cheaper for most companies than it was just a year ago. Average yields on U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds touched all time lows of 1.82% earlier this month, and are still hovering near those levels, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data.
But companies still have lower earnings relative to their required interest payments. The ratio of their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to their interest expense, known as their interest coverage, fell to 5.8 in the second quarter for investment-grade companies, compared with a 20-year average closer to 7. The June 2020 level was the lowest since 2003. For junk-rated companies, the interest coverage ratio fell to 2.3 in June, also the lowest since 2003.
Ratings firms are taking note of the broad downward trend in credit quality. S&P Global Ratings downgraded more U.S. high-yield debt in the second quarter, relative to upgrades, than any time in at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Credit metrics have been eroding despite some evidence that the economy is stabilizing or even recovering. As of Thursday, more than 80% of the S&P 500 companies that posted second quarter results performed better than analysts’ average expectations, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.
Even with that improvement, the economy is still weak. Corporate earnings per share fell by about a third in the second quarter from the same period last year, and are likely to fall in the third and fourth quarters as well. Debt loads are also higher, and strategists expect leverage and interest coverage to erode further.
Liquidity, Solvency
Some of the worst credit deterioration has happened for transportation companies, which have suffered as customers have stayed home. For junk-rated companies, leverage in the transportation sector jumped to a staggering 10.77 times for the second quarter, up from 5.24 times in the first quarter, driven largely by the airlines.
The consumer cyclical sector also saw a large increase in leverage ratios, to 7.51 from 5.29 in the first quarter, driven in part by cruise lines and the fall of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. into junk.
Investors have given companies a break for about a year and are looking ahead into mid-2021 or later to evaluate where they will perform after, for example, the world finds and distributes a Covid-19 vaccine. That explains why cruise companies that are burning cash, such as  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd. and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp., have been able to borrow repeatedly, and have seen most of their new bonds trade well above the price at which they were originally sold.
But even if bond prices are broadly rising, investors need to be cognizant of the risks they’re buying, said Schwab’s Jones.
“This cycle is very different because we’ve had so much support from central banks and we have so much liquidity in the market,” Jones said. “But the old saying ‘liquidity does not equate to solvency’ is something people need to keep in mind when they’re investing.”"
409,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The euro is becoming the go-to currency for safety and liquidity as we approach the U.S. presidential elections and investors bet on a rocky time for the dollar. This may be a source of pride for European policy makers in how they’ve handled the pandemic so far. Unfortunately, it’s a potential problem for exporters on the continent, not least its manufacturers.
As Kit Juckes, a currency analyst at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), puts it: “The dollar’s very overvalued but the euro isn’t very undervalued.”
With signs that hedge funds are taking option exposure on a rising euro, the recent move into the single currency could easily turn into an investor stampede if dollar flight takes hold. As I’ve written before, this would put European Central Bank Governor Christine Lagarde in a very tight spot because she’d find it hard to fight against an overly strong euro. The ECB doesn’t have an official mandate to manage the currency, but its actions definitely help. It is close to being maxed out on policy responses as it already has a giant pandemic bond-buying program and deeply negative interest rates.
The minutes from the July meeting of the ECB’s governing council, released on Thursday, noted that several policy makers questioned whether the 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) quantitative-easing program for the pandemic should be fully used. That’s not a sign that printing more euros, or taking measures that would weaken the currency’s ascent, are available options.
Isabel Schnabel, the ECB’s executive director for market operations, also said optimism in the financial markets (read all-time highs for U.S. stock markets) “raised questions regarding the robustness and resilience of current investor sentiment.” She has a point. If the S&P 500 index were to correct sharply it would push the dollar lower, and the biggest beneficiary could be the euro as it’s the next most liquid currency. The euro area relies on exports for growth, so this could choke a Covid recovery.
There’s also a widening gap between America’s economic sentiment and its stock performance. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s minutes from its July 29 meeting gave a gloomy assessment of the economy, downgrading second-half growth estimates. Weekly U.S. jobless claims rose by more than 1 million. For some investors, this is an obvious risk to start hedging against.
The effect is showing up in the bond markets too. Wednesday’s auction of 30-year German bonds was the best on record in terms of demand, despite offering a negative yield. This was reportedly driven by foreign interest. It makes sense for Japanese pension funds and insurers to hedge some of their foreign-currency bond exposure out of the dollar if they fear it will weaken further.
With the European Union finally joining up its fiscal and monetary response, it might end up being a victim of its own success. The euro area doesn’t need to perform particularly well economically to attract inflows as it’s simply the next best place to park money after the U.S. If the dollar does lose its shine, the euro could become too popular for its own good.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Friday, amid doubts about the pace with which the U.S. economy will rebound from the coronavirus-inspired slowdown.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.662. USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 105.57, while EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1868.
Dragging the greenback lower was the news Thursday that applications for U.S. unemployment benefits increased,  defying consensus forecasts for a further decline, while the Philadelphia Fed reported a disappointing reading for its manufacturing index.
This came a day after the Federal Reserve warned that the path to U.S. economic recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak remained highly uncertain, with the recovery in hiring starting to slow.
“A widening budget deficit paired with a continued trade deficit is an issue for the USD,” said analyst Andreas Steno Larsen at Nordea, in a research note, “but mostly when the rest of the world catches up growth-wise, as has been the case since the reopening of the global economy during Q2.”
The euro has been the biggest beneficiary of a recent decline in the dollar, but this tone could be tested with the release of eurozone manufacturing data later in the session.
That said, “the EUR has much further to go when/if the market realizes that the tail risks in the EUR are much smaller now compared to 9-12 months ago,” Larsen said, adding that the USD could weaken by as much as 20-25% over the coming two years, aiming “for (at least) >1.25 levels in EUR/USD.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.3240, helped retail sales rising above their pre-coronavirus level in July, as shops selling non-essential goods opened again after the lockdown in March.
Retail sales volumes rose by a much stronger than expected 3.6% from June and were 1.4% higher than in July 2019, the Office for National Statistics said, representing a sharp recovery from double-digit falls in April and May.
Additionally, USD/CNY dropped 0.1% to 6.9071, after earlier falling below 6.90 for the first time since January.
The Chinese currency has responded favorably to the idea that the trade agreement between China and the U.S. could well stay intact despite a recent escalation of tensions, as Beijing confirmed the two countries plan to hold talks soon and White House economic advisor Lawrence Kudlow said he expected China to make major purchases of U.S. oil and other exports soon."
411,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 01:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Sovereign bonds in India fell after the minutes of the central bank’s interest rate-setting panel meeting showed its members have turned more hawkish over inflation, pushing back bets on further rate cuts.
The yield on the new 5.77% 2030 bond rose five basis points to 6%, after gaining 18 basis points in the previous two weeks. Traders are watching for demand at a 300 billion rupee bond sale on Friday after last week’s auction of the new benchmark 10-year paper had to be rescued by underwriters.
The rate panelists fretted over a recent surge in consumer inflation, preferring to wait for price pressures to wane before considering more steps to address the “deepest contraction in history,” minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s Aug. 4-6 meeting published Thursday showed. The fading rate cut hopes come even as the central bank is yet to show its hand on further bond purchases to help ease a record 12 trillion rupees supply in the fiscal year.
“We now believe we are at the end of the rate cut cycle and expectations of large cuts must be anchored (ideally 25, base case 50) as inflation is unlikely to materially decline from the current levels,” Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, wrote in a note. “We believe it would better serve the financial markets if RBI continues to resort to unconventional policy measures.”"
412,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan rallied beyond a key level versus the greenback for the first time in seven months while outperforming Asian peers, as investor confidence gets a boost on planned trade talks with the U.S.
The onshore yuan climbed as much as 0.29% to 6.8960 per dollar on Friday, breaching 6.9 for the first time since January. The currency has risen more than 0.6% this week, outpacing gains in all Asian exchange rates except the Japanese yen.
Fueling the yuan’s strength are bets that a trade agreement between China and the U.S. will stay intact despite a recent escalation of tensions, as Beijing confirmed the two countries plan to hold talks soon. The Asian nation is buying “a ton of” commodities as part of the deal, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this week. The dollar’s plunge to a two-year low has also strengthened the yuan against it.
“The next important level to watch is 6.85, where we will likely see resistance as traders may think the currency should fall after a quick rally and Beijing may worry it’s too strong,” said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “The yuan will likely test that level soon, as investors price in less uncertainty in terms of trade relations between China and the U.S.”
The yuan’s rebound this month isn’t limited to its rate against the greenback -- the currency has advanced for a third week versus a basket of 24 peers, the longest streak since March. That’s a reversal from July, when the yuan tumbled against its peers to the lowest level this year.
The turnaround is a catchup trade as the yuan underperformed peers amid drops in the greenback, due to the Chinese government’s tighter controls on the foreign-exchange market. Also, it suggests that investors are buying the yuan not only because of dollar weakness but also China-specific reasons, such as Beijing’s trade relations with the U.S. and the country’s economic recovery.
“With the People’s Bank of China likely unfettered about the yuan strength versus the dollar, and an escalation in trade war unlikely, we could see the yuan now set sights on 6.85 to 6.87,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at Axicorp Ltd.
Meanwhile, technical indicators are flashing conflicting signals on where the yuan may go next. While the currency is overbought according to its relative strength index, it also saw a golden cross last week that may prelude further gains.
The onshore yuan rose 0.1% to 6.9082 as of 12:29 p.m., while the offshore rate stood at 6.9019. The offshore currency also briefly traded stronger than 6.9.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, as an unexpected rise in the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits and a slight decline in Treasury yields dampened investor sentiment.
Data released by the U.S. on Thursday said that 1.106 million Americans claimed unemployment benefits during the previous week, surpassing the forecasted 925,000 claims prepared by Investing.com as well as last Thursday's 971,000 figure.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was flat, inching down 0.09% to 92.692 by 10:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT)
The large number of claims, added to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s warning of a slowdown in hiring just a day before, led to investor concerns about the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 and how to deal with the excess dollars already in circulation, thanks to massive quantitative easing programs that have rolled out by the Fed
“Sentiment for the dollar is weak, reflecting all the QE and the decline in real U.S. yields,” Monex Securities credit trader Tsutomu Soma told Reuters.
Investors are widely expected to continue favoring the euro due to the European Union (EU) reaching agreement on a COVID-19 recovery package for its members in late July.
Comparatively, across the pond, the U.S. Congress has yet to reach a consensus on the latest stimulus measures up for debate, another reason for investors to favor the euro.
‘The euro is strong because Europe has already put a firm backstop in place to support economic growth, which has boosted confidence in the euro and euro zone bonds,” Soma added.
The GBP/USD pair edged up 0.12% to 1.3226.
In Asia, the lack of major economic data ushered in a quiet end to the week as currency moves in the region were subdued on Friday.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.08% to 105.70.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.13% to 0.7200 and the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.6538.
The USD/CNY pair inched down 0.10% to 6.9077, with U.S.-China tensions continuing to simmer despite China confirming plans to reschedule talks with the U.S. to discuss trade and other matters. The talks were originally scheduled to take place on August 15."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive against most currencies on Friday after a rise in U.S. jobless claims and a dip in Treasury yields dampened the appeal of holding the greenback.
The euro, which has been the biggest beneficiary of a recent decline in the dollar, will come into focus later on Friday as traders brace for euro zone manufacturing data.
A larger-than-expected rise in weekly U.S. jobless claims came just one day after Fed officials warned that a recovery in hiring is starting to slow, raising doubts about how quickly the world's largest economy will bounce back from the coronavirus.
Concern about the U.S. economy, combined with an excess supply of dollars already in circulation due to the Fed's massive quantitative easing, are likely to weigh on the U.S. currency in coming weeks, analysts say.
""Sentiment for the dollar is weak, reflecting all the QE and the decline in real U.S. yields,"" said Tsutomu Soma, a credit trader at Monex Securities.
""On the flip side, the euro is strong because Europe has already put a firm backstop in place to support economic growth, which has boosted confidence in the euro and euro zone bonds.""
The dollar stood at $1.1866 per euro (EUR=D3) on Friday in Asia following a 0.2% decline in the previous session.
The British pound  bought $1.3218, holding onto a 0.8% gain made on Thursday.
The dollar also nursed losses against the safe harbour Swiss franc , last trading at 0.9071 in Asia on Friday.
The greenback was quoted at 105.73 yen  after a 0.3% decline on Thursday.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose back above the 1 million mark last week, data showed on Thursday in a setback for a U.S. job market that has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.
A slight decline in Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) was another factor working against the greenback.
The dollar index (=USD) against a basket of six currencies fell 0.3% on Thursday.
Sentiment for the dollar and risk assets like equities had already taken a hit after dovish minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting, which were released on Wednesday.
Currency moves could be subdued during Asian trading due to a lack of major economic data and concerns about friction between the United States and China.
Traders in the euro are looking ahead to the release later Friday of manufacturing data for the euro zone and for Germany, Europe's largest economy.
The growing consensus is the euro will continue to edge higher because European governments have taken decisive action on stimulus measures to support growth.
In comparison, U.S. Republicans and Democrats are still at loggerheads over additional economic stimulus, which analysts said is another reason to favour the euro over the dollar.

Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar  edged up to $0.7208, while the New Zealand dollar  held steady at $0.6543.

Investing.com – The pound continued its strength against the dollar on Thursday, shrugging off growing concerns that the U.K and EU are unlikely to find a breakthrough on the latest round of post-Brexit talks, which concludes on Friday.
GBP/USD rose 0.71% to $1.3192.
With the latest U.K.-EU trade talks set to end on Friday, there are few betting that both sides will be able to find common ground on key sticking issues including access to British fishing waters and the level playing field rules - a set of common rules to ensure firms in the U.K. and EU compete on an equal footing.
Investor focus would now shift to the final round of trade talks in September, to see whether a deal can be struck.  EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that a deal would need to be agreed to by October to allow time for the EU to ratify the agreement.
Without a trade deal the U.K. would have to trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms, which many say are harsher than the current trade pact, which expires at the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31.  
Earlier this year, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided against extending the transition period beyond the end of 2020, and signaled optimists that a deal could be reached by the fall.
Despite the strong day of gains for the pound, GBP/USD will likely find resistance at the $1.32-to-$1.33 price level in the absence of a U.K.-EU trade deal, which is not likely until the last minute in September or October, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) said."

Hedge funds are becoming even more bullish on the euro. Not only are they betting the currency’s rally will continue, they see it rising to a level last seen in early 2018.
Interest to buy euro options that payout on another 5% advance over the next six-months is strong, according to two traders and a broker in London, all of whom are familiar with the transactions. The euro traded little changed at $1.1836 as of 10:44 a.m. in London.
The chances of a Democratic Party win, and what that means to U.S. fiscal plans, are among the main drivers of the dollar’s weakness, the traders added, asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.
It isn’t just hedge funds. Bullishness on the euro has lifted risk reversals across tenors to between 60 to 80 basis points, a phenomena that’s only happened three times since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2006. In all cases, the euro rallied by more than 5% within a few months.
And such is the conviction in the euro’s long-term strength that, despite falling against the dollar on Wednesday by the most in more than four months, risk reversals hardly budged on tenors one-month out. While the common currency is still benefiting from the dollar’s misfortunes, it’s also riding high on optimism over the fiscal and monetary union shown in the euro area.
Data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation for options trades that went through this month show a strong preference for euro calls instead of puts. Some are even buying structures that pay out if the euro advances to $1.28. That’s an 8% increase from current levels, and the highest since 2014.
Economic data out of the U.S. and the European Union due Friday could be drivers for both the euro and the dollar.

417,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The clock is ticking on the dollar’s long-enduring bull cycle.
After nine years of strength, the currency is being assailed from all sides. This year, the Federal Reserve joined other central banks in slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, wiping out the dollar’s advantage vis-à-vis the euro and yen. Ballooning debt and deficits have eroded foreign investment in the U.S. And trade-weighted measures suggest the dollar’s decline is overdue.
For the doomsayers, they finally herald the beginning of the end. It’s reminiscent of previous turning points in 1985 and 2002, when abrupt policy shifts upended the dollar and ushered in protracted periods of weakness. Now, a bleaker growth outlook in the U.S. compared with Europe could hasten the reversal. It’s little wonder the greenback has slumped to a two-year low following its worst month in a decade, and traders -- on a net basis -- are shorting it for the first time in years.
“The dollar has been overvalued for a long time, and this might finally be a catalyst for a multi-year downtrend,” said Brandywine Global Investment Management’s Jack McIntyre. “As we’ve seen before when valuations have been stretched, a policy or economic shock can quickly change the currency’s trajectory and that’s what seems to be happening thanks to the Fed’s swelling balance sheet, a surge in debt, and the way we handled the pandemic.”
Granted, die-hard bears have been sounding alarms about the dollar’s imminent demise for years now, only to be wrong time and again. Whether it’s inflation, America’s twin deficits or the Fed’s easy-money policies, fears over dollar debasement have done little to diminish its standing in the real world.
The currency still accounts for more than 60% of global reserves and is the most widely used for international transactions by far. What’s more, the end of the bull run doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the dollar, according to BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management’s Liz Young.
“There’s a difference between there being a pullback in the dollar and there being a complete collapse,” she said. “This is a pullback. It’s a little extreme to think the dollar is going to lose its reserve status anytime soon.”
Nevertheless, a chorus of prognosticators including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) says this time is different, and the greenback’s reckoning has been a long time coming. Climbing 30% from its nadir 12 years ago, it has been the most overvalued major currency based on real effective exchange rates -- which take into account countries’ relative trade balances -- since 2014, according to the Bank of International Settlements. The dollar is also around 16% stronger versus the euro based on OECD’s purchasing-power-parity data.
History suggests that once triggered, dollar strength could quickly unravel.
Plaza Accord
The first bull cycle occurred between 1980 and 1985, when the greenback almost doubled in value. But once the world’s richest nations signed the Plaza Accord to depreciate the dollar and help the U.S. pull out of its recession, the dollar soon lost all of that and more.
The second cycle began around 1995 and lasted seven years before ending amid speculation President George W. Bush wanted a weaker currency to boost exports and manufacturing. The greenback went on to slump 33% in the following two years.
“Dollar cycles are long and persistent, and we are now at the top end of valuations,” said Guillermo Felices, head of research and strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management’s multi-asset group. He predicts a dollar retreat over several years. “Ultimately, relative monetary policy is a key driver. The Fed continues to be the most aggressive and proactive central bank when it comes to policy stimulus, and that is likely to continue to be the case.”
The Fed has committed to keeping rates close to zero for years to come as central bank officials try to mitigate the economic fallout from the pandemic. But its efforts have been hamstrung by the U.S.’s failure to get a grip on the virus, even as countries in Europe and Asia have been more successful in containing its spread.
That’s weighing on the outlook for U.S. growth, which has pushed down long-term government bond yields closer toward the rest of the world and raised expectations for more deficit-inflating stimulus. In a more dire signal for the dollar, inflation-adjusted real yields are now negative, reaching record lows in July.
Wall Street heavyweights including Jeffrey Gundlach and Ray Dalio are among those taking notice. Gundlach said earlier this year his strongest market conviction is a weakening dollar on the back of rising U.S. government and trade deficits and a pullback in foreign investment. Dalio sees U.S.-China tensions resulting in a capital war that will lead to the currency’s decline.
Throw in doubts about the U.S. election and the federal government’s haphazard response to the coronavirus and you’ve got hurricane-force headwinds for the currency at home as well.
Indeed, speculative investors turned net short on the currency in June for the first time in two years. And the options market shows increased demand for wagers against the dollar, with a gauge of one-year risk reversals for the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index on a firmly bearish trajectory.
Euro calls are trading at a premium to puts across tenors out to a year, a rare phenomenon that’s occurred just two previous times -- during March’s turmoil and the financial crisis.
Meanwhile, falling U.S. government bond yields have also zapped currency-hedging costs, knocking out another tailwind for the dollar.
Until earlier this year, those costs were sky high -- a product of U.S. short rates being far above those of other countries -- and made it unprofitable for many overseas investors to protect against dollar fluctuations. As a result, some foreign insurers and asset managers chose to buy U.S. assets unhedged, buying dollars in the process.
But that hedging expense has evaporated after the Fed slashed rates to near-zero. Foreign investors can now buy dollar assets and hedge back into their local currencies at lower costs, without any benefit for the greenback.
“That hedging aspect is underplayed,” said Tim Graf, EMEA head of macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. “It’s a potential source of a long-term dollar downside. We know foreigners own loads of U.S. equities and bonds and they can now be hedged with very little cost.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, helped by the Federal Reserve offering few clues that it intends to take a more dovish approach to help the U.S. economic recovery in the near future.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 93.067. USD/JPY was flat at 106.11, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3072 while EUR/USD was flat at 1.1841.
The path to economic recovery for the U.S. economy from the Covid-19 outbreak remains highly uncertain, the Federal Reserve warned, according to minutes from its latest meeting, released on Wednesday.
However, the Fed did not appear to be prepared to change its monetary policy objectives at the forthcoming September meeting, suggesting that the introduction of yield curve controls or average inflation targets are still some way away.
Speculation has been rife the Fed will adopt an average inflation target, and seek to push inflation above 2% to make up for years it has run below, as part of a broader policy review.
In the emerging markets sphere, Turkey’s central bank is scheduled to meet later Thursday, with most analysts expecting it to leave its benchmark one-week repo interest rate unchanged at 8.25%.
The Turkish lira has fallen to record lows against the U.S. dollar in recent times on concerns that low interest rates, depleting FX reserves and a flood of easy credit could pave the way to a second currency crisis in as many years.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs, putting pressure on policy makers led by Governor Murat Uysal not to raise interest rates to support the currency.
The central bank’s approach is now effectively to tweak the cost of funding on a daily basis, varying the amount of liquidity available to lenders. 
Turkey’s central bank “will likely attempt more backdoor tightening before eventually being forced to hike rates outright later this year,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., in a Bloomberg report.
At 3:00 AM ET, USD/TRY traded 0.3% higher at 7.3094.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Long positions across most Asian currencies were comfortably raised, a Reuters poll found, as investors turn increasingly optimistic of the region's economic rebound with confidence in the U.S. dollar waning and China primed for a recovery.
Long bets on the Chinese yuan , for example, shot up to their highest since early 2018, a fortnightly poll of 15 respondents showed, with investors consistently raising wagers since turning bullish in July.
With unprecedented amounts of liquidity pumped into markets by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, investments that would have otherwise been considered risky at a time of an economically-devastating pandemic have turned attractive.
The dollar, often viewed as a safe-haven, is set for its fourth straight monthly decline, trading at a more than two-year low.
""The U.S. dollar is likely to weaken over the next 12 months as global growth accelerates and the narrowing in real interest rate differentials continues to thwart the greenback,"" BCA Research strategists wrote in a note at the end of last week.
Though fragile, recent economic data from China, the world's second-largest economy, has pointed to a nascent recovery. Long bets on both South Korea's won  and the Malaysian ringgit  climbed to more than two-year highs. 
Despite many Asian economies suffering double-digit contractions in the last quarter due to lockdown measures, many investors say the worst is probably over.
""The recovery is now being seen as something more sustainable, which is driving inflows back into Asia and supporting Asian currencies against the dollar,"" said Wei Liang Chang, a macro strategist at DBS.
Long positions on the Philippine peso , the region's top performer so far this year, were also sharply raised to their highest since early 2013.
One currency that investors have remained bearish about is Indonesia's rupiah , an interest rate carry trade favourite, on expectations of further monetary easing this year.
While rates were kept on hold on Wednesday after the vast majority of poll responses came in, analysts are still factoring in further cuts this year over other fiscal and monetary measures.
""Markets are concerned about the fiscal burden sharing with BI (Bank Indonesia), possible fiscal slippage, as well as the diminished yield attractiveness of the rupiah,"" DBS' Chang said.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com – The dollar was flat on Thursday morning in Asia over disappointing minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.03% to 93.052 by 9:44 PM ET (2:44 AM GMT).
The minutes, released on Wednesday, gave investors few clues on whether the Fed will adopt a more dovish policy framework in the months ahead.
Although it had been widely expected that the policy would adopt an average inflation target and seek to push inflation above 2%, the minutes were vague regarding the issue. They stated that “a number” of Fed members suggested that would be helpful to make a revised statement on its policy strategy at some point, without any further details.
“Traders were hoping [the minutes] would cement a clear consensus in the Fed’s ranks for a series of key changes in the 18 September meeting,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston told Reuters.
“[But] there seems little consensus in the Fed collective to adopt an inflation-targeting regime, which is what so many have positioned for.”
The minutes also struck a gloomy note about the U.S. recovery from COVID-19, with Treasuries seeing a modest sell-off after the minutes revealed Fed skepticism over capping government bond yields to encourage recovery and investment.
Some investors warned that the dollar could stay on a down note for longer, with short bets against the greenback at their highest level since 2011 and long bets on the Euro also seeing a record high.
“All that was needed to push up the dollar was a catalyst; the minutes provided the catalyst,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso.
“Nevertheless, we still expect the dollar to track lower. The rest of the world economy, led by China, is recovering...we consider the AUD’s fall overnight as a short-term pothole along a road that trends higher,” he added.
Investors will now see whether the Fed will unveil more details during the Jackson Hole symposium, due to take place from August 27-28, or at the next Fed meeting in September.
The USD/JPY pair was also flat, inching up 0.02% to 106.12.
The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.12% to 0.7172 and the NZD/USD pair inched down 0.03% to 0.6555.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.07% to 6.9243, with U.S.-China tensions continuing to mount after the U.S. on suspended its extradition treaty, as well as ending reciprocal tax treatment, with Hong Kong earlier in the day. The People’s Bank of China is also set to release its loan prime rate later in the day, which is widely expected to remain unchanged.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.01% to 1.3100."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar clung to overnight gains on Thursday, after minutes from last month's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting gave few clues about whether an even more dovish shift in its policy framework is possible in the autumn, disappointing some dollar bears.
A heavily shorted greenback put on its biggest one-day surge since March after the release, hitting 93.159 against a basket of currencies (=USD), about 1% above Tuesday's two-year trough. The move wiped out earlier gains made by other majors.
Speculation has been rife the Fed will adopt an average inflation target, and seek to push inflation above 2% to make up for years it has run below, as part of a broader policy review.
But the minutes were vague on the issue and merely said ""a number"" of Fed members thought it would be helpful to make a revised statement on its policy strategy at some point, without providing details or timing.
After hitting an 18-month high of $0.7275 before the meeting, the Australian dollar  tumbled back below 72 cents and last sat at $0.7186. The New Zealand dollar  dropped almost 1.4% from its intraday high to sit at $0.6561.
The euro - the most stretched of all recent gainers on the greenback - fell 0.7% overnight to trade back below $1.19. It last sat at $1.1841 (EUR=EBS). The pound  was dumped back to $1.3103 and the dollar jumped 0.7% on the yen  to 106.13.
""Traders were hoping (the minutes) would cement a clear consensus in the Fed's ranks for a series of key changes in the 18 September meeting,"" said broker Pepperstone's head of research, Chris Weston.
""(But) there seems little consensus in the Fed collective to adopt an inflation-targeting regime, which is what so many have positioned for.""
The minutes also sounded pretty gloomy about the U.S. economy and skeptical about capping government bond yields as a means of encouraging recovery and investment - leading to a modest sell off in Treasuries.
The dollar's rebound comes after short bets against the world's reserve currency had risen to their largest since 2011 last week and long bets on the euro were at a record high, which has some investors feeling it could be short-lived blip. <0#NETUSDFX=>

For the Fed, the focus now shifts to whether more will be revealed at the Aug. 27-28 virtual Jackson Hole symposium or at September's meeting.
On Thursday investors expect China to keep its benchmark lending rate steady when it is fixed at 0130 GMT.

Later in the day, U.S. weekly jobless claims are expected to drop even further below one million, and markets are warily awaiting the Philadelphia Fed business index at 1230 GMT after a disappointing reading from New York earlier in the week. 
 
"
422,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Six months ago, exchange rates would have mattered less in a global investor’s stock-picking process. Now with the dollar facing what some warn is an existential threat, currencies are in the limelight.
With over 40% of non-U.S. firms’ sales exposed to the world’s reserve currency, according to data from Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc., everyone is trying to map how a tumbling dollar re-shapes investment across equities. Some are betting emerging market shares will benefit, others point to value in America, while Japanese stocks are seen lagging should the greenback slide more.
“The fastest selloff in risk assets in history followed by the fastest rally showed extraordinary volatility tied to currency markets, so yes, you’d have to take a view of how these would impact your hedges and equity investments,” said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management in Melbourne. “You do have to be cognizant of currency risks far more.”
With the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index down around 10% since its March high, the challenge for investors lies in determining the depth and longevity of its decline.
The Winners
For New York-based hedge fund manager Thomas J. Hayes, the dollar’s downtrend is a signal to buy riskier EM stocks and commodities.
“Cheap dollar funding encourages risk taking and money flows into perceived ‘higher growth’ locales,” said Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital LLC. He favors emerging-market stocks partly as companies will have an easier time servicing dollar-denominated debt.
Equities in developing nations have recorded a consistently inverse relationship with the dollar, with the most profound impact in Latin America, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists including Jeremy Hale.
“Moves in correlations between Latam equities and the dollar tend to be more pronounced and occur prior to moves in other regions,” they wrote in a recent note. “Emerging market equities are currently underperforming the U.S. relative to historical soft dollar periods, and look good value to outperform should the greenback fall another 10% from here.”
In Asia, Chinese and Hong Kong firms stand to benefit most as the dollar tumbles, according to an analysis earlier this month from Jefferies strategists including Desh Peramunetilleke.
“While exporters to the U.S. are negatively impacted due to a weaker dollar, such periods are usually very supportive of global equities, led by EM/Asia,” the Jefferies team wrote. From a global sector point of view, “cyclicals such as energy, materials and capital goods benefit strongly.”
To be sure, not everyone places currency fluctuations as a core part of their investment considerations. Case in point is Phillip Kim, a portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management in Chicago, who said his team is more focused on discussions such as value versus growth.
“We focus on quantitative factor data and fundamentals but currency and fund flows can confirm strength in a particular region or country,” Kim said.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. sees a weaker dollar as a reason to favor U.S. stocks. It’s ratcheting up its allocation to American equities as a cheaper currency makes the assets more attractive to foreign investors, while also creating a growth headwind for overseas firms, strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note this month.
Invesco Ltd.’s Nixon Mak, a strategist, is also a fan of U.S. stocks, even if a weaker currency ends up weighing on their absolute returns for global investors.
“With strong domestic demand and sustainable earnings growth from certain sectors, we believe the U.S. equity market is still favorable now and the currency effect could be offset by the return from capital,” he said.
The Losers
At the other end of the scale, Japanese stocks are often flagged as benefiting least from a weaker dollar. Local currency appreciation can be “problematic” for equity performance in Japan -- and also Europe -- where correlations with the dollar are not as “clear-cut” as those in emerging markets, wrote the strategists at Citi.
“If the dollar is in a structural downtrend, the yen has room to appreciate further and that means Japanese equities will fall to last place on our radar,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors in Sydney. “While emerging markets will stand to benefit from a weaker dollar, Japan is the opposite.”
Meanwhile in Europe, though U.K and Russian miners, and e-commerce players have shown strong performance during periods of dollar weakness, Danish biotech stocks, Swiss healthcare suppliers and Dutch food retailers are some of the key sectors that underperform, according to the Jefferies analysis.
“Traditionally the currency effect is minimal with only a maximum 3% to 5% of impact in absolute return,” said Invesco’s Mak. However, the pandemic-induced rout earlier and the change in environment to one of low growth and yield has changed the investment dynamics, he said.
“In this sense, the currency return could become a major component in a total return perspective,” Mak said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey's lira has been driven to record lows on concerns that lower interest rates, depleting FX reserves and a flood of easy credit could pave the way to a second currency crisis in as many years.
The lira's 20% fall makes its the third-weakest currency in the world this year and adds to a pattern of storms that has become all too regular in recent years.
While these tempests have tended to blow themselves out, usually aided by a blitz of emergency rate hikes, such wild volatility leaves analysts struggling to understand where the lira's ""fair"" value really lies, as the charts below show.
1/FAIR VALUE OR FAIR GAME
The International Institute of Finance has just slashed its estimate of lira fair value to 7.50 per dollar from 6.30 in June and 5.50 in April. The calculation factors in the evolution of the country's current account, which in turn depends on the government's approach to bank lending and other factors such as the hit to tourism from the coronavirus pandemic.
The government and banks are rolling out unprecedented credit stimulus this year which is supporting growth. But the boost to domestic demand has also raised demand for imports, which is widening the current account deficit to levels last seen in the run-up to the 2018 currency crisis.
""A severe credit crunch in the second half of 2018 put the country into recession, shifting the current account very rapidly from deficit to surplus,"" said Robin Brooks, the IIF's managing director. ""We expect a similar dynamic now.""
Graphic: Markets see more Turkish rate hikes ahead https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/gjnpwxqeovw/eikon.png 
2/ THE 'REAL' PROBLEM 
Turkey's central bank has cut its main interest rate from 24% to 8.25%  since last summer when Murat Uysal was brought in by President Tayyip Erdogan to replace Murat Cetinkaya as its head.
While the coronavirus has triggered a severe economic contraction, the scale of rate cuts has meant the yields savers earn on their deposits and investors earn on government bonds no longer offsets what is still double-digit inflation in Turkey.
That so-called ""real"" effective interest rate is the lowest in the world barring a few countries, and if investors aren't buying bonds and savers aren't depositing, that puts even more pressure on the currency.
Graphic: Turkey has lowest interest rates when inflation factored in https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdnrkmpo/Pasted%20image%201597662056983.png 
3/RATE EXPECTATIONS 
Money markets have started pricing in higher rates again, as they did in the last lira collapse. The central bank meets on Thursday and if it signals something along those lines - either in terms of a formal rate hike or via back-door channels, as is expected - it should take some pressure off the currency.
Blaise Antin, head of emerging market sovereign research at fund manager TCW, said the ""weighted average"" cost of funding from the central bank has already risen to 9.3% from 7.3% in mid-July as the bank has tweaked its lending operations.
""That has occurred in just the last 10 to 15 days. That has got many people contemplating whether the central bank will now raise its policy rate,"" Antin said.
Graphic: Turkey's balance of payments https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqwxjwvx/Pasted%20image%201597664502084.png 
4/WARNING SIGNS
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) doesn't expect a more meaningful policy rethink unless the lira slides to levels nearer 8.50. No blend of banking system tinkering or partial capital-control measures can turn the lira around this time, it says.
Stricter capital controls can perhaps buy some time, but stress still looms. Some analysts say a more fundamental change is needed to a monetary policy approach that more aggressively targets inflation.
The lira could fall much further, as the FX options market has been signalling this month. 
5/RESERVES 
Turkey's gross currency reserves have fallen below $47 billion, compared with $81 billion at the start of year. Finance Minister Berat Albayrak has said FX buffers remain more than adequate but his comments have done little to soothe investors' nerves.
Some analysts say reserves could effectively be used up within months if the current situation persists.
""The reserves that have gone this year, there are not enough left now for that to happen again,"" said Kieran Curtis, head of emerging market local currency debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""We need some signal that policy has changed,"" he said, referring to a need for more orthodox monetary policy and a reduced reliance on credit-fuelled growth. 
Graphic: Turkey near bottom of the table of world currencies this year https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvokqjevd/Pasted%20image%201597697246053.png 
6/THE SMALL SHORT
One big difference to 2018 and 2019 is that there are now far fewer international investors in Turkish markets who could cut and run and thereby send the lira skidding further.
Data shows that 2020 has seen at least $30 billion of redemptions by foreigners from equity markets, leaving only around $15 billion still in. Bond holdings have also dropped to lows not seen in years.
At the same time, authorities have clamped down on the foreign exchange market since 2018 by tightly restricting how much local banks can supply to their international counterparts. That has seen the ""swap"" market shrivel, making it very expensive to borrow the lira to settle a ""short"" position.
Graphic: Foreign investors have been selling Turkish stocks and bonds https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkeodapm/Pasted%20image%201597664038978.png 
7/HOLIDAY SPENDS
The summer holiday season is usually a huge source of foreign currency for Turkey, with millions of tourists spending around $9 billion on hotels and changing cash.
That money typically swings the services part of the country's current account into a $3 billion surplus, according to Aberdeen Standard's Curtis.
But the pandemic has savaged tourism: June holidaymaker arrivals were 96% lower than last year and while July and August may have been better, major tour firms estimate pan-European travel is still down by half. ""I think this has been a big part of the problem (for the lira),"" Curtis said.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Wednesday, with the Federal Reserve’s minutes in focus, while stronger than expected inflation has boosted sterling.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.222. USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.50, while EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1943, having hit a fresh 28-month high of $1.1954 overnight.
The dollar hit fresh lows against most major currencies overnight as the ongoing effects of the Federal Reserve's stimulus programs, together with reduced expectations for fresh fiscal stimulus, weakened the greenback broadly. 
With this in mind, investors will keep a wary eye on the release later Wednesday of the minutes from the July FOMC meeting for hints over the central bank’s next move amid speculation it will choose to adopt an average inflation target.
The Federal Reserve has a mandate to ensure stable inflation, which most see as being around the 2% level. However, inflation has been below this level for some time, and thus if the central bank was to adopt an average inflation target it would need to push inflation above 2% for some time. High inflation is generally seen as bad for the relevant country’s currency.
“All in all, with a bearish trend consolidating, the dollar appears to be hoping for a less-dovish-than-expected message in the Fed minutes,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“We doubt that the release will offer enough push to the USD to invert the trend and any potential USD-positive effect may be short-lived on the back of an opportunistic sell-the-rally approach on the dollar.”
Elsewhere, sterling has posted strong gains against the dollar, with GBP/USD up 0.2% to 1.3261, above Tuesday’s eight-month high of $1.3241.
This represents a dramatic turnaround for sterling, which plummeted in March to the lowest level in more than three decades, but has now erased this year’s drop.
Helping sterling was the release of the latest inflation data earlier Wednesday, which jumped unexpectedly in July to its highest rate since March.
Consumer price inflation rose to 1.0% in July from 0.6% in June, the Office for National Statistics said, while core inflation - which excludes typically volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices - also rose to 1.8% from June's 1.4%. 
However, a bumpy path lies ahead for the pound, as U.K. and EU negotiators undertake another round of talks on a trade deal on the back of the U.K.’s departure from the bloc. 
“Sterling’s recent good performance and resilience to grim economic data has likely relied on the Brexit story being put on the back burner by investors,” said ING. 
“Our base case remains for a deal to be ultimately reached, but we expect the over-complacent GBP to face increasing Brexit-related stress in the coming weeks, making it a possible key laggard in the G10 space,” ING added.

Investing.com – The dollar was flat on Wednesday morning in Asia, with the safe-haven asset slowly recovering heavy losses from the previous session over the uncertainty surrounding the latest stimulus measures and, in turn, U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was flat, inching up 0.06% to 92.317 by 12:03 AM ET (5:03 AM GMT).
The ongoing impact from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stimulus programs saw U.S. stock indexes soar to record highs and continues to put pressure on the dollar. The Fed's intervention in the financial markets to increase liquidity also reduced demand for safe-have assets whilst increasing the appeal of risk assets, despite a bleak picture being painted for the U.S. economic recovery.
“There is a strong momentum for investors to want to sell the dollar,” Juntaro Morimoto,  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Financial Holdings analyst, told Reuters, adding that the greenback has been declining since last month.
Consensus within the U.S. Congress for the latest stimulus measures also remains elusive, despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s statement on Tuesday that Democrats would be willing to cut their bill “in half” to reach an agreement with Republicans.
The USD/JPY pair edged up 0.12% to 105.55. Japan said earlier in the day that exports fell 19.2% in July year-on-year, beating forecasts for a 21% drop prepared by Investing.com as well as the 26.2% drop seen in June. The data also showed that core machinery orders fell 7.6% month-on-month.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.05% to 0.7237 while the NZD/USD pair inched up 0.08% to 0.6604.
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.01% to 6.9219, with U.S.-China tensions continuing to escalate. China reacted to the U.S. further restricting Huawei Technologies’ access to commercially available chips by denouncing the move as “nothing short of bullying” on Tuesday.
Meanwhile U.S. President Trump on Tuesday took responsibility for postponing trade talks between the two countries, originally scheduled for August 15.
The GBP/USD pair inched up 0.06% to 1.3243.
Investors are now looking to the release of the minutes from the Fed’s FOMC meeting, due later in the day."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar struggled to recoup heavy overnight losses on Wednesday after it slipped to 27-month low the previous session as uncertainties about an economic recovery and the U.S. fiscal stimulus package weighed.
The dollar hit fresh lows against most major currencies overnight as the ongoing effects of the Federal Reserve's stimulus programmes weakened the greenback broadly and lifted U.S. stock indexes to record highs. 
The dollar (=USD) last sat at 92.179 against a basket of currencies.
The euro (EUR=EBS) changed hands at $1.1949, having strengthened to its highest level since May 2018 in the previous session.
Sterling edged above Tuesday’s eight-month high of $1.3241, last quoted at $1.3255.
“There is a strong momentum for investors to want to sell the dollar,” said Juntaro Morimoto, an analyst at  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Financial Holdings, pointing that the greenback has been declining since last month. 
Although the dollar often functions as a safe-haven investment in times of crisis, it has fallen since the Federal Reserve's intervention into financial markets to maintain liquidity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Fed's programmes have pushed risk assets to all-time highs and reduced demand for safe-havens, even as economic data has painted a bleak picture of the U.S. recovery.
In commodities market, a softening dollar kept gold elevated, with spot gold  last trading at $2,002.1 per ounce.
An agreement over a new round of federal stimulusspending remained elusive, although U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that Democrats in Congress are willing to cut their coronavirus relief bill in half to get an agreement on new legislation with the White House and Republicans.
Providing additional headwind for the dollar, President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a big shift to mail-in voting in the November presidential election could cause so many problems officials might have to re-do the vote.
On the data front, Japan's official data on exports fell 19.2% in July from a year earlier, beating economists' forecast of 21% decrease, while the country's core machinery orders fell 7.6% in June from the previous month.
Against the yen , the dollar last sat at 105.17 yen.
Investors await the release later on Wednesday of the minutes from the July 28-29 FOMC meeting, with speculation the Fed will adopt an average inflation target, which would seek to push inflation above 2% for some time.

The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  traded near $0.7255, while the kiwi  last bought $0.6611.

427,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound extended its advance to a fifth day, erasing this year’s drop against the dollar.
The currency rose as much as 0.2% to $1.3265. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen around 10% from late March when the Federal Reserve acted to provide dollar liquidity in the virus-induced global market panic.
”The dollar is doing most of the heavy lifting for the pound,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Sterling is still cheap as chips. Everyone has problems, most of them huge, but UK PLC has fewer than most.”
It’s a dramatic turnaround for sterling, which plummeted in March to the lowest level in more than three decades. Outflows from the dollar have helped the currency rally, despite the possibility that the nation will transition out of the European Union without a trade deal.

428,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Divergent monetary policies are fueling sharp gains in the Australian dollar against its New Zealand peer, and analysts see the rally running well into 2021.
A two-year high in the Aussie-kiwi cross that was reached this week may be just a stepping stone on its way to levels last seen in 2016, they say.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) forecasts the pair to rise about 3% to 1.13 by year end while Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) CIB expects it there by mid 2021. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) suggests going long with a target of 1.19, versus just under 1.10 now.
“The main point of difference is monetary policy given only the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is considering negative rates and has been much more aggressive with its QE,” said Tom Nash, strategist at HSBC in Sydney. “Both rate differentials and the rate of change of the respective central bank’s balance sheets are pointing in the direction of a higher AUD/NZD.”
While the RBNZ has embarked on large scale bond buying and is now contemplating sub-zero rates, the Reserve Bank of Australia is trying to keep a lid on debt purchases with yield-curve control and has said it is “extraordinarily unlikely” to adopt negative rates.
Adding to the kiwi’s woes is a fresh coronavirus outbreak in Auckland that’s denting consumer confidence, and which has forced a delay in the general election until October.
Swaps traders are pricing 40 basis points of RBNZ rate cuts by July 2021, which would take the cash rate well into negative territory.
The Aussie-kiwi pair has advanced more than 5% this year and on Monday capped 10 straight days of gains, the longest winning streak in almost three decades. The kiwi is also the worst-performing currency against the dollar this year.
“Heavy reliance on tourism and education exports and the closure of international borders likely well into 2021, as well as the RBNZ’s threat of implementing negative rates, will lead to some NZD underperformance relative to the AUD,” said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole in London.
Still, not everyone is predicting the kiwi’s continued slide against its South Pacific peer.
Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe Ltd., expects the Aussie’s rally against the kiwi to wane as New Zealand clamps down on the virus outbreak and investors become used to the RBNZ’s dovish commentary.
“New Zealand’s ‘elimination’ strategy has proven effective in the past and at some point RBNZ rhetoric will lose its ability to verbally suppress the currency,” said Berich. “I’m inclined to view the current spike higher as likely to unwind gradually.”

429,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar sank to its lowest level since May 2018 on Tuesday on concern that the world’s biggest economy will struggle to regain momentum amid a standoff over further virus relief and as infections continue to mount.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell as much as 0.6%, dropping for a fifth straight session and bringing its 2020 decline around 1.7%. On the day, the greenback is tumbling against all its major peers, led by the pound and the euro, which climbed to a two-year high.
The greenback has been on the defensive since mid-year, with lawmakers unable to agree on measures to support the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, and with U.S. real yields dropping to multi-year lows. On top of that, investors’ attention is turning to the November presidential election and the uncertainty that may bring.
“Broader positioning against the USD is not overly stretched,” said Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank. Investors and speculators are “only just starting to embrace the short USD story. There is room for this move to run.”
Wagers on dollar losses by hedge funds and other large speculators have been building, but have yet to reach the levels seen in 2017 and 2018, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.

430,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. dollar is driving a wedge between volatility expectations for global currencies and stocks.
The greenback’s plunge last month jolted currencies so profoundly that expected swings in the market are no longer correlated with a similar measure for U.S. equities.
“It’s a reminder that dollar moves could be an outsized driver of risk, sentiment and narrative over the next few months, if they continue with the recent volatility experiences,” said London-based John Roe, head of multi asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. For equities, there’s a “feeling that the fireworks are over for now,” he said.
That’s because currency traders are anxious about the unknowns of the coming months and their impact on the dollar. These include the U.S. presidential election and the risk of a winter surge in coronavirus infections in the northern hemisphere, a factor that has played in the euro’s favor after European governments proved to be quick to implement mitigation measures.
And at the same time, implied volatility for equities is falling as central-bank stimulus whitewashes a plethora of risks weighing on company revenue.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). joined other firms in raising its year-end target for the S&P 500 Index, which is close to a record high.
While the VIX Index of U.S. stock swings has fallen to the lowest since Feb. 21 on a closing basis, the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Global FX Volatility Index is near the highest since May. The disparity drove the 40-day correlation between the two measures below zero this month to the lowest since 2009.
“The lack of correlation highlights the diversification out of U.S. dollar,” said Sophie Huynh, multi-asset strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London. “The question is whether we will have the same move in equities.”

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Monday, weighed by falling yields, weak economic data and few signs of a new relief package to help the U.S. economy.
At 3:20 AM ET (0720 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 92.537. USD/JPY was down 0.5% at 105.47, GBP/USD gained 0.5% to 1.3163 and EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1896.
U.S. economic data disappointed Monday, with the Empire State Manufacturing index dropping to 3.7 in August, well below the 15 level expected as well as July's reading of 17.20. 
This release came out ahead of Friday’s Purchasing Managers Indices, seen as more forward looking indicators, and suggests the U.S. economic recovery may be stalling.
Yields on the 10-year note plunged as much as 5% on Monday, reducing the attraction of assets denominated in dollars.
Meanwhile, investors still wait for the two political parties to agree to a much-needed financial support package. With lawmakers now in recess and both parties' conventions over the next two weeks, the chances of anything being signed off any time soon appear to be slim.
Even the dollar’s traditional role as a safe haven seems to be attracting little demand. 
The Trump administration stated Monday that it would further tighten restrictions on China's Huawei Technologies, cracking down on its access to commercially available chips. However, this has had little impact, with the delay in the review of the U.S.-China trade deal suggesting this important trade relationship can hold even amidst conflict on multiple other fronts.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve minutes are due Wednesday, and investors will be studying these carefully to see if there was any discussion about the central bank adopting an average inflation target. With inflation having been under target for so long, an average target would imply that a loose monetary policy for longer than would ordinarily be expected.
These dollar losses also look set to grow, if positioning data are to be believed.
CFTC data, ending Aug. 11, added to signs that bearish sentiment on the U.S. dollar continues to grow, according to analysts at ING, in a research note. 
“The most evident contribution comes from yet another rise in EUR net positioning, which is now at +28% of open interest, a touch below the 30% highs seen in April 2018. This was the seventh consecutive week of gains in EUR positioning,” said ING, with the euro representing the biggest weight in the USD weighted positioning vs the CFTC-reported G10 currencies.
Additionally, “there is little indication from the spot market that the USD short-building process has stopped in the last few days and we may see USD net positioning inching lower still next week,” ING added.
Elsewhere, USD/RUB traded 0.1% lower at 73.5989, retracing a touch after the pair climbed to the top of its recent trading range as Russia continues to suffer from the coronavirus outbreak as well as a weak economy, weighed by U.S. sanctions.
That said, Russian reserves hit $600 billion for the first time ever last week, so there are few signs of this ruble weakness turning into full blown currency flight, particularly with oil prices stabilising.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, with a triple menace of retreating yields, disappointing U.S. economic data and a drop in safe-haven demand dampening investor sentiment.
Even an overnight tech rally in U.S. markets could not convince investors to give up their bearish positions.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.22% to 92.642 by 12:21 AM ET (5:21 AM GMT).
Net bearish bets on the greenback rose to their highest levels since May 2011 during the previous week, with spot trade over the past few days suggesting that the levels have increased since.
“Extended short dollar positions risk a sharp pull back if the dollar downside stalls further, but for now the negatives for the dollar are mostly still in place,” OCBC Bank analysts told Reuters.
“We are reduced to staying in the game while the music is playing,” they added, whilst also attributing disappointing ESM index, the stalled negotiations in the U.S. Congress over the latest stimulus measures and a “limited appetite for interpreting Sino-U.S. relations as being in an outright downward spiral,” to the dollar’s gloomy outlook.
U.S. data released on Tuesday also disappointed investors, with the Empire State Manufacturing (ESM) index diving to 3.7 in August and missing the forecasted 15 points prepared by Investing.com as well as July's reading of 17.20.
The USD/JPY pair fell 0.30% to 105.67.
The AUD/USD pair edged up 0.10% to 0.7221. Across the Tasman sea, the NZD/USD pair edged down 0.18% to 0.6545, with New Zealand continuing its battle against a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 in the country.
The USD/CNY pair was flat, inching up 0.02% to 6.9303. Investors are keeping an eye on the latest round of U.S.-China tensions after the U.S. Commerce Department on Monday further restricted Chinese tech company Huawei’s access to commercially available chips. The department added 38 Huawei affiliates in 21 countries to an economic blacklist, with these latest measures in addition to the restrictions announced by the U.S. in May.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar teetered near milestone lows on Tuesday, after a triple blow of retreating yields, soft U.S. economic data and a dip in safe-haven demand exerted broad selling pressure.
Against the euro, Aussie, pound, Swiss franc and yuan it is poised to re-test multi month or multi year troughs made earlier in the month, though moves in morning trade were small as Wednesday's release of the Federal Reserve minutes looms on the horizon.
The euro (EUR=EBS) last sat at $1.1874, just below a recent two-year high of $1.1916. The Aussie  was steady at $0.7213 and close to an 18-month top of 0.$7242 hit on Aug. 7.
Investors have been relieved by a delay in the review of the U.S.-China trade deal this week, which has left the agreement standing and reinforced a belief that the trade relationship can hold even amidst conflict on multiple other fronts.
A fresh rally in tech stocks added to the positive mood, and together with a pullback in U.S. yields and a weak reading in a U.S. manufacturing survey has many traders sticking to their bearish convictions on the dollar.
Net bearish bets on the U.S. dollar grew to their largest since May 2011 last week and spot trade in recent days suggest the position has only grown further since.
""Extended short dollar positions risk a sharp pull back if the dollar downside stalls further, but for now the negatives for the dollar are mostly still in place,"" said analysts at Singapore's OCBC Bank.
""We are reduced to staying in the game while the music is playing.""
OCBC called out soft data, the political impasse holding up U.S. fiscal stimulus and a ""limited appetite for interpreting Sino-U.S. relations as being in an outright downward spiral,"" as backing the dollar's gloomy outlook.
Underscoring that view, the yuan  sat at 6.9306 per dollar, within range of a five-month high of 6.9280, despite the Trump administration flagging a further tightening of restrictions against Chinese tech gear maker Huawei.
On the data front the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index tumbled to 3.7 in August from 17.2 in July - far lower than the 15 points forecast by a Reuters survey.
Delinquency rates for residential mortgages also posted the largest quarterly increase on record.
""A high delinquency rate for an extended period can impair the banking system,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency analyst Joe Capurso.
""An impaired banking system could hold back the U.S. economic recovery like it did in the aftermath of the (2008 crisis),"" he said.
The Japanese yen  rose back past 106-per-dollar to 105.88 after a 2.6 basis point drop in benchmark U.S. 10-year government bond yields overnight. [US/]
Investors expect the release of U.S. Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday to possibly determine the next moves.
The British pound  was stalled around $1.1311 as investors are watching the latest round of Brexit negotiations, with the future of London's financial institutions' access to the European market in focus.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar sat at an eight-session low of 92.762.
Among G10 currencies, the kiwi was the laggard as New Zealand's largest city remains under lockdown and anticipation of future monetary easing weighs on the currency.
It last bought $0.6557 and traders said bets on the kiwi dropping had supported the Aussie as investors sought exposure to the Aussie/kiwi cross, which is trading at a two-year peak.
""The move has been one way traffic,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne broker Pepperstone, who is holding for the ride even though the pair (AUDNZD=) has hit his price target of NZ$1.10 per Aussie.

Investing.com - The  dollar weakened in early European trade Monday, weighed by worries about the U.S. economic recovery as political tensions rise and ahead of the release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 92.933. GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.3108 and EUR/USD gained 0.2% at 1.1863. USD/JPY dropped 0.2% to 106.42, despite Japan suffering its biggest economic contraction on record in the second quarter.
The number of unemployment claims dipped below the one million mark late last week for the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak, but this would hardly be cause to celebrate given the grim reality that more than 30 million Americans are out of work.
All the time the Covid-19 virus continues to wreak havoc, with the United States surpassing 170,000 coronavirus deaths on Sunday, according to a data from Johns Hopkins University. The country's public health officials and authorities are concerned about a possible fall resurgence in cases amid the start of the flu season, which will likely exacerbate efforts to treat the coronavirus.
With the Democratic national convention starting on Monday, traditionally the starting point for November’s presidential election, and the two sides seemingly further away than ever, a compromise that results in a new stimulus package seems an unlikely prospect.
The latest bone of contention between the two warring factions centers around the U.S. Postal Service, with the Democrats accusing President Donald Trump of trying to hamstring the cash-strapped organisation to suppress mail-in voting.
Of interest this week will be the release of Federal Reserve minutes on Thursday, with markets looking for any hints of a possible change to the central bank's guidance at its next meeting in September.
""Market participants will be looking for insight into the details and exact timing of when the Fed's Monetary Policy Review will be completed, and also for more clarity with respect to the potential timing and structure of any changes to forward guidance,"" noted analysts at NatWest Markets, in a Reuters report.
These dollar losses could also be sustained going forward as hedge funds have now turned bearish on the greenback for the first time since May 2018.
Net futures and forward positions held by leveraged funds against eight other currencies dropped to minus 7,881 contracts last week, according to data aggregated from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Bloomberg reported.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning, but capped its losses after a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials, originally scheduled for Saturday, was delayed.
Scheduling conflicts reportedly led to the postponement of an online meeting to discuss trade, as well as other issues.
Some investors welcomed the news, with the delay leaving the phase one trade deal between the two countries intact for now.
“That’s good news in the sense that it’s something we can place on the back burner for now,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior foreign exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril told Reuters.
“But there are other uncertainties coming up that need to be resolved,” he warned, with U.S. President Donald Trump indicating a potential increase of U.S. pressure on Chinese tech firms, such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, on Saturday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.07% to 93.023 by 10:04 PM ET (3:04GMT).
Investors are also keeping an eye on the U.S. presidential elections, now less than three months away as the four-day Democratic national convention due to being later in the day.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to release its minutes on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any clues to policy changes ahead of the Fed’s September meeting.
Investors are expecting more tolerance in the Fed’s approach to inflation, Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told Reuters.
“The bond market is key here and if the Fed can drive down real yields then the dollar will follow, and gold will rally - and vice versa,” he added.
The USD/JPY pair dropped 0.06% to 106.53. Japan reported a record economic contraction in the second quarter earlier in the day, with gross domestic product shrinking 27.8% year-on-year.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases continues a relentless march upwards. There are almost 21.6 million cases globally as of August 17, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Europe reported fresh COVID-19 outbreaks over the weekend, with Italy and Spain ordering nightclubs shut and France warning of an uptick of cases. The fresh outbreaks are also challenging the Euro, which has been on an upward trend since the European Union struck a deal for a EUR750 billion ($888.036 billion) COVID-19 stimulus package in July.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.27% to 0.7190. The NZD/USD pair inched up 0.02% to 0.6539, with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern delaying the general election to October 17. The country’s battle with its first outbreak in 102 days led to the four-week delay from the original date of September 19.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar began Monday where it left off last week, caught between pressure from worries about the lagging U.S. economic recovery and support from rising U.S. bond yields and safe-harbour demand.
A boost to sentiment from the postponement of the U.S-China trade deal review - which leaves the deal intact - was muted by uncertainty, ahead of a week a week that includes Federal Reserve minutes and the Democrats' nomination convention.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar traded under gentle pressure at 93.039 on Monday, roughly in the middle of the range it has held since hitting a two-year low at the end of July.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  inched up to a three-session high of $0.7194, but also remained contained in the channel it has traded in for a week. 
Other Asian currencies, such as the won  and rupiah  edged lower, while the kiwi  remained weighted at $0.6534 by last week's dovish language from the central bank.
The yen  was steady at 106.54 per dollar, having dipped last week as a jump in U.S. yields drew Japanese investment to U.S. Treasuries.
REVIEW DELAY
The United States and China delayed a Saturday review of their Phase 1 trade deal, people familiar with the plans told Reuters, citing scheduling conflicts.
""That's good news in the sense that it's something we can place on the back burner for now,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) senior foreign exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril.
""But there are other uncertainties coming up that need to be resolved,"" he said, pointing to U.S. politics as a presidential election looms, and new virus hot spots in Europe that could challenge the perception that the euro is on an uptrend.
U.S. President Donald Trump also flagged a broadening of his pressure on Chinese tech firms such as e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
The yuan , often a barometer of relations between the two countries, was unmoved in offshore trade on Monday morning, and last traded at 6.9364 per dollar.
ELECTION DELAY
Elsewhere, in Japan, data showed the world's third-largest economy suffered its acutest economic contraction on record in the second fiscal quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic crushed business and consumer spending.
New Zealand delayed a general election by a month as it grapples with a new outbreak of the pathogen, while there have been flare-ups in infections in South Korea, Spain and France.
The euro (EUR=EBS) and sterling  were steady in Asia, with the euro last buying $1.1844 and sterling $1.3095.
On the horizon, the Democratic national convention in the United States begins on Monday, and is something of a starting gun for the final sprint to the November election. It culminates in a speech from presumptive nominee Joe Biden late on Thursday.

"
437,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Few economists have the long-term track record of Lacy Hunt at Hoisington Investment Management. 
For more than three decades, Hunt has held the view that U.S. Treasury yields would fall, fall and then fall some more. That was true when the 30-Year bond yielded 9% in 1990, 6.75% in 2000, 4.5% in 2010 and now 1.4% in 2020. Hoisington’s chief economist, who recently celebrated his 78th birthday, spoke with me by phone on Aug. 10.
The first half hour of our discussion went about as expected. Even though the coronavirus pandemic has led to unprecedented Federal Reserve interventions and fiscal relief efforts, Hunt insisted it was mostly a continuation of what he’s seen for years. Essentially, piling on more debt today, not to boost future productivity but just to keep the economy afloat, will lead to decades of slow growth and potential disinflation. For now, the Fed looks invincible to many investors — Hunt would remind them that the central bank’s previous quantitative easing episodes did little to sustainably lift growth or inflation. The policy response this time isn’t all that different, Hunt says. It’s just larger because the downturn is more severe.
Then, I asked about Modern Monetary Theory and other novel policy ideas, like direct monetary financing. That’s when his tone shifted to what he sees as a “great risk” in the years ahead.
What follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation:
Brian Chappatta: The Treasury is issuing a record amount of debt and the Fed’s balance sheet has grown by $3 trillion. Has this changed your thinking at all around the interplay between debt, growth and inflation?
Lacy Hunt: The measures taken to ameliorate the recession, in terms of trying to help people in distress, while they’re popular and humane, they’ve resulted in a massive increase in the debt overhang. The pandemic will eventually go away, but the debt will remain. It’s been my view that over-indebtedness ebbs economic growth. Debt is a double-edged sword: It’s increasing current spending in exchange for a decline in future spending unless it generates an income stream to repay principal and interest.
We had four secular peaks in total debt to GDP. The 1870s, 1920s and 30s, 2008-09, and we’re going to set a new peak this year, which will take out the peak in 2008-09. The debt surge reflects both a rising debt and a decline in GDP. In the three earlier instances, the inflation rate fell very dramatically. We now have a new secular peak in debt to GDP occurring within 12 years of the prior secular peak, whereas before they were decades apart. That’s massively disinflationary.
BC: What do you make of the Fed shifting its stance to encourage an overshoot of its 2% inflation target?
LH: Inflation is a complex subject. There’s no single variable that determines inflation, but according to the figures of the Congressional Budget Office, the output gap will be a record this year and we will have a deflationary gap. In other words, potential GDP will be well above real GDP. And according to the CBO, we’re going to have a deflationary output gap through 2030. I feel that’s a solid forecast. This economy is going to come out at a very slow rate, and with the massive output gap, the velocity of money declining and this massive debt overhang, the risk is that the inflation rate goes down to the zero bound and probably crosses through it.
What the Fed says is interesting, but it doesn’t change this powerful dynamic.
BC: How do you square that view of low inflation and slow economic growth with what we’re seeing in markets today?
LH: When the Fed initiated QE1, QE2 and QE3, folks said those policies were very inflationary. There is a liquidity effect of what the Fed is doing, and the liquidity effect can be very powerful over the short term. But ultimately the increase in the money supply did not follow through after the rounds of Fed purchases of government securities because the banks couldn’t utilize the reserves, they didn’t have the capital base to make the loans, they had to charge a risk premium in an environment in which the risk premium was rising very dramatically and the borrowers couldn’t pay the risk premium. There was no secondary follow-through in terms of money supply growth, and the velocity of money fell and the growth rate fell back after a transitory rise. And I don’t really see this as any different.
Keep in mind, when the Fed comes in barrels open like this, the program initially looks successful because it unblocks what problems existed in the markets. But it’s the job of the economist to understand the unintended consequences. When the Fed comes in and they have this tremendous success, which gives the appearance that the inflation process is starting, they thwart a couple of important mechanisms that make the free enterprise system work: creative destruction and moral hazard. The first-round effects of the Fed look effective, and they’re widely hailed, but they make the economy even more overleveraged than it was before and credit is allocated to those who are not really in a position to generate economic growth from it. We’ve seen numerous similar programs in Japan and Europe and it looks like the central bank has the capability to do whatever it takes. They certainly have the ability to calm and reliquify markets, but those actions then compound the underlying problem, which is the extreme over-indebtedness. You get a transitory boost, you get a liquidity effect, but that liquidity effect runs out very quickly.
To my way of thinking, the government expenditure multiplier is slightly negative after three years. It’s slightly positive for a while, but that period of time only lasts for one to two quarters. Then the debt dynamics take hold and the growth rate falls back and the inflation rate goes with it. In the meantime, this period of weak economic growth is becoming ever-extended, and that has consequences of its own.
BC: This is usually the point at which I ask, how do we get out of this? 
LH: The problem is people want a financial transaction to cover the problem. They want greater levels of debt — in other words, we’re going to try to solve an indebtedness problem by taking on more debt. Japan has tried many, many heroic measures to try to pull themselves out. Great results were promised.
The production function says GDP is determined by technology interacting with land, labor and capital. If you overuse one of the factors of production, such as debt capital, initially GDP will rise. You continue to overuse that factor of production, GDP flattens out; and if you continue to overuse that factor, GDP declines. More is not more — more is less. 
The possibility exists that technology could step forward, and there are some smart people, like Bill Gates, who think technology will save us. But I think the technology answer has been provided to us by Dr. Robert Gordon at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE). He said in our period of great growth from 1870 to 1970, we had transformative, revolutionary inventions. The combustion engine, modern sanitation, electricity, modern communication, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Each one of those things enhanced the demand for labor and natural resources. Think about the natural resources and labor that were require to effectuate the benefit of the combustion engine. It led to the assembly line, complex supply chains, and we had to develop the highway infrastructure.
The technological changes today are more evolutionary, not revolutionary. The production function is one of the most fundamental relationships in all of economics, and it’s telling us we’re facing a period of difficult growth. Given these other circumstances, it’s going to be one in which the inflation rate is going to be trending down, possibly at a much greater risk of deflation than inflation.
BC: Lastly, I want to ask you about the rise of Modern Monetary Theory within economics, and some proposals to have the Fed give money directly to individuals. 
LH: The great risk is that we become dissatisfied with the way things are, and either de jure or de facto, the Federal Reserve’s liabilities are made legal tender. 
The Federal Reserve as it’s constituted today can lend but it cannot spend. Now, they’ve done some things that are different from what the Federal Reserve Act said under the exigent circumstances clauses, but so far they’re lending. They’re not directly funding the expenditures of the government in any meaningful way. But there are folks who want to use the Fed’s liabilities for that purpose.
When the Fed buys government securities, all that really happens is you switch to the government having a one-day liability which the banks are holding.(1)And those deposits that the banks own, which have gone up sharply as a result of the Fed buying, are not legal tender. Now, the banks could use them to make loans, but they’re not doing that. Loans are coming off very sharply because you have to have this interplay between the banks and their customers, and the risk premium has to be accounted for. 
There are folks who want to make the Fed’s liabilities legal tender. Now, if that happens, then the inflation rate would take off. However, in very short order, everyone would be totally miserable because no one would want to hold money. You would trigger Gresham’s Law — people would only want to hold commodities they can consume and commodities that can be traded for others. 
But there is that risk that you could use the Fed’s liabilities to pay directly. The Bank of England has made a small move in that direction — they say it’s temporary. There are others that want to try that because they’re frustrated with the fact that issuing the debt is not getting the job done. So we could significantly alter the whole structure of the U.S. economy. But if you use the Fed’s liabilities for directly funding goods and services, the consequences could be very extreme and very quick.
(1) MMT economists recognize this as well. Hereis how Stephanie Kelton described it: ""Printing money simply means that overnight central bank liabilities earning the central bank’s target rate replace, say, three-month government liabilities earning roughly the central bank’s target rate. And if the Fed doesn’t pay interest on these reserve balances, then that simply means it wants its target rate at zero. Overall, there’s little difference in terms of macroeconomic impact whether the government sells its securities or prints money because the latter isn’t actually a thing in the real world.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, with attention still focused upon the lack of a new relief package to help the U.S. economy recover from the damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.235, set to continue a seven-week losing streak.

The U.S. said on Thursday that the number of unemployment claims over the past week dipped below the one million mark for the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning, giving up some earlier gains as doubts persist over the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Investor sentiment was dampened by disappointing Chinese data released earlier in the day that indicated continuous but slower recovery in industrial production, as well as a bigger-than-expected drop in retail sales.
The data said that July’s industrial production rose 4.8% year-on-year but missed the 5.1% increase in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. Meanwhile, retail sales fell 1.1% in the same month, against the forecasted 0.1%. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.7%.
Investors will also be looking at the outcome of Saturday’s online meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials to discuss trade alongside other issues.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.04% to 6.9468 by 12:15 AM ET (5:15 AM GMT), and the U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.08% to 93.243.

The USD/JPY pair was flat at 106.92. The yen recently saw its biggest losses against the dollar as higher U.S. yields attracted Japanese investors.
The AUD/USD pair inched down 0.01% to 0.7147. The NZD/USD pair was down 0.21% to 0.6531, with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern due to announce whether the country will extend or ease Auckland’s re-imposed lockdown measures later in the day.

441,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- It took weeks of frenzied gold trading in Istanbul’s historic commercial center to spur one of the biggest gaps between the cost of physical dollar bills and the official exchange rate in 18 years.
Home to scores of foreign-exchange kiosks that double up as brokers for the precious metal, the Grand Bazaar is often seen as the benchmark for the country. Traders there also mostly use cash to settle gold dealings -- and dollars were in short supply.
As a result, U.S. currency bills in this market have been trading at the biggest premium relative to the official exchange rate since at least 2002 over the past month, according to local data provider Matriks Bilgi Dagitim Hizmetleri and Bloomberg calculations. The difference has narrowed close to zero this week.
As the price of bullion soared to a record beyond $2,000 an ounce in August while the lira fell to an all-time low, traders at the world’s oldest covered market began bidding up the price of physical dollars to meet surging demand from clients for gold, a popular form of household savings.
“There has been a cash squeeze in the Grand Bazaar,” said Cumhur Tasdelen, a board member at Troy Precious Metals in Istanbul. “As demand for hard currency and gold jumped, this has created a cash squeeze, widening margins in kiosks.”
Over the past 30 days, dollar bills were on average 0.83% more expensive than the rate offered in the wholesale global currency market.
Fever Subsides
With the gold prices now showing signs of easing, and authorities in Turkey moving to tighten policy to steady the currency, the dislocation looks to be subsiding. The precious metal suffered its biggest three-day loss since March this week, helping the spread between the two dollar rates narrow to just 0.3%.
Still, the last time it blew out to a level anywhere near as wide was during a political deadlock in 2002 that forced the coalition government at the time to call early elections. The vote proved to be a seismic event that wiped out Turkey’s ruling political class, and ushered in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party, which has remained in power ever since.
This time, however, it was less politics than the strain on the economy from the coronavirus pandemic and outflows of foreign capital that helped warp the exchange rates.
As the lira weakened, local households and businesses took to hoarding dollars to hedge against bouts of inflation and currency deprecation that have eroded their savings over the decades. In July, Turkish households and companies purchased $11.7 billion of foreign-currency, driving their dollar and euro deposits to a record $213 billion, equivalent to more than a quarter of the Turkish economy.
Savers’ Hedge
Others prefer to hold dollar bills at home. That’s because they can avoid a 1% tax the government collects on foreign-currency purchases executed through banks.
The levy was imposed in May 2019, as part of a series of measures designed slow the currency’s depreciation.
A currency dealer in Istanbul’s Atasehir region, who declined to give his name because of the sensitive nature of the subject, pointed to the low yield on dollar accounts that further reduces the appeal of storing foreign exchange at banks.
A steep monetary easing cycle and a government-sponsored credit push have also done their part to heighten distrust of their currency among Turks.
Growth in money supply, as measured by currency in circulation and bank deposits, is running at an annual rate close to 70% when adjusted for foreign-exchange movements, a record high, according to central bank data going back to late 2006.
Holding liras, meanwhile, is guaranteed to sap savings in real terms because the average one-month deposit account in the local currency yields an annual 6.87%, while headline inflation is just under 12%.
Facing pressure on the currency to weaken but reluctant to raise rates, authorities have instead started curbing the supply of credit. On Thursday, the central bank announced the latest measures that would effectively raise the cost of funding.
The question now is whether the shift in monetary policy is enough to persuade Turks to move out of gold and dollars and back into owning their local currency.
“In the last couple of days we’ve seen a correction -- we have to watch how far this will go on,” Tasdelen at Istanbul’s Troy Precious Metals said, referring to the pullback in the price of gold. “But some investors see this as an opportunity to buy.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar drifted higher on Friday, helped by strong U.S. jobs data as well as firmer global demand for safe-havens amid concerns about the coronavirus recovery, setting the currency up to potentially snap a seven-week losing streak.
Soft Chinese retail and production figures cast a pall over the mood in Asia, dragging on the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars. 
The Aussie  was last 0.2% softer at $0.7138 and has settled in to a range around that level after pulling back from a 18-month high hit a week ago. [AUD/]
The kiwi  was under pressure at $0.6537 as the country also faces a fresh COVID-19 outbreak and after dovish comments from the central bank this week. Other majors were mostly flat, but the euro (EUR=EBS) hovered above $1.18.
""Risk sentiment is slowing down,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer. ""It's too early to say the whole (dollar) downtrend is over...but it's got potential and at the very least it's putting a cap on the Aussie and kiwi.""
China's industrial output rose more slowly than expected in July and retail sales fell for a seventh straight month, suggesting some bumps in even the world's most promising rebound.
Troubling signs also emerged on the health front in Asia, with a dozen new cases in New Zealand - which is considering whether to ease or extend its lockdown of Auckland - and the biggest daily jump in new cases in South Korea since March.
Overnight the weekly number of applications for unemployment benefits in the United States dropped below one million for the first time since the start of the pandemic, with 963,000 claims coming in below expectations for 1.1 million.
But beyond buoying the dollar any relief was shortlived, as some 30 million Americans are out of work and an aid package to keep stimulus flowing in the economy has stalled in Congress.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar remains 0.1% lower for the week, but it has appeared to arrest a slide that has it about 9.5% below its March peak.
YEN DROPS
This week has also been a bad one for the Japanese yen, which is headed for its biggest weekly drop against the dollar in two months as a jump in U.S. yields has attracted flows from Japan.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) are up nearly 15 basis points this week, the sharpest jump since early June, as the U.S. Treasury flooded the market with supply and as some investors grew more positive about the long-term outlook. [US/] 
The yen  was steady on the dollar at 106.94 in morning trade and is a little less than 1% softer for the week.
""After threatening to break lower towards the end of last month, dollar/yen has moved back within the 106.00 to 108.00 range which has held for the most part since April,"" said MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman.
""The yen has been undermined in part by the ongoing improvement in global investor risk sentiment,"" he said.
The move is also broad, with the yen down 1.2% this week to an almost two-year low against the Swiss franc (JPYCHF=R) and falling more than 1% to multi-month lows against the euro (EURJPY=R) and pound (GBPJPY=R).
That is welcome in Japan, where it benefits exporters which has helped propel the Nikkei stock index (N225) to a six month peak this week. (T)
Elsewhere the pound  was marginally weaker at $1.3055.

On the data schedule later today are preliminary European employment and GDP numbers, as well as U.S. retail sales figures, with investors likely to focus on any signs of divergence between the U.S. and European recoveries.

Invesitng.com – The pound continued to flirt with five-month highs against the dollar, and is likely to add to gains despite rising worries the U.K. and EU are unlikely to end the stalemate on post-Brexit talks, which are set to be resumed next week.  
GBP/USD rose 0.15% to $1.3051.
The U.K.'s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said the U.K. would work to iron out key sticking points on a range of measures including regulatory standards, fisheries, and security policy as the next round of talks kick off on Aug. 18.
Frost, however, said the U.K.  would not comprise on its sovereignty, over its laws, courts, or fishing waters, suggesting that efforts to end the current stalemate will be fraught with difficulty.
Ahead of the talks Ireland's Prime Minister Micheál Martin said a ""landing zone"" for the deal had emerged.
But analysts appear to be downplaying the prospect of any deal making at the upcoming round of talks, raising the economically damaging prospect of the U.K. adopting World Trade Organization terms to trade with the EU.
“As the trade talks have made no progress so far, it seems increasingly unlikely that an agreement will be reached by the end of the year,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. “Without such an agreement, trade would then be conducted according to WTO rules from next year onwards, which would be a bitter blow for both sides in real economic terms, but above all for the British economy, for which the EU is by far the largest trading partner.”
Still, the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is unlikely to see the pound cede much ground to the dollar, as the greenback is forecast to continue its slide.
Commerzbank forecasts GBP/USD to reach $1.32 by the end of the year, and hit a high of $1.39 next year.

China’s yuan is flashing the strongest technical signal since 2012 for gains against the U.S. dollar.
The onshore currency’s 50-day moving average has fallen below its 200-day mean, completing the so-called golden cross pattern that some analysts interpret as a sign that a rally will continue. While such crossovers happen frequently, this is the first time in eight years that both moving averages are trending down, a phenomenon some market watchers say signals a true golden cross.
Looking for Carry Trade? Yuan Ranks Among the Best: China Today
The dollar is heading for a fifth month of losses. Meanwhile, China’s success in restarting the economy after the pandemic, the widening of its current-account surplus, its relative yields over dollar assets and foreign inflows are all supportive of further gains for the yuan.
In addition to the golden cross pattern, the currency has broken through a trend line that’s limited its gains since March 2019. The line has now become a support for the Chinese currency -- potentially limiting any losses.
Fiona Lim, a senior currency analyst at Malayan Banking Berhad in Singapore, predicts a stronger yuan and suggests investors look to the trend in the 100-day mean, now that the 50-day and 200-day averages have already completed a cross.
“A decisive break below could see USD/CNH trade lower towards 6.85 levels,” she wrote.
The onshore yuan was trading little changed at 6.9409 on Thursday, holding its gains since May at 3.4%. Its offshore counterpart was at 6.9372.

While technicals point to further strengthening, the yuan remains vulnerable to an escalation in U.S.-China tensions. With a discussion imminent on the so-called phase one trade deal between the two nations, the next several days could be a testing time for the currency.

The yuan capped its last golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day averages in October 2012 when Federal Reserve stimulus stoked capital flows into China. The pattern was followed by an extended advance until January 2014, when a 5.9% rally ended.
Since then, the shorter average fell below the longer average four times -- in 2014, 2017, 2019 and earlier this year. But all of them had a rising 200-day mean, making them weaker signals.
There were also four crossovers between the 100-day and 200-day averages since 2012, but there hasn’t been one with both of them trending down.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Thursday, amid fading hopes for additional economic stimulus while inflation figures surprised to the upside.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 93.157. USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 106.72, GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.3066 and EUR/USD was up 0.4% at 1.1826.
Weighing on the greenback has been the inability of the U.S. lawmakers to come to any sort of consensus regarding the country’s latest Covid-19 stimulus package, a deal that many feel is necessary to keep the economic recovery on track.
U.S. President Donald Trump accused Democrats on Wednesday of not wanting to negotiate over the package, with Republican and Democratic negotiators trading barbs and blame as negotiations ended without a result for the fifth day.
 On Tuesday, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin stated that the economy could take another downturn if U.S. policymakers fail to provide more financial aid. 
He was backed up Wednesday by Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren, who said he ""strongly"" supported taking additional fiscal action to help businesses and households survive the crisis. But, added more spending should be combined with more robust efforts to contain the virus.
U.S. deaths caused by Covid-19 topped 166,000 as of Aug. 13, with confirmed cases rising by more than 4% in the past week, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.
Adding to the problems facing the dollar were the latest inflation figures, with strong numbers from both the consumer and producer sides.
""The 0.6% month-on-month increase in July core CPI was jaw dropping,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""It was the largest sequential jump since January 1991. While this momentum in pricing is unlikely to be sustained, the strength was broad-based and cannot be ignored.""
With the Federal Reserve already committed to keeping its benchmark rates at these very lows for some time, the pressure is building on U.S. real yields.
“Much discussed in financial markets this summer is the drop in U.S. real yields as the Fed keeps rates low, while U.S. inflation expectations are on the rise,” said Chris Turner at ING, in a research note to clients.
“Expect this macro-policy theme to play a major role in FX market pricing ahead of a possible Fed adoption of an average inflation target in September. This theme is a broad dollar negative.”

COVID-19 continues to impact U.S. economic recovery, with almost 5.2 million cases in the U.S. alone as of August 13, according to Johns Hopkins University and millions unemployed.
Although investors have swung between optimism and pessimism over the stalled package, some argued that U.S. economic recovery depended on both sides reaching an agreement.
""The dollar needs positive news on stimulus to rise further, but I'm sure we'll get there, because these politicians can't go back to their constituencies empty handed,"" Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, told Reuters.
""Once this happens, gains in dollar/yen could be a catalyst for dollar gains against other currencies.""

The AUD/USD pair was up 0.08% to 0.7167, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics releasing a positive jobs report for July earlier in the day. The report said that 114,700 jobs were added in July, beating analyst expectations of 40,000 jobs prepared by Investing.com. July’s unemployment rate of 7.5% also beat expectations.
But the country’s fight against COVID-19 goes on, although the country was poised to report its lowest one-day rise in the number of cases in more than three weeks on Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against most of its peers on Thursday amid fading hopes for a compromise between Republicans and Democrats over additional economic stimulus.
In Asia, the focus was on the Australian dollar ahead of data that is expected to show slowing jobs creation and rising unemployment as a resurgence of the coronavirus rocks the economy.
The greenback was hampered by a decline in Treasury yields, but analysts say this is likely only a temporary setback because U.S. lawmakers will eventually agree to more stimulus to support economic recovery from the coronavirus.
""The dollar needs positive news on stimulus to rise further, but I'm sure we'll get there, because these politicians can't go back to their constituencies empty handed,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

President Donald Trump accused congressional Democrats on Wednesday of not wanting to negotiate over a U.S. coronavirus aid package as top Republican and Democratic negotiators traded blame for a five-day lapse in talks over relief legislation.
The pandemic has taken a particularly heavy toll on the United States, where it has killed more people than any other country. Millions of U.S. workers have lost jobs, and supplemental federal unemployment benefits expired last month.
Market sentiment has swung between optimism and pessimism, but analysts argue that more stimulus is the most likely outcome because without it the U.S. economic recovery could stall.

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher in early European trade Wednesday, helped by a jump in U.S. yields ahead of a massive bond auction and amid hopes that the coronavirus outbreak is coming under control.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 93.736. USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 106.78 and EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1732.
The yield on 10-year U.S. debt climbed by its most in two months overnight ahead of a record $38 billion auction later on Wednesday.
The move up in yields is driven by both repositioning ahead of big issuance this week and a sense that the U.S. recovery is broadening and looking more robust, said NAB senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril, in a Reuters report.
Recent reports have suggested a decline in hospitalizations in the U.S. due to the Covid-19 virus, strengthening confidence that the pandemic is coming back under control.
Elsewhere, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.3045 after official figures showed the U.K. economy shrank by a record 20.4% between April and June, the largest contraction reported by any major economy to date.
This means the U.K.’s economy, the world's sixth biggest, has entered a recession, its first since the financial crisis, as the previous quarter had also seen a gross domestic production contraction.
That said, sterling losses were minor as a sharp slowdown during the height of the lockdowns had been expected, and there were signs of recovery in the month of June alone when gross domestic product grew by 8.7% from May.
""The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record,"" Jonathan Athow of the Office for National Statistics said.
""The economy began to bounce back in June... Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.""
From a technical point of view, GBP/USD risks further downside in the near-term, although within the broader 1.2950/1.3160 range, according to FX strategists at UOB Group.
“Downward momentum is beginning to improve, and GBP could drift lower to 1.3005. For today, a sustained decline below 1.3005 is not expected (next support is at 1.2950).”

The central bank on Tuesday met the banks to discuss the situation with them, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The banks had been engaged by grains firms to trade dollars in the offshore non-deliverable forwards (NDF) market where they would get a better exchange rate than they would at home, the sources said.
The sources declined to identify the banks or the grains firms. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan does not permit onshore trading of NDFs, but companies can still engage in this via foreign banks' overseas branches.
The sources said the size of the trades could have an impact on the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at a time when the central bank is already worried about the local currency's strength.
The Taiwan dollar has continued to strengthen against the U.S. dollar, and the relatively large gap between the overseas non-deliverable forward market for the greenback and the deliverable forward market for the Taiwan dollar has created arbitrage opportunities, as they get a more favourable rate overseas.

The Taiwan dollar has appreciated 2.4% against the greenback so far this year, worrying the government in the export reliant economy. Taipei is also wary about being labelled a currency manipulator by the United States.

That attracts investment, particularly from Japan where yields at the front of the curve are pinned around or below zero, and lifted the dollar by half a percent on the yen  to 106.53 - where it stayed on Wednesday.
Elsewhere in financial markets, focus was on the political holdup in Washington over a new stimulus package, which capped broader investor sentiment.
In Asia, the New Zealand dollar  hit a three-week low following a fresh coronavirus lockdown in Auckland and ahead of a crucial central bank policy decision due at 0200 GMT.
The move up in yields is driven by both repositioning ahead of big issuance this week and a sense that the U.S. recovery is broadening and looking more robust, said NAB senior FX strategist Rodrigo Catril.
""That is reflected in the rotation in equities into more cyclical sectors and plays into the idea that U.S. Treasury yields should be higher, reflecting that improvement in prospects for the global recovery,"" he said.
""Dollar/yen is the most sensitive...but higher U.S. Treasury yields should in theory be broadly supportive for the dollar.""
Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the dollar extended a bounce made last Friday as U.S.-China tensions ratcheted higher with President Donald Trump's ban on TikTok and WeChat.
It last sat at 93.654. Against the euro (EUR=EBS) the greenback was steady at $1.1740 and against the Australian dollar  it was firm just below a one-week high at $0.7147.
The dollar index has slumped 9% from a three-year high it hit in March and lost 4% in July alone, leaving investors divided over whether the support the greenback has found in August amounts to a bounce or a pause in its decline.
RBNZ WATCH
Traders in Asia have a wary eye fixed on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday.
No change in rates is expected, but the bank can often surprise and a dovish tone is likely -- especially with Auckland back under lockdown because four new COVID-19 cases were detected after 102 virus-free days.
""It's far too soon to say what the exact implications are, but the return of COVID-19 presents downside risk to the outlook,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Wednesday.
""The (policy) committee can ill-afford to be complacent, and need to underscore that they will do what it takes. We thus expect a very dovish tone, which poses significant downside risks for the New Zealand dollar.""
Most analysts expect an expansion of the central bank's bond buying programme beyond the current NZ$60 billion and for negative rates to remain firmly on the table.
The kiwi was last at $0.6564, its lowest since July 21.
Elsewhere the pound  was under pressure following poor labour market data overnight, which showed British job losses jumping to their highest level in more than a decade last quarter.
U.S. inflation figures due at 1230 GMT are expected to show consumer price growth drift down to 1.1% on a year-on-year basis from 1.2% in June.

Investors are also looking for signs that the political impasse in Washington over the next stimulus programme can be overcome, with the stalemate weighing on U.S. equities overnight as Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for the deadlock.

452,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Shorting the dollar is becoming a crowded trade due for a squeeze, some hedge funds say.
BlueBay Asset Management, which oversees more than $60 billion, has taken profit on short dollar positions, while AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Ltd. pared its bullish bets on emerging-market currencies. K2 Asset Management Ltd. is taking risks off the table partly on concern over a sudden bounce in the world’s reserve currency.
If they’re right, the investors that have piled into short positions -- now at a two-year high -- could see their summer gains evaporate. The most popular trade in foreign-exchange markets since the Federal Reserve’s all-out intervention in late March has showed no signs of abating with Wall Street predicting further dollar declines.
“It’s becoming a very crowded trade to short the dollar,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP in Sydney. “The risks could manifest at any time, there’s room for the dollar’s re-tracement.”
The dollar has been sold against its Group-of-10 peers for the past four months, and bets against it continue to mount. At the end of July, leverage funds piled into the yen, and they then turned net long on the euro for the first time in two years.
While none of the hedge funds are advocating for a return to dollar strength, they’re pointing out that the risks are mounting for a short-term bounce.
“Excess spikes in volatility could see the dollar swing back aggressively in the short-term,” said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset. “That could prove painful especially for some emerging-markets that tend to get whacked on bouts of dollar strength.”
One of the drivers could come from a continued escalation of the Washington-Beijing spat, which tends to spur volatility and haven bids. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index posted its biggest one-day gain in over a month last Friday on the back of a strong U.S. jobs report and an attack by President Donald Trump on two Chinese technology firms.
While summer tends to see a lull in activity, swings in foreign exchanges have climbed through July, according to volatility indexes from Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
August could also mark the start of seasonal flows that tend to favor the American currency. A gauge of dollar strength shows that it tended to gain from this month to November over the past decade, and rose 3% on average in the quarter before the past seven presidential elections.
“It makes sense to run flat risk through August after several very strong months of returns across markets,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay in London. “We had been short U.S. dollars but are now flat after booking profits.”
For the dollar bears though, any rebound will be short-term and ripe for more bets against it.
“The obvious risks are a sharp market correction or tail events” such as a stronger-than-expected U.S. recovery, said David Ward, a managing director at Golden Horse Fund Management Pte. in Singapore, who favors the euro. “But it is looking increasingly unlikely this recovery will occur in the near term.”

453,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s weakness is giving central banks in Asia room to ease monetary policy further amid concerns that the region’s economic recovery is plateauing.
A 10% decline in the Bloomberg dollar index since its March high has stemmed a tide of capital outflows triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and drawn foreign investors back into Asia’s capital markets.
That dynamic strengthens local currencies and keeps a lid on inflation, giving central banks the option of reducing interest rates without being hemmed in by fleeing capital or rising prices.​
While many are opting to hold rates for now, they have relatively more room to ease versus their global peers and have scope to unleash programs such as quantitative easing or use other targeted tools to spur lending.
“A weak U.S. dollar is on balance positive for Asian economies and good news for central banks,” said Janet Mui, an investment director at Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF) Holdings Plc in London. “The worst situation for an emerging market central bank is usually a slump in the local currency, capital outflows, rising inflation,” which would prompt rate hikes.
All Asian currencies have strengthened against the greenback since the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index reached a peak in late March. Indonesia’s rupiah has led the advance, gaining more than 10%, while the South Korean won has risen almost 7%.
Growth Risks
The dollar reprieve comes as the resurgent coronavirus threatens to stall an already fragile economic recovery.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned last month that Asia-Pacific economies, which accounted for more than 70% of global growth in 2019, passed a major inflection point in June when the pace of the region’s reopening “slowed materially.” China and Vietnam are among very few economies in Asia projected to grow this year.
While economists say the bulk of emergency easing is likely over -- for example, China’s central bank is sticking to a restrained path -- more policy measures are still expected.
The Bank of Thailand this month held its benchmark interest rate at an all-time low and said it was prepared to use “additional appropriate monetary policy tools” to support an economy suffering the biggest blow in Asia from the coronavirus pandemic. India’s central bank also held its policy rate at a record low last week while outlining a range of measures to support a fragile banking sector.
New Zealand’s central bank is expected to hold steady when it meets Wednesday, though unemployment could pressure it to move again. Indonesia and the Philippines, which will announce policy decisions next week, have cut rates aggressively this year and are using other tools, such as reducing reserve ratios for banks, to support growth.
Reserves Boost
Downsides of dollar weakness include stronger local currencies which make exports less competitive.
Some central banks have capped appreciation by buying dollars or have taken advantage of the greenback’s weakness to restock their foreign currency reserves. China’s foreign currency holdings rose $54.9 billion, or 1.7%, from the previous month to $3.3 trillion in July. India has accumulated a record amount of foreign exchange reserves worth almost $535 billion.
Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte. in Singapore, said the weaker dollar will allow officials to go beyond rate cuts and consider quantitative easing without fear of capital outflows. Indonesia’s central bank has already ventured into direct financing of the government.
“A weaker U.S. dollar may push some Asian central banks toward monetizing fiscal deficits and debt as the repercussions on their own currency and inflation will be smaller,” he said.

Investing.com -- The dollar was little changed in early trading in Europe Tuesday, with no breakthrough in the U.S. fiscal stimulus talks to push it in either direction.
Risk appetite was supported somewhat by reports of a decline in hospitalizations in the U.S. due to the Covid-19 virus, strengthening confidence that the pandemic is coming back under control in response to more restrictive measures in the south and west of the country in June and July.
The euro was quiet ahead of the first big sentiment indicator of the month in Europe, in the shape of the ZEW index. At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), it was unchanged at $1.1737.
Consensus expectations for the ZEW are for a modest decline in the main index to 58 from 59.3 in July, although the more important number will arguably be the sub-index for current conditions, which is expected to improve to -68.8 from -80.9.
The euro was also flat against sterling, rising less than 0.1% to 0.8982 after U.K. labor market data showed the biggest fall in employment since 2009 in the three months through July. Some 220,000 jobs were lost and the number of people claiming jobless benefits soared by 94,400, well above the consensus forecast of 10,000 and only partially offset by a downward revision to June’s figures.
Dave Ramsden, a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Council, told The Times in an interview that the Bank is still ready to add stimulus if the economy weakens again.
Sterling also edged down by 0.1% against the dollar to $1.3060, keeping some support after a reasonably solid survey from the British Retail Consortium, which suggested that retail sales were 3.2% higher in July than a year ago.
Pantheon Economics analyst Samuel Tombs noted that the BRC figures may flatter the underlying trend, since  “services spending likely also has benefited from the release of pent-up demand and the running down of “enforced” savings.” He said this was unlikely to continue as the labor market weakens further.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira strengthened modestly after sharp losses last week on fears of a looming balance of payments crisis. The dollar fell 0.5% to 7.2958 lira."
455,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s stunning decline last month, the most in a decade, suddenly looks a lot less consequential once you take into consideration the inflation-adjusted value of the greenback.
That’s the view of veteran strategist Marshall Gittler, who suggested investors should adjust for price levels, use a wider basket of trading peers than the closely-followed U.S. Dollar Index and remember how much the currency had previously risen, in order to put its move in proper context. While the gauge of the dollar fell 4.2% in July, the U.S. Fed Trade-Weighted Real Broad Dollar Index only weakened by 0.9%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Back in April, the recent peak, the dollar’s real value was the highest it’s been in nearly 18 years,” Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Group, said in a note Friday, published by Nasdaq. “That was the extraordinary move, not the recent decline.”
The Federal Reserve index’s 3.6% drop since April is “far from being a catastrophe that needs explaining” and is in line with its historical long-term trading pattern, he said. By comparison, the Dollar Index is down 7.1% from its April peak.
Gittler joins other strategists, including those at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., pushing back on the intensifying debate over the future of the dollar, including threats of a structural decline voiced by analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).

 "
456,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s been a seismic shift in the euro’s fortune.
Money managers are the most optimistic they’ve ever been on prospects for the common currency after its best month in almost a decade. And demand for European assets is so high that the currency is within a whisker of being more expensive than the dollar for the first time since funding pressures jumped earlier this year.
That’s because the European Union’s landmark rescue fund has gone a long way in soothing concerns over the bloc’s structural risks, and efforts to control the coronavirus and reignite the economy look particularly promising compared to the U.S. Those factors are setting the stage for a long-lasting change for the euro.
“This is not a matter of growth this year or next year or predictions about the cycle -- it’s really something more structural,” said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The budget deal changes the way financial markets look at the euro zone in a significant way,” he said, adding that “it’s a big reinforcement of the EU and of the euro.”
Such is the euphoria over the turn in the euro’s paradigm that stocks, which typically see demand fall as their underlying currency strengthens, are rising as traders capitalize on growth differentials between Europe and the U.S. And the rates on some of the highest-yielding sovereign bonds in the 27-member bloc have plummeted to pre-lockdown levels.
The Big Shift
Underpinning the euro’s transformed fortunes is the EU’s landmark 750-billion-euro ($882 billion) package. The deal, thrashed out in July to support the economic recovery, succeeded where years of political wrangling had failed. The rescue fund, which will be financed by the sale of joint bonds, has helped calm fears of a breakup.
Coupled with European Central Bank’s quantitative easing programs, the difference in yield between benchmark Italian and German bonds, a measure of risk in Europe that soared in March, is now near the lowest since February.
“It’s a powerful story for the euro,” said Tony Small, head of European interest rate strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). “A big portion of the tail associated with a euro break-up will likely be perceived to have gone away, and will be replaced by an attractive high quality issuer, which will pull up the entire credit quality of the euro.”
The euro’s 4.8% jump in July sent the currency flying through a bearish trend line that capped gains since 2008, unlocking its potential for more rallies. It also spurred a rush among analysts to revise their forecasts higher.
And while the currency has taken a breather in the spot market in August, falling 0.2% to $1.1756 as of 4:59 p.m. on Monday, net-long positions in the security rose to an all-time high, according to CFTC data.
It’s Relative
The currency’s fundamentals look especially strong when compared with the dollar, which has seen net-short positions versus major peers rise to the highest since 2012, according to Bloomberg calculations of CFTC data.
A gauge for the greenback suffered its worst July since 2010, ending the month near the lowest level in almost two years. It’s being weighed down by the rising number of infections in the U.S., which exceeded 5 million, the nation’s fragmented response to the virus, a Washington standoff over a new economic relief bill, and what may be a contentious presidential election in November.
These risks play in the euro’s favor.
There are signs the euro area has succeeded in breaking the link between economies re-opening and the virus escalating, helping to boost forecasts for growth. Even though Europe’s lockdown and initial downturn were larger, gross domestic product is poised to expand 5.5% in 2021, about 1.5 percentage points faster than the U.S., according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s only happened eight times since 1992, according to International Monetary Fund data.
Real Yields
Nonetheless, there are mounting concerns about new flare-ups in infections in Europe. The number of confirmed cases in Germany, the continent’s biggest economy, rose more than 6,000 in the seven days through Sunday, the most since May, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.
“The risks remain that new outbreaks will occur, particularly as we get into winter,” said Iain Begg, a research fellow at the European Institute of the London School of Economics. “But the range of policies -- both the economic and containment policies in Europe -- seems to me to be better-attuned to dealing with both the health crisis and the economic crisis than the U.S.”
With real yields in the U.S. at a record low and falling faster than elsewhere, investments are flowing back into Europe where the government response to the virus is more predictable, said London-based Jordan Rochester, a Group-of-10 foreign-exchange analyst at Nomura International.
Until those dynamics change or there’s a second wave, Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA in London, recommends buying dips in the euro in the medium term.
“It’s not just growth,” said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho International Plc, who sees the currency rising to $1.30 by July 2021. “It’s also that politically, the euro has never been as strong as this, and it’s never been as close to being properly constructed as this.”

457,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- It looks increasingly like Emmanuel Macron holds the key to whether the U.K. and European Union will get a trade deal.
Officials on both sides of the negotiations see the French president as the wild card who could scupper an agreement at the last minute if he thinks there’s more to gain by refusing to compromise.
With a French presidential election less than two years away and his ratings flagging amid an economy hit hard by the coronavirus, the officials say they fear Macron could think there are votes to be had in standing up to the British. Another negotiating round gets under way in Brussels next week, with both sides hoping to close in on an agreement by the start of October.
While U.K. and EU negotiators are now making slow headway toward a deal, Macron and the other leaders of the bloc’s 27 countries have scarcely paid attention to Brexit since talks on the two sides’ future relationship started in March. That will change after the summer when they will be asked to approve or reject any accord.
Fishing for Votes
What’s giving officials the jitters is that the biggest sticking point in the negotiations is something that has totemic significance among the working-class French voters that Macron needs to appeal to most: fishing. Equally, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s successful push for Brexit included a promise to look after the interests of the U.K. fishing industry.
“The EU continue to insist on access to U.K. fishing waters in a way that is incompatible with our future status as an independent coastal state,” said a U.K. government official, asking not to be named in line with policy. The official declined to comment on Macron’s role in talks.
Without an agreement on fisheries there can be no overall trade deal, meaning the two sides would start trading on World Trade Organization terms with tariffs and quotas, and a breakdown in relations in areas ranging from police cooperation to environmental standards.
Four people familiar with the U.K.-EU negotiations, two on each side, said uncertainty over what Macron might do was more than a passing concern and that the issue has been discussed by British officials and informally between EU diplomats. One described it as the perfect storm of a French president eager to bolster his electoral support, a British prime minister who might settle for “no deal,” and an issue that’s highly symbolic for both nations.
Migrant Crossings
While Johnson and Macron get along personally -- the president is the only major EU leader to visit Johnson since his election victory in December -- the relationship between the U.K. and its closest overseas neighbor is never a simple one. Currently tensions are boiling up over migrants crossing the English Channel from France to England.
Within the trade talks, the fight is over the level of access French and other European vessels will get to the plentiful waters around the U.K. when Britain leaves the bloc’s Common Fisheries Policy at the end of this year.
Any agreement “cannot lead to the partial destruction of the EU fishing industry,” the bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said after the latest round of negotiations in London last month. Pointedly, he added that it was necessary to protect “the interests of all member states” by getting a “long-term solution” on fish.
The U.K. rejects anything resembling the status quo. Britain’s fishing communities voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, blaming the EU for decimation of their industry. The British government sees control of its waters as part of regaining sovereignty and is pushing not for a “long-term solution” but for annual discussions with the EU over quotas based on the latest fish stock data that would give the U.K. a far bigger share.
Economic Realities
An Elysee official declined to comment other than to say Macron fully supported Barnier and his negotiating mandate.
Still, what’s giving officials some hope is that by the time he’s asked to intervene, Macron will be convinced of the benefits of an overall agreement for both sides. The EU has remained united on Brexit, and after the bloc last month reached a common position on the far more divisive issue of its post-pandemic recovery program, there’s little appetite to fall out over its relationship with the U.K.
The EU is betting that economic realities means Britain will want to do a deal too. British vessels catch far more fish than the U.K. consumes so relies on the EU market to sell to, which would be far more difficult without a trade deal.
“There is scope for a deal to be signed,” Anand Menon, director of the U.K. In a Changing Europe, a network of academics, told Bloomberg Radio. “But it won’t happen until the autumn, when political leaders on both sides of the Channel finally get properly involved and authorize the kind of concessions that both sides are going to have to make.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held overnight gains on Tuesday following seven weeks of an almost relentless fall as investors clung to hopes of a bi-partisan stimulus deal in Washington and U.S. bond yields rebounded from multi-month lows.
The dollar index jumped back to 93.597  from Friday's two-year low of 92.495. Having fallen for seven straight weeks, the currency was due for a short-term corrective bounce, traders said.
The euro changed hands at $1.1741 (EUR=) having eased 0.5% in previous trade. The dollar stood little changed at 105.96 yen  
""The dollar's decline appears to have come to a halt for now. Although talks on fiscal spending are locked in a stalemate, we are at least avoiding a complete cutoff of extra jobless benefit,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday signed executive orders restoring part of enhanced unemployment payments and suspending payroll taxes.
""Compared to market consensus of a stimulus deal worth $1 trillion-$1.5 trillion, economic boosts from the announced measures would be clearly smaller,"" said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan rates and FX research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""Looking at market reactions, investors appear to think that there will be some sort of deal eventually,"" JPMorgan's Yamawaki.
U.S. congressional leaders and Trump administration officials said on Monday they were ready to resume negotiations on a coronavirus aid deal, although it was unclear whether Democrats and Republicans would be able to bridge their differences.
On Monday, the S&P500 index (SPX) rose to a five-month high while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose to as high as 0.581% (US10YT=RR), its highest level in more than a week.
Investors are also keeping an eye on the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Washington and Beijing.
China imposed sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens, including Republican lawmakers, following Washington's sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said companies from China and other countries that do not comply with accounting standards will be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges as of the end of 2021.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira stayed near a record low hit on Friday on concerns about the country's depleting foreign reserves, leading to expectations that the central bank may take more decisive action to stem its fall.
The lira was quoted at 7.320 per dollar , just above Friday's record low of 7.365.

With more wild swings in the Turkish currency expected, implied volatilities, calculated from option prices, have soared, with three-month volatility  rising to 26.5%, its highest since April last year.

459,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Compared with the global market turmoil China’s currency devaluation in 2015 triggered, the more gentle but steady depreciation since is spurring less concern.
Five years ago to the day, the central bank unexpectedly cut its daily reference rate by 1.9%, triggering the yuan’s biggest one-day drop since China ended a dual currency system in 1994. The shock move, and ensuing weakness, spurred outflows of more than $500 billion over the next two years, prompting authorities to impose a series of restrictions to stem the exodus of funds.
Compared with the pre-devaluation level, the yuan is down more than 10% against both the dollar and a basket of trading partner currencies. Against the euro, the Chinese currency is near a six-year low. Activity in the foreign-exchange market is calm: a gauge measuring expected swings in the yuan and an indicator for bearish options never reached the levels seen in the aftermath of Beijing’s shock move, although capital controls remain strict.
China welcomes a weaker currency, which makes the country’s goods more appealing globally. Yet avoiding sharp depreciation has meant a trade off between stability and encouraging the yuan to play a more significant role. The currency remains little used outside of China for the size of the economy. Its share in global payments and central bank reserves remains low at about 2%, only a fraction of the dollar’s share of more than 40% on both accounts.
Keeping depreciation slow may also help avoid the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who vowed to brand China a currency manipulator when he first campaigned for president. For now, it seems Chinese policy makers are happy to watch the yuan track the dollar weaker against peers. Despite escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, the yuan is trading around the same level it was against the greenback six months ago.
“China’s management of the sentiment in the foreign-exchange market has been successful -- the overall stability in the yuan has helped bolster investor confidence and drive inflows,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank. “In the future, Beijing will need to make the spot rate more market-driven, facilitate overseas funds’ investments in onshore assets, and create more derivatives for traders to hedge yuan risks.”
The People’s Bank of China can still dictate where it wants the yuan to trade with its daily fix. Based on quotes submitted by 14 banks every morning, the rate restricts the onshore yuan’s moves by 2% on either side. For traders, the fixing signals the government’s stance on the currency. Other measures to manage the currency’s moves include rhetoric from officials, capital controls on companies and individuals and issuance of offshore yuan bills.
Such controls are a double-edged sword. While they help Beijing prevent messy depreciation, they also undermine the government’s plan to make the yuan a truly globalized currency. Despite China’s efforts to get the International Monetary Fund to name the yuan an official reserve currency in 2016, its share in central bank reserves is small. Analysts such as Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior emerging-markets strategist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) CIB, say the PBOC should allow the currency greater flexibility.
Further tests are coming for the yuan ahead of the U.S. presidential election. It posted its largest single-day plunge in four years in 2019 as the two countries exchanged threats to levy additional tariffs on each others’ exports. And in May this year, it edged closer to a decade-low after the Trump administration stepped up rhetoric against Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus. Analysts expect the exchange rate to end the year 0.4% weaker at 7 per dollar, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.

""Over the last two weeks the GBP has been the best performing G10 currency. Unless there is a broader deterioration in overall investor risk sentiment, the GBP appears well placed to extend its advance in the near-term,"" MUFG said in a note.
GBP/USD, or cable, climbed 0.23% to $1.3081, after climbing to a session high of $1.3104.
The latest move higher in the pound came ahead of key economic data including an update on the labor market and second-quarter GDP due later this week.
Cable, which is on a two-month winning streak, is nearing levels that if surpassed could set it on a course to test a more than eight-month high.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Monday, following Friday’s better-than-expected employment report. However, gains are likely to be short-lived as doubts remain about the U.S. economic recovery.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.477. USD/JPY was flat at 105.94, GBP/USD traded up 0.1% at 1.3062 and EUR/USD was down 0.1% at 1.1772.
Non-farm payrolls rose by 1.763 million in July, against the estimated 1.6 million increase, data showed on Friday. The unemployment rate also fell to 10.2% in July, compared to June’s reading of 10.5%.
While this was a better than expected result, “the risk is this eases the pressure on politicians to agree on an immediate fiscal deal,”said analyst James Knightley at ING, in a research note.
“With confidence already under pressure, incomes being squeezed by benefit cuts and Covid containment measures hurting job prospects, we are entering a more challenging period for the economy,” he added.
“The August jobs report is going to be worse as the economic effects of Covid-19 containment measures increasingly bite.”
U.S. President Donald Trump kept his promise to take executive action if the U.S. Congress failed to reach a consensus over the country’s latest stimulus measures, signing four executive orders over the weekend related to Covid-19 economic relief.
The orders would provide an extra $400 per week in unemployment payments, less than the $600 per week passed earlier in the crisis. However, doubts remain about the legality of the orders and whether they would have the desired impact. 
Meanwhile, White House officials and congressional Democrats on Sunday expressed a willingness to compromise on another stimulus package to bolster the stalled economy, but said no talks were planned.
From a technical point of view, looking at the dollar index, the recent “price action lends credence to our view that a technical consolidative/corrective phase is at hand,” said Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “Further near-term dollar recovery looks likely but does not change our longer-term bearish outlook.”
“A bottom was carved and tested near 92.50. It is potentially a double bottom. A move above 94.00 is needed to confirm it, though others might not be convinced until 94.50 area (20-day moving average) is surpassed,” he added."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was struggling to keep a rare rally together on Monday as its longest losing streak in a decade left much of the market structurally short of the currency and vulnerable to a squeeze on any upbeat news.
Bears were caught out by a better payrolls report on Friday, which pushed Treasury yields higher into this week's massive $112 billion debt sale. Yet the dollar still ended lower for the seventh week in a row.
""Our portfolio has been positioned for a number of weeks now for a narrowly weaker USD as a consequence of the independent surge in COVID-19 infections in the U.S. that has opened up a decent gap in near-term economic performance, especially against Europe,"" said analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note.
""Our positions have been concentrated in the EUR-bloc, reflecting also the structural improvement in the European policy framework following the agreement over the recovery fund.""
The euro edged up to $1.1791 on Monday, having hit a two-year high of $1.1915 last week, which now acts as major resistance. Support comes in around $1.1755 and $1.1694.
Turnover was light with Tokyo on a holiday and considerable uncertainty on whether U.S. policymakers can agree a new package of fiscal support for the virus-hit economy. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said they were open to restarting COVID-19 aid talks, after President Donald Trump took executive actions on unemployment benefits.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction firmer at 93.339 and just above a two-year trough.
The dollar was a little steadier on the yen at 105.75, well above the recent low of 104.17 but facing stiff resistance at 106.46.
Investors were wary of a fresh flare up in Sino-U.S. tensions with trade talks scheduled for Aug. 15 even as Washington imposed sanctions on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials.
Any breakdown in talks would tend to benefit the dollar, and the safe-haven Swiss franc, at the expense of the Japanese yen and commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar.
On the data front, the United States has consumer prices on Wednesday and retail sales on Friday, which is expected to show a solid bounce in spending albeit before the latest round of social restrictions took some steam out of the economy.
A raft of Chinese figures is due this week, which is forecast to show a continued recovery, while EU production data is also expected to please.

Data showed China's factory deflation eased in July, driven by a rise in global oil prices and as industrial activity climbed towards pre-coronavirus levels.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, despite Friday’s better-than-expected U.S. payrolls report which pushed Treasury yields higher.
Non-farm payrolls rose by 1.763 million in July, against the estimated 1.6 million increase. The unemployment rate also fell to 10.2% in July, compared to June’s reading of 10.5%.
But continuing doubts over the U.S. economic recovery remain, with the U.S. surpassing the grim milestone of five million COVID-19 cases as of August 10, according to Johns Hopkins University. The dollar’s longest losing streak in a decade has also left a structural gap in much of the market for the currency, as well as leaving it vulnerable to a squeeze on any positive news.
“Our portfolio has been positioned for a number of weeks now for a narrowly weaker USD as a consequence of the independent surge in COVID-19 infections in the U.S. that has opened up a decent gap in near-term economic performance, especially against Europe,” analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in a note.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump kept his promise to take executive action if the U.S. Congress failed to reach a consensus over the country’s latest stimulus measures. Trump signed four executive orders on Saturday related to COVID-19 economic relief, unemployment benefits, a temporary payroll tax deferral, eviction protection and student-loan relief.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said on Sunday said they were open to continuing talks for further COVID-19 stimulus measures.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.11% to 93.308 by 10:16 PM ET (3:16 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair fell 0.12% to 105.78. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.21% to 0.7172 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.06% to 0.6606.
The USD/CNY pair rose 0.05% to 6.9697. China reported a better-than-expected consumer price index for July, with a 0.6% increase month-on-month and a 2.7% increase year-on-year. The producer price index also beat expectations, although it shrank 2.4% year-on-year in July.
Investors are also keeping an eye on simmering U.S.-China tensions after the U.S. imposed sanctions on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials, including Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on Friday. Officials from both sides are still scheduled to meet to discuss trade later in the week, on August 15.

465,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hopes for a speedy economic rebound in Germany are holding ground as manufacturing starts to catch up with consumer-oriented sectors.
Industrial output gained 8.9% in June, slightly more than forecast, following on from figures on Thursday that showed factory demand is rising. The most recent data suggest Europe’s largest economy may bounce back more quickly than its neighbors, after a record second-quarter slump because of pandemic-related restrictions on business and movement.
With trade indicators also signaling a revival, traditionally influential parts of the German economy are now seeing improvements that so far have been concentrated mainly in private consumption.
A full recovery will take time. Manufacturing and trade were under pressure well before the global Covid-19 outbreak. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China -- two of Germany’s major export markets -- could stretch past the pandemic, with squabbles increasing more recently over issues including human rights and technology companies.
“Having been led initially by domestic consumer spending on goods, the recovery is gradually broadening out to early stages of production and from domestic to foreign demand,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. “In the absence of a major accident, Germany can recoup at least half the second-quarter drop in GDP in the third quarter already.”
An industrial recovery is also underway in other euro-area countries. France reported a 12.7% increase in output in June, production in Spain was up 14.0% from the previous month.
German factory demand in June was at roughly 90% of the levels seen at the end of last year. Output was strongest for investment goods, with car and car-part makers seeing production up more than 50%.
The Bundesbank has said the German economy probably bottomed out in April, though it noted that the recovery in manufacturing and exports has been moderate and the business situation is still considered “very bad.”
Unemployment rose by more than 670,000 in the second quarter, and some 5.6 million people remained on state wage support last month.
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY), which set out to slash headcount by about 22,000 without forced redundancies, warned Thursday that compulsory dismissals are now likely. Europe’s biggest airline posted an adjusted operating loss of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in the second quarter, after the coronavirus grounded virtually all passenger flights.
The European Commission predicts the German economy will contract 6.3% this year and expand 5.3% in 2021. The euro area is set to see a deeper slump, though better-than-expected data recently have fueled hope for an upside surprise.
European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane has cautioned against any premature optimism, arguing that the region’s third-quarter performance will be key to determining the strength and sustainability of the recovery.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Friday, reprising its role as a safe haven amid renewed tensions between the U.S. and China, but gains are likely to be capped by the stalemate in the U.S. Congress over the latest stimulus package ahead of the release of the official monthly jobs report.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 92.995, not far removed from Thursday's two-year low of 92.483.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was flat at 105.54, GBP/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.3121,  EUR/USD was down 0.3% at 1.1842, despite German and French industrial production both handsomely beating expectations for June. Germany's exports also rose 12.7% on the month in June. The data all point to a considerable rebound in activity at the end of the second quarter. 
USD/CNY gained 0.2% to 6.9637.
U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up already-heightened tensions with Beijing, and fueled some demand for the dollar, by announcing late Thursday that his administration was banning U.S. transactions with two popular Chinese apps, Tencent's WeChat and ByteDance's Tiktok.
Tension has been simmering between the two powers for months, with the United States unhappy with China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and moves to curb freedoms in Hong Kong.
That said, these gains look temporary as sentiment has turned against the greenback due to a combination of rising U.S. coronavirus infections, a steady decline in Treasury yields, and more immediately a lack of consensus in Washington over additional fiscal stimulus.
“Dollar demand from both the investor and commercial community is in decline and the dollar is no longer the only game in town,” said ING analyst Chris Turner, in a research note.
U.S. Republicans and Democrats have so far failed to reach an agreement on the size and makeup of a new fiscal stimulus package that many think is needed to prevent the U.S. economy from losing more momentum.
Jobless claims data released Thursday still showed over 31 million Americans claiming benefits, and the non-farm payrolls release later on Friday is expected to show U.S. job creation slowed in July, with expectations for an increase of 1.6 million jobs in the month, a sharp slowdown from the record 4.8 million in June. 
An area the dollar has shown some strength of late is against the Turkish lira, with USD/TRY soaring 0.9% to a new record high of 7.3036. The lira is down nearly 20% versus the dollar so far this year, despite the greenback's own problems.
The Turkish central bank has delivered 1,575 basis points of interest-rate cuts in nine consecutive steps since July 2019, in attempting to boost growth while driving borrowing costs adjusted for inflation below zero.
With the currency being hit so hard, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now expects 175 points of hikes by year end, estimating that Turkey’s central bank has spent $65 billion in the first six months of the year managing its currency.

A revision to the asset-ratio rule by the regulator would be in line with requests from the banks, the people said, who asked to speak on condition of anonymity. The central bank was present at the meeting held on Thursday night.
The asset-ratio rule was introduced earlier this year to push financial institutions to step up lending, purchase government bonds and engage in swap transactions with the central bank. The regulation allowed the government to fine banks who can’t maintain an asset ratio of at least 100%.
The revision could mark an end to Turkish authorities’ push for loan growth, the people said. The regulator, known as BDDK, declined to comment.
The decision comes after the lira tumbled to a record low against the dollar on Thursday even though the central bank had spent billions over the past year propping it up. A series of jumbo-sized interest rate cuts and a campaign to get credit flowing to the economy to support growth has pushed the nation’s current account into a deficit, while risking a fresh bout of inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against major currencies on Friday ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which some investors fear could reinforce the view that momentum in the world's largest economy is slowing.
Sentiment has turned against the greenback due to a combination of rising U.S. coronavirus infections, a steady decline in Treasury yields, and a lack of consensus in Washington over additional fiscal stimulus.
Analysts say the dollar will continue to fall, particularly against the euro, the yen and Swiss franc, as expectations for a V-shaped recovery from the coronavirus epidemic fade and investors take a more sanguine view of markets.
""I see further dollar weakness,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""Optimism for an economic recovery is not backed up by the data. Safe-havens are very high, but stocks are also high, which doesn't make sense. The party has to end at some point.""
Against the euro (EUR=D3), the dollar stood at $1.1868 on Friday, close to its weakest in more than two years.
The British pound  bought $1.3134, close to its strongest level since March.
The dollar teetered near a five-year low against the safe-harbour Swiss franc  at 0.9109. 
Against the yen , which is also considered a safe currency, the dollar traded at 105.57, not far from a four-month low.
Non-farm payrolls due later on Friday are widely expected to show U.S. jobs creation slowed in July from the previous month, indicating a resurgence in coronavirus infections is undermining the economic recovery there.
Earlier this week, the five-year Treasury yield (US5YT=RR) hit an all-time low, and the benchmark 10-year yield (US10YT=RR) fell to its second-lowest ever, further reasons to shun the greenback.
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies  last stood at 92.864, close to a two-year low.
U.S. Republicans and Democrats have so far failed to reach an agreement on the cost of fiscal stimulus measures that many investors say is necessary to prevent the economy form losing more momentum.
Spot gold , another asset sought during times of heightened uncertainty, rose to a record high early in Asian trading, another sign of the dollar's woes.
Some investors are also worried about increasingly frayed Sino-U.S. relations. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order banning transactions with ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns the video-sharing app TikTok, saying the app is a threat to national security.
Trump also said he will ban transactions with Chinese firm Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), which owns the WeChat messaging app. 
The bans will start in 45 days and mark an escalation of a row over China's ambitions in the technology sector.
The yuan took the news in its stride, holding steady at 6.9568 per dollar , but speculation about retaliation from Beijing could hurt risk sentiment further.
The Antipodean currencies benefited from the broad-based weakness in the greenback.

The Australian dollar  traded at $0.72223, close to the highest in one-and-a-half years, while the New Zealand dollar  bought $0.6681, which is near its strongest since January.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.08% to 92.840 by 10:07 AM ET (3:07 AM GMT).
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that Republicans and Democrats are “still very far apart” on key issues” after concluding talks on Thursday. But he added that President Donald Trump is prepared to issue an executive order if the two sides fail to meet their end-of-the-week deadline.
But some investors are skeptical that the dollar will retain its gains, especially against the EUR and JPY, with hopes of a V-shaped U.S. recovery fading quickly.

Investing.com – The pound eased from fresh five-month highs on Thursday even as the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey backed the central bank's optimistic tone on the U.K. economic recovery.
GBP/USD rose 0.38% to $1.3149, though had hit fresh five-month highs of $1.3186 earlier in the session.
Bailey told CNBC in an interview that he would ""really lean back on people who think the Bank of England is optimistic.""
The remarks come as the central bank adopted a less dovish tone than many had expected in its monetary policy report after keeping interest rates unchanged at 0.10%.
In its outlook on the economy, the central bank estimated that the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic would be less than initially feared.
Inflation was expected to return to target in just two years and GDP to fall 9.5% for the year, well below the previous forecast for a 14% decline.
The BoE ""has become less dovish, and accordingly rewrote its guidance on the likely direction of future policy,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said a note.   
The central bank also tipped its hat to the prospects of cutting rates below zero, with Bailey suggesting negative interest rate policy (NIRP) was in the policy toolbox, though if and when such a tool could be used remains uncertain.
""So, while the MPC acknowledged that the risks to the growth outlook remain hugely skewed to the downside, for the time being it sees no need for additional stimulus,"" Daiwa Capital Markets added.

ISTANBUL/LONDON (Reuters) - Turkish central bank head Murat Uysal has stuck to the rate-cutting script since President Tayyip Erdogan hired him to lift Turkey out of a recession and currency crisis.
A year later with the COVID-19 pandemic now crushing the lira, some traders and analysts say they think Uysal will instead hike rates to head off a deeper crisis.
Erdogan, whose 17-years in power have been marked by cheap credit and booming growth, has repeated the unorthodox view that high rates cause inflation and sacked Uysal's predecessor for not following his instructions.
The central bank did not immediately comment on expectations of higher rates or on political pressure. Uysal said last week policy was in line with the central bank's inflation forecasts and he has said in the past it has policy independence. 
Investors, analysts and sources close to Turkey's central bank say the most direct solution to the lira's costly slide, in the form of a rate hike, would only happen as a last resort.
Erdogan's office was not available to comment, while a spokesman for the Treasury did not immediately respond. 
After the central bank slashed rates to 8.25% from 24% in less than a year, such a quick policy turn-around would likely need the government's tacit approval, analysts say.
Nevertheless, money market traders have been adding to bets in recent days that Uysal, who halted an aggressive year-long easing cycle in June, has little choice but to tighten policy soon to avoid a second currency crisis in as many years. 
The lira hit a historic low on Thursday and is down nearly 20% versus the dollar so far this year, despite the greenback's own weak performance.
While the central bank's policy rate  is 8.25%, the November money market pricing for three-month lending  is at 10.75%, implying 250 basis points of tightening by year-end. 
Graphic - Turkish markets signal rate hikes ahead: https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-CURRENCY/xklpydljgvg/chart.png
Some fear that in a worst-case scenario, interventions to stabilize the lira lose steam as the central bank's reserves run thin, prompting further depreciation, inflation and a ballooning current account deficit.
""We have a lot of ingredients here to have a full blown crisis,"" said Nikolay Markov, senior economist at Pictet Asset Management. ""The hope is to have a more proactive policy response from the central bank."" 
Turkish annual inflation is high at near 12%, leaving real rates deeply negative for depositors in lira, a factor which has hastened the currency's slide.
Economists polled by Reuters before the latest lira selloff expected more rate cuts once things cooled. 
But after two weeks of volatility, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now expects 175 points of hikes by year end. Pictet's Markov said Turkey boasts the biggest gap among major emerging markets between the current policy rate and where it should be based on inflation and other factors.

Ankara is running out of alternatives to monetary policy.
The central bank's gross FX reserves have dwindled to $51 billion from $81 billion this year, official figures show. 
Data and the calculations of traders show the drop is in part due to the central bank and state banks selling some $110 billion in dollars since last year, including an acceleration in recent weeks, to stabilize the lira.
Ankara's appeals for funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have only yielded a deal with Qatar.
Rate hikes are only an option if more foreign funding cannot be found, a senior Turkish banker said, adding: 
""We do not anticipate a rate rise unless there is no other option.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's real will likely extend its recent uptrend after a crash earlier this year, supported by higher U.S. dollar inflows but held back by a brutal recession that has curbed imports and bloated the budget deficit, a Reuters poll showed.
The real (BRBY) logged a 4.6% gain in July, its best month since December. This could anticipate a stronger performance in the near future despite several existing risks, particularly the continuing COVID-19 health crisis.
The real is seen appreciating to 5.20 per U.S. dollar in one month from 5.25 on Wednesday and then recovering further to 4.85 in one year, rising 8.2% over its value this week, according to the median estimate of 29 economists polled July 31-Aug. 5.
""Volatility has subsided but should pick up in Q4 ... because of underlying U.S.-China tensions, U.S. elections and a second COVID-19 wave,"" noted analysts at Rabobank, who have raised their forecasts for the real and expect it to trade near 5.25 per dollar by year-end from 5.45 previously. 
""Domestically, the drivers still are the uncertainty created by COVID-19, and the resulting fiscal costs."" 
Since the start of 2020, the real is down 23.4%. Ending December around 5.0 per dollar, as implied in the survey, would mean an annual loss of almost 20%, its weakest year since 2015, when the currency was hit by a local political crisis.
Brazil posted a record $8.1 billion trade surplus in July as the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus outbreak led to a steep decline in imports. The Economy Ministry has raised its 2020 surplus forecast by almost 20%.
On the negative side, the pandemic is set to keep weighing on the currency. President Jair Bolsonaro has minimized the gravity of an illness that could exceed the grim mark of 100,000 deaths.
Another threat comes from a bloated budget related to the ongoing fight against COVID-19. ""Fiscal risks are high and on the rise, local markets have been complacent but this can't last forever,"" analysts at ARX Investimentos in Rio de Janeiro wrote.

PESO TO CONSOLIDATE
Last month was good too for Mexico's peso  which, like the real and other emerging market currencies, has benefited from a drop across the board in the greenback.
The Mexican currency still has some room for improvement on the back of this. ""We expect the MXN to continue consolidating between 22.00 and 23.00 per dollar in coming weeks,"" said Santiago Leal, senior FX strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte. 
With almost 49,000 deaths from the pandemic, Mexico is the second most affected country in Latin America, which has surpassed Europe to become the region with the highest coronavirus death toll worldwide.
However, investors recognize Mexico's solid trade links with the United States and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's austerity efforts, which stand out even more when compared to staggering deficits in peers like Argentina.
""The risk of additional pressure on the peso has not completely vanished but is minor given the decent shape of external balances and a relatively conservative fiscal stance"", Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analysts wrote in a report last Friday.
The currency was forecast at 22.20 in 12 months, 1.5% stronger than its value this week, according to the poll. It has shed 16% since the start of 2020, hit also by increasing Sino-U.S. tensions.
Elsewhere, Argentina's peso staged an extremely unusual rally versus the dollar in the black market on Tuesday after the country reached an agreement with creditors to restructure around $65 billion in sovereign debt.
Some analysts hope the deal will bring more certainty and the parallel rate, used in many transactions, will start to converge with the heavily regulated official one, reducing a spread that is just one of several anomalies in the country.

WARSAW/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Most central European currencies will firm over the next 12 months, a Reuters poll showed, buoyed by improved risk sentiment as investors shrug off worries about a rise in coronavirus cases and focus on hopes of economic recovery.
The reopening of economies has helped central European currencies recover ground after they took a hammering in the early stages of the pandemic and a recent spike in infections has not significantly dampened investors' optimism.
""The baseline scenario for the global economy, which expects recovery of global economic activity ... will be positive to risk sentiment in financial markets, which should be supportive also for CEE currencies,"" said Radomir Jac, chief economist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments CEE in Prague. 
Expected to be the region's best performing currency, the Czech crown (EURCZK=) is seen firming 1.7% to 25.725 against the euro from Tuesday's European close.
""The Czech currency is supported by the relatively still very solid fundamentals of the Czech economy ... the interest rate differential also remains favourable and the Czech central bank does not seem to plan further easing of monetary conditions,"" Jac said.
Since March, the Czech central bank has slashed its main interest rate  three times, by a total of 200 basis points, to 0.25%, but governor Jiri Rusnok has said a further cut could threaten financial stability while other rate setters have also pointed to stable rates ahead.
The Polish zloty (EURPLN=) is seen strengthening 1.1% to 4.35 over the next 12 months, while the Hungarian forint (EURHUF=) is expected to firm 0.9% to 343. 
Marcin Sulewski, an economist at Santander (MC:SAN) Bank Polska, said he did not expect rising coronavirus cases to spook the market, despite daily infection rates in Poland hitting record highs over the past week.
""The key assumption here is that nobody, or very few people, expect that such strict laws like during the first wave could be reintroduced now,"" he said.
Some market participants had speculated the Polish central bank could intervene to weaken the zloty after it said in June the economic recovery could be ""mitigated by the lack of visible zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock"".
""The risk of FX intervention has declined in our view in recent weeks,"" said Sulewski, pointing to an interview with news agency PAP by rate-setter Jerzy Zyzynski, who said the comments were only informative and not intended as a form of intervention.
Romania's turbulent political scene and twin budget and current account deficits will weigh on the leu (EURRON=) over the coming year, the poll showed. It is expected to fall almost 1.0% against the euro to 4.88.

""A series of elections scheduled later this year and the subsequent fiscal outlook imply risks for the leu and for the sovereign rating,"" said Jakub Kratky a financial analyst at Generali Investments CEE.

Investing.com - The dollar sold off in early European trade Thursday, registering a new two-year low, weighed by concerns the U.S. economic recovery may be delayed as the coronavirus continues to cause damage and the latest U.S. relief plan is delayed due to political wrangling.
 At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 92.760, after earlier falling to 92.483, breaking through the two-year low of 92.523 seen late last week.
 Elsewhere, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.52, while EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1873, just below Friday's two-year high of $1.1908. 
 A decline in the U.S. currency has gathered pace since late July on rising perception that the U.S. economic recovery could be hobbled by the country's poor performance in containing the Covid-19 outbreak.
On Wednesday, the ADP report on private payrolls showed only 167,000 jobs were added last month, suggesting an abrupt slowdown in the jobs recovery, ahead of the weekly initial claims data later Thursday and Friday’s official employment report.
Meanwhile, the global death toll from Covid-19 is now over 707,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, while in the U.S., California reported its second-deadliest day from the virus on Wednesday and Florida’s case count topped 500,000.
A Reuters poll of more than 60 currency strategists, taken between July 31 and Aug. 5, showed the dollar was expected to continue to underperform against most major currencies over the coming 12 months, with a good chance of that weakness extending beyond a year.
Elsewhere, sterling advanced after the Bank of England suggested the economic downturn will not be as bad as it first feared. The Bank maintained its policy stimulus and signaled rates would stay low.
Sterling has made back a lot of the losses seen after the Covid-19 outbreak led to lockdowns in March, when the currency nosedived to its lowest level in 35 years. However, a lot of these gains have been down to a weak dollar, and it could well lose some of those gains this year amid Brexit uncertainty.
The Reuters poll saw the currency dipping to 1.29 in a month and to 1.28 in three months before returning to current levels in a year's time.
At 3:05 AM ET, GBP/USD traded at 1.3150, up 0.3%, and approaching a five-month high.
In emerging markets, USD/BRL was up 0.1% at 5.2915 after the country’s central bank cut its key interest on Wednesday to 2% from 2.25%, a more modest quarter point following back-to-back reductions of 75 basis points.
Policy makers are trying to stimulate an economy ravaged by the coronavirus without fueling financial risks associated with very low borrowing costs.
In India, USD/INR gained 0.1% to 74.860 after the country’s Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the benchmark repurchase rate at a record low of 4%, surprising some analysts which had expected a 25 basis-point reduction.
The six-member committee, which has already lowered rates by 115 basis points this year, retained its “accommodative” stance, implying there’s still room to cut rates again.

(Reuters) - Investors stacked up bullish bets on most Asian currencies, a fortnightly Reuters poll found on Thursday, as worries the coronavirus pandemic is hobbling a nascent recovery in the U.S. economy clouded the dollar's outlook.
Climbing infection rates, a stalled coronavirus relief bill, weak jobs data and escalating tensions with China have driven investors out of the traditional security of the dollar, with the greenback (DXY) posting its biggest monthly drop in a decade in July.
Markets should brace for further weakness in the dollar as liquidity is ample due to the Federal Reserve's measures, said Wei-Liang Chang, macro strategist at DBS Bank, adding that the currency would stay on the back foot until the Presidential elections in November.
Singapore's dollar  and the South Korean won  were the biggest beneficiaries of the U.S. dollar pullback, the poll of 17 respondents showed.
Bullish bets on the Singapore dollar touched an eight-month peak, while those on the won more than doubled to their highest since December 2018.
""The outlook for global trade seems to be improving from highly depressed levels, evident from the sharp rebound in purchasing managers index (PMI) figures in China and across the region,"" DBS analysts Wei-Liang Chang added.
Disruptions from the pandemic are slowly winding down and most economies have reopened to a significant degree, fuelling expectations that global trade will pick up on the back of strong fiscal and monetary stimulus, he added.
Earlier this month, data showed South Korea's exports fell at their slowest pace in four months in July and beat expectations. Singapore's retail sales climbed sequentially in July, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending after the easing of restrictions.
Meanwhile, investors firmly held onto their long positions on the Chinese yuan  since turning bullish in July, as largely positive factory data and an assurance from the central bank that economic recovery was underway kept spirits high.
Investors went long on Thailand's baht , reversing positions from two weeks ago as the central bank's policy easing cycle seemed to have come to a halt after three cuts this year.
Short bets on Indonesia's rupiah  were trimmed despite a spike in coronavirus cases and market expectations of another interest rate cut after a slew of disappointing economic data. 
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

The pound extended its advance after the Bank of England maintained its policy stimulus and signaled rates would stay low.
The central bank kept interest rates and bond purchases unchanged on Thursday as expected and said it won’t tighten policy until inflation moves sustainably to its target. The currency advanced as much as 0.5% to $1.3183 after the early morning announcement in London.
Sterling is coming off the back of its strongest July since 1990, thanks to a weakening dollar. That has made up for its losses since Covid-19 led to lockdowns in March, when the currency nosedived to its lowest level in 35 years.
Investors have also been piling into the U.K.’s bonds, leading benchmark 10-year yields to touch record lows this week. Markets have been given confidence by the BOE’s debt purchases soaking up some of the government’s extra borrowing to fund its crisis response. The pace of purchases will slow to 4.4 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) a week starting Aug. 11 from 6.9 billion pounds.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank’s asset-purchase target to be increased again by the end of this year, while money markets are betting on more interest-rate cuts in 2021.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts have again upgraded forecasts for the Australian and New Zealand dollars in the latest Reuters poll, but still lag the market as investors increasingly wager on a lasting downtrend for their U.S. counterpart.
Median forecasts put the Aussie  at $0.7000 on a one- and three-month horizon, compared with $0.6800 in the previous poll. The market, however, already has the Aussie at $0.7195, having just hit an 18-month top of $0.7241. 
Yet analysts doubt the rally can get much further, putting the currency at $0.7100 in six months and $0.7300 in one year.
The Aussie was supported by the relative outperformance of the Chinese economy which continues to suck up Australian resources and boost prices for key exports including iron ore. 
That has gifted Australia with its largest current account surplus in decades, providing a net trade inflow to the Aussie.
Perhaps more importantly the U.S. dollar was having troubles at home, with the rampaging coronavirus infections setting back recovery and stoking speculation the Federal Reserve will have to ease policy even further.
""The global economic revival underway is one where the U.S. lags not leads the rest of the world. It implies a weaker USD,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.
""Our forecasts have been revised to reflect our increased conviction that the recent weakening in the USD is 'for real' and has a fair way to play out over the coming couple of years at least.""
He now sees the Aussie reaching $0.7400 by the end of the year and $0.7800 at the end of 2021, up from $0.7200 and $0.7500 previously.
The New Zealand dollar has benefited from similar forces, though again analysts polled seem to think it has topped out for the moment, putting it at $0.6600  in one month and $0.6500 in three.
The kiwi was last trading at $0.6639, having climbed almost 3% in July to break major chart barriers and impress some analysts.
""NZD has sustained its break above a two-month old range at $0.6600, signalling a move to the $0.6750 area during the month
ahead,"" wrote Westpac's FX team in a note.
""Global risk sentiment, proxied by equities, remains elevated and the U.S. dollar continues to weaken.""

One near-term risk is a policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) next week which could see it protest against any further strength in the currency.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar struggled on Thursday under the weight of worries the U.S. economic recovery may lag other countries due to a high level of coronavirus infections, as investors looked to upcoming data on the U.S. labour market.
The dollar's index against a basket of currencies (=USD) stood almost flat at 92.814, having fallen more than 0.5% in the previous session to approach its two-year low of 92.539 marked last Friday.
""Dollar-selling seems to have resumed. We are having the same structure we saw in July,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
A decline in the U.S. currency has gathered pace since late July on rising perception that the U.S. economic recovery could be hobbled by the country's poor performance in containing the COVID-19 outbreak.
The euro changed hands at $1.1869 (EUR=), having gained 0.5% in the previous day's trade to stand just below Friday's two-year high of $1.1908, extending its bull run since European leaders agreed on a recovery fund on July 21.
The common currency held an upper hand against the yen, trading at 125.25 yen (EURJPY=R), having hit its highest since April last year in the previous session.
The U.S. currency slipped a tad to 105.52 yen .
The dollar extended losses in the previous session after data showed U.S. private payrolls growth slowed sharply in July, suggesting the labour market recovery was faltering.
A separate survey by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) also showed U.S. services industry activity gained momentum in July as new orders jumped to a record high but here too, hiring declined, stoking worries about upcoming job figures.
Weekly data due at 1230 GMT is expected to show a slight decline in initial claims to 1.415 million last week from 1.434 million in the preceding week. 
On Friday government data is expected to show payroll growth slowing to 1.6 million in July from 4.8 million in June. 
With more than 30 million people on jobless benefit, recovery in employment is seen as critical to the U.S. economy, with many investors counting on another fiscal stimulus to support the economy.
Top congressional Democrats and White House officials appeared to harden their stances on new coronavirus relief legislation, however, as negotiations headed toward an end-of-week deadline with no sign of an agreement.
""I expect a deal will be reached before the Congress will adjourn on Aug. 10. So far there are few signs of compromise, leaving markets unable to react,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
If the two sides reach a middle ground, the dollar could rebound, he added.
Sterling also edged near Friday's 4-1/2-month high of $1.3170, last quoted at $1.3129 .
The Bank of England looks set to hold off from taking further action at its policy review later in the day, by keeping its benchmark interest rate at an all-time low of 0.1% and its bond-buying stimulus programme unchanged at 745 billion pounds ($980 billion). 
The U.S. dollar sank to its lowest in almost half a year against the Canadian dollar at C$1.3273 . 
The offshore Chinese yuan traded at 6.9439 per dollar , near its five-month high of 6.9324 on Wednesday.
Hedging demand against a softening dollar kept gold elevated, with spot gold last trading at $2,041.5 per ounce , near Wednesday's record high of $2,055.3.
Plummeting U.S. bond yields, especially in inflation-adjusted terms, are undermining the attraction of the dollar, which had boasted highest yields among major currencies before the pandemic.

""It's difficult to buy the dollar with such a decline (in U.S. rates), and it's understandable how gold is being bought to substitute for the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling, which was approaching a five-month high on Wednesday, is expected to lose some of those gains this year amid Brexit and coronavirus fears before recovering in 2021, a Reuters poll found.
The pound  registered its biggest monthly rise in more than a decade in July, although its ascent was mainly due to a weaker dollar after a surge in U.S. coronavirus cases and unease about the upcoming presidential election.
But fears of a second wave of infections in Britain, already the hardest-hit European country, have capped the pound's advance and according to a new study published on Tuesday a resurgence of the pandemic could be twice as bad as the initial outbreak.
Also containing sterling strength is a weak economy and growing pressure to strike a Brexit trade deal before a transition period ends in December, prompting traders and investors to be wary of the pound's prospects.
The July 31-Aug. 5 poll of around 60 foreign exchange strategists said the pound would dip to $1.29 in a month and to $1.28 in three months before returning to current levels in a year's time. It was trading around $1.31 on Wednesday. 
""The dip is because it seems like the uncertainty over Brexit will continue until we get to around September or October, so until we know what is going on it can't trade as well,"" said Jordan Rochester at Nomura.
""I lean towards a deal, but it doesn't mean the same euphoria for sterling as it used to. The deal will be bare bones - it might be that in Q1 we are still adjusting to a new trading agreement and you do see all of the foretold Brexit border chaos.""
Illustrating the murky outlook, the 12-month forecast horizon was wide - from $1.18 to $1.44.
Reuters polls since the June 2016 referendum to quit the EU have consistently said the two sides would eventually agree a free-trade deal, but talks have been troubled.
Without an agreement, trade and financial ties between the world's fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading partner would collapse overnight, spreading havoc among markets and businesses.

Against the euro (EURGBP=), little movement was expected. One euro was worth around 90.3 pence On Wednesday, and the poll suggested it would be worth 90.0p in a month and 89.0p in a year.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Thursday morning in Asia, continuing its retreat over worries about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19.
The ADP Nonfarm Employment record released on Wednesday suggested increasing unemployment as it reported a sharp decrease in payrolls growth in July, with 167,000 jobs created during the month compared to the 4.314 million jobs created in June.
Meanwhile, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for July was 58.1, beating June’s 57.1 reading, but the same survey showed decreased levels of hiring.
“Dollar-selling seems to have resumed. We are having the same structure we saw in July... although the headline figure from the [ISM] survey was strong... while ADP data was weak. These point to downside risks to Friday’s payroll data,” Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), told Reuters.
With more than 30 million Americans already claiming unemployment benefits, the latest rise in unemployment indicates a slowdown in U.S. economic recovery.
Investors are now looking to the latest unemployment benefits figures, due to be released later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.05% to 92.778 by 10:01 AM ET (3:01 AM GMT).
Another cause for concern is the continuing deadlock in the U.S. Congress over the latest stimulus measures. With both Republicans and Democrats hardening their stances as the end-of-week deadline to reach an agreement nears, doubts remain as to whether the two sides will reach an agreement.
The USD/JPY pair inched down 0.03% to 105.53.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.06% to 0.7195, while the NZD/USD pair fell 0.09% to 0.6639.
The USD/CNY pair jumped 0.14% to 6.9450.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.14% to 1.3130. The Bank of England is widely expected to refrain from taking any further action as it convenes for its policy review later in the day. The benchmark interest rate is expected to remain at 0.1%, a record low, and the bank is also expected to make no changes to its bond-buying stimulus program."
482,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Investors should be “open-minded” about a possible shift in leadership across global markets in the months ahead, which could favor a cyclical rotation in stocks and a steeper yield curve, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The increased probability of an approved vaccine by the end of November is underpriced by equity markets and by that time the result of the U.S. election will be known, wrote strategists including Kamakshya Trivedi in a note Wednesday. Investors will also know how the start of the school year will have impacted the spread of the coronavirus, they said.
“A vaccine approval could also challenge market assumptions both about cyclicality and about eternally negative real rates, and prompt the kind of rotation that started and petered out in May and early June, supporting traditional cyclicals, steeper curves and banks, and challenging tech leadership,” the team wrote. If this happened with a change in the U.S. administration, it “may open up scope for rotation into EM equities if trade policy risks diminish while U.S. tax risks rise.”
While the strategists suggested it may be too early for investors to position themselves aggressively for such a shift, they recommended options trades as a way to play the theme. For example, some call options on the S&P 500 still look attractive, and Goldman sees upside to around the 3,700 level should there be an early vaccine. That compares with a potential downside target of 2,200 should there be a significant reversal of activity from a second wave of the virus, the strategists added.
The team was more forthright on keeping its bearish view on the dollar.
“The range of outcomes is wide and our highest confidence is still in ongoing U.S. dollar weakness,” they said.

BENGALURU/JOHANNESBURG/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies are expected to rise a bit further in coming months as a sliding U.S. dollar offsets domestic worries about large economic imbalances stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed.
From a peak reached early in the year, the emerging markets currency index (MIEM00000CUS), heavily weighted toward China given the size of its economy, weakened over 7% to hit a 2020 low in late March. 
It has since recovered 4% as confidence in the dollar wilted, worsened by strained U.S.-China relations, and as China's economy has recovered strongly, and much earlier than others that were and still are hard-hit by the coronavirus.
Most emerging market currencies polled for by Reuters July 31-Aug 5 were forecast to extend their recent gains, rising about 3% on average in 12 months. But most won't recoup even half their coronavirus-induced 2020 losses over the coming year.
""While valuations remain cheap and positioning is somewhat neutral, we think that the near-term balance of risks could be less supportive for a bullish stance,"" noted Ioana Zamfir, a strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), adding that most of what has been driving these currencies higher is ""already in the price."" 
""Some of these risks include a more neutral USD, a pick-up in U.S.-China tension ahead of the U.S. election, still rising COVID-19 cases across EM and the potential for new outbreaks as we approach autumn.""
The South African rand, Russian rouble, Chinese yuan, Brazilian real and the Indian rupee have recovered over 10%, 11%, 3%, 11% and 3%, respectively, against the dollar - the world's reserve currency - from this year's intraday lows.
Over 80% of FX strategists who answered an additional question, 31 of 38, said major emerging market currencies were either fairly valued or cheap versus the dollar. The remaining seven strategists said those were expensive.
The surge in coronavirus cases in several U.S. states and fears a push to re-open the economy was premature has weakened the greenback's traditional appeal. The dollar is forecast to extend its losing streak. [EUR/POLL]
However, nearly two-thirds of FX strategists who answered an additional question, 38 of 62, said the greenback's weakening trend would last less than a year. The remaining 24 said it would last for more than a year.
""While the dollar depreciated against all its G10 and the vast majority of EM currencies last month, we are of the view that the sell-off seems overdone,"" said Piotr Matys, senior EM FX strategist at Rabobank.
""Escalating geopolitical tensions between the US and China accompanied by rising risk of a second wave in Europe and Asia may provide the dollar with a much-needed support.""
The Chinese yuan , the most actively-traded emerging market currency but also tightly-managed by its local authorities, was predicted to gain about 1% to 6.93 per dollar in 12 months time.
China was the world's first major economy to declare a return to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year as lockdown restrictions were eased after the country reported fewer coronavirus cases.
""The CNY may gently perform strongly against the dollar in the near term on the stronger-than-expected China recovery,"" said MUFG's head of research Derek Halpenny.
""(But) the relationship between the two countries under Trump's administration continues to deteriorate. Depending on the political intensity, the market may seek refuge in the USD, which would weaken the CNY.""
Surging coronavirus infections in other developing economies have dispelled any notion the region may be over the worst.
The Indian rupee  is forecast to gain about 1% in the next 12 months. Latin American currencies face a similar outlook.
South Africa's rand  is expected to gain another 5% in 12 months despite new confirmed coronavirus cases rising to over half a million in the past weekend, accounting for more than half of the cases in Africa.

""The uneven nature of the (global economic) recovery will continue to trip up market sentiment, and so cause EM currency volatility, in particular reflected by the rand,"" wrote Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's supremacy of well over two years has turned sharply and the current downward trend will continue into next year on expectations the U.S. economic recovery is flagging, especially compared to Europe, buttressing the euro, a Reuters poll showed.
A surge in coronavirus cases across several U.S. states and some data pointing to an economic recovery losing steam pushed the dollar index (DXY) down 4.1% in July, its biggest monthly percentage fall in a decade.
That was reflected in the latest positioning data, which showed speculators increased their bets against the dollar to the highest in nine years and at the same time raised their bets in favor of the euro to the highest on record.
A deteriorating economic outlook has driven down U.S. Treasury yields across the curve to record or near-record lows, and gold jumped to a record high on Wednesday, pushing further past $2,000 in the face of a weak dollar, a common hedge during times of economic uncertainty.
""There is no doubt the dollar has made a cyclical turn now ... the dollar is extremely expensive and that's not sustainable given the current monetary policy stance, nor is it sustainable given the outlook for growth over the next few years,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""The dollar's weakness is reflected in a stronger euro, also driven by a large position shift that sees net longs as big as they were just before EUR/USD peaked in 2018 ... Seasonal patterns don't point to EUR/USD weakness in August, and the longer-term euro trend is upwards.""
The July 31-Aug. 5 poll of more than 60 currency strategists showed the dollar was expected to continue to underperform against most major currencies over the coming 12 months, with a good chance of that weakness extending beyond a year.
Indeed, more than half the strategists, or 33 of 62, in response to an additional question said the dollar's weakening trend would continue for at least another six months, including 24 respondents who expect it to run for more than a year.
About a quarter, or 15 analysts, said it would be less than six months. While 11 said it would be less than three months, just three respondents said it was already over.
""Following some hesitancy in June and the first half of July, the negative forces acting on the USD have returned to the fore. The in principle approval by European Union leaders to the proposed recovery fund and the associated EUR/USD response has been the catalyst for a generalised move lower in the USD,"" said Gavin Friend, senior FX strategist at NAB.
""This has some way to play out.""
The euro traded below $1.10 as recently as May. But the single currency soared around 5% in July, marking its best monthly performance in a decade, with much of those gains coming after EU leaders agreed a 750 billion euro economic recovery fund, where it will borrow jointly for the first time - a major boost to regional cooperation.
While the euro (EUR=) was not forecast to carry the same momentum, it was still expected to end the year on a high.
The single currency was expected to trade at about $1.18 in a year's time, around where it was last trading on Wednesday. That consensus view was the highest in a year and the range of forecasts pointed to higher highs and higher lows.
In the derivatives markets, the one-year euro forward  was last trading at $1.19, suggesting more upside to the currency's strength.
""The euro has been significantly weaker post-financial crisis because global investors are much less confident of the financial architecture - in particular the role of fiscal policy in the European economy. Though they're less pessimistic about that today than they were a month ago,"" added SG's Juckes.
Twenty-eight of 55 analysts who answered a separate question said major developed market currencies, most of which rose against the dollar in July, would perform better against the dollar over the next six months.

Twelve said emerging market currencies, six said commodity-linked currencies, while the remaining nine respondents said all of those currencies.

Investing.com – The pound rose on Wednesday to remain on course for a third-straight weekly win against the dollar, shrugging off weaker-than-expected economic data ahead of the Bank of England meeting on Thursday.
GBP/USD rose 0.44% to $1.3123.
Services, the backbone of the UK economy, improved to a reading of 56.5 last month from 47.1 in June, though just missed economists' forecasts of 56.6.  
The data suggest the U.K. recovery accelerated in July, but that was partly driven by pent-up demand, which will soon fade, Pantheon Macroeconomics said, flagging job cuts and higher savings as economic headwinds to come.
The pound's march higher comes just a day ahead of the Bank of England meeting.
The U.K. central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will roll out its forecasts on a range of economic measures including inflation, GDP and unemployment. In recent weeks, investors have been debating when the BoE will cut rates below zero, but Thursday's meeting is unlikely to offer detailed insight.  
""Forecasts will be updated and could showcase the MPC’s bias toward downside risks,"" Scotia Economics said. ""Expect further jawboning on the negative rate option, but it’s unlikely that the results of the BoE’s review of this option will be disclosed just yet. At present, markets are pricing a marginally negative policy rate commencing in early 2021.""
Dutch Bank ING agrees. 
""Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP) is under ‘active review’ at the BoE, but we think it a little too early for the BoE to make any decisive moves here,"" ING said.  ""We think the BoE will prefer to hold off on the use of NIRP until some clarity emerges on the UK-EU relationship from 2021. """

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are worried the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic is dealing a body blow to the dollar, potentially accelerating what has so far been a slow erosion in the greenback's status as the world's dominant reserve currency.
Investors and analysts, including billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) strategists, are among those who have warned that massive U.S. government spending in recent months could hurt the dollar.
At the same time, rock-bottom U.S. interest rates for the foreseeable future and concerns over a potential rise in inflation are denting the dollar’s appeal. 
These factors are already weighing on the dollar (=USD), which stands 9% below its high of the year and notched its worst monthly performance in a decade in July.
Changes that may affect the dollar's reserve currency status “have historically been glacial,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB). “Lately, they have been speeding up.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC last month that the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency is in the U.S. interest and the administration wants to maintain it.
The Treasury declined to comment further.
The dollar’s dominance endows the U.S. with many benefits, ranging from an outsized influence over the world’s financial system to giving it the power to flex its muscle abroad by punishing rivals and bringing errant foreign players to heel.
For the world’s central bankers, the dollar remains the reserve currency of choice by far. The dollar's share of global central bank reserves stood at around 62% in the first quarter, compared with about 20% for the euro and 1.9% for the yuan, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries, considered among the world’s safest investments, rose to $6.86 trillion in May.

Past concerns about the dollar’s top-dog status, including those that cropped up after Standard & Poor's in 2011 downgraded its credit rating of the United States, have proven short-lived, due in part to the lack of a credible replacement.
The main challenger, the euro, has struggled in the face of existential crises and years of subpar growth in the euro zone. Indeed, during the throes of the coronavirus panic in March, the dollar’s dominance was on full display, with investors and governments scrambling for the greenback as they looked for a haven against extreme volatility and uncertainty.
Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG), believes there is little imminent danger to the dollar’s reserve currency status. 
""It is hard to replace something with nothing,"" he told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.
Nevertheless, the dollar has seen its status slowly degrade over the past two decades, with its share of global central bank reserves falling by about 10 percentage points, IMF data shows.
Some market participants worry that recent U.S. actions may tarnish the currency's appeal.
One concern is the state of U.S. finances. U.S. debt is expected to exceed 130% of gross domestic product by 2021, according to Fitch, which revised the outlook on the United States' triple-A rating to negative from stable on Friday.
Although most countries are similarly ramping up spending, U.S. fiscal account deficits were already among the biggest in the developed world before the pandemic hit, Ruskin said.
The concern is shared by Dalio, founder of the $138 billion hedge fund Bridgewater LP. In a late July appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" Dalio said he worried about ""the soundness of our money.""
""You can't continue to run deficits, sell debt or print money rather than be productive and sustain that over a long period of time,"" Dalio said. 
In a recent blog post last month, he wrote that the dollar’s reserve currency status has lagged but may eventually catch up to declines in U.S. competitiveness, trade and production.
Dalio was unavailable for comment. 
A more immediate catalyst has been the decline in yields on U.S. government debt. For years, the U.S. enjoyed higher yields than any other developed country, boosting the dollar's allure.
That gap narrowed considerably after the Federal Reserve in March cut borrowing costs to historic lows in response to the pandemic. The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries and German bunds, for example, stands at its lowest level since 2014 - before the Fed embarked on a series of rate increases to raise borrowing costs from their post-recession lows.

Some analysts are also worried the surge in U.S. government spending will eventually spur inflation, hurting the U.S. currency’s buying power.
Goldman Sachs commodities research analysts recently wrote that the spending could lead to problems for the dollar, especially if policymakers decided to let inflation drift higher to pay down massive budget shortfalls even after economic growth steadies. 

As a result, ""real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency have started to emerge,"" they wrote.

Several international banks failed to close their lira positions with Turkish counterparts on Tuesday, an outcome of policies that are keeping a lid on local-currency liquidity offshore, according to people familiar with the matter.
Foreign lenders were unable to meet lira obligations as the cost of borrowing in the currency jumped as high as 1,050% for offshore investors, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive information.
The banks’ failure is reminiscent of previous dislocations in the offshore lira market, where regulators have engineered a lasting liquidity crunch since August 2018 to prevent a disorderly depreciation in the currency. That resulted in several settlement failures similar to Tuesday’s, and as a consequence Turkish regulators temporarily banned local lenders from trading with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
A person familiar with policy makers’ thinking said regulators were unlikely to impose fines over Tuesday’s settlement failures. Turkey’s banking regulator declined to comment.
The supply squeeze this time was a result of heavy interventions last week. Dollar sales executed by state banks to prop up the lira began to settle after a public holiday, draining the supply of local currency and pushing the overnight borrowing rate in the offshore market to its highest level in 17 months.
To deter short sellers, foreign investors have essentially been barred from borrowing from local banks and don’t have access to Turkish central bank funding. As a result, those without liras on hand have to borrow the currency in the offshore market -- where supply is limited -- driving up the rate.
The lira weakened more than 14% against the U.S. currency this year, defying efforts by state lenders and breaching the psychologically important level of 7 per dollar on Wednesday.

Investing.com - The dollar was lower in early European trade Wednesday, weighed by doubts about a prompt U.S. economic recovery amid continued political wrangling over the latest U.S. relief plan from the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:00 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.3% at 93.067, not far removed from  the two-year low of 92.523 seen late last week.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 105.64, GBP/USD was up 0.2% at 1.3094, while EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1823.
A hardening perception that the U.S. economic rebound is lagging Europe, particularly given how the two regions have responded to the Covid-19 outbreak, has weighed heavily on the dollar in favour of the buoyant single currency.
This perception has been given more weight of late by the stalemate in Congress over the proposed new stimulus to boost the hard-hit U.S. economy, while the European Union was recently able to pass a 750-billion-euro package, including the principle of collective debt. 
Although White House negotiators vowed on Tuesday to work “around the clock” to reach a consensus by the end of this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that “we’re not going anywhere close” to the $3.4 trillion price tag sought by Democrats.
The need for more aid is likely to be illustrated with private U.S. payrolls data, due at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), likely to show a slowdown in hiring as the second wave of the coronavirus resulted in various states rolling back their reopening plans. 
The weekly initial jobless claims data has shown a slight increase in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits over the last couple of weeks, and this could translate into a very disappointing official payrolls release on Friday.
ING looks for even more losses for the dollar against the euro in the weeks ahead.
“Of note now is the fact that the recent EUR/USD rally has not been backed by equity flows. Buy-side surveys suggest that: i) investors are still heavily overweight U.S. equities, especially tech stocks, and ii) are minded to rotate into eurozone and see the euro as cheap,” analysts at ING said, in a research note.
“If that rotation comes to pass …. then EUR/USD may be a 1.25 story after all,” ING added.

Investing.com – The dollar was down in Asia on Wednesday morning, with hopes of a U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 continuing to diminish. Investors retreated from the greenback as the U.S. Congress failed to reach a consensus over the country’s latest stimulus measures and U.S. yields continue to plummet.
Although White House negotiators vowed on Tuesday to work “around the clock” to reach a consensus by the end of this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that “we’re not going anywhere close” to the $3.4 trillion price tag sought by Democrats.
“Failure to agree on a fiscal package has pushed back the U.S. dollar,” Imre Speizer, FX analyst at Westpac, told Reuters.
“So if they agree something in the next few days, see the dollar bouncing back,” he said. “But even if we get another leg to it, I think it is still dollar weakness for the rest of the year,” he said.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.09% to 93.148 by 10 AM ET (3 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.14% to 105.56.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.23% to 0.7177. Across the Tasman sea, the NZD/USD pair gained 0.17% to 0.6633, with the NZD supported by a surprise fall in unemployment.
The USD/CNY pair fell 0.09% to 6.9656. U.S. and Chinese officials are reported to be meeting to review the implementation of the phase 1 trade deal between the two countries, as well as discussing mutual grievances during an August 15 videoconference.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.14% to 1.3079.
Meanwhile, the dollar’s losses have been the Euro’s gain after the European Union reached a consensus on a COVID-19 rescue package in July. The Euro posted its best month in almost a decade against the greenback in the same month.
But some investors suggested that a pile-in could provide more support to the greenback, with equity investors still skeptical over the EU package’s ability to kickstart the European economic recovery from COVID-19.
“Buy-side surveys suggest that investors are still heavily overweight U.S. equities, especially tech stocks, and are minded to rotate into the Eurozone and see the euro as cheap,” ING’s global head of markets Chris Turner told Reuters.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was under pressure on Wednesday from a towering euro and crumbling U.S. yields, as the latest coronavirus relief package got bogged down in Congress and investors braced for a bumpy ride to economic repair.
A hardening perception that the U.S. rebound is lagging Europe has buttressed the common currency just below a two-year high, helping it repel a bounce in the dollar this week.
The euro (EUR=EBS) last sat at $1.1808, after twice testing support around $1.17, as focus turns to U.S. private jobs data due later in the day and the Washington stalemate.
The Japanese yen  rose to 105.66 per dollar and gold soared above $2,000 an ounce as the bond market's dim view of the U.S. recovery sent real yields further into negative territory and nominal yields close to record lows. [US/]
""Failure to agree a fiscal package has pushed back the U.S. dollar,"" said Imre Speizer, FX analyst at Westpac in Auckland.
""So if they agree something in the next few days, see the dollar bouncing back,"" he said. ""But even if we get another leg to it, I think it is still dollar weakness for the rest of the year.""
White House negotiators on Tuesday vowed to work ""around the clock"" with congressional Democrats to try to reach a deal on coronavirus relief by the end of this week.
But lawmakers have allowed a $600-a-week unemployment benefit to lapse while they remain at loggerheads and the two sides still seem far apart. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that ""we're not going anywhere close"" to the $3.4 trillion that Democrats have been seeking.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars edged ahead, to climb back towards multi-month highs hit last week. The kiwi  also won support from an unexpected fall in unemployment and was last 0.3% stronger at $0.6639.
The Aussie  rose 0.2% to $0.7172 and the pound , which has shrugged off the dollar's bounce this week, was steady at $1.3080.
DIVERGENCE
The dollar has been sliding since March, as central bank liquidity measures and calmer markets have eased demand for the world's reserve currency.
But its prime antagonist in recent weeks has been the euro, which in July posted its best month in almost 10 years against the greenback, as a Europe-wide fiscal package convinced investors that the bloc can manage an economic rebound.
Net long bets on the euro hit a record high last week as low yields dulled the dollar's allure and many in the market are convinced the common currency has further to run.
The yield on inflation-protected 10-year U.S. debt  is at a record low of -1.05% and nominal 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) sit near their lowest since the height of the March panic, at 0.5118%.
Investors are already expecting a slowdown in U.S. hiring from private payrolls data due around 1215 GMT. But a disappointment would bode ill for broader payroll data due on Friday and underscore the apparent divergence between Europe and the United States.
Analysts at ING have also noted that equity investors have yet to really buy in to the European recovery story - and say a pile-in could provide even more support to the currency.
""Buy-side surveys suggest that investors are still heavily overweight U.S. equities, especially tech stocks, and are minded to rotate into the Eurozone and see the euro as cheap,"" said ING's global head of markets Chris Turner.

Investing.com –The U.S. dollar drifted lower on Tuesday, as the debate on the greenback's next move rages on, with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) claiming the dollar is more likely to settle into a trading range than mount a material move in either direction.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.24% to 93.28
With the dollar on a six-week losing streak, the bearish chorus on the greenback continues to gather steam, but Wells Fargo believes the greenback is more likely to find its footing as demand will continue.
""The dollar is likely to settle into a trading range closer to where it is today – without material appreciation or depreciation in the near term,"" Wells Fargo said, though did acknowledge medium-terms risk ahead.
The sizable U.S. government deficit, the possibility of higher corporate taxes, and elevated levels of national debt are negatively impacting the dollar, the bank said.
Others, however, have adopted a bearish outlook and warned of further doom and gloom ahead for the greenback.
""(T)he roots of the USD depreciation cycle now in train lie in the sharp compression in previously USD-favouring yield differentials …  On this basis alone, there should be much more to come by way of USD weakness,"" National Australia bank said.
The greenback's sluggish start to the week comes just days ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report that many expect will confirm the recent slowdown in the economic recovery.
""We expect a 550k increase nonfarm payrolls, as the labor market recovery slows, and a divergence between manufacturer and non-manufacturer momentum during July,"" Nomura said. ""We expect a slower recovery phase as new COVID-19 cases surge and states move to restrict activity."""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Typically a boon for emerging markets, this year's plunge in the U.S. dollar may fail to boost the developing world's prospects as the raging pandemic hits economic activity, increases poverty and exposes weak policymaking.
The greenback (=USD) plummeted by its most in a decade in July and U.S. Treasury yields fell to record or multi-year lows, pressured by a soaring COVID-19 caseload and Federal Reserve pledges to keep monetary policy loose.
Such a backdrop would normally help emerging markets suck in foreign investment with the lure of higher bond yields and faster economic growth, but this time looks different. 
Even leaving aside idiosyncratic stories such as Turkey, where a plunging lira is increasing the risk of a financial crisis, there are signs the developing world may not be able to capitalise on dollar weakness the way it has in the past.
MSCI's emerging equity index (MSCIEF) has bounced 40% from its March trough but it is heavily weighted towards China and East Asia, where the economic recovery appears strongest. Returns on emerging debt since end-March trail those on debt issued by Germany and the United States.
Graphic - Global market asset performance: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxnkkdpx/Capture.PNG
Luis Costa, emerging markets strategist at Citi, said that although the environment appeared positive for riskier assets, investors should not be complacent. 
""There will be bumps in the road because we know there are so many other underlying stories, especially when it comes to emerging markets and these stories are actually negative.""
Those doubts show up in investment flows. Since April, emerging market hard-currency bond fund inflows have lagged those into 'junk-rated' U.S. and European company debt, which is benefiting from government bond-buying support.
Debt denominated in emerging market currencies has fared even worse.

Graphic - Portfolio flows into emerging markets: https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-MARKETS/xklpydbjrvg/chart.png
Contrast that with the first quarter of 2018 when the dollar slipped 2.5%, less than the around 3.0% decline so far this year, and emerging market funds absorbed $118 billion.
Investors no longer feel compensated for the risks. 
South Africa is the latest developing nation to lose its investment grade credit rating, while interest rates across emerging markets have fallen - by an average of 64 basis points this year.
U.S. high-yield corporate bonds (MERH0A0) offer investors a pick up of almost 100 bps over emerging sovereign dollar debt <.JPMEGDR>, while local currency emerging debt yields are around 4.4%, down from 6% in early-2018 <.JGEGDCM>.
Meanwhile, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Jason Daw has warned clients that August, when liquidity is typically thin, could be a ""dangerous"" time.
Turkey's 2018 lira meltdown, China's 2015 yuan devaluation and Russia's 1998 default were all August events.
CURRENCIES, CUTS, COVID
The dollar's decline boosted the euro (EUR=) 5% in July, the pound  6% and the Australian dollar  3.6%. Emerging currencies strengthened just 1.4% (MIEM00000CUS).
That weakness raises concerns about borrowers' ability to repay external debt, with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) reckoning 13.7% of junk-rated EM corporate bonds may default in the year to March 2021. In the sovereign space, Argentina, Lebanon and Ecuador have already defaulted.
As the coronavirus spreads rapidly across India, South Africa, and Latin America, Oxfam has warned that without room to cushion the economic blow with extra spending, as wealthier nations have done, some countries may see poverty rise to levels last seen three decades ago.
Rising debt and stagnating reform had already left emerging markets ill prepared for the pandemic with Manik Narain, head of EM strategy at UBS, noting their growth premium over the developed world, a key performance driver, went into reverse in the Jan-March quarter.
""If you leave China aside, you are left with an emerging market complex stuck with a much lower pace of fiscal stimulus than the developed world has seen this year,"" Narain added.

493,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- A bet on the U.S. dollar declining in the medium term makes the key assumption that a vaccine against the novel coronavirus will be available comparatively soon, according to Bank of America.
That’s because Europe and Asia have a higher chance of fresh waves of infections the longer it takes for a vaccine to be found, a scenario that’s bullish for the dollar, said David Woo, a strategist at the bank.
Woo in an Aug. 3 note backed short-term dollar bears, but said many investors don’t realize the biggest view underlying a medium-term dollar short is that a vaccine will “become available sooner rather than later.”
A prolonged path to an inoculation would boost the odds “that liquidity support from central banks will not be enough to shore up financial markets,” he said. That could spur risk aversion and benefit the dollar given its status as a safe haven.
The pathogen has in recent weeks flared up in some U.S. states, threatening to hamper the nation’s economic recovery and contributing to the greenback’s worst drop last month in about a decade. A number of other factors have been cited for dollar weakness, such as negative real yields on some U.S. bonds and the boost to the euro from a European Union joint economic-stimulus package.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Tuesday, as political wrangling over a U.S. relief plan and the gloomy economic outlook kept investors shy of the currency.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 93.442.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.05, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.3078, while EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1775.
After its worst month in a decade in July, the dollar posted gains Monday, helped by better-than-expected manufacturing data, but this positive tone has been short lived.
Weighing heavily is the inability of the U.S. lawmakers to agree on a new coronavirus relief bill, hitting optimism for a prolonged recovery. This contrasts with the recent agreement in Europe of a proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund.
Adding to the dollar woes is the narrowing of government bond yields between EU and U.S.
""(T)he roots of the USD depreciation cycle now in train lie in the sharp compression in previously USD-favoring yield differentials …  On this basis alone, there should be much more to come by way of USD weakness,"" analysts at National Australia Bank said, in a research note, Reuters reported.
That said, it’s not only the perceived risker currencies that the dollar is losing ground against.
The yen and the Swiss franc have also gained versus the greenback in positioning terms, analysts at ING said, in a research note. “This can be read as further evidence that investors are finding less and less interest in buying the dollar as a safe-haven asset compared to the alternative low-yielders.”
“This appears to be largely a function of the rising idiosyncratic risks facing the dollar on the domestic side, as a worsening Covid-19 contagion picture keeps postponing most US states’ re-opening plans; if anything, it suggests more restrictions are on the cards. It also casts further doubts about the prospect of a rapid economic rebound,” ING added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A rebound in the dollar faltered on Tuesday as political wrangling over a U.S. relief plan and the gloomy economic outlook kept investors shy of the currency.
After its worst month in a decade in July the greenback started August on a firm note as some investors trimmed their short positions, pushing the currency as high as $1.1695 per euro on Monday, 1.8% above last week's two-year low.
However, that only carried it so far, and it settled back to $1.1766 (EUR=EBS) in Asia on Tuesday, while the yen and other majors also lifted from troughs. The Aussie  edged ahead to $0.7134 after the central bank offered no surprises by holding policy steady.
Despite an encouraging slowdown in new virus cases and better-than-expected manufacturing data, investors are reserving judgment on whether a U.S. economy with 30 million people out of work can really lead the world's recovery.
""We're still in a situation where the market wants to believe the recovery is on track but is still worried about the COVID situation,"" said Bank of Singapore FX analyst Moh Siong Sim.
""The fiscal wrangling in the U.S. is the next key test for risk sentiment, and if they manage to get a deal - which seems likely - that could be supportive of risk sentiment.""
Top Democrats in Congress and White House negotiators on Monday said they had made headway in talks on the latest coronavirus relief bill, though an expired $600-per-week unemployment benefit remains a sticking point.
It is not clear whether an agreement would be enough to shift the market perception that the U.S. economic recovery lagged those of Europe and Asia.
""The historically extended long positions in the euro is dry tinder, but there is no spark to trigger a more significant reversal just yet,"" said OCBC Bank FX strategist Terence Wu in Singapore.
""We are still left with hazy signals about the potential turn in broad dollar prospects.""
MIXED BAG
A better-than-expected expansion in the Institute for Supply Management's U.S. manufacturing index was a bright spot for the dollar overnight.
But it came with a warning as output remains far below pre-virus levels and the employment index was below forecasts, at a still contractionary 44.3. 
""The recovery cannot accelerate with the virus still not under control in large segments of the global economy,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s chief international strategist Alan Ruskin.
""We expect much more sensitivity to the August data, now that 'the easy part' of the bounce back from lockdowns is done."" 
The United States had a second straight week of slowing infections last week, but a fourth week in a row of rising deaths, a Reuters analysis found, as new hotspots emerge there and around the globe.
Cases are on the march again in Europe while Australia's second-biggest city of Melbourne announced a curfew and fresh restrictions on movement to suppress an outbreak there.
""This recovery is ... likely to be both uneven and bumpy,"" the Reserve Bank of Australia said in its policy statement on Tuesday, forecasting Melbourne's lockdown to push unemployment to about 10% later in the year from 7.4% in June.
Elsewhere the yen  was stable at 106.04 per dollar while the pound  hung on to most of July's gains on the greenback at $1.3079. The New Zealand dollar  was flat at $0.6612.

Investing.com –The U.S. dollar rose on Monday, looking to get the new month off on a solid footing, but optimism on Wall Street for a prolonged recovery appears unlikely as analysts warn dark days will return.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.24% to 90.54. 
The dollar's positive start to the week was helped by better-than-expected manufacturing data.
After falling 5.5% in July, the dollar's path ahead is likely lower as the negative forces wreaking havoc on the world's reserve currency remain at large.  
""Following some hesitancy in June and the first half of July, the negative forces acting on the USD have returned to the fore,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) said.
The recent surge in the euro – on the back of the proposed €750 billion recovery fund – and the U.S.'s failure to contain the outbreak have been singled out as key headwinds for the greenback.
But the handsome run in the euro and the EU's handle on the virus outbreak are not the only factors that have kept the dollar in the doldrums.  
The narrowing of government bond yields between EU and U.S. rates has also reduced the dollar bias that was prevalent in prior months.
""(T)he roots of the USD depreciation cycle now in train lie in the sharp compression in previously USD-favoring yield differentials …  On this basis alone, there should be much more to come by way of USD weakness,"" National Australia Bank added.

Investing.com -- The dollar has posted small gains in early European trade Monday, but the general trend remains one of greenback weakness amid mounting concerns about a slowing U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 93.550, rebounding from the two-year low of 92.523 seen late last week.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 105.98, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.3070, while EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1755, more than a cent below Friday's two-year high of 1.1908.
While the dollar has moved higher Monday, this is widely being seen as a technical reaction to the sharp losses of late, mainly against the euro, and these gains could quickly be eroded.
“The dollar heads into August under pressure, having seen its largest monthly decline in three years,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
“The nature of the sell-off suggests a different dynamic is at play. This is not the benign dollar decline we had envisaged, but instead, one seemingly being driven on a new risk premium being inserted into U.S. asset markets on the back of a resurgence in U.S. Covid-19 cases and perhaps as well November's presidential elections starting to make their mark,” ING added.
The U.S. has reported over 4.6 million Covid-19 cases, and is now in a new phase of the novel coronavirus outbreak with infections ""extraordinarily widespread"" in rural areas as well as cities, White House coronavirus experts said on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Congress is still deadlocked over the next round of economic relief, meaning that tens of millions of Americans have now lost a $600 per week federal unemployment supplement.
Eyes will turn to the U.S. manufacturing PMI data for July, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), to see if there's an impact from the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak.
On Friday, Fitch placed U.S. government bonds on a negative outlook, citing concerns about the deterioration in the country’s public finances, but demand for Treasurys is still strong in these turbulent times. Bond yields have fallen to their lowest level since the pandemic-induced market turmoil in March.
“The dollar's decline is likely to continue. Real U.S. interest rates are declining even as the country is running a big current account deficit, a situation we hadn't had for a long time,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank, in a Reuters report.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gave up brief early gains on Monday as mounting concerns about a slowing U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic hobbled the currency after a brief rebound late last week. 
The euro traded almost unchanged at $1.1768 (EUR=), coming off a low of $1.1741 touched earlier in the session, though it is still more than a cent below Friday's two-year high of $1.1908.
The common currency hit a speed bump on some technical signs of being over-bought in the near-term, and with speculators' long positions hitting a record level, said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
""But the dollar's decline is likely to continue. Real U.S. interest rates are declining even as the country is running a big current account deficit, a situation we hadn't have for a long time,"" he said.
U.S. bond yields have fallen to their lowest level since the pandemic-induced market turmoil in March, with the 10-year rate (US10YT=RR) slipping to near 0.50%, undermining the yield attraction of the dollar.
U.S. bonds looked even less attractive when adjusted for inflation expectations, with the yield on inflation-protected U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YTIP=RR) falling to a record low below minus 1%.
The dollar changed hands at 105.90 yen , giving up early gains to 106.44, which traders saw as an extension of Friday's rebound from 4-1/2-month lows of 104.195 triggered in part by month-end buying. 
Investors have reasons to worry about the U.S. outlook as policymakers have so far struggled to clinch a deal to pump more money into the world's largest economy even as an expanded unemployment benefit, worth about $75 billion per month and accounting for nearly 5% of personal income, expired on Friday.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Sunday he was not optimistic on reaching agreement soon on a deal for the next round of legislation to provide relief to Americans hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak.
A growing U.S. fiscal deficit to finance the stimulus prompted Fitch Ratings to revise the outlook on the United States' triple-A rating to negative from stable.
While the market has not shown immediate reaction to the downgrade, it still marked a sharp contrast with the European Union, which got a lift from Standard and Poor's (NYSE:SPY) decision to upgrade its rating outlook to positive from stable. 
Sentiment on the euro has improved after European Union leaders agreed last month to a 750 billion euro economic recovery fund - while also taking on debt jointly in a major boost to regional cooperation.
The deal could be conducive to a shift to the euro, at the expense of the dollar, among managers of official currency reserve, said Zach Pandl, co-head of global foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in New York.
""Prospects for the euro in reserve portfolios are looking brighter. In particular, the EU's new Recovery Fund addresses two fundamental problems that have held back the internationalization of the single currency - macroeconomic instability due to limited fiscal transfers, and a shortage of highly-rated liquid bonds."" he said.
Some traders speculate the dollar's decline since late last month has been so big that it may have been driven in part by reallocation of official reserves.
Traders are also keeping an eye on intensifying tensions between Washington and Beijing on many fronts, including trade, technology and geopolitics. Over recent days, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to ban TikTok, a popular video app run by China's ByteDance.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday Trump will take action shortly on Chinese software companies that are feeding data directly to the Beijing government, posing a risk to U.S. national security.

499,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The dollar is flashing a warning sign to U.S. policy makers -- get a grip on the virus.
After hitting an all-time high in March, a gauge of the greenback has lost 10% of its value, with declines accelerating in recent weeks as infections spread seemingly unchecked across the nation. Much of the sell-off has come during New York trading hours, suggesting domestic investors are closing out bets on U.S. strength and spurring renewed questions about the supremacy of the dollar. Meanwhile, a popular model that’s guided dollar traders for the past two decades has warped.
It’s a rapid reversal in fortune. Early on in the pandemic, the dollar soared after investors sought safety in U.S. assets like Treasuries while the virus stormed through Europe. But with cases now exploding at home, the ineffectual American response to the disease has become a millstone for the currency, spurring concern about lasting damage to the U.S. economy that could keep interest rates and growth low for years.
“What people are most desperately waiting for is good news on virus control, that I think is number one,” said Stephen Jen, chief executive at Eurizon SLJ Capital Ltd. “The currency bet is mainly a bet on relative control of the virus, not reflecting the fundamental strength of the economies in question.”
The U.S. government’s handling of the pandemic -- which contrasts with the euro area’s progress in containing infections -- is now the key driver of the greenback, dictating more conventional spurs of the currency, such as relative growth or monetary policy.
The dollar’s losses have often deepened during the U.S. trading day, suggesting investors were selling after the latest virus figures were released. Speculators are now the most short since May 2018, after betting on strength for almost all of last year.
Still, prior to the dollar’s slump to a two-year low in July, Stephen Jen was bullish. A pioneer of the so-called dollar smile theory -- which posits that the dollar will gain as a result of either U.S. growth exceeding that of other nations or during risk aversion -- Jen predicted in June that the currency would bounce back as the U.S. economy rebounded.
Instead, the dollar has languished as rising infections simultaneously put the kibosh on a boost for growth and sapped appetite for the currency as a haven. California, Texas and Florida posted a record number of daily coronavirus deaths last week, while New Jersey slowed its reopening. “The key assumption I was making, which turned out not to be correct, was that the U.S. would sort itself out after a difficult period,” Jen said.
Policy Subsumed
The euro area has only outperformed the U.S. in eight years since 1992, according to IMF data, but 2020 is on that track.
American gross domestic product suffered its deepest quarterly contraction since at least the 1940s in the three months through June, a release showed Thursday. While Europe’s economy was also eviscerated, with output shrinking to levels not seen since 2005, recent data show signs of a rebound as lockdowns ease across the region, and governments -- so far -- keep a lid on new infections.
That hasn’t been lost on the Federal Reserve, with Chairman Jerome Powell saying after the central bank’s latest meeting that the path forward for the U.S. economy will largely depend on America’s success in “keeping the virus in check.” While policy makers have not explicitly linked rates to controlling Covid-19, the broader effort to curb the pandemic is influencing the outlook for both monetary policy and economic growth.
“I’m much more confident about the ‘left’ side of the smile: that is, the dollar performing in a risk-off environment, than I am on the other side, which is classically driven by a U.S. economic outperformance,” said Ross Hutchison, investment director for  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Investments.
But others aren’t convinced that even this side of the framework holds up. The dollar smile has flattened and turned into a painful “grin,” according to Calvin Tse, a foreign-exchange strategist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., with the flood of liquidity unleashed by the Fed diminishing the likelihood of a sudden rush to the dollar in a risk-off scenario.
While Tse doesn’t rule out gains for the dollar, any haven rally is likely to be shallower than in previous years thanks to these measures, while the possible extent of depreciation remains the same. Meanwhile, in the event that U.S. growth returns, aggressive rate cuts have enhanced foreign investors’ appetite for hedging dollar exposure when buying Treasuries, further hurting the case for the dollar to strengthen, he wrote in a report July 29.
For some, then, it’s time to better reflect the influence of the virus in their strategies. Paresh Upadhyaya, money manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, which has $78 billion under management, says accounting for the virus has taken on a bigger role in shaping his view of the dollar and the economy.
To keep tabs on the virus’s ongoing impact Upadhyaya has created a spreadsheet of data points, including activity at airport security checkpoints, restaurant reservations, small business openings, small business revenue and employment. He also tracks traditional data on manufacturing and services, and uses mobility data produced by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. to gauge state reopenings.
“As cases in the U.S. have picked up, that’s a flag for the dollar,” Upadhyaya said. “Because currency is the perfect reflection of relative value, we use that to gauge which region is having a better handle over the virus.”

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia but saw gains capped as the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19 slows down.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.11% to 93.535 by 9:47 AM ET (2:47 GMT).
Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank, told Reuters that the greenback hit a speed bump as there were some technical signs of being over-bought in the near-term and with speculators’ long position hitting a record level.
“But the dollar’s decline is likely to continue. Real U.S. interest rates are declining even as the country is running a big current account deficit, a situation we hadn’t have for a long time,” he warned.
Gains were also capped by Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. failing to reach a consensus over the latest stimulus measures, after some previous measures expired on Friday. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CBS on Sunday, “I’m not optimistic that there will be a solution in the very near term,” but both sides will continue negotiations for the bill this week.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.16% to 106.05.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.29% to 0.7122, with the Australian dollar feeling the impact as the state of Victoria declaring a state of disaster on Sunday and tightened existing lockdown measures after reporting 671 cases. Across the Tasman sea, the NZD/USD pair was down 0.14% to 0.6623.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.03% to 6.9767. China reported a better-than-expected Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of 52.8 earlier in the day, higher than the official manufacturing PMI of 51.1 released on Friday. Both PMI readings were above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
Meanwhile, U.S.-China tensions simmered over the weekend after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ban popular video app TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, on Friday. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo also said on Sunday that the U.S. will act shortly on Chinese software companies that are providing data directly to the Beijing government, thus posing a risk to U.S. national security.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.05% to 1.3082."

Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe will keep interest rates and the three-year yield target unchanged at 0.25%, surveys show, and reiterate a readiness to resume buying government bonds in the event conditions worsen. Yet, bank economists will be grappling with the fluid situation in Melbourne -- home to about 20% of Australians -- as they prepare the bank’s quarterly forecast update.
The Victorian state capital is amid a six-week lockdown that could be extended with daily new infections elevated. “This will have clear negative implications for the economy,” said Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s Gareth Aird. “We suspect the better news on the spread of Covid‑19 in Australia, excluding Victoria, will largely be offset by the situation in Metropolitan Melbourne.”
Australia suffered its worst day of infections Thursday with Victoria recording 723 new cases, dashing hopes the outbreak was coming under control and sapping the confidence that was gradually returning.
The RBA’s quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy is due Friday at 11:30 a.m., with Assistant Governor Luci Ellis, the bank’s chief economist, delivering a speech shortly after that’s likely to address the vagaries of forecasting in such an uncertain period.
Treasury, in a fiscal and economic update two weeks ago, estimated Victoria’s restrictions would cut economic growth by around 0.75 percentage point in the third quarter.
After an initial flurry of activity -- injecting liquidity, cutting rates, setting the yield target and buying bonds -- the RBA has sat tight for the past three months. In its July meeting, the board discussed alternative policies it could have pursued, including taking the cash rate and yield target to 0.10%. The bank concluded it had followed the right path and no further action were required in the current circumstances.
Still, with a deflationary pulse emerging, lifting real interest rates, and the currency on a tear, monetary conditions are tightening.
Friday’s release “will be one of the most eagerly anticipated RBA publications of this year,” said Josh Williamson, a senior economist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., who notes the early reopening of the economy, extension of the stimulus and large drawdowns from pension funds should see forecast upgrades.
“The risk is that the return to a hard lockdown in Greater Melbourne and decision by the Queensland premier to close the border to residents of Greater Sydney tips the RBA into not upgrading,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - After years of gloom, euro bulls will be celebrating the single currency's brisk rally to two-year highs against the dollar, yet the euphoria is now being tempered by caution over what side effects the rapid run-up might bring.
The euro (EUR=EBS) has enjoyed a 11% jump against the dollar since May, benefiting from the U.S. currency's weakness and Europe's decisive joint stimulus plan to combat the coronavirus. It will end July with its best monthly performance in a decade.
And its real exchange rate -- against a basket of trade partners' currencies, a gauge watched by policymakers -- has soared to six-year highs . 
Graphic: Trade weighted euro index vs dollar index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrkmyjpe/Trade%20weighted%20euro%20index%20vs%20dollar%20index.png
Now some say they may hold off adding to those positions for fear of jolting the European Central Bank into tamping down the euro, viewing it as rising too far, too quick. Aside from hurting exports, the ECB won't want to see a strong currency complicating its battle against deflation.
Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, is now avoiding long euro positions, seeing levels around $1.18 as possibly triggering ""more noise from the ECB to cut rates again. That's why it is just not our favoured cross.""
The euro hit $1.19 on Friday. On May 18, just before the game-changing EU stimulus plan was proposed, it traded at $1.08.
The gains are also partly down to a more successful pandemic response compared with the United States, which also faces presidential elections in November. 
UBS Global Wealth Management's economist, Dean Turner expects the euro to stay in the $1.15-$1.20 range for now, with a break above that bringing risks.
""The rule-of-thumb simple model would suggest a 10% rise in the euro would knock 40 basis points off annual GDP growth, so this can't go on indefinitely,"" Turner added.
The euro zone economy is expected to contract 8% this year. Annual inflation is running around 0.3%.
Equity investors have returned in force to European shares in recent months, but the euro's exchange rate can also affect company earnings, since more than half of euro zone companies generate revenues outside the bloc. 
A 10% euro appreciation shaves about 6% of earnings-per- share for regional companies, said Marco Mossetti, an equity portfolio manager at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Asset Management.
When the euro rallied 5% against the dollar in a few weeks towards the start of 2018, Mario Draghi, then president of the ECB, called the exchange rate a ""source of uncertainty"".
But, so far, the ECB has stayed silent on the euro this time around. It's also reluctant to cut its minus 0.5% interest rate further. Nor are money markets pricing cuts for now.
For many, the negative effects of euro strength may be limited by improved confidence in the bloc's prospects.
Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho, predicts the euro will attract ""significant"" safe-haven flows in coming months.
""The cause of the stronger currency is a fundamental improvement in the structure of Europe, politically and financially. So I think it would be dangerous to be pushing back against that now,"" Chatwell said.

Investing.com - The dollar slumped in early European trade Friday, heading for its weakest month in 10 years, as traders fretted about the U.S. economic recovery due to the continued spread of the Covid-19 virus across the Midwest and the failure of U.S. lawmakers to agree a new round of stimulus measures.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.4% at 92.648, having fallen as low as 92.523, a new two-year low.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was up 0.4% at 104.36, a 4-1/2-month low, GBP/USD was up 0.3% at 1.3135, a 4-1/2-month high. 
Leading the charge has been the euro, with EUR/USD up 0.4% at 1.1898, up 5.8% this month, and well on course to post its biggest monthly gain in 10 years.
""At the root of the dollar's weakness is the fact, which was highlighted by Fed Chairman (Jerome) Powell the other day, that U.S. coronavirus cases started to increase in mid-June, curbing consumption and sending the economy downhill,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank, Reuters reported.
Evidence of the economic weakness was delivered by the second quarter GDP data, which showed the U.S. economy contracted by a massive 32.9% annualised during that quarter.
That data may well be old news, but initial claims for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.434 million in the week ending July 25, a sign that recovery in the labor market is stalling.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has created even more uncertainty over the upcoming presidential election, while Republicans and Democrats appear to be no closer to reaching consensus on the latest stimulus measures, with some earlier measures set to expire later Friday.
At the same time, the U.S. has reported almost 4.5 million Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data, while states like Florida and Arizona reported a record increase in new deaths for a third day in a row on Thursday.
Turning to technical analysis, the dollar has room to drop a lot more versus the euro.
“EUR/USD is through tough resistance at 1.1815/33, this was a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, a 12-year resistance line and the September 2018 high. We are surprised that this has not held the initial test. The break above here targets 1.2635/66, the 200-month ma,” said Karen Jones, Team Head FICC Technical Analysis Research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)."
504,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- The dollar’s rise to become the dominant currency started after World War I, but it was only definitively confirmed by the Bretton Woods accord reached in 1944. President Trump has accelerated America’s turn away from some of the post-World War II global architecture that reinforced the U.S. currency’s place at the heart of international systems. His tendency to pursue a unilateral approach could reduce the dollar’s appeal. When previous leaders moved to weaken the dollar, they did so as part of a consensus shift aimed at redressing global imbalances—most notably with the 1985 Plaza Accord.
Last year, global reserve managers cut their U.S. currency holdings as a percentage of their total stockpiles close to the lowest level since the 1990s, International Monetary Fund data show. That may have helped fuel the rush into dollars that occurred as the coronavirus pandemic spread in March, so the next IMF release could reveal a rebound in dollar holdings. But the severity of that dash into the U.S. currency helped drive up volatility in currencies such as the Australian dollar, Korean won, and Mexican peso when the Federal Reserve waited four days after taking emergency liquidity actions on March 15 to extend swap lines to those nations.
The Fed has added almost $3 trillion to its balance sheet since February. Traders have bet Chair Jerome Powell would follow the central bank’s prolific quantitative easing program by cutting benchmark rates below zero. Though he has said that’s not appropriate for the U.S., he’s declined to specifically rule it out. Add a federal budget deficit that’s set to triple to $3.7 trillion, and you have reason to doubt the dollar as a long-term store of value—a crucial factor for any currency, let alone a global reserve currency.
“The fact that the global financial system runs on dollars and that the Fed is central to its operation—those things haven’t changed, and those facts have been underscored and reinforced in the early stages of the crisis,” says Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California at Berkeley. “At the same time, I think what the crisis and those dollar-related facts have raised are renewed concerns about the mismatch between the dollar-centric international financial system on the one hand and a multipolar world on the other. That’s an uncomfortable situation.”
While it seems hard to imagine the dollar losing its place as the world’s reserve currency, a glance at history tells us it’s far from impossible. The Dutch guilder filled the role in the 17th and 18th centuries, before the Spanish dollar took over, followed by the pound sterling from 1860 until at least 1914. In each case, the nation’s domination of global trade and finance was key to the currency’s status, though central banks and regulatory maneuvers played a role.
The dollar still dominates currency reserves and transactions, but its power is weakening. In global trade, the U.S. lags behind the euro zone and China in overall volume of exports and imports, IMF data show. So it seems like a good time to review the leading alternatives to the dollar, even if none appears ready to knock it off its perch just yet.
Gold
“Money is gold, and nothing else,” John Pierpont Morgan testified to the U.S. House of Representatives’ Bank and Currency Committee in 1912.
PROS: Gold’s allure as a global reserve currency is that it can’t be written into existence. That removes the risk that the government rolls its printing presses to fund spending, a practice that’s brought on hyperinflation and destroyed currencies throughout history.
The only way to increase the global supply of gold is to dig up more. That’s difficult and expensive, leading to remarkably stable long-term inflation rates. A favored anecdote is that an ounce of gold bought the same amount of bread (350 loaves) in the Babylon of 562 B.C. as it did in 1998, when economist Stephen Harmston took a look into the metal’s properties as an inflation hedge.
Gold is also free of counterparty risk. Fiat currencies derive their value from the creditworthiness of the issuer. That means their value can be eroded by economic or political policies pursued by the country or group of countries that backs the currency. Gold, by contrast, has an intrinsic value. Not only is it a sought-after ornament, but it’s also useful as an inert, pliable electric conductor. These attributes prevent its value from falling to zero.
CONS: Gold’s scarcity removes a key central bank policy tool. If central banks can’t control the money supply, they can’t respond to changes in aggregate demand. Adherence to the gold standard has been blamed for exacerbating deflation and causing the Great Depression. Most of the world’s governments abandoned gold-based money systems over the past century to gain flexibility in managing economic difficulties.
In the modern world, where money moves at the speed of light, sending shipments of gold to settle sovereign debt has become impractical. —Eddie van der Walt
The Japanese Yen
PROS: The yen has ranked among the world’s top reserve currencies for decades. It made up almost 6% of official foreign exchange reserves last year. Japan’s $9.5 trillion sovereign debt market trails only the U.S., data from the Bank for International Settlements show, providing investors with access to a deep liquidity pool.
Japan’s self-reliance is also a draw. The country has persistent current-account surpluses and the world’s largest savings pool. Japanese households held 1,903 trillion yen (more than $17.5 trillion) of assets at the end of 2019.
CONS: The Bank of Japan’s massive asset purchases—the central bank owns almost 44% of the nation’s debt, far outweighing the Fed’s or the European Central Bank’s bond buying—have distorted markets. Negative interest rates have failed to overcome persistent deflation, damping the appeal of Japanese assets. The yen slid as a proportion of global reserves after the BOJ introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing in 2013, though it has clawed back some market share.
Japanese policymakers may resist anything that causes strong currency appreciation, preferring to keep its exporters—the backbone of its economy—competitive in world markets.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: The nation’s economy has been eclipsed in the past decade by China. Japan’s rapidly aging and shrinking population has contributed to an economic slowdown, and even negative interest rates haven’t shaken its tendency toward high savings and low investment. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pursued reforms designed to restore growth, known as Abenomics. To make up for the labor shortage created by the shrinking workforce, the government has welcomed foreign workers. Still, cumbersome immigration policies have kept their numbers limited to 1.5 million in 2019.
Japan’s wariness about yen strength could be the biggest obstacle for the currency. In 2011 the country sold more than 14 trillion yen (worth about $185 billion at the end of that year) to halt a surge to a post-World War II record of 75 yen per dollar. —Ruth Carson and Chikako Mogi
Special Drawing Rights
PROS: The appeal of Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, lies in their international pedigree. They were created—and are backed—by the International Monetary Fund.
In that sense they match the multipolar nature of the world economy. They’re accessible to almost all nations and are based on an adjustable basket of key currencies. Wider use of SDRs as a reserve currency would reduce developing economies’ need for foreign exchange reserves as “self-insurance.”
SDRs became a go-to reserve asset when the dollar fell 34% vs. the yen and 23% against the deutsche mark in the two years ended Dec. 31, 1978. And from 2009 through 2011, the IMF boosted the SDRs available to member nations to ensure adequate global liquidity.
CONS: In their current form, Special Drawing Rights can’t be used as a direct medium of exchange. Countries receive allotments from the fund, but they need to sell the SDRs to another country, or the IMF, to obtain actual currency. Outstanding SDRs were worth only $281 billion as of March 2020, a fraction of the $11.8 trillion of total central bank reserves.
The IMF’s role gives the U.S. effective veto power over SDR allocations. And there’s no central bank to redress imbalances. Suspicion of the IMF has increased around the world amid a growing awareness of the downsides of globalism. So a currency explicitly backed by the institution could be a political nonstarter.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: SDRs were set up in 1969 as a reserve asset that could act as a substitute in case of a shortfall of dollars. Unlike most dollar rivals, the SDR was explicitly designed as an alternative to the U.S. currency.
“The SDR—created 50 years ago to supplement IMF member countries’ official reserves—is the only true global money, backed by all IMF members,” Jose Antonio Ocampo, a professor at Columbia University who previously served as finance minister and central bank board member in Colombia, wrote on the fund’s website last year. “A more active use of this tool would significantly strengthen the IMF’s role as the center of the global financial safety net.” —Garfield Reynolds
The Euro
PROS: From its birth at the dawn of the millennium, the euro inherited the deutsche mark’s position as a key rival of the dollar. Its standing has grown with the expansion of the euro zone to 19 countries.
Today the euro is used in a third of all foreign exchange transactions, behind only the dollar. The bloc accounts for almost half of global trade, and its economy is tied for second place with China at about $13 trillion. (The U.S.’s economy is worth $20 trillion.) The euro is the second-most-widely held currency in foreign exchange reserves, and the euro zone has the third-largest sovereign debt market, behind the U.S. and Japan.
The euro has its own central bank, and as a currency used by a diverse set of sovereign nations, it’s a more multilateral medium of exchange than the dollar.
CONS: The euro is still recovering from a near-death experience. In 2011 to 2013, policymakers in Greece and Italy came close to exiting the shared currency rather than accepting the austerity measures attached to bailout packages.
That highlighted a flaw in the euro: the lack of a shared fiscal policy to match the European Central Bank’s monetary powers. Richer countries in the north didn’t want to subsidize the poorer nations in the south. Until there’s a solution to that, the currency will struggle to challenge the dollar’s credibility among world markets.
The region’s relatively weak economic performance, often blamed on bureaucracy and a lack of innovation, also limits the currency’s appeal.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: Europe has a habit of taking key steps only when on the brink of collapse. The European Union in July agreed on a €750 billion ($857 billion) recovery fund, to be paid for by selling debt on behalf of the 27 member states. That debt could one day rival U.S. Treasuries, boosting demand for the euro and fulfilling the long-held dreams of policymakers who want a more integrated Europe. The U.S. bond market, which has long seemed impervious to growing government deficits, could be punished by investors known as bond vigilantes if they felt they had another option.
“The only thing that can make U.S. bond vigilantes return is a viable alternative to Treasuries or the dollar, and the EU just took a major first step toward producing one,” Tom Essaye, president of Kinsale Trading, wrote in a note to clients. It’s not a problem for now, he said, but “the euro could challenge the dollar.” —John Ainger
The Chinese Yuan
The yuan’s rise is all about the way China has transformed itself into an economic superpower to rival the U.S.
PROS: China has overtaken the U.S. to become the single largest trading nation, while the IMF estimates China’s gross domestic product overtook the U.S.’s weight in the world economy in 2014, based on purchasing power parity.
The nation’s policymakers are determined to raise the currency’s profile, promoting direct trade settlements with Russia and other nations and pushing to add yuan-denominated bonds to major debt benchmarks (including the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes). Stock market links with Hong Kong and the Bond Connect program make it possible for global investors to purchase yuan-denominated assets. In March foreign holdings of debt and equities denominated in yuan rose to a record 4.2 trillion yuan ($600 billion).
In 2016 the yuan was added to the basket that underlies the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights, an official recognition of its use as a reserve currency. Crude and iron ore futures also now trade in yuan, boosting its value on world markets.
CONS: China’s capital controls present a hurdle. Officials tightened their grip when a shock currency devaluation in 2015 led to an accelerating exodus of funds. The yuan’s value is still closely managed by Beijing, primarily through the central bank’s daily reference rate. The People’s Bank of China’s use of a wide range of monetary policy tools makes the money markets opaque and alienating to outsiders.
As a result, the yuan’s global footprint remains tiny relative to China’s economic power. The currency’s share of global payments has stagnated at about 1.8%, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift). The yuan makes up about 2% of global FX reserves and accounts for just 4% of foreign exchange transactions.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: The government is signaling change as it seeks to open China’s financial markets. The PBOC issues an annual report on the internationalization of the yuan, and the government is eager to showcase international cooperation, including its “Belt and Road” investment initiatives. While the yuan has a very long way to go to compete with the dollar, the way the nation surged in the 2000s to become the world’s largest consumer of raw materials shows its capacity for transformation. —Tian Chen
Cryptocurrencies
The newest dollar rivals are a bewildering array of decentralized digital tokens, which include Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, and others. Notoriously volatile and prone to manipulation, they have become infamous for their use in illicit transactions. But the technology behind them—and its potential ability to reorder global finance—has gained influential proponents, including former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Officer Abby Johnson, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
PROS: Like gold, cryptocurrencies aren’t fiat currencies, so there’s no government with the power to print them. Unlike gold, there’s no need for physical storage, electronic transfers are easy, and encryption offers relative anonymity.
CONS: Cryptocurrencies have proliferated into myriad coins and permutations of those coins created by splits and forks, meaning that relatively few are being widely adopted as a means of exchange.
The best known, Bitcoin, has been particularly volatile. It spiked to almost $20,000 in late 2017, only to plummet to just above $3,000 about a year later, undermining digital currencies’ claims to being a reliable store of value. Crypto’s role in criminal enterprise, where it’s prized for the anonymity it offers users, has hurt its reputation. So have hacking incidents that cost investors their digital fortunes.
THE BIGGER PICTURE: Digital assets have captured the attention of policymakers around the world because of the threat they pose to governments’ power over money. Regulators fret that tokens could move a large swath of economic activity out of their view. The Chinese government, which was early to ban cryptocurrencies, now has a pilot program for an official digital version of its own currency.
There are more than 5,000 tradable cryptocurrencies on Coinmarketcap.com. The largest and eldest, Bitcoin, was invented in 2008 and now has a market capitalization of more than $150 billion. Proponents say the technology has staying power, despite the volatility that plagues the currencies.
“At the end of the day, trust is really getting broken in the traditional financial system—that’s the theme. The less trust you have in the dollar, the more you want alternatives,” says Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “More and more people are saying, ‘You know what? It’s not such a bad idea to be decentralized.’ ” —Vildana Hajric

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning, touching two-year lows and on its way to posting its biggest monthly decline in a decade as fresh doubts over the U.S economy’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic creep in.
These doubts have led investors to question the dollar’s strength. Data released on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy contracted by 32.9% in the second quarter and that 1.434 million unemployment claims were submitted in the week ending July 25.
On the political front, Republicans and Democrats are also no closer to reaching consensus on the latest stimulus measures, with only one more day left before some earlier measures expire on Friday.
Ever-rising numbers of COVID-19 cases also continue to pose a challenge to the U.S.’ economic recovery. The country reported almost 4.5 million cases as of July 31, according to Johns Hopkins University data, and continues to hold the dubious honor of recording the highest number of COVID-19 cases globally.
“At the root of the dollar’s weakness is the fact, which was highlighted by Fed Chairman (Jerome) Powell the other day, that U.S. coronavirus cases started to increase in mid-June, curbing consumption and sending the economy downhill,” Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank, told Reuters.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump added to the dollar’s woes on Thursday after he floated the idea of delaying the U.S. presidential elections, currently scheduled for November 3. But the proposal was immediately rejected by Congress, the sole governmental authority that could make such a change.
“The mere suggestion by Trump of a delay does play to concerns that the election result will be challenged in November (should Trump lose), and that, because of the likely larger than usual share of votes via mail in ballots due to the pandemic, we might not now (get) the result on election night itself,” Ray Attrill, Head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.28% to 92.645 by 9:53 AM ET (2:53 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.45% to 104.25.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.34% to 0.7218 and the Dow Jones New Zealand (USD) pair was up 0.04% to 0.6701.
The USD/CNY pair slid 0.30% to 6.9870. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said that the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for July was 51.1, indicating expansion in factory output.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped to two-year lows on Friday and is on track to post its biggest monthly decline in 10 years, as investors worried that a recovery in the U.S. economy could be stymied by a second wave of coronavirus.
Confidence in the U.S. currency was undermined further after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the possibility of delaying the nation's November presidential election.
The dollar index fell to 92.777 (=USD), and is on course to post its biggest monthly fall in 10 years.
""At the root of the dollar's weakness is the fact, which was highlighted by Fed Chairman (Jerome) Powell the other day, that U.S. coronavirus cases started to increase in mid-June, curbing consumption and sending the economy downhill,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Bank.
The U.S. Labor Department data showed initial claims for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.434 million in the week ending July 25, a sign that recovery in the employment market is stalling.
That poured cold water on hopes of recovery after a devastating recession in the previous quarter. Data on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy contracted by 32.9% in the second quarter, the steepest pace since the Great Depression. 
The U.S. Congress was no closer to a deal extending or replacing the extra $600-per-week in payments to tens of millions thrown out of work by the coronavirus pandemic, just one day before a federal jobless benefit was set to expire. 
Adding salt to the dollar's injury, Trump raised the idea of delaying the Nov. 3 U.S. elections, although it was immediately rejected by both Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress - the sole branch of government with the authority to make such a change.
""The mere suggestion by Trump of a delay does play to concerns that the election result will be challenged in November (should Trump lose), and that, because of the likely larger than usual share of votes via mail in ballots due to the pandemic, we might not now (get) the result on election night itself,"" wrote Ray Attrill, Head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
Leading the charge against the dollar was the euro, which has gained traction after European Union leaders agreed this month to a 750 billion euro economic recovery fund, taking on debt jointly in a major boost to regional cooperation.
The euro hit a two-year high of $1.1889 and last traded at $1.1869 (EUR=), having gained 5.7% so far in July, also the biggest gain in a decade.
Against the yen, the dollar hit a 4 1/2-month low of 104.52 yen and last stood at 104.54 , having lost 3.1% this month.

Likewise the British pound stood at $1.3119  after hitting a 4 1/2-month high of $1.3136.

507,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- For the first time since Haruhiko Kuroda took the helm in 2013, the Bank of Japan isn’t projecting more optimism than private economists in a shift in its messaging facilitated by Covid-19.
While helping support companies, ease liquidity issues and stabilize markets since March, the BOJ has also de-emphasized the link between prices and its policy stance, and dialed back its forecasts to more realistic levels.
The change leaves the central bank more in line with economists’ projections and less likely to take additional action to pursue its inflation target once the impact of the pandemic subsides.
“The BOJ has finally come back to Earth,” said Kyohei Morita, chief Japan economist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) Securities Asia BV. “With these moves, it looks likely that the BOJ has positioned itself to stay in persistent easing mode once the pandemic is over and avoid a need to take more drastic action.”
The central bank now sees inflation this fiscal year averaging -0.5% compared with a 1% projection back in January, making it clearly more pessimistic than Bloomberg’s median forecast of economists for one of the first times in more than seven years.
In 30 quarterly projections under Kuroda’s watch, the July forecasts marked the first occasion that the BOJ didn’t even see inflation reaching the halfway point toward its 2% target within a three-year time frame.
The gloomier forecasts come after the central bank dropped a baffling guideline to increase its government bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen that was out of sync with net purchases last year of around 15.8 trillion yen. The BOJ also dropped the link between price momentum and additional easing in its policy guidance.
The shift suggests Covid-19 has put an end to the BOJ’s hope for achieving its price target in the foreseeable future and its intention of influencing expectations through aspirational projections. It also likely means the BOJ will stick with its current easing framework unless the economy buckles further or an overly strong yen emerges in the post-virus era.
BOJ officials saw the bond guidance as increasingly meaningless following the virus crisis, according to people familiar with the matter. They also wanted to remove any hint of a limitation on bond buying should the government’s fiscal response prove bigger than expected, according to the people.
By keeping interest rates low the bank is helping the government borrow at little cost, ensuring a policy mix without any additional moves.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“With the pandemic pushing inflation away from the 2% target, it is better for the Bank of Japan’s communication with the market to have a more realistic price outlook. While it’s a painful setback, the upheaval caused by the virus offers a chance to shift the price target to a medium or long-term goal.”

Invesitng.com – The dollar remained on track to post its sixth-straight weekly slump after falling on Thursday as economic data exacerbating worries about a slowdown in the economy led some experts to warn that good times for the greenback will be limited.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.42% to 93.04.
The U.S. economy suffered its biggest slump on record in the second quarter, and signs the labor market continues to stutter have diminished the prospect of a speedy recovery. This will likely keep a lid on the greenback's chances of mounting a comeback.
""(T)he greenback’s reputation has suffered to such an extent over the past weeks that its appreciation potential is limited,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
U.S. GDP declined at an annualized rate of 32.9% in the second quarter of 2020, less bad than the expected decline of 34.5%, but still the biggest decline on record.
At the same time, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans making initial claims for jobless benefits rose for the second straight week, albeit by only 12,000, to 1.434 million. Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, also rose.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that cracks were beginning to appear in the pace of the economic recovery during a press conference on Wednesday.
“It looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery,"" Powell said.
But the virus impact on the economy is not the only challenge keeping the dollar down. The ongoing deterioration in U.S.-China relations has also sparked concern.
""It is by no means our assumption that the US dollar will lose its status as the world's reserve currency any time soon; but the corona crisis and the US-Chinese conflict have sown sufficient doubt to justify an increased risk premium for the dollar,"" Commerzbank added."

LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey's lira is back in the spotlight. After two months of stability, the currency is testing the 7-per-dollar threshold and tumbling to record lows versus the euro, rekindling memories of the August 2018 lira meltdown.
Speaking on Wednesday, Central Bank Governor Murat Uysal downplayed concerns about the bank's depleted FX reserves, which he said would naturally fluctuate during a pandemic. He did not address a drop of as much as 1.8% in the currency this week that could put more pressure on that buffer.
Below are five charts showing the extent of the pressure on the lira.
1/ SHRINKING RESERVES
It takes firepower to support a currency. Just how much of that the central bank has left has come into focus. 
Official data puts official net international reserves at $31 billion. But minus swap lines, gold reserves and lines to domestic banks, the number is negative, analysts calculate.
""Given the pace of reserve burn this year, we extrapolate that the CBRT will have used all of its reported gross reserves (mostly borrowed) by late summer/early autumn,"" said Cristian Maggio at TD Securities. 
(GRAPHIC - Turkey's foreign reserves under pressure: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxnqyovx/ybX38-turkey-s-foreign-reserves-under-pressure%20(1).png)
2/WANING ATTRACTION
An aggressive year-long easing cycle has pushed real interest rates negative, raising questions for investors about being adequately compensated in times of heightened stress. 
After the central bank halted rate cuts in June and held policy steady this month, the question is whether it will pivot back to monetary tightening, as inflation forecasts are raised.
(GRAPHIC - Emerging market real yields: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpoknxnpd/Capture.PNG)
3/ECONOMIC WOES
Turkey's economy is expected to shrink for the first time in more than a decade in 2020. The coronavirus's effects are expected to induce a 5% contraction, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
The government will post a record budget deficit of 5% of gross domestic product, S&P Global predicts.
There is some hope, however. Industrial output, while still negative, shrunk less than expected in May, and low crude prices should help the oil-importing nation.

4/CREDIT CRUNCH
The plunging lira complicates the task for Turkey's government and companies of repaying hard-currency debt. 
FX loans account for about 37% of the total debt owed by Turkish borrowers as of April, S&P Global estimated, citing it as a key risk for the country's banks.

5/ POLITICS & POWER PLAYS
The lira has long been hostage to politics. 
Tensions with Moscow over Syria, testy relations with Washington over the purchase of Russian missile systems and strains with Europe over migration and oil and gas rights near Cyprus have taken their toll. 
There is now the risk of another standoff with Moscow over Libya.
Strains have been compounded by authorities exerting ever tighter control over the FX market and the government's push for lower interest rates.

510,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters said Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the greenback is “unassailable” at a time when the U.S. has threatened action against China for imposing a national security law on the former British colony.
“The Hong Kong peg is extremely well-supported with monetary reserves in Hong Kong,” Winters said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. “Attempts to undermine Hong Kong I’m afraid would have some pretty deleterious effects on the financial system more broadly and it’s hard to see any policy maker in the world thinking that’s a good thing to do anytime, but particularly now, during a pandemic.”
U.S. President Donald Trump decided against moving to undermine the Hong Kong dollar’s peg after aides in his administration weighed the possibility of limiting Hong Kong banks’ access to the greenback as a way of striking back at Beijing, Bloomberg News has reported. Those against the move were concerned that it would be difficult to implement and could end up hurting the U.S., people familiar with the matter had said.
The city’s linked exchange rate system is supported by foreign reserves of more than $440 billion, according to its de facto central bank. The currency is also trading near the strongest it can be and the city has sold billions of local dollars since April to stop it from strengthening further.
Still, executives at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) have begun wargaming potential disruptions to the Hong Kong dollar peg, as the worsening political situation endangers its appeal, people familiar with the matter have said. Kyle Bass, Dallas-based founder of Hayman Capital Management is starting a bearish fund that will make all-or-nothing wagers on a collapse in Hong Kong’s currency peg.
Standard Chartered and HSBC both count Hong Kong as their largest market and are two of the three note-issuing banks in the city.
“Relations between the U.S. and China remain highly charged, driven by both economic and political considerations,” Standard Chartered Chairman Jose Vinals said in its earnings statement on Thursday. “We do not expect an easy or quick resolution. We do believe, however, that Hong Kong will continue to play a key role as an international financial hub.“

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Thursday, but remained mired near two-year lows after the Federal Reserve stuck to its dovish stance in pledging to support the U.S. economy from the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 93.498, recovering a touch from the 93.273 level seen earlier, its lowest level in more than two years.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 105.18, GBP/USD was down 0.3% at 1.2958, just below Wednesday's 4-1/2-month high of $1.3006. 
EUR/USD was down 0.3% at 1.1753, having earlier climbed above 1.18 for the first time in two years. The single currency is on course to post its biggest monthly gain in 10 years, having risen just short of 5% so far this month.
The U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its latest two-day meeting late Wednesday, keeping interest rates near zero, pledging to keep an accommodative monetary policy for an extended period. 
The central bank’s policy statement also directly tied the economic recovery to an end of the coronavirus health crisis. This comes as the United States surpassed 150,000 recorded Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday, with several states seeing their highest death tolls. 
The U.S. epidemic has intensified since June, with an average of around 65,000 new cases detected each day, putting a brake on the rebound in economic activity. This has drained support from the greenback as investors started to doubt that U.S. economic growth would rebound more quickly and higher than most other countries.
Economic data due later Thursday is expected to show a record 34% drop in annualised gross domestic product last quarter, while the weekly jobless claims is likely to show more people claiming unemployment benefits than last week.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues on the FOMC ""are clearly more concerned about the economy than they were just a month ago,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The resurgence of COVID cases and the impact that has on the economy is spurring their anxiety. Powell is willing to do more but is limited and needs Congress to step up to the plate and provide more aid ASAP.”
Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats continue to negotiate over the country’s latest stimulus measures, with just one day left before some earlier stimulus measures expire.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was mired at a more than two-year low on Thursday as the Federal Reserve repeated a pledge to limit damage from the pandemic as surging new coronavirus cases hamper the economy.
The Fed's policy statement released at the close of its two-day meeting directly tied the economic recovery to an end the coronavirus health crisis.
""We think September and November meetings will be more eventful, with the (Federal Open Market Committee) expected to conclude its framework review in September and then amend its forward guidance and possibly adjust its inflation-targeting strategy,"" said Mike Swell, head of Global Fixed Income Portfolio Management, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management in New York.
The dollar has been tumbling on expectations that the Fed will continue its ultra loose monetary policy for years to come and on speculation that it will allow inflation to run higher than it has previously indicated before raising interest rates.
The dollar index (=USD) fell 0.52% on Wednesday and steadied at around 93.275, its lowest in more than two years. The dollar traded at 104.97 yen , having fallen to 4-1/2-month low of 104.77 hit in previous trade.
The greenback weakness supported the euro at $1.1792 (EUR=). The common currency had hit a two-year high of $1.1807 and is on course to post its biggest monthly gain in 10 years, having risen about 5% so far this month.
Sterling also held firm against the dollar at $1.2998 , just below Wednesday's 4-1/2-month high of $1.3013.
The dollar's decline came as investors started to doubt the conventional wisdom that U.S. economic growth and investment returns from the U.S. currency would be higher than many other countries.
The U.S. epidemic has intensified since June, with an average of around 65,000 new cases detected each day, putting a brake on the rebound in economic activity and dashing hopes of V-shaped recovery.
A government report due out later in the day is expected to show a record 34% drop in annualised economic output last quarter.
Adding to investor alarm, U.S. congressional Republicans and Democrats were struggling to reach a deal on stimulus and slid toward letting a $600-per-week unemployment benefit lapse when it expires this week.

Elsewhere, the Turkish lira dropped to a 2-1/2-month low against the dollar  and a record low versus the euro , on rising concerns over depleted reserves and local demand for dollars despite state efforts to stabilise trading.

The Fed also tied economic recovery to an end to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Powell warning that there are signs that increases in the number of COVID-19 cases are starting to weigh on economic activity.
But some investors were already looking ahead to Fed meetings scheduled for later in the year, when bigger changes to the Fed’s strategy could be unveiled.

Invesitng.com – The dollar cut its losses on Wednesday even as the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and extended its temporary dollar liquidity swap lines.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.23% to 93.47.
The Fed kept its benchmark rate within a 0%-to-0.25% range and pledged to keep rates near zero ""until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."" 
The central bank announced it would extend its U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines and temporary repo operations through March 31, 2021. After an initial move lower, the dollar cut some of its losses. 
The central bank first rolled out the currency stimulus measures when the Covid-19 pandemic struck in March, amid concerns about strains in global dollar funding markets.
The weakness in the dollar had been well documented heading into the Fed meeting, with many on Wall Street expecting the central bank to reiterate its commitment to keep rates lower for longer – a commitment that has seen the dollar plunge nearly 10% since hitting a peak in March.
The urgency to support the broader market was backed up by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who warned that the resurgence in coronavirus cases has hampered the economic outlook.
""We not even thinking about raising rates... the economy will need high levels of accommodative monetary policy for an ""extended period,"" Powell said in a press conference on Wednesday.   
In another sign that monetary policy will continue for a prolonged period, the Fed chief also flagged deflation as more of a risk than inflation over the near term.
The most recent reading of the core PCE price index – the Fed's preferred measure of inflation – stood at about 1%."

“I have not yet decided,” Murkowski told reporters Wednesday. “I’ve been in conversation with folks who are part of the banking community, just kind of tapping their brains on some of their impressions and talking to people.”
Murkowski has bucked party line in the past and has been undecided for months about how she will vote on Trump’s controversial central bank nominee.
Her decision could influence whether Shelton is approved. Republican Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine have already said they plan to vote against Shelton. The nomination would be blocked if four Senate Republicans join Democrats in opposing her.
The Senate Banking Committee advanced Shelton’s nomination on a party-line vote earlier this month, and she now is awaiting approval by the full Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday he is looking at her nomination but has not yet set a date for a vote.
Shelton, an informal adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign, is viewed suspiciously by many in central banking circles for policy views that are well outside the mainstream -- including a history of admiration for the gold standard -- and for being a political loyalist who might bend to Trump’s will. She appeared to abandon her advocacy for ultra-tight monetary policy when she emerged as a Fed candidate, publicly aligning herself with the president’s calls for lower interest rates.

Investing.com - The dollar traded lower in early European trade Wednesday, languishing near two-year lows, amid doubts about the U.S. economic recovery and the Federal Reserve concluding its latest meeting.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 93.507, not far removed from the 93.448 low last seen in May 2018. The dollar continued to lose ground both against haven and risk currencies: USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 104.97, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.2946 and EUR/USD gained 0.3% to 1.1753.
The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its latest two-day meeting Wednesday, and is likely to stick to a dovish stance at its policy review later in the day, many of its officials having given gloomy forecasts in their recent public appearances..
While there have been some signs that the coronavirus is waning in some of the previous hotspots, four U.S. states in the south and west reported one-day records for coronavirus deaths on Tuesday and nationwide cases stayed high.
Eroding confidence in the U.S. recovery is weighing on the dollar. This isn't being helped by the perception of a lack of unity among the U.S. lawmakers, creating doubts about the timing of the next relief package.
Some Republicans in the U.S. Senate have railed against their own party's $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, while Democrats have called for a much larger package.
“It remains unclear as to when and in what form the stimulus will be passed, with a possible delay underscoring the downside risks to the U.S. economic recovery (already hit by rising Covid-19 cases),” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “Consequently, the prospects for a more pronounced and longer lasting U.S. dollar rebound appear to be limited, with the dollar remaining in a structural bear trend, in our view.”
This all prompted Goldman Sachs to suggest that the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency is now coming under threat.
The greenback faces several risks, the investment bank said, including that the U.S. Federal Reserve may shift toward an “inflationary bias,” a rise in political uncertainty while the debt buildup as a result of the pandemic may lead to debasement fears.
“Real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency have started to emerge,” said Goldman strategists, in a research note published earlier this week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar languished near two-year lows on Wednesday as the United States struggled to contain a spike in coronavirus cases, dashing hopes for a quick economic recovery.
The dour outlook for the world's largest economy is expected to see the U.S. Federal Reserve sticking to a dovish stance at its policy review later in the day, with dollar bears betting it could hint of other ways to loosen policy further down the road.
The dollar index against six major currencies stood at 93.720 (DXY), near its lowest since June 2018 this week.
The euro traded at $1.1723 (EUR=), up slightly on the day though it has stepped back a tad from Monday's 22-month high of $1.17815.
The dollar changed hands at 105.05 yen , near a 4-1/2-month low of 104.955 hit the previous session.
Its weakness stemmed from an eroding perception that U.S. economic growth would be stronger than the rest of the developed world and that investors could count on higher returns in the dollar.
U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in July, losing steam following two months of recovery, in a fresh sign that rising COVID-19 infections are dampening consumption.
Four U.S. states in the south and west reported one-day records for coronavirus deaths on Tuesday and nationwide cases stayed high.
""Given the concerns about the second wave of infections, markets think the Federal Reserve is likely to take a dovish policy stance,"" said Yujiro Goto, chief FX strategist at Nomura Securities.
Investors will be watching for any indications that the U.S. central bank will increase its purchases of longer-dated debt, implement yield caps or target higher inflation than it has previously indicated when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday noted that a potential Fed shift ""towards an inflationary bias"" along with record high debt levels by the United States government are raising ""real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.""
Such worries are spurring a rush to gold, which last stood at $1,963.5 per ounce , near its record high of $1,980.5 per ounce on Tuesday.
In fact, some market players think the dollar is long overdue for a pullback after the Fed's unprecedented money-printing since March to cope with a pandemic-triggered recession. 
The Fed's balance sheet has swelled about $3 trillion to as high as $7.17 trillion, much faster than those of other central banks as banks and corporates around the world sought dollar liquidity to survive lockdowns, though the tally has shrank slightly in recent weeks.
Also weighing on the dollar were uncertainties over an additional fiscal package to support the economy.
Some Republicans in the U.S. Senate have pushed back against their own party's $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal while Democrats have called for much larger support, including a full extension of a $600-per-week enhanced coronavirus unemployment benefit.
The British pound fetched $1.2931, having hit a 4-1/2-month high of $1.2952  on Tuesday.

The Australian dollar traded at $0.7170 , near its 15-month peak of $0.7184 touched a week ago, stepping back slightly after data showed Australia's consumer prices fell by a record in the second quarter.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia over continuous investor worries over the U.S. economic recovery that capped the greenback’s gains. Investors are no longer able to count on higher returns from the dollar relative to other currencies, due to the question marks over U.S. economic growth.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday warned that a potential U.S. Federal Reserve shift “towards an inflationary bias” along with record high debt levels by the United States government are raising “real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.”
The Fed is scheduled to convene later in the day and is widely expected to retain its dovish stance as the economy continues to be impacted by COViD-19. Four states reported record numbers of COVID-19 cases over a 24-hour period on Tuesday, with over 4.3 million cases reported nationwide as of July 29, according to Johns Hopkins University.
“Given the concerns about the second wave of infections, markets think the Federal Reserve is likely to take a dovish policy stance,” Yujiro Goto, chief FX strategist at Nomura Securities, told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.01% to 93.703 by 9:53 AM ET (2:53 AM GMT).
The dollar’s loss was gold's gain, with investors flocking to the safe-haven yellow metal and keeping gold futures at record-high levels.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.04% to 105.12.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.11% to 0.7165 while the NZD/USD pair slid 0.04% to 0.6658.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.02% to 7.0011 and the GBP/USD pair gained 0.08% to 1.2920.
Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats continue to wrestle over the latest COVID-19 stimulus measures, with some Republicans opposed to even their own party’s proposed $1 trillion proposal. Investors will be watching to see whether a consensus can be reached before some measures expire on Friday."

Invesitng.com – The dollar held onto slender gains on Tuesday, as concerns about the economic recovery were laid bare following data casting doubt on the strength of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.06% to 93.67.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge fell to a reading of 92.6 in July from 98.3 in June, missing economists' forecast for a reading of 94.5.
The weakness in the U.S. consumer, the driving force behind the economy, comes as some U.S. states have been forced to pause, or even roll back reopening measures amid a surge in cases that if continue could see consumer confidence deteriorate further.
""Should we see the current set-back in the reopening process manifest itself in a back-up in unemployment, we will very likely see confidence fall further as a consequence,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
The latest sign of a wobble in the economy comes just as the Federal Reserve is slated to get its two-day meeting underway.
The meeting is expected to conclude with policymakers voting to keep rates unchanged.
Against the backdrop of rising coronavirus cases that threaten the economic outlook, however, the Fed could opt for a more dovish tone on monetary policy on Wednesday.
Much of the focus on Wednesday is expected to center around how the Fed plans to deliver forward guidance on future monetary policy action.
Some Fed members have recently expressed a desire to tie forward guidance to an economic metric such as inflation.
But Wall Street appeared divided on whether it is too early for the Fed to adopt this approach with some believing that the transition will come later in the fall.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said it was ""doubtful"" that the Fed will officially adopt this new approach at this week's meeting, but added that Fed chairman Jerome Powell ""could drop some hints"" in the post-meeting press conference.
Grant Thornton's chief economist Diane Swonk asserts that the time has come for the Fed to clarify its position on forward guidance as ""the resurgence in hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 is taking a toll on growth."""
520,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency is coming under threat, as evinced by the recent surge in gold prices, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The greenback faces several risks, including that the U.S. Federal Reserve may shift toward an “inflationary bias,” a rise in political uncertainty and growing concerns surrounding another spike in coronavirus infections in the country, according to Goldman strategists. They added that the debt buildup as a result of the pandemic may lead to debasement fears.
“Real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency have started to emerge,” wrote Goldman strategists including Daniel Sharp (OTC:SHCAY). “Gold is the currency of last resort, particularly in an environment like the current one where governments are debasing their fiat currencies and pushing real interest rates to all-time lows.”
Gold’s record-breaking rally highlights growing concern over the world economy. The bank raised its 12-month forecast for gold to $2300 an ounce from $2000 an ounce previously. That compares with a value of around $1930 currently.
Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is on course for its worst July in a decade. The drop comes amid renewed calls for the dollar’s demise following a game-changing rescue package from the European Union deal, which spurred the euro and will lead to jointly-issued debt.
Ballooning Debt Pile
For Goldman, the growing level of debt in the U.S. -- which now exceeds 80% of the nation’s gross domestic product -- and elsewhere, boosts the risk that central banks and governments may allow inflation to accelerate.
“The resulting expanded balance sheets and vast money creation spurs debasement fears,” Goldman strategists said. This creates “a greater likelihood that at some time in the future, after economic activity has normalized, there will be incentives for central banks and governments to allow inflation to drift higher to reduce the accumulated debt burden,” they said.
The Fed is set to deliver its latest decision Wednesday. The bank sees U.S. real interest rates continuing to drift lower, boosting gold further.

(Reuters) - An accelerating decline in the U.S. dollar is reverberating around the world, adding fuel to a global momentum rally that has boosted prices for everything from technology stocks to gold. 
The U.S. dollar index (=USD), which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, is down around 9% from its March highs and is on track for its worst month since 2011, pressured in part by expectations that the United States will take a bigger hit to growth than other economies from the coronavirus pandemic.
Because of the dollar's central role in the global economy, a sustained selloff in the greenback could buoy a broad market rally driven by expectations of continued economic stimulus from the world's central banks and governments. 
At the same time, further dollar weakness would likely be an unwelcome development for economies such as Europe and Japan, as their own rising currencies threaten to weigh on growth and efforts to spark inflation.
""The weaker dollar is almost becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, with gains for risk assets seeing the dollar weaken further, fueling additional gains,"" said Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton.
The dollar is down around 3% year-to-date, after rising for each of the last two years. The greenback slid nearly 10% in 2017.

A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports more competitive abroad and helps U.S. multinational companies by making it cheaper for them to convert profits back into their home currency. That's potentially good news for a rally in U.S. stocks that has slowed in recent weeks after coming within distance of all-time highs.
Historically, the benchmark S&P 500 index has returned a median 2.6% in months when the dollar moves sharply lower, with technology and energy stocks faring best, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent report. 
A 10% fall in the value of the dollar against a basket of trade-weighted currencies would increase 2020 earnings per share by about 3%, Goldman said. Goldman analysts expect the dollar to fall another 5% over the next 12 months.
But a weaker dollar may be of little near-term political benefit to President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in the November elections and has complained that the currency's multi-year rally hurts U.S. manufacturers. 
The dollar's weakness would take at least a year to feed through to the manufacturing sector, ""too long to have a favorable impact for the president in the November election,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Graphic: Trump and the U.S. dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzddkevw/Pasted%20image%201595875302244.png
Other assets are already benefiting from the dollar’s drop. Gold, which like many commodities is priced in the U.S. currency and becomes more affordable to foreign buyers when the dollar falls, stands near its historic high, part of a rally that has driven the S&P/Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (SPGSCI) 34% higher since late March, as of Monday.
Developing countries are also likely to cheer a weaker dollar as it makes it cheaper for them to service debt denominated in the U.S. currency.
Emerging market currencies such as the Brazilian real  and South African rand  have come screaming back in recent weeks, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index <.dMIEF00000PUS>, which measures stock performance, is up some 40% from its March lows. 
""It has been hard to make an argument for the dollar, short term or long term,"" said Juan Perez, currency trader at Tempus Inc. The weaker dollar will likely benefit ""emerging market players and holders of real physical material,"" he said.
A reversal in risk appetite could push investors to return to the dollar, viewed by many as the ultimate haven. 
Evidence of stronger-than-expected U.S. growth could also be a boost for the currency. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's policy statement at the close of its two-day meeting on Wednesday and next week's U.S. monthly jobs numbers to see whether a resurgent coronavirus pandemic has slowed a nascent economic recovery.
Still, many believe the scales have tilted for the U.S. dollar. 

""We are comfortable with the idea that the dollar may spike in the near term if risk-asset volatility rises,"" analysts at Oxford Economics wrote. ""However, we see little basis for a rise to the March highs.""

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, bouncing off a two-year low, ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting and amid hopes for prompt delivery of the next U.S. fiscal rescue package.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 93.810, recovering from the 93.448 low last seen in May 2018. USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 105.58, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.2868.
These small gains come ahead of the Fed meeting, that starts later on Tuesday, and Friday's deadline for U.S. Congress to extend unemployment benefits. Both of these events are unpredictable enough for traders to seek temporary refuge in this safe haven.
Republicans unveiled their latest $1 trillion stimulus package on Monday, which doesn't leave much negotiating time to see whether a compromise between this plan and the Democrats $3.5 trillion proposal can be reached before some of the earlier measures expire at the end of the week.
That said, the “the bar for any reversal in the dollar decline seems to be set rather high,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “After the EU summit led to rises in the euro and cyclical currencies vs the U.S. dollar last week, the dollar now faces a mix of geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about the U.S. economic recovery. “
The durable goods release came in better than expected Monday, but the increase in Covid-19 cases throughout many of the more populous states in the U.S. has resulted in a pause in the U.S. jobs recovery. This is something the Federal Reserve will consider in its two-day meeting.
“We expect the Fed to keep an accommodative stance in place, particularly given the recent rise in the US Covid-19 cases and the accompanying downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook,” ING added.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1733.
“We continue to see upside in the cross although our 1M forecast has already been reached; look for 1.1815 (Sep-18 high),” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
“On top of concerns about U.S. growth, virus development and tensions with China, the tailwind for EUR/USD is the result of better news out of the euro area. Yesterday, a decent German IFO business confidence number added to the positive euro area picture as the forward-looking expectations index beat consensus by a wide margin,” Danske Bank added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar bounced off a two-year low on Tuesday as selling pressure faded ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting and as political wrangling over the next U.S. fiscal rescue package moved closer to a conclusion.
The world's reserve currency has been tumbling since May and was dumped in recent days as cracks in the U.S. coronavirus recovery and crumbling yields sent investors elsewhere.
Buyers crept out of the woodwork following a pullback in the gold price halfway through the Asian session, lending the greenback support and pushing other majors off milestone peaks.
The New Zealand dollar  touched an eight-month top of $0.6702 and then dipped back to $0.6656, while sterling  retreated from a four-month high to sit at $1.2850.
The Japanese yen  weakened 0.3% to sit just below its strongest since mid March at 105.65, and the euro (EUR=EBS) was last 0.2% softer at $1.1725. The Aussie dollar  gave up early gains dip 0.2 to $0.7133. [AUD/]
Most analysts say the reasons for the dollar's broad decline, especially falling real yields, remain intact but that the pace of the drop probably warranted a pause - particularly with a Fed meeting and a U.S. spending package in the offing.
""Perhaps it is a case of the market running ahead of itself,"" said Moh Siong Sim, currency analyst at the Bank of Singapore.
On the horizon is a Fed meeting that begins later on Tuesday and Friday's deadline for U.S. Congress to extend unemployment benefits - both unpredictable enough to inject some nerves into bets against the dollar.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) (DXY) the dollar lifted from a two-year low of 93.492 to hit 93.918. Still, it is down 3.6% in July and will need a stronger bounce to avoid posting its worst month in almost a decade.
NEW TOOLS
No policy change is anticipated at the Fed meeting on Wednesday, but investors expect to hear its super-easy outlook reaffirmed and are speculating about a change in emphasis in the forward guidance.
One shift could be to average inflation targeting, which would see the Fed aim to push inflation above its 2% target to make up for years of under-shooting.
That prospect has pressed on U.S. real yields, sending the yield on inflation-protected 10-year paper  to a record-low -0.92% last week, where it has held.
But a lift in nominal yields, pushing the 10-year (US10YT=RR) to a week-high 0.63% on Monday, suggests investors could ""sell the fact,"" even if the Fed sounds dovish.
""The (Fed) announcement may be a damp squib, or even lead to some modest fixed income selling to take profit,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) in New York.
A big U.S. fiscal package - currently deadlocked in negotiations between Democrats, who have made a $3 trillion proposal, and Republicans who have tabled a more modest $1 trillion plan - could also boost the dollar if it passes.
The current Republican plan would reduce an expanded unemployment benefit from $600 per week to $200 at a time when some 30 million Americans are out of work.
U.S consumer confidence and manufacturing data due at 1400 GMT will also give markets the latest read on progress in the U.S. economic recovery.

On the virus front, U.S. infection rates may be stabilising, with a 2% drop in the number of new cases last week - but the economic impact of curbs to restrict its spread and of job losses are only beginning to be felt.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was down in Asia on Tuesday morning, falling to a two-year low over fresh investor concerns about the U.S. economy’s ability to recover from the impact of COVID-19.
The number of global COVID-19 deaths shot past the 650,000 mark, while the number of cases is almost at the 16.4 million mark, as of July 28, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.04% to 93.573 by 10:09 AM ET (3:09 AM GMT), continuing its slump from the previous sessions.
But after Republicans unveiled details of the latest $1 trillion stimulus package on Monday, investors will see whether Republicans and Democrats can reach a consensus to pass the package before some earlier measures due to expire at the end of the week.
The euro, which has been on a meteoric rise ever since the EU reached a deal for a EUR750 billion ($879.549 billion) recovery package the week before, also continues to hit the dollar hard.
“With all of this in mind, we would not be surprised to see the dollar fall further,” Capital Economics market economist Oliver Jones told Reuters, with greater tolerance for inflation leaving room for more pressure on U.S. real yields and thereby diminishing a key attraction of holding greenbacks.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.01% to 105.36.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.20% to 0.7164 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.10% to 0.6688. The two Antipodean risk currencies continued their gains against the safe-haven dollar.
The USD/CNY pair fell 0.03% to 6.9931 and the GBP/USD pair gained 0.03% to 1.2885.
Investors will also be looking to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where it is widely expected to take a continuous dovish stance.
But some investors were skeptical of the impact any measures announced at the Fed’s meeting would have for the dollar.
“Investors have already priced in significant Fed easing for a long time, so we are not sure where the dovish surprise will come from,” Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), told Reuters.
“Over the last eight years, core inflation has hit 2% only six out of 96 months and has been above 2.1% only once. What makes any new tools or new framework so much more powerful?”"

Investing.com – The pound surged to a nearly five-month high against the dollar on Monday, but signs that Brexit negotiations have stalled could prompt bearish bets to rise further against sterling, ING said.
GBP/USD rose 0.66% to $1.2873.
Speculative investors continue to shrug off positive U.K economic surprises, according to ING FX strategist Francesco Pesole. As a result, bearish bets on sterling will remain ""relatively high, if not increase"" in the next CFTC report after the latest round of Brexit negotiations failed to end the deadlock, Pesole added.
Net short sterling positions, bets on the currency to weaken, climbed in the week to last Tuesday, the latest CFTC data showed. 
The U.K and EU wrapped up their latest round of negotiations in London last Thursday but failed to find a solution on key sticking points including access of EU vessels to fish in British waters that have so far stifled progress.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has emphasized that negotiations needed to be completed by October as the process to ratify a potential deal would be lengthy.
The pound's advance on Monday was largely helped by a sharp fall in the dollar as investors bet the Federal Reserve will introduce an average inflation targeting mechanism that would likely keep interest rate lower for longer.
The Federal Open Market Committee is set to kick off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. Policy members are expected to vote to keep rates unchanged within the 0% to 0.25% range."

Investing.com - The dollar sold off sharply in early European trade Monday, weighed by doubts about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this week.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.5% at 93.907, trading at levels not seen since May 2018.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was down 0.6% at 105.53, falling to a four-month low, GBP/USD was up 0.3% at 1.2820, reaching a four month high, while EUR/USD was up 0.5% at 1.1708, having earlier reached a 22-month high.
The dollar is weighed down by a number of factors, including a worsening row with China and the uncertainty surrounding November’s presidential election. However, of prime concern are doubts about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery as the country struggles to cope with Covid-19’s second wave.
The U.S. reported on Thursday its first rise in employment claims since March, largely as a result of a number of populous states having to roll back reopenings because of the pandemic.
“High frequency data already pointed to a stalling of the US recovery in recent weeks,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “July's U.S. PMIs confirmed this picture with the services PMI showing further improvement but remaining in contraction territory in contrast to its European counterpart.”
The Commerce Department is due to give its first take on second-quarter U.S. GDP on Thursday, with analysts forecasting a bruising 34% annualized decline during the three-month period. Ahead of that, durable goods orders for the month of June are due later Monday.
The Federal Reserve meets this week, with its two-day meeting ending Wednesday, amid growing expectations that the U.S. central bank will have to support the economy once more.
The emergency phase when the corona crisis was at its peak is over, and “now comes the next phase of supporting the recovery – a recovery, which several Fed members over the past weeks have said will take several years,” said analyst Morten Lund, at Nordea, in a research note. “As [Fed board member Lael] Brainard therefore put it in her recent speech, the focus of monetary policy will now shift from stabilization to accommodation. What those ‘accommodation tools might look like will be the focal point” of the FOMC meeting.

The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday after labour data last week showed the U.S. employment recovery wobbling. No major announcements are anticipated but analysts expect policymakers may begin laying the groundwork for more action in September or the fourth quarter.
The U.S. central bank could firm recent hints about the benefits of an average inflation target, which would allow rates to stay lower for longer.
""I think we're seeing the U.S. dollar adjusting to that,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. 
""If they are to ever get inflation...then the reaction is to allow the economy to run hot for a large period of time,"" he said. ""So the chance of the Fed raising in the next five years is being repriced in the U.S. dollar -- there's a momentum trade as people run this short position into the Fed meeting.""
The value of short dollar positions hit its highest in two years last week <0#NETUSDFX=>, while the futures market is pricing negative rates in the U.S. next August and no upward movement in the next three years <0#FF>.
The euro rose 0.5% to $1.1725 and the Antipodean currencies gained by the same margin, while sterling  and the Singapore dollar  both hit four-and-a-half month highs.

China said it had taken over the premises of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu on Monday after ordering the facility shut in retaliation for being ousted from its consulate in Houston.
Elsewhere, investors are also beginning to fret about U.S. political deadlock over the next round of fiscal stimulus with a month-end deadline looming to extend some unemployment benefits.
The White House and Senate Republicans agreed on a $1 trillion relief package, but that must be negotiated with Democrats who have been pushing for bigger spending.
Last week a recovery in the U.S. job market unexpectedly stalled, while purchasing manager surveys showed Europe's recovery pulling ahead - adding to nerves about any letup in U.S. stimulus.
""Failure to pass additional fiscal measures or a minimalist bill will likely generate a significant shock to markets,"" said Steve Englander, head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) in New York.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, starting the week under pressure from increasing U.S.-China tensions over the latest disagreement between the two countries.   
The latest tit-for-tat stemmed from the U.S. State Department’s order to close the Chinese Consulate in Houston within 72 hours during the previous week. China retaliated by ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu on Friday, with a Monday deadline.   
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo stoked the flames further last week when he suggested that Washington and its allies must use “more creative and assertive ways” to change China’s ways.   
The two countries are also in disagreement over issues such as trade, Hong Kong’s national security law, Xinjiang, and Chinese claims in the South China sea.
“The common factor is the ongoing decline in U.S. yields,” Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), told Reuters.  Yields fell as the bond market prices a slow U.S. recovery, robbing the dollar of a dependable attraction. 
“The message from the end of last week is that deterioration in risk sentiment alone may not be enough to provide the dollar with any kind of meaningful, durable support. I suspect it’s going to take much more [deterioration in sentiment] to really bring the dollar’s reserve-currency safe-haven characteristics back to the fore,” Attrill warned.  
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.47% to 93.933 by 12:15 AM ET (05:15 AM GMT), continuing its slide from Friday. 
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.0.47% to 105.62, with Japanese markets re-opening after a two-day holiday.  
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.44% to 0.7135 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.47% to 0.6675. The two Antipodean risk currencies, with close links to commodities and China, gained on the back of the dollar’s slump.

529,"<span>Jul 26, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Australian dollar is in rally mode, but its further rise is unlikely to be smooth sailing.
It’s climbed to a 15-month high against the dollar due to a widening yield differential between Aussie bonds and U.S. Treasuries as the Reserve Bank of Australia dismissed the possibility of negative interest rates, while Governor Philip Lowe said that the currency was broadly in line with economic fundamentals.
However, this pillar of support for the currency may come under threat if inflation data this week prompts the RBA to shift to a dovish stance.
“With one eye on the currency, it is possible that Lowe will use the RBA meeting on August 4 to sound more dovish,” said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank in London. “We are cautious about these gains holding beyond the European summer,” she said.
Australia’s second-quarter consumer price inflation data is forecast to have fallen 0.5% year-over-year, well below the central bank’s target range of 2%-3%. New restrictions in Victoria and New South Wales, in response to the surge in coronavirus cases, threatens to further douse inflation, with estimates of a 0.75% reduction in national real GDP growth this quarter.
However, RBA isn’t the only factor behind the Aussie rally. An economic rebound in China, its biggest export market, and positive developments on a coronavirus vaccine have also helped the currency surge by about 16% against the greenback since April to be Asia Pacific’s best performer.
The dollar’s weakness due to an increase in U.S. virus cases and stimulus negotiations have also supported the Aussie’s recent rise to its highest since April 2019.
“The carry trade has been lifting AUD/USD and this could sustain in the near-term,” said Foley.
Still, risks remain with the Aussie growing vulnerable due to its deteriorating relations with Beijing and simmering tensions between U.S. and China. Foley expects the Aussie to fall to around 0.68/67 per dollar over the next three months.

Investing.com – The dollar is set for its fifth-straight weekly loss on Friday as the ongoing spread of the coronavirus across the U.S. continues to threaten economic growth, but that could change if Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden wins in November, BofA said.
The dollar may weaken initially if Biden wins the November U.S. presidential election but would likely mount a rebound on the former vice president's proposed measures to support the economy.
In a Trump re-election in victory, all bets are off, and the dollar will likely continue on its current path lower, the bank said.
While Biden's proposed policies, particularly on taxes and regulation, appear less conducive to growth, his legislative agenda on the coronavirus and international trade are more supportive, BofA analysts said. ""Biden's call for greater federal coordination on Covid testing/tracing represent a good trade-off between economic damage and virus control.""
The continued weakness in the dollar comes as investors begin to doubt whether the U.S. economy's historical recovery powers will prevail once again in the wake of increased infections that have already shown signs of piercing through the nascent recovery.
The jobs market, which has underscored the recovery in the economy, has displayed weakness recently as weekly jobless claims increased for the first time since March 28.
The dollar is braced for a busy week of economic data releases, with second-quarter GDP – expected to show a 32% slump – durable goods, consumer confidence and jobs numbers on the calendar.
The greenback has also been hit by a surge in the euro, which accounts for about half of the weighting of the dollar index.

Investing.com - The dollar was in retreat in early European trade Friday, weighed by doubts about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery as the country struggles to curb the number of coronavirus cases.
 At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.627, breaching the March low of 94.650 to reach levels not seen since late 2018, and on track for its worst week in a month.
USD/JPY was down 0.5% at 106.33, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at 1.2725, while EUR/USD was up 0.1% at 1.1610, having reached its highest since late 2018. The euro was higher across the board profiting from an apparent 'safe haven' bid after the creation of a 750 billion-euro recovery fund improved the short-term political risk outlook.
The U.S. reported its first rise in unemployment claims since March on Thursday, with 1.416 million Americans filing for unemployment claims over the last week. This came as some states rolled back reopenings because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
There appears to be no sign that the coronavirus is stopping its relentless march across America. The U.S. on Thursday surpassed 4 million officially recorded Covid-19 cases, a quarter of which have come in just the last 15 days.
Additionally, the next U.S. fiscal rescue package appears to be deadlocked in Congress while a month-end deadline looms as some unemployment benefits are due to expire.
“U.S. exceptionalism has eroded, with perhaps only one pillar still standing -- demand for big cap U.S. stocks,” said Stuart Simmons, senior portfolio manager at QIC, Bloomberg reported. “The U.S. no longer has a yield advantage, there’s no growth advantage with the recovery from the coronavirus likely to prove more challenging than other developed markets.” 
Helping limit the damage in the dollar Friday, and boosting the Japanese yen as a safe yen, was the continued friction between the globe’s two economic powers, the U.S. and China.
Earlier Friday China ordered the United States to close its consulate in the city of Chengdu on Friday, responding to a U.S. demand this week that China close its Houston consulate. 
“This situation has been a catalyst for a pause in the risk-on rally, but to start seeing a reversal we would likely need to see further escalation and above all evidence that trade relations will be impacted,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Later Friday, the Central Bank of Russia is due to meet and is expected to cut its key interest rate again, having been on hold for the past couple of months. The ruble was a shade lower against the dollar at 71.56.
 "
532,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- After rocketing higher in March as the ultimate haven currency, the dollar is now headed for its worst month since the beginning of 2018, and many strategists see the sell-off continuing.
Negative real rates in the U.S., the relentless spread of the coronavirus in America and a pickup in global risk sentiment have seen investors hitting the eject button on long positions in the greenback.
With the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index already down 2.4% in July, here is why strategists say it has fallen, and where they think it will go from here:
Standard Chartered 
The dollar has seen continued selling during New York hours over the past few days, which is a negative sign for the currency, according to strategists including Geoff Kendrick. This implies that American asset managers have turned bearish on greenback while other currencies have performed well during their own local market hours.
Royal Bank of Canada
The S&P 500 index rising above a key double top technical level signals further losses to come for the dollar, given that short-term correlations between stocks and the U.S. Dollar Index are at their most negative since 2016, according to George Davis, chief technical analyst. Recovering commodity prices also weigh on the greenback as the correlation between the two moved to the most negative in over two years.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) 
The dollar is likely to decline after next week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, even as policy is expected to remain unchanged, according to strategists including Mike Schumacher. While a slight pickup in U.S. Treasury yields might cap gains against the yen and emerging markets, the euro and “dollar bloc” currencies are expected to benefit.
Bank of America 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists have raised their year-end target for the euro versus the dollar to $1.08 from $1.05. “The key driver of a weaker USD remains buoyant risk appetite and the U.S. equity market specifically,” wrote strategists including Ben Randol and Athanasios Vamvakidis. Despite this, they retained an overall positive view on the greenback, based on the negative outlook for the global economy.
K2 Asset Management
“We are in the weaker dollar ahead camp,” says George Boubouras, the hedge fund’s head of research in Melbourne. “We see the Aussie benefiting from this, and are targeting mid 70 U.S. cents as a sell,” K2 is currently long AUD/USD and have been adding to this position since the March risk-asset sell-off. “We see demand for greenbacks coming off on the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and ongoing fiscal stimulus.”
QIC Ltd.
“U.S. exceptionalism has eroded, with perhaps only one pillar still standing -- demand for big cap U.S. stocks,” says Stuart Simmons, senior portfolio manager at the Australian fund. “The U.S. no longer has a yield advantage, there’s no growth advantage with the recovery from the coronavirus likely to prove more challenging than other developed markets.” QIC sees the euro in particular as likely to benefit, with the 1.20 level as achievable by year-end.
GSFM
“I’ve generally had a disposition for a few years to be a dollar bull but that has changed a bit this year,” says Stephen Miller, an adviser at the unit of Canada’s CI Financial Group. “The Fed has lowered rates, Europe seems to have gotten its act together on the fiscal front and the dollar is also suffering from completely dysfunctional politics in the U.S.” He sees the euro as the biggest likely beneficiary.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, with the U.S. struggling to curb its surging number of COVID-19 cases. Combined with the looming expiry of some stimulus measures at the end of July as well as a record number of unemployment claims, investors are casting doubt over the U.S.’ recovery prospects.
“The USD bear case continues to sharpen with a break of the 94.65 March lows likely ushering in the next leg down,” Westpac analyst Richard Franulovich told Reuters.
The number of U.S. cases topped 4 million, with over 15.4 million cases globally as of July 24, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The U.S. reported its first uptick in initial jobless claims since March, with 1.416 million Americans filing for unemployment claims over the last week. The number was higher than analyst forecasts for 1.3 million claims, as well as the previous week’s 1.307 million claims.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.07% to 94.585 by 10:18 AM ET (3:18 AM GMT).
Franulovich also noted the dollar faces a major hurdle in the coming week, with the U.S. Federal Reserve expected to take a dovish outlook at its policy meeting.
Meanwhile, the dollar’s loss was the Euro’s gain, with the European Union reaching agreement on a EUR750 billion ($868.987 billion) COVID-19 rescue package earlier in the week. The agreement boosted the Euro to a 21-month peak against the dollar.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.28% to 106.56. Markets in Japan are closed for a holiday.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.25% to 0.7115 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.11% to 0.6641.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.05% to 7.0066. U.S-China tensions continue to simmer, with China vowing retaliation for the U.S. order for its Houston consulate to close by Friday. But a flight carrying an unspecified number of U.S. diplomats to Shanghai departed on Wednesday evening.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen advanced to a one-month high on Friday as deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations heightened investor anxiety, while a surging euro put the beleaguered dollar on track for its worst week in a month.
China has said it ""must"" retaliate after the U.S. ordered its Houston consulate to shut this week, amid allegations of spying. The editor of China's Global Times said on Twitter that Beijing will announce countermeasures on Friday and ask one U.S. consulate to close.
Earlier on Thursday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington and its allies must use ""more creative and assertive ways"" to press the Chinese Communist Party to change its ways, calling it the ""mission of our time.""
While trading volumes were lightened by a public holiday in Japan, the palpable tensions were enough to rouse the yen from a range it has kept for weeks.
The yen  rose 0.3% to 106.51, its strongest since late June. The Australian and New Zealand dollars were also off from multi-month highs and the Chinese yuan struggled for headway.
""The general concern is that any escalation in U.S-China tensions is bad and is putting the trade deal at risk,"" said Kim Mundy, an FX analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in Sydney.
""If we see China retaliating today, our view is that Aussie and the other growth-linked commodity currencies can fall,"" she said, with a dip likely to shove the Aussie back in the 68 cent to 70 cent range it held for several weeks. 
The Australian dollar  drifted higher to $0.7112, and is up about 1.7% for the week, but roughly 1% below a 15-month high touched on Wednesday. 
The New Zealand dollar  was at $0.6641, just under a 7-month high of $0.6690 touched on Thursday. 
The safe-haven Swiss franc  also hit a four-month peak of 0.9243 per dollar. Weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data had rattled U.S. markets overnight.
FAREWELL, CHENGDU?
Sino-U.S. ties have deteriorated over issues ranging from the novel coronavirus pandemic, which began in China, to Beijing trade and business practices, its territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.
A tit-for-tat consulate closure is shaping as among the most likely Chinese reply to the Houston consulate eviction.
A source told Reuters on Wednesday that China was considering shutting the U.S. consulate in Wuhan.
The Chinese yuan, a barometer of Sino-U.S. relations, fell overnight after the South China Morning Post reported that the U.S. consulate in Chengdu may be shuttered. 
The yuan  last sat at 7.0058 per dollar. Other Asian currencies from the South Korean won  to the Thai baht  and Singapore dollar  were also gently pressured.
Elsewhere the tearaway euro (EUR=EBS) remained a tower of strength since busting through chart resistance in the afterglow of Europe's leaders agreeing on a coronavirus rescue package.
It has gained 1.6% this week, its best since late June, and 3.4% for the month so far to sit at $1.1615, just below a 21-month high hit overnight.
Sterling  hung on to early-week gains at $1.2749.
Besides China's next move, investors are looking to a slew of Purchasing Managers Index figures due across Europe and the U.S. later on Friday for a read on economic recovery progress.
Focus is also on the next U.S. fiscal rescue package, which is deadlocked in Congress while a month-end deadline looms as some unemployment benefits are due to expire.

""The concern is that a failure to get this away will impact consumer sentiment at a time when U.S. data is starting to miss the mark,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.

535,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian borrowers stung by the pandemic have found financing costs in the dollar bond market too pricey recently. But that’s changing as their currency hedging costs decline.
Six-month Mifor swap rates, a combination of the London interbank offered rate and dollar-rupee forward premiums used by India’s borrowers to hedge exchange rate risks, are near a nine-year low. The cheaper hedging costs will give an additional impetus to companies, including Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd., Lalitpur Power Generation Co. and the nation’s biggest lender State Bank of India, seeking to issue dollar notes.
“The fall in offshore hedging costs boosts prospects for more Indian companies to issue dollar bonds at reasonable costs,” said Prabal Banerjee, group finance director at conglomerate Bajaj Group, the parent of Lalitpur Power.
Indian companies had issued a record amount of offshore notes in the first three months of 2020. But sales have plummeted since amid the coronavirus fallout and the world’s biggest lockdown. Borrowers may benefit from cheaper access to the dollar bond market, as they must repay a record $4.6 billion of foreign-currency notes next quarter.
The fall in hedging premiums cuts companies’ overall borrowing costs and could help some raise funds abroad at rates as much as 100 basis points cheaper than onshore.
The decline in hedging expenses stems in part from a recent rebound in the rupee, which has gained 1% in July. That makes it one of the best performing Asian currencies for the month and has helped it pare losses to 4.5% so far in 2020.
“The rupee’s recovery could see the pipeline for overseas issuance resume as it highlights an improving sentiment among global investors for Indian assets,” said Banerjee at Bajaj Group.

536,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Just three days after the Nasdaq 100’s biggest rally since April, those gains are history, and warnings are getting louder that tech stocks are in a bubble.
Fifty-year Wall Street veteran Ned Davis added his venerable voice to the chorus of worriers, citing the speed of the index’s advance -- before today -- and surging share volume. The Nasdaq 100 was down 2.8% Thursday, wiping out its gain for the week.
Of particular concern to bulls were plunges in  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., right after reporting earnings that exceeded analyst forecasts. The very biggest internet and software companies, collected under the Fang umbrella, have now fallen in six of the last nine sessions, losing 4.6% over that span for their worst run since March.
“The Nasdaq 100 looks bubbly to me,” Davis wrote in a note to clients of Ned Davis Research. “If this isn’t a sign of climbing up a high diving board for speculation, I don’t know what is.”
He plotted the velocity of the advance against the S&P 500 and found the price ratio has exceeded the peak seen during the dot-com era in 2000. Similarly, trading among all stocks listed on Nasdaq has jumped to a record relative to those on the New York Stock Exchange as investors embraced speculative names.
The drumbeat for such warnings has picked up in recent months as the S&P 500 has come close to erasing its bear-market decline, bouncing back even as a recession and pandemic rage. That rally has nothing on the Nasdaq 100, which, driven by internet and software companies seen benefiting from social distancing, has surged more than 50% from its March bottom, sending its price-earnings ratio to the highest level in two decades.
Read: Tech’s Perfect Profit Record Fails to Impress Spoiled Bulls
As dangerous as it all seems, market watchers like Canaccord Genuity LLC strategist Tony Dwyer are quick to point out some key differences now versus 2000. Back then, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy, with its benchmark interest rates rising to 6.5%. Now, the central bank has cut rates to near zero and says it remains willing to combat the effects of the virus on the U.S. economy.
Also supporting the current rally is a wider market participation, according to Dwyer. While it’s true that tech megacaps have dominated equity gains, other companies haven’t been completely left out. The cumulative advance-decline line for stocks listed on the NYSE, which represents the number of daily gains minus the number of daily declines, is hovering near an all-time high. By contrast, in 2000, market breadth had weakened for two years.
“While many fear the current environment is like 2000 ‘dot com’ bubble, the macro backdrop suggests otherwise,” Dwyer said. “The very different macro backdrop vs. 1999 suggest any pullbacks should prove temporary.”
Still, tech’s market dominance has raised some eyebrows. Should  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. be categorized as technology in the S&P 500, rather than communications or consumer discretionary where they currently belong, the tech industry’s index representation would have increased by roughly 10 percentage points to 37.5%, according to DataTrek Research. That’d exceed the industry’s peak weight of 32.5% during the internet bubble.
That big of a share would not only be the largest for technology itself, it would also exceed all other sectors since at least 1980. The closest industry peak weight, DataTrek found, was 29% from energy in December 1980.
“If prosaic oil companies were once 29% of the S&P, why can’t innovative tech one day be 50% of the index?” DataTrek’s Co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note. “Yes, at that point I think we’d all agree tech would be in a bubble just like energy was in 1980. But we’re not there yet.”

Invesitng.com – The dollar hovered around 22-month lows on Thursday on further signs the economic recovery in the U.S. could be grinding to a halt in the wake of a resurgence in coronavirus cases nationwide.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.22%, to 94.72.
The U.S. is on track for a strong rebound in the third quarter, but signs of rising initial jobless claims and declining footfall at retail stores suggest the recovery has come unstuck.
The U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday that 1.4 million people filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 18, up 109,000 from the prior week and above economists' estimates of 1.3 million.
While weaker footfall ""isn't a huge concern"" as June data showed retail sales returning to their pre-Covid levels, other indicators including industrial production and employment highlight that overall economic activity ""remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. 
The potential backdrop of a slower-than-expected recovery has dampened investor hopes for a V-shaped economic rebound.
The July Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Fund Manager Survey showed that 30% of the surveyed fund managers expect a W-shaped (double-dip recession) recovery, up from 21% last month.
Just 14% of the fund managers expect a V-shaped recovery, down from 18% in June, the survey showed.
The dollar has also been dragged lower by a sharp rise in the euro, which looks set to notch its fifth-straight weekly win against the greenback.
EUR/USD rose 0.28%, to $1.116."
538,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The forces behind the euro's recent strength suggest this may only be the first stage of a big market shift.
The currency’s 3% rally this month to near $1.16 has come on the back of dollar weakness due to narrowing bond-yield differentials and the U.S. struggle to deal with the pandemic, as well as the prospect of increased cohesion in the European Union after its agreement on a recovery fund.
These factors remain very much in play. Yet what makes the case for the rally to extend further is that market positioning remains largely underweight on the euro. A structural shift in investor exposure would mean the trend has just begun.
Hedge funds are still rushing to cover short exposure in the spot and options market, while institutional investors have just started to add long positions, according to traders in Europe, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly.
According to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the week through July 14, asset managers increased their long positions to over 300,000 contracts, while leveraged funds were short by more than 32,000 contracts.
The fact that traders are essentially covering cash shorts is shown by price action in the euro-dollar pair. Any corrections have been shallow and the fear of missing out in rallies has seen investors rushing to buy fresh highs.
There’s a similar picture painted by risk reversals, a barometer of options positioning and sentiment, in the euro versus currency havens. Bearish sentiment in the euro versus the yen through option trades is now at its lowest level since early 2018, while against the Swiss franc the market started betting on gains last week.
This means there is plenty of room for the common currency to rise should the EU keep handling the pandemic effectively and if the economic recovery in the region keeps defying initial expectations.
Technical charts and commercial investor positioning also point to a continuation in the rally. Momentum could take the euro above $1.18, with the dollar at risk of a deep drop in coming months.
According to CFTC data commercial investors, who are looking to hedge and thus trade in the opposite direction to anticipated price action, are adding more and more euro short positions. Historical patterns suggest that will be followed by the euro strengthening.

539,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
Turkey is asking banks to use futures contracts to hedge their growing foreign-currency liabilities to help ease some of the pressure that a surge in dollar demand from local businesses is putting on the lira exchange rate.
Authorities advised lenders last week that instead of buying hard currency in the spot market, they should purchase futures agreements to balance any foreign-currency obligations toward their clients, according to people with knowledge of the mater, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public.
The call comes as state-owned banks approach the legal limit on how much currency risk they can hold, a result of their efforts to support the lira by selling dollars on the spot market. The new measure is also part of policy makers’ push to increase the nation’s currency reserves, the people said.
Typically, when a Turkish lender sells a foreign-currency forward contract to a corporate client, they hedge this position by buying the dollars in the spot market. Shifting some of this demand to the futures market would help support the lira and require the central bank to sell less of its reserves.
The central bank and Turkey’s banking regulator declined to comment.
Cash Settled
One major benefit of future contracts is that they’re cash settled -- which means that banks don’t need to have the dollars to hand. Still, given the lack of liquidity in the futures market, any meaningful shift -- at least initially -- would probably see the central bank take on a large role as a counterparty.
The level of central bank reserves has been a concern for some Turkey analysts since last year, when it began borrowing foreign currency from commercial lenders through swap agreements. The central bank’s foreign currency holdings have dropped to $49.6 billion as of July 10 from $81.2 billion at the end of last year.
Over the weekend, the monetary authority raised the amount of foreign exchange lenders must hold at its coffers, a move that’s expected to increase the nation’s reserves by around $9.2 billion.

(Reuters) - Investors raised their long bets on the Chinese yuan and most other Asian currencies, a Reuters poll showed, as signs of a recovery in the world's second-largest economy and news of progress in coronavirus vaccine trials whetted risk appetite.
Bullish positions in the yuan  outpaced those in peers and were at their highest in two-and-a-half years, touching levels only seen before the trade war between the United States and China started, the fortnightly poll of 16 respondents showed.
Encouraging early data from three potential COVID-19 vaccine trials and upbeat economic indicators from China have anchored regional markets of late, said Han Tan, a market analyst at FXTM, but warned that the tolerance of export-reliant Asian countries for further currency strength would be limited. 
China posted better-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) and trade figures last week and promised higher fiscal support and capital market reforms, boosting confidence in the yuan and stoking a rally in local equities.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts expect the elevated interest rate spread between the yuan and the dollar to support further currency inflows, and Chinese activity growth to outshine the rest of the world in the second half of 2020.
However, they point to worsening Sino-U.S relations as a potential threat to an economic rebound in China. 
The poll responses came in by Wednesday, before markets retreated on heightened Sino-U.S. tensions after Washington ordered Beijing to close its consulate in Houston.
Poll results showed bullish bets on the Philippine peso  and the Indian rupee  climbed. Sentiment towards the two currencies has lately improved on the back of solid net inflows. 
Even as most Asian countries scrambled to stem a rise in new coronavirus cases, yield-seeking investors bought $6.45 billion worth of regional bonds last month, marking the biggest foreign inflow jump in a year.
On the flip side, bearish bets more than doubled on the Indonesia rupiah  after the central bank cut interest rate last week for the fourth time this year and predicted a ""U-shaped"" economic recovery from the pandemic.
Meanwhile, investors turned bearish on the Thai baht  for the first time since late May.
The resignation of Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana, economic policy czar Somkid Jatusripitak and four other ministers within a week has sunk the baht and worsened prospects for the ailing economy.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar , Indian rupee , Philippine peso , Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.

A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Thursday, with signs of a recovery in Europe boosting sentiment despite heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.808, just off the four-month low of 94.773 seen earlier.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY was largely flat at 107.09, GBP/USD was flat at 1.2731, while EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1587, having reached 1.1593, a 21-month high.
Helping the euro, and general risk-taking sentiment, was Germany's Gfk consumer confidence survey coming in better than expected earlier Thursday, suggesting that Europe's largest economy is on the path to recovery.
The forward-looking consumer sentiment index rose to -0.3 in August, better than the -5 expected and the -9.6 seen in July. It has gained almost 23 points since its low of minus 23.1 points in May.
This comes in the wake of the European Union leaders agreeing a substantial stimulus plan to help the region rebuild from the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Still, there are dangers to the risk-on tone.
Tensions are escalating between the two largest economies in the world, with the United States ordering China to close its consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying.
“Investors may turn defensive on Thursday with market players awaiting possible retaliation from China,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The yuan is a barometer of Sino-U.S. relations and it now trades around the 7.0 level, having fallen to a one-week low of 7.0174 per dollar in offshore trade on Tuesday.
Attention will also be on the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data early in the U.S. session, after last week’s release suggested the improvement in the U.S. labor market since April may be petering out.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY has held relatively steady at 6.8482 ahead of the latest rate-setting meeting by Turkey’s central bank. 
Most market players expect the bank to leave the key rate unchanged at 8.25% for a second month, but the pressure is rising on it to start lifting borrowing costs as the inflation outlook deteriorates.
“With recovering domestic demand and increasing price pressures, the next move will be a hike,” said analysts at JPMorgan Chase, in a research note, reported by Bloomberg. “We have the first hike in the first half of 2021, but a sharper-than expected demand recovery could lead to heightened risks to price and financial stability, encouraging the central bank to act earlier.”

A six-month guaranteed handout for 2.7 billion living below or just above the poverty line in 132 developing countries would cost around $199 billion per month and could be funded by repurposing external debt service payments, the agency said in a report published Thursday.
With the rate of infections increasing in many poorer nations with debt costs crowding out health and social expenses, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a standstill for all developing economies.
Those countries are set to spend $3.1 trillion in debt repayments this year and the UNDP said its proposal would allow them to briefly repurpose the funds to address the damage wrought by the crisis.
‘Unprecedented Times’
The plan would require 12% of the expected total financial response to pandemic in 2020, which is equivalent to one-third of what developing countries owe in external debt payments this year, the UNDP said.
Already the Group of 20 leading economies has offered a Debt Service Suspension Initiative to the world’s poorest nations that runs through December. So far, 42 countries have requested help under the plan, leading to the suspension of $5.3 billion in repayments.
The UNDP said the program could also be funded by energy subsidies, after a decline in oil prices, and through emergency cash transfers. It is particularly necessary in developing nations, where nine out of ten workers have informal employment and can’t earn money if they are at home, the agency said.
“Unprecedented times call for unprecedented social and economic measures,” Achim Steiner, the UNDP’s administrator said in a statement. “A temporary basic income might enable governments to give people in lockdown a financial lifeline, inject cash back into local economies to help keep small businesses afloat, and slow the devastating spread of Covid-19.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar crept off milestone lows against other majors on Thursday, and held on to gains against the yuan, as heightened Sino-U.S. tension put a bit of caution into currency markets.
The United States gave China until Friday to close its consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying, and President Donald Trump said it was ""always possible"" other Chinese missions could be ordered to close as well.
China has vowed to respond and the escalation in tension between the world's two largest economies sent the yuan  on its sharpest slide in nearly two months on Wednesday and has helped the greenback find support in Asian trade on Thursday.
The euro (EUR=EBS) sat at $1.1571, about 0.3% below a 21-month high of $1.1601, which it hit overnight in the afterglow of Europe's leaders agreeing on a coronavirus rescue package.
The Australian dollar  pulled back from a 15-month peak and was steady at $0.7143, while the kiwi  retreated slightly from a six-month top to sit at $0.6657.
Volumes were lightened by a public holiday in Japan.
""The market is still trying to ascertain whether this increase in geopolitical tension is going to be enough to derail the positive vibes we've been seeing,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
""Recent history will tell you that the market will tend to digest this stuff and carry on in its merry way...but a bit of caution is warranted, and the yuan moving higher is probably the canary in the coalmine that we need to keep an eye on.""
The yuan is a barometer of Sino-U.S. relations and it fell 0.6% to a one-week low of 7.0174 per dollar in offshore trade on Tuesday.
China's midpoint for the onshore trading band  was fixed weaker than expected on Thursday, suggesting there is more to come in this fresh flashpoint.
Still, the lift to the dollar was pretty modest. It edged off a four-month low against a basket of currencies (=USD) to 94.980.
The safe-haven Swiss franc  found support near a four-month top at 0.9287 per dollar, while the yen  was rangebound at 107.15 per dollar.
U.S.-China ties have worsened sharply this year over issues ranging from the coronavirus and telecoms-gear maker Huawei, to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and clampdown on Hong Kong.
The U.S. State Department said the Chinese mission in Houston was being closed ""to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information.""
Chinese state media said on Thursday that the move was a political ploy ahead of November presidential elections, and one source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that China was considering closing the U.S. consulate in Wuhan in response.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A steady decline in the dollar has accelerated in recent weeks, as a resurgent coronavirus outbreak in the United States and improving economic prospects abroad sour investors on the currency. 
The buck is down 8% from its highs of the year against a basket of currencies (=USD) and stands near its lowest level since 2018. Net bets against the dollar in futures markets are approaching their highest level in more than two years.
""The dollar is hanging by a thread,"" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York. ""At this point, the dollar-weakness mindset has become deeply entrenched.""
A range of factors are driving the U.S. currency's decline. For years, expectations that the United States would outperform other economies kept the dollar elevated against many of its peers. 
That performance gap is increasingly expected to narrow. European Union leaders earlier this week clinched a massive stimulus plan and have been largely successful in their efforts to contain the coronavirus. Meanwhile, outbreaks across large swaths of the United States have all but extinguished hopes of a quick economic turnaround there.
Analysts at Société Générale expect real gross domestic product growth in both the United States and Europe to take big hits next year. Yet they project a 5.2% rebound for EU growth in 2022, compared with a 2.5% bounce in the United States. The euro (EUR=EBS) is up 9% from its lows of 2020. 
""Investors don't know what the U.S. is doing"" regarding the coronavirus pandemic, said Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London. ""That has been a big drag on the U.S. dollar.""
His firm began betting on a weaker dollar and stronger euro in May. 
At the same time, the Federal Reserve has said it intends to keep rates at historic lows, narrowing a gap in yields between the United States and Europe that has boosted the dollar over the years. 
Low U.S. yields have also raised the allure of investments such as gold, which normally struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets. Prices for the metal are up 23% for the year.
Emerging markets, where yields tend to be higher, have also drawn their share of buying. The MSCI Emerging Market Currencies index (MIEM00000CUS) is up 4.5% from its lows. 
""There are other places that are doing much better than the U.S. on dealing with the COVID crisis,"" said Issa, of TD Securities. ""You are likely to see growth in those areas much sooner.""
A decline in the dollar earlier this month set off a technical formation known as a ""Death Cross,"" which occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, said Paul Ciana, chief global FICC technical strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Past occurrences of the Death Cross have been followed by a period of dollar weakness eight out of nine times since 1980 when the 200-day moving average has been declining, he said.
A weaker dollar will likely come as a relief to U.S. exporters, as their products become more competitive abroad when the dollar weakens. A falling dollar also makes it less expensive for U.S. multinationals to convert earnings back into their home currency.

Investing.com – The euro racked up gains on Wednesday, and could reach $1.21 against the dollar by the end of the year as the greenback faces a rocky few months amid rising cases and stimulus worries, analysts said.
EUR/USD rose 0.36% to $1.567.
""The 'one step forward, three steps back' style of U.S. reopening has exposed those weaknesses to the market, undermining the USD,"" TD FX analyst Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said.
The U.S. has struggled to contain the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 3.9 million nationwide, forcing some states to roll back recent measures taken to reopen businesses.
The struggles in the dollar against the euro have been compounded recently by signs that EU members are warming up to the idea of forming a fiscal union following their historical €750 billion coronavirus package agreed yesterday.
The pandemic aside, the dollar also faces headwinds, albeit short-term, from potential delays to fiscal stimulus, ING said.  ""A possible delay to the U.S. fiscal stimulus (Republicans reportedly are working on their own version, trying to bypass President Trump’s plan to include payroll tax cuts in the stimulus) is another in a series of short-term blows to the US dollar.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday reportedly said he does not expect that the bill, which includes new money for the paycheck protection program, and seeks to extend the program by at least six months, would be rolled out within the next two weeks.
With Congress set for a recess in August, time is running out for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to resolve their difference over the coronavirus aid bill. 
The Dutch bank said the path to gains for the single currency is more likely amid dollar weakness ahead.

The currency advanced as much as 0.5% to 1.1584 as of 7:35 a.m. in New York as traders absorbed the impact of the accord, which allocates 750 billion euros ($860 billion) to pull European economies out of the worst recession in memory, and tightens the financial bonds that hold the 27 nations together.
The shared currency “is clearly celebrating the improvement in its fundamentals,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank. “The size of the recovery fund is not huge and would likely be insufficient if another wave of lockdowns hit the continent. However, the fact that the EU were able to coordinate a compromise earlier than many had anticipated is significant.”
The region’s assets have rallied in response. Germany’s DAX Index is now almost positive for the year and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index has added $3.5 trillion in market value since the mid-March lows.

The Swiss, who for years have been using foreign exchange interventions to prevent the franc from appreciating too much, now meet all three criteria for manipulators set out by the U.S., namely a high trade and current account surplus plus large-scale interventions, economist Alessandro Bee wrote in a note to clients.
Switzerland is already on a monitoring list, and could be upgraded when the U.S. publishes its next report.
The Swiss National Bank says that along with negative interest rates, interventions are essential to prevent the onset of of deflation and a recession. Its policy makers stress they’re not trying to keep their currency artificially low but simply trying to limit a strong appreciation.
“Much depends on the diplomatic skills of the Swiss authorities and the goodwill of the U.S.,” Bee said, adding that the U.S. might abstain from any reprisal steps.
“Even if a conflict with the U.S. can be avoided, meeting all three formal criteria is likely to lead to increased uncertainty about the SNB’s future monetary policy and is likely to increase volatility” in the exchange rate.

This follows the European Union leaders agreeing a substantial stimulus plan to help the countries of the region rebuild their economies from the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
At the same time, there is a perception that U.S. lawmakers are struggling to reach consensus on the next round of stimulus measures to boost American consumers and businesses.

""Ironically, the dollar's weakness has been exacerbated by concerns that the United States is not doing as much as the Europeans have on stimulus.""
The EU summit agreement is pretty significant, analysts at ING noted, in a research note, as the emergence of grants points to solidarity, while common bonds points to integration.
That said, “with the EUR-specific good news now being largely in the price, we expect the next leg of the EUR/USD upside to come from the dollar side,” ING added, “with the U.S. currency's downtrend caused by a combination of loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve (note the dollar lost its key advantage which has kept it supported in prior years - the meaningful interest rate differential), the twin deficit and the U.S. Presidential election uncertainty.“

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against most currencies, undermined by concern that Republicans and Democrats are struggling to reach consensus on the next round of U.S. economic stimulus measures.
The euro traded near its strongest level in more than a year on Wednesday after European leaders agreed a stimulus plan to fuel recovery from the economic drag caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Risk appetite has improved greatly this week as progress in developing vaccines for the novel coronavirus reduced the U.S. dollar's safe-harbour appeal.
Investors also expect a massive amount of fiscal spending to support growth in major economies but could easily be disappointed if any stimulus falls short of expectations.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1 trillion package the Republicans are considering is not sufficient. The Democratic-run House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion relief bill two months ago that the Republican-majority Senate has ignored.
Concern about disagreement over stimulus spending in the United States is in contrast to the European Union.
The 27-member bloc worked over the weekend to narrow their differences and agree a 750 billion euro ($864.90 billion) recovery fund and a 1.1 trillion euro 2021-2027 budget to help the continent recover from its deepest recession since World War Two.

554,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar is facing renewed questions about its status as the globe’s primary reserve currency.
The greenback accounts for more than 60% of global reserves and is the most widely used currency for international transactions. But it risks ceding ground to the euro after European Union leaders agreed on a 750 billion euro ($860 billion) stimulus package that enhances the appeal of the shared currency and euro-denominated assets, analysts from Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and Mizuho International Plc said.
Wall Street strategists were already becoming more enthusiastic about the shared currency, betting that it will strengthen as the global economy rebounds from the pandemic and investor appetite for riskier assets picks up. The euro’s strong correlation with equities suggests it may climb as the recovery fund makes the region’s stocks more attractive. And under the accord, EU nations will jointly issue debt that could offer an alternative to U.S. Treasuries as a haven.
The recovery fund “will facilitate diversification out of the U.S. dollar by offering liquid, high-rating, euro-denominated debt,” said Credit Agricole’s Valentin Marinov, adding that the dollar’s share of reserves could revisit its lows from the early 1990s.
The euro on Tuesday touched $1.1540, the highest level since January 2019, and is now up almost 3% this year.
The shared currency still has some major hurdles to overcome before it dents the dollar’s dominance. About 85% of all foreign-exchange transactions occur against the greenback, while half of international trade is invoiced in it, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
And the euro still only makes up about 20% of global foreign-exchange reserves. That figure peaked at about 28% in 2009.
Lift-Off Path
Still, long-time dollar bear Ulf Lindahl, chief executive officer of A.G. Bisset Associates and a more than 40-year veteran of the currency market, projects the euro will rise by more than 30% against the dollar in the next 16 months. After breaching $1.14 earlier this month, it’s on a “clear lift-off path” against the dollar, and its outlook is “even stronger now,” he said.
And should the recovery fund quell concerns that the euro region could even break up at some point, more economic activity will be executed in euros, according to Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho.
“Over the medium term, the recovery fund does indeed pose a strong challenge to Treasuries and the dollar,” he said.

EUR/USD rose 0.76% to $1.1530.
The EU's coronavirus recovery fund, made up of €390 billion in grants and €360 billion in loans, should prop up the euro as economic activity picks up in the bloc, BK Asset Management said. ""The size and scope of the deal are historic and open the way for greater federalism within the union which could make Europe a more integrated market and stronger economic competitor on the global stage.
With the EU showing a better handle on the coronavirus outbreak than the U.S., the economic bloc may ""even enjoy a competitive advantage,"" BK added.
Some, however, have been quick to point out that the path toward the deal highlighted just how divided EU members are on closer fiscal integration. The deal was held ransom by the ""frugal four"": Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, which only backed the deal after demands to increase rebates on payments made to the EU were met.
""This fact is important as it shows that the compromise is -- at least in part -- built on a one-off incentive for certain countries that cannot be repeated as often as one might like,"" M&G investment said.
Countries receiving support from the fiscal package would have to propose milestones and prove they are meeting them.
It also included an option for any member country to call an emergency brake on any disbursement to another country if it believes reforms have not been meant, potentially leading to headline risk and volatility, BofA said.
The deal is expected to ratified by the European parliament and national parliamentary across member states."

For the first time member states will underwrite joint bond issuance, posing a challenge to the hegemony of the dollar in financial markets.

Investing.com - The dollar has been under pressure Tuesday, with the euro and commodity currencies benefiting from the news that European Union leaders have reached an agreement over a recovery fund for the region and amid renewed hopes for a Covid-19 vaccine.
 At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 95.718, having earlier traded at a more than four-month low of 95.687.
 Elsewhere, USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.31, while EUR/USD was flat at 1.1444, having earlier hit a four-month high of 1.1469.
 In the commodity currencies, NZD/USD inched higher and AUD/USD added 0.4% to 0.7039.
After more than four days of haggling, European Union leaders reached a deal on a massive 750 billion euro stimulus plan for their coronavirus-hit economies, with 390 billion euros as non-repayable grants - down from 500 billion originally proposed - and the rest in repayable loans.
“Investors are likely to scrutinize the package to look for the finer details such as the resulting distribution and the share of loans versus grants among member states,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
“Although an agreement has been reached, we do not expect any major moves as the price action yesterday suggested that a lot has already been priced in.”
Adding to the weakness for safe havens like the dollar was encouraging data from trials of three potential COVID-19 vaccines, including a closely-watched candidate from Oxford University.
This comes as the number of coronavirus infections world wide climbed above 14.7 million, with over 609,000 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.
Another currency showing strength Tuesday has been sterling, helped by the positive news from the EU summit as well as ahead of fresh Brexit talks beginning later Tuesday.
The aim of reaching an agreement between Britain and the EU on future ties by October is ambitious but achievable, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Tuesday.
“There is sizeable room for more stress to be built into sterling in the coming weeks and months as EU-UK negotiations enter a crucial phase – but we remain positive a trade deal will eventually be agreed on,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
At 2:45 AM, GBP/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2687, just off the one month high of 1.2693 hit earlier, while EUR/GBP dropped 0.2% at 0.9018, close to the week low of 0.9015.

Published in the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics, the study is the first such examination of the behavioral impact of negative rates, according to co-author Lior David-Pur, who also heads the debt management unit in Israel’s Ministry of Finance. “Central banks should consider carefully before decreasing rates below zero,” he said in an interview.
The finding may give monetary policy makers around the world pause as they consider further cuts to borrowing costs in an attempt to stimulate economies during the global slowdown brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Among the findings in the report were that cutting rates from 1% to 0% had the greatest impact on boosting risk-taking and borrowing, while a reduction below zero could actually have the opposite effect, with leverage decreasing.
David-Pur attributed the results to a couple of factors: the psychological importance of 0%, and the fact that negative interest rates -- where individuals are paid by banks to borrow money -- could spur risk aversion.
A long-running debate has played out during the past few years over the efficacy of negative rates, amid slowing growth and weak inflation. A handful of central banks including the European Central Bank reduced their key rate below zero, with Sweden’s Riksbank lifting rates back to zero. Fed funds futures also price in a chance of a negative policy rate from around mid-2021, despite continued push-back from U.S. central bankers.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Progress toward both a coronavirus vaccine and a fiscal rescue package in Europe put the dollar under pressure and supported commodity currencies and the euro on Tuesday.
European Union leaders appear close to an agreement on a massive stimulus plan for the bloc as the summit drags beyond a fourth day.
Hopes for a breakthrough pushed the euro (EUR=EBS) to a four-month high of $1.1467 and it held just below that level at $1.1460 in Asian trade.
Encouraging data from trials of three potential COVID-19 vaccines, including a closely-watched candidate from Oxford University, also supported sentiment and weighed broadly on the safe-haven greenback.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar traded at a more than four-month low of 95.687 while the pound  extended overnight gains to a one-month high of $1.2683.
The New Zealand dollar inched higher and the Australian dollar added 0.1% to hold above 70 U.S. cents. The Japanese yen  was steady at 107.23 per dollar.
""The agreement in Europe on the economic recovery fund underwrites growth there and improves the global economic outlook,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) FX analyst Joe Capurso.
""That is a positive for growth-linked currencies such as the Aussie and kiwi.""
EU Council President Charles Michel said he was confident the compromises he offered the 27 leaders would clinch a deal on a fund that many say is critical to dispel doubts about the bloc's very future.
Michel proposed that within the 750 billion euro recovery fund, 390 billion should be non-repayable grants, down from 500 billion originally proposed, and the rest in repayable loans.
On the vaccine front, drugs developed by Britain's AstraZeneca (L:AZN) with Oxford University and by CanSino Biologics (HK:6185) with China's military research unit showed they were safe and produced an immune response in early trials.
LOWE WORRIES
Traders' focus on Tuesday in Asia is on Australia's central bank and a speech from Governor Philip Lowe at 0300 GMT. [AUD/]
The speech, addressing the virus and labour markets, also comes as Australia fights a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 in Victoria state, which authorities said could take weeks to subside even with a new lockdown in Melbourne.
""We are in a very different situation to where we were a month ago in terms of the virus - how rattled are they, if at all, on that?"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow.
""Is Lowe worried enough that he is willing to talk about what might be the next step?""
Minutes from last month's meeting published on Tuesday showed the bank was prepared to keep policy accommodative but indicated negative rates were unlikely.
The Aussie  was a touch firmer at $0.7025. The kiwi  held at $0.6581, close to the top of its range this month.
Meanwhile the pound  hung on to broad and sizeable gains made overnight as many traders closed out long euro/pound positions in the wake of the EU Summit progress and ahead of fresh Brexit talks beginning on Tuesday. [GBP/]
Against the pound, the euro held close to a week low at 90.40 pence (EURGBP=) after dropping half a percent on Monday.

The two sides will resume talks on Tuesday after Britain's chief negotiator David Frost hosts his EU counterpart Michel Barnier for dinner later on Monday.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Tuesday morning in Asia, with investors retreating from the safe-haven asset over fresh hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Oxford University said on Monday that early-stage human trials for its candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which it is developing with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), showed positive results. Two other potential candidates also reported positive results on the same day, including one being developed by CanSino Biologics alongside China’s military research unit.
Meanwhile, European Union leaders are a step closer in reaching a consensus for its proposed stimulus plan at the EU Summit, even as negotiations were extended beyond a fourth day.
“The agreement in Europe on the economic recovery fund underwrites growth there and improves the global economic outlook,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) FX analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies fell 0.16% to 95.623 by 10:09 AM ET (3:09 AM GMT). The USD/JPY pair was down % to 107.16.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.21% to 0.7028. The Reserve Bank of Australia will release minutes from its June meeting later in the day, and Governor Philip Lowe will also give a speech.
The NZD/USD pair was up 0.05% to 0.6577 and the USD/CNY pair gained 0.05% to 6.9867.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.14% to 1.2677. The GBP held its overnight gains over the progress made at the EU Summit, with investor sentiment further boosted over fresh Brexit negotiations between the EU and the U.K. slated to begin later in the day."

Investing.com - The euro rose on Monday, posting a four-month high against the U.S. dollar, as traders reacted with optimism to the noises coming from the EU summit regarding a potential agreement for a massive recovery fund for the region.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), EUR/USD gained 0.2% to 1.1443, having earlier posted a four-month high of 1.1467, while EUR/GBP climbed 0.3% to 0.9118.
After three days of haggling, European Union leaders have yet to agree on how to structure the proposed recovery fund, seen totaling 750 billion euros, and what conditions to put on the countries, mainly from the Mediterranean rim, that would benefit from the fund.
That said, they have agreed to return on Monday afternoon in an effort to finish the negotiations, suggesting the two sides are not too far apart.
“Tough negotiations just came to an end,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a tweet, earlier Monday. “We can be very happy with today’s result. It will continue this afternoon.”
Austria is one of the four European Union governments, along with the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, that have been holding up negotiations over the deal, concerned about the level of monitoring over how the funds will be used.
Bloomberg reported Monday that these four governments are now satisfied with 390 billion euros of the fund being made available as grants with the rest coming as low-interest loans, a key component of the deal.
""If this is true, then it is a fairly decent deal that goes through. The hardliners need to understand that grants are necessary continously going forward, if they want a well-functioning EUR. Permanent money transfers from North to the South will be required,"" said Andreas Steno Larsen, Global Chief FX & Rates Strategist at Nordea, in a tweet.
Elsewhere, the ICE (NYSE:ICE) Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was flat at 95.925, near the four-month low it posted last week. GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2553, while USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 107.27.
The dollar has been unable to post gains despite the number of coronavirus infections having climbed above 14.5 million, with over 600,000 deaths world wide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The virus has claimed over 140,000 U.S. lives in total. Florida announced over 12,000 new cases on Sunday, while the Mayor of Los Angeles said his city is on the brink of new lockdown measures. 
These numbers will put pressure on U.S. policymakers to agree on further measures to stimulate the country’s economy, particularly as some policies are due to expire at the end of July.
“We see more political pressure on the Republicans to compromise on Democratic objectives because Republicans are trailing badly in polls... Senate Republicans are not in a position to hold back stimulus,” Reuters quoted Steven Englander, head of global FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank in New York, as saying."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro jumped to a four-month high against the dollar on Monday, boosted by European leaders saying progress was being made in talks to take on debt jointly to help their economies.
The euro gained 0.2% to $1.1452 (EUR=), having risen to as high as $1.14555, its loftiest level since March, as EU leaders appeared within a whisker of breaking an impasse over a proposed 750 billion euro ($858.30 billion) recovery fund.
With the marathon talks adjourned until 1600 CET (1400 GMT) on Monday, Austrian Chancellor Sebestian Kurz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, leaders from two of the so-called ""frugal four"", said progress was being made.
Rutte said talks had been close to failing, but the chairman was now working on a new EU compromise proposal.
""The EU appears to be about to overcome a major hurdle. If they come to an agreement, the euro could look for a new trading range, possibly something like $1.14-$1.16, as opposed to the $1.11-$1.14 range it has been stuck for a while,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
The 750 billion euros proposed for the fund are to be raised on behalf of EU countries on capital markets by the EU's executive European Commission 
While that would be a historic step towards greater fiscal integration for the union, a group of ""frugal"" wealthy north European states have been reluctant, pushing for a smaller fund and seeking to limit how payouts are split between grants and repayable loans.
As European Council President Charles Michel urged leaders to achieve ""mission impossible"", diplomats said it was possible that they would abandon the summit and try again for an agreement next month.
""If they do come to an agreement, we should see a further rally in the euro,"" said Yujiro Goto, chief currency strategist at Nomura Securities.
But many market players also believe the euro will be supported even if the deal is not reached this time, as long as there remains the prospect of a deal on the stimulus.
The dollar index  was flat at 95.948, with its advance kept in check as investor risk appetite continues to be strong, underpinned by bets of more stimulus not just from Europe but also the United States.
A battle in the U.S. Congress over a new coronavirus-aid bill began late last week as Republicans and Democrats pushed for their own agenda.
The Republicans want the upcoming coronavirus aid bill to cost no more than $1 trillion while leading Democrats have pledged to fight for much more - in the range of the $3 trillion bill.
""We see more political pressure on the Republicans to compromise on Democratic objectives because Republicans are trailing badly in polls...Senate Republicans are not in a position to hold back stimulus,"" wrote Steven Englander, head of global FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank New York branch in a report. 
Expectations of more government spending have offset worries about rising coronavirus cases in the United States as well as fears over deteriorating U.S.-China relations.
The British pound fell 0.2% to $1.2541  while the Australian dollar shed 0.10% to $0.6987 .
The Japanese yen  eased 0.2% to 107.29 per dollar .
It did not react to Japan's trade data showing exports in June plunged 26% from a year earlier, worse than expected.

The offshore Chinese yuan held firm at 6.9853 per dollar , only a tad below last week's four-month peak of 6.9806.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Monday morning in Asia, with investors awaiting the results of a U.S. Congress debate over fresh COVID-19 stimulus measures later in the week.
Debate over the bill started last week, with some current measures due to expire at the end of July. But Republicans and Democrats are already in disagreement, with Republicans wanting the bill to cost no more than $1 trillion while the Democrats want measures totaling around $3 trillion.
“We see more political pressure on the Republicans to compromise on Democratic objectives because Republicans are trailing badly in polls... Senate Republicans are not in a position to hold back stimulus,” Steven Englander, head of global FX strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank New York branch, warned in a report.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 numbers continue a never-ending climb. There are almost 14.5 million COVID-19 cases and over 600,000 deaths globally as of July 20, according to Johns Hopkin University data. Dampened hopes of a quick recovery also saw investors turning to the safe-have asset.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.23% to 96.112 by 12:01 AM ET (5:01 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.36% to 107.38. The pair was unaffected by the release of Japanese trade data earlier in the day that showed a worse-than-expected 26.2% decline in June exports year-on-year.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.18% to 0.6983and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.15% to 0.6546.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.04% to 6.9940 and the GBP/USD pair fell 0.34% to 1.2522.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Euro rose against the dollar as the EU reached an impasse over a proposed EUR750 billion ($856.969 billion) COVID-19 recovery fund. Some members are pushing to reduce the fund amount, as well as limit the ratio of grants against loans, during a summit ironing out fund details.
Although the impasse could see the summit abandoned and a second try in August, some investors were optimistic on the prospects of a deal.
“I don’t know what to expect from the summit. But even if there is no agreement, the impact will be limited given the euro appears to have a fairly strong momentum these days,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.",,,,,

The dollar was offered for as much as 255,300 rials, up from 242,500 on Friday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. The economic daily Donya-e-Eqtesad's website gave the dollar rate as 252,300, compared with 241,300 on Friday.
The currency has lost nearly 48% of its value in 2020, more than half of that in the past month, as a drop in oil prices and a slump in the global economy have deepened the economic crisis in the country, which also has the highest death toll in the Middle East from the pandemic.
The official exchange rate - used mostly for imports of state-subsidised food and medicine - is 42,000 rials per dollar.
In May 2018, President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme and reimposed sanctions that have since battered the economy. 
President Hassan Rouhani, who has partly blamed the rial's drop on the failure of exporters to repatriate their foreign currency earnings, instructed the central bank on Friday to redouble its efforts to enforce rules on returning export earnings, state media reported.

In the months after May 2018 the rial's value tumbled as Iranians snapped up dollars, fearing Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and sanctions could shrink Iran's vital oil exports and severely impact the economy. The currency recouped some of its losses in late 2018.

Invesing.com – The dollar looked set for a fourth-straight weekly loss on Friday, on weaker economic data and falling demand as rising cases cast doubts on the U.S. economy's ability to bounce back faster than that of its rivals, experts warn.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.43% to 95.89.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment fell to 73.2 in early July. ""We do not expect to see a material increase in consumer sentiment until it is widely viewed that the virus is under control,"" Wells Fargo said.
Beyond the economic data, some have pointed to rising coronavirus infections in the U.S. as a key driver of dollar weakness.
The U.S. reported 77,200 cases on Thursday, a daily record, with the death toll above 138,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The U.S. economy's ability to bounce back from recessions faster than its rivals has long made the dollar a priority for investors when crisis strikes, but as the U.S. struggles to contain the outbreak, many are questioning the recovery powers of the world biggest economy.
""The dollar often benefits in crises because, according to the beliefs of many market participants, the U.S. economy can emerge from crises faster and better than other economies. But this view has been shaken because the U.S. seems to be worse at mastering the pandemic than Europe and Asia,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
The greenback has also lost its ""scarcity premium,"" which rose the fore in the early stages of the corona pandemic following strong non-U.S. demand, but has since eased in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move to increase the supply dollars, Commerzbank added."

At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the ICE (NYSE:ICE) Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 96.215. EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1391, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.2556, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 107.17.

Against this backdrop, the euro has shown strength, with EUR/USD up 0.7% over the last week. Europe as a whole has been seen as handling the virus pandemic well, a spate of small outbreaks notwithstanding, while European Union leaders meet in Brussels seeking to overcome their differences over a proposed stimulus package.
“For this weekend, a political agreement on the basic principles of a European Recovery Fund is still feasible, although the final stamp of approval may need another round of negotiating as it will involve lots of horse-trading, including the negotiations on the European budget,” analysts at ING said in a research note. 
“A deal now would be huge, but any sign of further progress on the remaining contested issues would also still be positive,” ING added.
 Additionally, with some U.S. Covid-19 stimulus measures due to expire at the end of July, Congress is scheduled to debate further measures next week.
Investors are counting on the pressure of upcoming elections in November to push U.S. policymakers into adopting more stimulus measures as the world’s largest economy struggles to contain the epidemic.
Elsewhere, USD/CNY pushed 0.1% higher to 6.9979, as tensions between the two global superpowers continued to sour.
The past week has not been a good one for U.S.-China relations, with the U.S. disputing Chinese claims in the South China Sea and President Donald Trump removing Hong Kong’s special trade status as well as approving initial sanctions against Chinese entities involved in enacting Hong Kong's national security laws.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held onto gains against most currencies as worries that a resurgence in the coronavirus is starting to curb economic activity drew safe-haven flows into the U.S. currency.
One notable exception was the euro, which was well supported by hopes that European officials will agree on fiscal stimulus measures at a meeting starting later on Friday.
Some investors say they are beginning to see troubling signs in recent data that a relentless surge in coronavirus infections is threatening the U.S. economy.
Others point to a widening diplomatic row between the United States and China as reason to avoid risky trades, which should keep the dollar supported for the time being.
""The dollar looks like a good safe haven now because of worries about a return to coronavirus lockdowns,"" said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank.
""But I worry that the dollar will start to lose this status if long-term Treasury yields continue to fall.""
The dollar stood at 107.29 yen  in Asia on Friday, following a 0.3% gain in the previous session.
The euro (EUR=D3) held steady at $1.1389 and was marginally higher against the British pound (EURGBP=) at 90.66 pence.
Sterling  was little changed at $1.2560 on Friday.
The dollar was quoted at 0.9456 Swiss franc , close to the highest since July 3.
For the week, the dollar was on course for gains against the yen, sterling, and the Swiss franc due to safe-haven inflows.
Another jump in coronavirus infections has forced California and other U.S. states to at least partially shut down again, raising fears the economy and labour market will continue to struggle.
In addition, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering banning travel to the United States by all members of the Chinese Communist Party, according to a person familiar with the matter, in a move that would surely put further strain on relations between Washington and Beijing.
This week the United States has ratcheted up the pressure on China in a wide-ranging dispute over civil liberties, access to technology, and territorial claims that some analysts liken to a new cold war.
The yuan was steady in offshore trade  but could face some selling pressure once onshore markets  open as investors grow concerned about how China will retaliate.
The euro will take centre stage later on Friday as European Union leaders will meet in Brussels as they seek to overcome their differences over a proposed stimulus package.

The stakes are high because the coronavirus pandemic has caused considerable damage and some short-term measures supporting the labour market will soon expire.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said on Thursday it will allow some stores to sell food, personal hygiene and other consumer goods in U.S. dollars and will eliminate a 10% tax on the greenback, an effort to rake in more hard currency to purchase goods abroad.
It is one of a list of reforms the Communist government said it would detail and implement in the coming months such as the expansion of the private sector that Economy Minister Alejandro Gil termed necessary to face an ""exceptional situation,"" during an evening broadcast on state television.
Cuba, which monopolizes retail and foreign trade, faced a liquidity crisis even before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered tourism and hit other revenue earners with the implosion of ally Venezuela’s economy and the tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo under President Donald Trump.
Pandemic fallout has worsened shortages of food, medicine and other goods and long lines at retail outlets.
Cuba's economy is forecast to decline nearly 10% this year after stagnating in 2019.
The government opened around 80 ""dollar stores"" late last year selling items such as home appliances, motor bikes and car parts that it buys abroad in tradable currencies. It added used cars earlier this year.
There are currently two currencies, the peso and the convertible peso, which is valued at 24 pesos, circulating in Cuba. Possession of the dollar and other tradable currencies is legal, but they have not been deemed legal tender for purchases for years.
Cubans who patronize the dollar stores need a dollar-denominated bank card from an account opened with tradable currencies, such as the dollar or euro. Tradable currencies may be obtained through offshore remittances or other means such as exchanging local pesos on the street.
The government claims the convertible peso is equal to the dollar, but imported goods, when available, have huge mark-ups as they are purchased in tradable currencies. The peso and convertible peso have no value abroad.
Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Colombia’s Universidad Javeriana Cali, said Cuba was returning to a strategy that worked in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union left its local currency useless and it allowed dollars to circulate freely.

Investing.com – The euro looked set to snap a four-day winning streak on Thursday after the European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged, but the single currency could be set for a rocky end to the week as the EU gets ready to discuss the €750 billion recovery plan.
EUR/USD fell 0.25%, to $1.1381.
The European Central Bank held the rate on its main refinancing operations at 0%, and pledged to roll out more stimulus if the eurozone's economic recovery slowed materially.
The ECB governor continued to call for fiscal support a day ahead of the two-day European Summit, at which EU leaders will discuss the European Commission proposals for a €750 billion recovery plan to help some of the economic bloc's worst-hit members.
“It is important for the European leaders to quickly agree on an ambitious package,” Lagarde said.
Ahead of the talks, however, there are not many betting that the recovery plan, which requires the backing of all 27 EU member states, will be ratified as members disagree over how it should be funded.
The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Austria, known as the ""frugal four,"" have insisted that the funds should be released as loans rather than grants or subsidies.
""Having failed at their videoconference on 19 June to reach agreement on the detail, the leaders' first face-to-face summit since the outbreak of the pandemic might again fall short of sealing a deal, despite new compromise proposals issued last week by EU President Charles Michel,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said.

571,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank kept its emergency monetary stimulus unchanged as the region’s political leaders prepared to haggle over a plan to drag the economy out of the worst slump in living memory.
ECB President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues held their pandemic bond-buying program at 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) and interest rates at -0.5% on Thursday, maintaining the flood of liquidity that has so far calmed markets and kept borrowing costs low.
With coronavirus cases in check for now and lockdowns ending, the pressure has eased on the ECB to provide more monetary support. Still, the outlook remains fragile and much depends on whether European Union leaders can settle their differences over a groundbreaking recovery fund when they meet in Brussels on Friday.
Lagarde will hold a press conference call at 2:30 p.m. Frankfurt time to explain the ECB’s decision and its assessment of the economy.
Policy makers have started to sound slightly less pessimistic about the rebound in recent public appearances. Executive Board members Isabel Schnabel and Luis de Guindos both said the downturn this year could turn out less severe than expected.
They remain wary of another spike of infections though -- a risk underscored by local outbreaks in some regions and a resurgence in the U.S., the world’s largest economy.
Policy makers have warned repeatedly that the path back to pre-crisis levels of activity will be arduous, marked by higher unemployment and bankruptcies that could increase sharply when government aid programs end. Countries will have to work out how to deal with the massive debt burdens they’re building up.
When the European Commission last week projected an economic contraction of almost 9% for the euro area this year, in line with the ECB’s June assessment, it also warned that southern European nations including Italy and Spain face a much bigger hit than northern countries such as Germany.
Questions for Lagarde
Lagarde is likely to be quizzed on whether the ECB expects to spend the entire amount in its pandemic program, and whether it might be increased. Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect another 500 billion euros to be added before the end of this year.
She might also be asked to address the differing views in the Governing Council on the extent to which bond buying should stay weighted toward weaker countries, where the ECB aims to contain yields.
Another set of questions is likely to focus on the role of banks during the recovery. A recent ECB survey showed financial institutions nervous of the economic outlook are preparing to tighten lending standards considerably -- a worrying scenario for policy makers concerned with keeping credit flowing to rekindle growth.
Lagarde may also encounter inquiries about what it would take for the ECB to consider exempting more bank deposits from its negative rates.
Funds parked at the central bank surged in parts of the euro area in June. At the same time, the ECB is already offering generous compensation via its long-term lending program, and -- according to Danske Bank’s Piet Christiansen -- could pay banks as much as 1.6 billion euros this year."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has recovered moderately in early European trade Thursday, reversing earlier losses, but the long-term prognosis for the greenback continues to look less healthy.
At 3:AM ET (0700 GMT), the ICE (NYSE:ICE) Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 96.135. EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.1398, GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.2544, and USD/JPY was flat at 106.92. 
Helping the dollar Thursday has been the continued rise of Covid-19 cases globally, as a flurry of localized outbreaks across the world pushes the overall number of infections to 13.5 million and the death toll to nearly 600,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
China reported a 3.2% growth in its second-quarter GDP year-on-year, a sharp bounce back from the first quarter’s 6.8% contraction, although the yuan weakened slightly as monthly data showed a surprising drop in retail sales that suggested ongoing weakness in consumer demand. 
“Global market trends are increasingly looking like a renewed relative rotation out of the stay-at-home winners (tech, USD) towards reflation trades (Dax, energy, EM FX) and not a global/US growth scare,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“We continue to see EUR/USD as being part of this rotation,” Danske added. “With this in mind (and we have not even begun to price Brexit optimism) we have started to think we can overshoot our short-term 1M and 3M target at 1.15.”
The Dollar Index is expected to weaken about 2% to 94.1 by the second quarter of next year, according to an analyst survey compiled by Bloomberg. 
Additionally, Deutsche Bank’s Trade-Weighted Dollar Index has dropped more than 1% so far this month, Bloomberg reported, and is set to test the trendline in place since 2011, a break of which would be an important signal for dollar bears. 
Looking ahead, the European Central Bank meets later Thursday, but is unlikely to deliver another easing package so soon after June’s moves.
“We expect a repetition of recent comments from various governing council members, thereby striking a cautiously optimistic tone compared to the June projections,” Danske added.
Important U.S. economic data are due later Thursday, with initial jobless claims set to a slowly improving employment situation, while analysts will be watching to see if May's big jump in retail sales can be repeated."

Deutsche Bank’s Trade-Weighted Dollar Index -- a gauge of the currency against the U.S.’s most important trading partners -- has fallen to test the trendline in place since 2011, a break of which would be an important signal for dollar bears. The index has dropped more than 1% so far this month amid weakening demand for havens, an ongoing rally in risk assets and a shift in sentiment toward currencies like the euro and yuan.
Dollar strength has been a feature of much of the last 10 years. The trade-weighted basket climbed over 40% from the 2011 low to its recent peak in March, at the height of coronavirus fears. Yet a growing chorus of commentators is calling for the currency to decline, as the global economy attempts to recover from the impact of the pandemic.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, reversing earlier losses as investors turn towards the safe-haven asset.
Wednesday’s hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine dimmed, with doubts surfacing over the efficacy of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s potential COVID-19 vaccine in immunizing against the disease. Moderna said on Tuesday that all 45 volunteers participating in a study for the vaccine developed high levels of virus-killing antibodies.
ANZ analysts still remained optimistic, saying in a note, ""Results like this are encouraging... without a vaccine, devastating health impacts will continue, with significant economic implications. The stakes couldn't be higher.""
But COVID-19 continues its rampage globally, with over 13.5 million cases and almost 600,000 death as of July 16, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump privately ruled out further sanctions against Chinese entities involved in enacting Hong Kong’s national security laws on Wednesday, attempting to diffuse escalating U.S.-China tensions.
But tensions remain in place, with China threatening to retaliate after Trump also stripped Hong Kong of its special trading privileges and signed an executive order for initial sanctions on Tuesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.01% to 96.032 by 10:12 PM ET (3:12 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.01% to 106.94.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.05% to 6.9923. China reported a 3.2% growth in its second-quarter GDP year-on-year, with the country dodging a recession amid COVID-19’s economic impact. Data on June factory output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment was also released earlier in the day.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Thursday and riskier currencies found support on signs of progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine, even as the virus itself continues to spread and investors fret over simmering Sino-U.S. tensions.
The growth-sensitive Australian dollar  held close to 70 cents and near a month high. The euro (EUR=) hovered just below a four-month top touched overnight on hopes that European leaders can agree on a recovery fund.
The mood pushed the safe-haven Swiss franc  half a percent lower overnight and it lifted the crude price and oil exporters' currencies along with it. The Norwegian krone  rose to a one-month high of 9.2715 per dollar and the Canadian dollar  advanced to a week high of 1.1305 on the greenback. [O/R]
Moves in Asian morning trade were small as markets waited for Chinese growth data due around 0200 GMT for the latest update on the recovery of the world's second-largest economy.
Both the euro and the Aussie are now testing key resistance levels, ANZ analysts said, with sentiment favouring the upside after the positive early results from a test of U.S. company  Moderna 's (O:MRNA) experimental vaccine.
Study results showed all 45 healthy volunteers given doses of the Moderna vaccine had high levels of virus-killing antibodies, although the experimental drug's efficacy in stopping the virus is not yet clear.
""Results like this are encouraging,"" the ANZ analysts said in a note. ""Without a vaccine, devastating health impacts will continue, with significant economic implications. The stakes couldn't be higher.""
The Australian dollar last sat at $0.7000 and the euro at $1.1415. The New Zealand dollar  spent the morning either side of flat and last bought $0.6564.
Gains were capped by worries about surging infections across the United States where new cases are rising by about 60,000 per day.
Global tension also remains elevated, with Britain ordering equipment from China's Huawei be purged from its communications network by 2027, prompting a warning from Beijing, and China and the U.S. at loggerheads over issues from trade to technology.
President Donald Trump has not ruled out additional sanctions on top Chinese officials over Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong, a White House spokesman said on Tuesday. 
Sterling  held steady at $1.2591 and the yen  was very marginally firmer at 106.86 per dollar.
Investors' focus in the Asian day is on second-quarter GDP data from China, along with June factory output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.
A Reuters poll found analysts expect China to report 2.5% growth, reversing a 6.8% first-quarter decline driven by the pandemic.
Markets also expect to see unemployment on the rise in Australia, and the Aussie could come under pressure if the jobless rate turns out worse than the 7.4% consensus expectation. Data is due at 0130 GMT.
All 30 analysts polled by Reuters see the Bank of Korea keeping rates unchanged at 0.50% around 0100 GMT, while it is a closer call in Indonesia where the rupiah has been on a slide leading in to Thursday's central bank meeting.
Fourteen of 26 analysts see BI cutting rates by 25 basis points, with a decision due around 0700 GMT.
The rupiah  has been among the worst performing currencies in Asia this week, falling about 0.6% against the dollar.

Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar is down 0.6% this week so far and last sat at 96.019, just above a one-month low struck overnight.

Investing.com – The loonie gained on the dollar on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada kept its key interest rate unchanged and said the slump in the economy was not as bad as feared.
USD/CAD fell 0.73% to C$1.3512, its lowest in since July 9.
The Bank of Canada (BoC) kept its benchmark interest rate at the effective lower bound of 0.25% and vowed to keep rates unchanged until at least 2023.
In a boost to hopes of a robust recovery, the central bank said recent data had suggested the economy had bottomed in April.
""We now estimate that the economy contracted by about 15 percent in the first half of this year,"" the central bank said in its monetary policy statement. ""As deep as this is, it suggests the economy has avoided the most dire scenarios we laid out in the April MPR. In the third quarter, we expect to continue to see a strong rebound in jobs and output.""
The BoC did, however, its 2022 growth outlook, indicating that ""permanent scarring from the COVID-19 pandemic (less investment, less immigration, permanent business closures) will reduce the economy’s long-term productive capacity by 4%,"" RBC said.
The central bank also pledged to continue to purchase bonds in an effort to keep rates low across the yield curve and support lending activity.
""The bank will continue its large-scale asset purchase program at a pace of ""at least $5 billion per week of government of Canada bonds,"" said BoC governor Tiff Macklem.
Beyond monetary policy, the loonie was also supported by a rise in oil prices and upbeat Canadian manufacturing data.
Manufacturing sales in Canada rose by 10.7% in May, beating expectations for a 9.5% increase.
Manufacturing could likely build on the gains made in May as early reports for June - improvements in the Canada manufacturing PMI and a jump in manufacturing hours worked -  have been a ""little more positive,"" RBC added."

Investing.com - The euro has been in demand in early European trade Wednesday, hitting a four-month high after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard hinted at a need for an even easier monetary policy in the U.S.
The dollar also suffered more broadly from a rise in risk appetite after positive test data for one of the lead candidates for a Covid-19 vaccine late, published late on Tuesday.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1408, after reaching its highest level since March 10 at $1.1423 earlier in the session. EUR/GBP dropped 0.2% to 0.9060, with sterling helped by stronger than expected inflation figures in June, but the euro had posted a two-week high of 0.9112 late Tuesday.
Additionally, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 96.093, GBP/USD gained 0.4% to 1.2595 and USD/JPY was flat at 107.23. 
The single currency has benefited of late--it’s up 1.3% against the dollar over the last month--from the perception that the region has handled the Covid-19 crisis better than most.
""Germany, France and Italy have all taken severe lockdown steps and as a result the coronavirus now appears to be under control. The economy could be gradually recovering,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch manager of  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank and Trust, to Reuters.
The economic picture still is grim, however. Only last week, the European Commission downgraded its outlook for the EU economy, saying it would now contract by 8.3% in 2020. However, recent confidence data have tended upward, with Tuesday’s German ZEW survey pointing to continued optimism over the next six months.
Looking ahead, “the forthcoming ECB meeting should not change much, with the discussion/progress on an EU Recovery Fund being a more important short-term driver for the EUR/USD,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
There still remain doubts about whether the EU leaders will reach agreement on a 750-billion-euro pandemic recovery fund at this week's summit, amid resistance from more frugal member states.
That said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who now holds the presidency of the EU Council, was in no doubt of the need of the fund and the importance of its size.
""Because the task is enormous, the answer must also be huge,"" she said Monday, after hosting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte for talks.
""It must be particularly powerful in order to signal clearly that Europe wants to hold together in this difficult time. There is a political dimension to it"".
Any potential progress on the recovery fund at the EU summit “should translate into support for EUR/USD for the remainder of the week, with the ECB meeting playing second fiddle,” ING added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro rose to a four-month high against the dollar on Wednesday on hopes European Union leaders may agree on stimulus and deepening fiscal integration to shield the economy from the pandemic.
The dollar was on the defensive, particularly against other growth-leveraged currencies such as the Australian dollar, following an uptick in U.S. inflation and news of progress in vaccine development for COVID-19.
The euro rose to $1.1400 (EUR=), after reaching its highest level since March 10 at $1.1423 earlier in the trade. 
Against the yen, the common currency hit one-month high of 122.47 (EURJPY=) while it had scaled a two-week high of $0.91125 British pound the previous day and last stood at 90.690 pence (EURGBP=D4).
""Germany, France and Italy have all taken severe lockdown steps and as a result the coronavirus now appears to be under control. The economy could be gradually recovering,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch manager of  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank and Trust.
The euro has been helped by hopes the European Union could agree at its summit later this week on a rescue financing package that will limit the economic damage to the bloc from the coronavirus pandemic.
The euro's strength helped to push the dollar index (=USD) to one-month low at 96.056. The index last stood at 96.225.
The dollar extended losses on Tuesday after U.S. consumer prices rebounded 0.6% month-on-month, the most in nearly eight years, in June, easing worries about deflationary pressures from the economic downturn. 
Further boosting investors' risk appetite,  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) experimental vaccine for COVID-19 showed it was safe and provoked immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.
Against that backdrop, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar rose 0.24% to $0.6992 .
Sterling, however, underperformed after data showed Britain's economy was recovering more slowly than forecast.
Gross domestic product rose by 1.8% in May after falling by a record 20.8% in April, well below forecasts in a Reuters poll.
The pound last traded at $1.2567 . 
The yen stood at 107.28 yen per dollar , little changed after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady and maintained its stance that the economy would gradually recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The market has so far taken the latest heightening in U.S.-China tensions in its stride.
President Donald Trump signed legislation and an executive order to hold China ""accountable"" for the national security law it imposed on Hong Kong.
Trump also signed a bill approved by the Congress to penalise banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the new security law.
In response, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday it will impose retaliatory sanctions on U.S. individuals and entities.
""While there are increasing doubts on whether Hong Kong will remain an open market, investors think this is a very long-term issue,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
Diplomatic battles between the two big powers have intensified on several other fronts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, military operations in the South China Sea and trade.
The onshore yuan ticked up 0.05% to 7.0040 per dollar  
The Canadian dollar bounced back from a two-week low, changing hands at C$1.3604 per U.S. dollar , despite the prospect of travel restrictions between Canada and the United States being extended.
The Canadian central bank is expected to leave rates on hold at a policy announcement on Wednesday, with investors likely to focus on the bank's outlook for the economy and potential guidance on its bond-buying program.

Investing.com – The euro rose to more than one-month highs against the dollar on Tuesday, and may likely heap further misery on the greenback as Europe appears to have a better handle on containing the coronavirus outbreak than the U.S. does, setting it up for a faster recovery.
The spread of the virus across major European countries is more contained even after recent lockdown measures were lifted, while in the U.S., some states are rolling back reopening measures.
This is creating the ""potential for cyclical momentum to diverge in the near-term between the U.S. and eurozone economies,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said. ""If the eurozone recovery is allowed to continue without re-imposing lockdown measures, it could boost the relative attractiveness of the euro over the U.S. dollar.""
Expectations are already running high that the eurozone is set for a solid economic recovery.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said that investors should position themselves for PMI upside in the eurozone, forecasting the composite PMI for new orders to rise from 47 in June to 58 by September.
The strong start to the week for the euro comes ahead of the European Central Bank's meeting and the European Summit later this week.
The ECB meeting, however, will likely be a non-event as no policy changes are expected. ""The meeting should be more about testing [ECB] President Christine Lagarde's communication skills rather than any new measures,"" ING said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus and the end-2020 Brexit deadline have left UK firms facing historic uncertainties, prompting many to find more flexible ways to protect their foreign exchange exposure -- even if these come at a higher initial cost.
The pandemic is expected to cause Britain's biggest economic contraction in 300 years and swell unemployment, debt and corporate bankruptcies. An added risk is that Britain could cast off from the European Union next year without having agreed any trade deals.
All of that makes it hard to forecast future cash flows, which in turn complicates the normal practice of using forward contracts to hedge foreign currency risks. 
""What we're seeing more and more is that clients don't have confidence in their forecasts,"" said Jonathan Pryor, head of corporate foreign exchange at Investec, who advises clients across a range of sectors with international exposure, from consumer goods to energy.
""Fundamentally they still know that they need to hedge (so) there is a bracket of option products that some clients are deeming more appropriate to use than forwards ... due to COVID-19 demand fluctuations.""
Most companies will hedge their foreign currency exposures to minimise potential volatility. 
Forwards allow holders to lock in a future exchange rate with minimal costs up front. But the contracts are binding and currency swings can leave holders out of pocket.
That is making currency options, which give the buyer the right -- but not the obligation -- to buy or sell a currency at a specified exchange rate on or by a given date, more appealing. 
An option does requires an up front premium but its price is set, whereas forward contract-holders must put up more collateral -- known as a margin call -- if exchange rates deviate from the 'strike' price.
That's what happened in March: as FX volatility soared to record highs above 16% <.DBCVIX>, the amount of collateral that companies had to pay rose, inflicting heavy losses and sometimes, bankruptcy.
(Graphic: Currency volatility drifts lower after pandemic-led spike, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpordqdvd/Pasted%20image%201594633853199.png) 
Meanwhile, if revenues fail to materialise, companies can find themselves paying for hedges they don't need. 
Barry McCarthy, chief executive at hedging service provider Assure Hedge, estimated half the hedging positions held by UK exporters turned loss-making when COVID-19 hit.
""Many firms did get hurt that had traditional FX forwards in place and the reason they got hurt is that many of their (business) deals were cancelled and so they didn't get their income,"" McCarthy said.
Coronavirus impacts companies everywhere but the Brexit factor has kept sterling implied volatility -- expected fluctuations measured by options costs -- well above that of peers, including the euro and yen. 
(Graphic: Pound vs. G10 fx volatility, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvealdwvr/Pasted%20image%201594633942699.png) 
SHORT-TERM
The hedging strategy shift is reflected in sterling/dollar option volumes, which increased 18% year-on-year in June and by 26% versus May, according to data from CME, the world's largest financial derivatives exchange.
Average daily traded volumes in FX forward contracts meanwhile decreased by 20% year-on-year in May, says CLS, a major settler of trades in the foreign exchange market.
Hedging providers said even companies that hedge years in advance are now choosing to buy three- to six-month sterling/dollar and euro/sterling options. 
""The concept of optionality is now being much more understood and adopted by the mainstream SMEs (small- to medium-sized enterprises),"" McCarthy added.
Hedging specialist Abacus FX said one of its client, a London-based tour operator, started using options because it was so hard to predict what the next tourist season would be like. 
""In the past we simply used forward contracts to protect our margins,"" an executive at the tour company said in emailed comments, asking that it not be named. 
But the COVID crisis prompted it ""to integrate alternative and less traditional products into our hedging.""

Investing.com - The dollar has strengthened in early European trade Monday, with investors seeking out this safe haven after the Covid-19 outbreak forced the biggest reversal of U.S. economic reopening to date and the U.S. and China squared off over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 96.547. USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.31. 
The number of Covid-19 cases globally has now passed the 13 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University data, jumping by one million cases over the last five days.
This has resulted in demand for the dollar as hopes of a quick economic recovery fall, with some countries, including the U.S., re-imposing lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus.
Adding to demand for the greenback Tuesday has been the fresh tensions between the U.S. and China, the two global superpowers, this time over China’s ambitions in the South China Sea.
Sterling sold off Tuesday, not helped by signs of a very tepid recovery from the Covid-19 crisis in May after lockdown restrictions began to ease.
Gross domestic product rose by just 1.8% in May after slumping by a record 20.3% in April, Britain's first full month of lockdown. This was a smaller rise than the average 5.5% increase widely expected.
GBP/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2538, while EUR/GBP pushed 0.2% higher to 0.9048.
The euro has generally been in demand of late, climbing 0.7% against the dollar this week, trading just below a one-month high reached on Monday.
The single currency is “consolidating its role as the most overbought currency in the G10 ahead of a busy period in the eurozone, with the European Central Bank meeting and the EU summit on the Recovery Fund possibly revamping EUR volatility in the coming days,” said Francesco Pesole, FX Strategist at ING, in a research note.
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1346, despite the generally positive dollar move.
Elsewhere, the Polish central bank holds a meeting later Tuesday, but is not expected to change its reference rate so soon after the presidential election.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Tuesday morning in Asia, with investors turning to the safe-haven asset as COVID-19 cases continue their relentless climb and U.S.-China tensions simmer.
The number of COVID-19 cases globally passed the 13 million mark as of July 14, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The dollar got an additional boost as investor hopes of a quick economic recovery diminished further, with some countries re-imposing lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus.
“The focus has shifted to whether or not the next round of coronavirus lockdowns will be large enough to damage economic growth,” Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities, told Reuters.
Adding to the list of recent differences between the U.S. and China over trade and Hong Kong’s national security laws, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo issued a statement on Monday rejecting Chinese claims in the South China Sea. Pompeo’s statement came on the back of China’s recent military exercises in the contested waters around the South China Sea’s Paracel Islands.
China hit back on Tuesday morning, rejecting the U.S. statement and calling Pompeo’s accusations of China bullying its neighbors “completely unjustified”.
The two other issues also threaten to sour relations between the two countries.
“The Hong Kong problem could potentially lead to new trade friction. Negative developments on either front could cause stocks to adjust lower and drive some safe-haven flows to the dollar and the yen,” Ishikawa added.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.03% to 96.537 by 9:36 AM ET (2:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.06% to 107.19 while the USD/CNY pair jumped 0.20% to 7.0099.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.04% to 0.6942, reversing its earlier losses. The AUD has taken a hit as some Australian states joined the city of Melbourne in re-imposing lockdown measures. Meanwhile, the NZD/USD pair slid 0.08% to 0.6534.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was hemmed into narrow ranges against most currencies on Tuesday as renewed concerns about diplomatic tension between the United States and China and rising coronavirus cases put a dent in risk appetite.
The euro held onto gains against the greenback and the pound as investors await data on German investor sentiment to help gauge the pace of Europe's recovery from the health crisis.
Currency trading has thinned out as a recent resurgence of novel coronavirus infections has caused some areas to place new restrictions on business activity. 
Markets now face an additional threat from tit-for-tat retaliation between Washington and Beijing over access to U.S. financial markets, civil liberties in Hong Kong, and territorial claims in the South China Sea.
""The focus has shifted to whether or not the next round of coronavirus lockdowns will be large enough to damage economic growth,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities .
""The Hong Kong problem could potentially lead to new trade friction. Negative developments on either front could cause stocks to adjust lower, and drive some safe-haven flows to the dollar and the yen.""
The dollar stood at 107.35 yen  on Tuesday in Asia following a 0.4% gain in the previous session.
The dollar traded at 0.9419 Swiss franc  after eking out three consecutive sessions of narrow gains.
The euro (EUR=) was quoted at $1.1346, resting below a one-month high reached on Monday. The common currency traded at 90.36 pence (EURGBP=), holding onto a 0.9% gain from the previous session.
The United States and China are waging diplomatic battles on several fronts that have the potential to unsettle financial markets.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration plans to soon scrap a 2013 agreement between U.S. and Chinese auditing authorities, a senior State Department official told Reuters.
This move could foreshadow a broader crackdown on Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock markets that are under fire for sidestepping U.S. disclosure rules.
In addition, the United States has hardened its stance against China's claims in the South China Sea and is taking steps to end Hong Kong's special legal status in protest against Beijing's security law for the former British colony.
The opening of onshore trade in the yuan  will be closely scrutinised on Tuesday to see if China's currency can continue its recent rally.
However, traders are likely to avoid big positions before the release this week of data on Chinese gross domestic product, retail sales, industrial output, and exports. 
Demand for riskier assets is likely to take a hit after California, the most populous U.S. state, placed new restrictions on businesses as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations soared.
Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar  was little changed at $0.6935. Sentiment for the Aussie has taken a hit as some Australian states also re-impose coronavirus restrictions.
The New Zealand dollar  fell slightly to $0.6530.

The Antipodean currencies are considered barometers of risk because of their close ties to commodities and China's economy.

Aides at the White House and State department had weighed the possibility of limiting Hong Kong banks’ access to U.S. dollars as a way of striking back at Beijing, Bloomberg News reported last week. But they dropped the idea after advocates could not gather enough support, with those against the move concerned that it would be difficult to implement and could end up hurting the U.S., according to one of the people.
Tensions between the U.S. and China have flared over issues ranging from the competition for military supremacy in the South China Sea to the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Early Monday, Beijing announced sanctions against U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz -- a largely symbolic move after the U.S. sanctioned a top member of China’s ruling Communist Party and three other officials over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
Beijing has repeatedly accused Washington of inappropriately interfering in China’s internal affairs.
“The president is not in a good mood about China,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday in a Fox News interview.
Hours later, the Trump administration rejected China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, reversing a previous policy of not taking sides in regional disputes.
The White House referred questions to the National Security Council which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com – The euro jumped sharply against the dollar on Monday, and is likely set for a bumpy ride over the next few days ahead of key developments in the European Union later this week.
EUR/USD rose 0.69%, to $1.1369.
The euro is likely to face a volatile week, ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday and an EU summit on Friday, ING said.
It widely expected that the European Central Bank will leave its key benchmark rate unchanged on Thursday, likely drawing added attention to ECB President Christine Lagarde's speech, which could provide clues about future policy actions, ING added.
The ECB meeting, however, could be shadowed by Friday's EU summit when the bloc's leaders will debate the European Commission's coronavirus recovery plan, which requires the backing of the EU's 27 member states, making compromise difficult.
Ahead of Friday's meeting, Germany and Italy have backed a compromise plan for EU’s €750 billion coronavirus recovery fund in an effort to appease bloc members who have voiced concerns over how to finance the stimulus.
The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Austria, known as the ""frugal four,"" have insisted that the funds should be released as loans rather than grants or subsidies.
The strong start to the week for the euro comes as data showed ongoing investor appetite for the single currency.
The value of euro net longs positions jumped to a two week high of around 103,600 contracts during the week ended on July 7, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. That was up from 99,000 the prior week."
589,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Already the world’s reserve currency, the dollar’s hold over the world of foreign exchange has grown even stronger amid the Covid-19 crisis.
The pandemic has served as a reminder that the greenback remains the haven of choice when uncertainty takes over, and how the U.S. currency moves -- regardless of direction -- is the single most important determinant of sentiment across asset classes these days.
While investors have begun to factor in regional data trends in daily trading decisions, the U.S. currency’s medium-term prospects are still key to their longer-term strategies.
The euro-pound exchange rate is a prime example. Its realized volatility stands almost 200 basis points below the five-year average, showing how ranges have tightened after the market turmoil in March. That’s despite Brexit uncertainties being back in focus and the upcoming European Central Bank meeting and European Union summit now entering the market’s radar.
That suggests that the pair’s behavior has been more under the influence of global risk trends as reflected by the dollar than factors closer home.
The link between sterling and emerging-market currencies also illustrates the greenback’s sway. The pound’s correlation with an EM currency gauge hit a record in June, mainly due to the dollar’s own correlation with risk sentiment.
Just how important the dollar’s direction has become this year is also depicted in its recent range against the yen. The Japanese currency also serves as a haven currency and its lockstep dance with the greenback showcases the latter’s heightened correlation with risk bias.
On a weekly basis, the dollar-yen range hasn’t been this tight since February as realized volatility stands at the lower end of its trading band since 2014.
American exceptionalism has become one of the market’s main narratives once again and it can be clearly shown by the so-called volatility term structures of the yen, the pound and the Swiss franc. These curves show the level of hedging costs these currencies hold against the greenback across tenors.
There is a clear spike in six-month options, which capture the U.S. presidential elections in November as well as the risk of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic toward year-end.
Yet, there are signs that the dollar could lose its influence over the longer term. Options that pay out on a stronger greenback due to risk hedging are in a steady drop from this year’s highs. That may be reflecting a shift in views -- with traders placing increasing focus on the U.S. response to the pandemic and what that means for growth differentials with other major economies and ultimately the country’s market dominance.

590,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Lebanese pound has strengthened against the U.S. dollar on the informal market this month, partly thanks to travellers bringing in scarce dollars since the airport reopened, traders said.
Dollars traded at around 7,300 Lebanese pounds on Monday, two exchange dealers said, compared with the rate of close to 10,000 pounds/dollar late last month that triggered a string of protests.
A crippling financial meltdown, exacerbated by coronavirus restrictions, has slashed the value of the local currency this year, sending prices and poverty rates soaring.
Currency dealers told Reuters demand for the greenback eased as travellers brought dollars with them when the airport re-opened on July 1 after months of lockdown. 
Other market participants also cited the government's pledge to subsidise around 300 essential food items and basic goods, and support importers and manufacturers of those items and goods. 
The central bank said last week it would provide them with foreign currency at a fixed rate of 3,900 Lebanese pounds per dollar.
""With the announcement of the food basket and the arrival of fresh money from abroad ... all cause a drop, but there are no fundamentals,"" said Hani Bohsali, head of the syndicate of foodstuffs importers. ""Even the drop could be speculative.""
The central bank has sought to stabilise the rate at exchange houses by setting a unified rate with them each day, which on Monday was announced at 3,850/3900 pounds for buying and selling. Still, importers and others have said it was nearly impossible to secure dollars at those rates.

At Monday's rate on the informal market, the pound was still much weaker than an official peg of 1,507.5 - in place since 1997 and now only available for imports of fuel, wheat and medicine.

Investing.com - The dollar has weakened in early European trade Monday, with investors turning to risk-sensitive currencies amid optimism over the upcoming earnings season even as the Covid-19 outbreak rages on.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 96.448, not far from the June trough of 95.714. EUR/USD gained 0.2% to 1.1324, GBP/USD was up 0.2% at 1.2650, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.95. 
The U.S. corporate earning season will start this week, and this is expected to offer more evidence of a recovery, admittedly from beaten down levels. The key question will be whether the valuations currently priced in are supported by the outlooks given by companies.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has become a little more optimistic on earnings prospects for the S&P 500 Index this year, lifting its baseline forecast for S&P 500 earnings per share in 2020 to $115, up from a prior estimate of $110.
This is despite the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus. The World Health Organization reported a record 230,370 new cases in 24 hours on Sunday. Roughly a quarter of these new cases are in the U.S., with the state of Florida reporting more new cases in 24 hours than hard-hit New York did in April.
Also helping the euro push higher against the dollar Monday was the decision of Fitch rating agency late Friday to confirm Italy's credit rating, with a stable outlook. 
That said, these moves have been limited, and it’s difficult to see the catalyst for sharp moves in the dollar in the near term.
“The ongoing rise in Covid-19 cases in the U.S. is preventing the market from turning bullish on risk (thus preventing a USD sell-off), while the put from the Federal Reserve and other central banks to do more if the situation warrants it prevents a sharp risk-off environment,” said ING, in a note to clients.
EUR/USD continues to trade around the 1.13 level which has transformed into a gravity line over the past month, ING added.
“This is likely to hold for now, with limited near term catalysts that would point to a break in the EUR/USD range trend and the July ECB meeting … unlikely to be a trigger point.”
Elsewhere, the result of Poland's knife-edge presidential election was still uncertain, with an Ipsos survey showing incumbent Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, winning 51.0% of the vote.
“If Duda wins another term, we expect little or no change in either economic policies or relations with the EU,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“Over time, [Rafal] Trzaskowski may be able to seed a more conciliatory line towards the EU, although for EUR/PLN spot, the current Euroskeptic politics have not been persistent in driving moves,” added Danske.
At 3:05 AM ET, EUR/PLN traded 0.1% higher at 4.4624.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged down in Asian trade on Monday as investors looked to looming economic data from around the world and U.S. corporate earnings to gauge whether the markets' guarded optimism on the economic outlook is justified.
The greenback had ended its third week of losses on Friday as investors bought into risk-sensitive currencies on bets that the worst of the pandemic's sweeping impact was over.
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies slipped 0.2% in early Monday trade to 96.452 (=USD).
U.S. coronavirus cases surged over the weekend, as Florida reported an increase of more than 15,000 new cases in 24 hours, a record for any state, surpassing a peak hit in New York in April. [nL2N2EJ04T]
""Rising coronavirus cases are not positive but at the moment, markets seem to think that there is still some distance to a situation where an overflow of the medical system will force them to put restrictions on the economy,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Hopes for development of drugs and vaccines for the disease are also supporting risk sentiment as do economic indicators that have so far shown a recovery from lockdowns.
""We've seen a rapid rebound after a rapid decline in various economic data. But looking ahead, the improvement could slow or we could even seen a deterioration given the second round of infections,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
A weekly gauge of consumer confidence in Australia has dropped after a spike in infections in Melbourne and that could be echoed in the United States, where the magnitude of the outbreak is much larger, he noted.
U.S. consumer inflation figures for June are due on Tuesday while retail sales, a key gauge of consumption, are released on Thursday.
The U.S. corporate earning season will start this week, providing another window to assess the scale of the damage as well as the recovery, from the pandemic.
""I expect stock markets to remain firm and the dollar to slightly weaken, but everybody is getting nervous about a possible correction,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of FX Sales at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Bank and Trust's Tokyo Branch. 
The euro rose 0.25% to $1.1329 (EUR=), maintaining its slow uptrend since late last month.
Looming large for the common currency was a planned EU summit on July 17-18, where leaders need to bridge gaps on long-term budget and economic stimulus plans.
European Council President Charles Michel proposed a smaller joint EU budget for 2021-27 than previously envisaged to placate thrifty countries in the north. [nL8N2EH1E6]
The British pound also gained 0.3% to $1.2656 , edging near its three-week high of $1.2668 touched last week. 
The Australian dollar added 0.3% to $0.6969 .
The dollar also lost small ground against the safe-haven yen, to 106.83 yen , staying near two-week lows of 106.635 set on Friday.
Investors also looked to China, where economic recovery is gaining momentum as the outbreak has largely been contained. 
China will release its June trade data on Tuesday and a batch of other data, including second quarter GDP, on Thursday.
The Chinese yuan gained 0.15% to 6.9987 per dollar  in early trade.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, with investors cautiously bullish over the upcoming week of earnings and economic data even as the number of COVID-19 patients shows no sign of slowing down.
Florida reported over 15,000 new cases in 24 hours on Sunday, the highest number in any state since records started. Of the almost 12.9 million global cases, over 3.3 million are in the U.S. as of July 13, according to Johns Hopkins University.

594,"<span>Jul 12, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Hong Kong dollar is suddenly looking vulnerable, after weeks of trading at the strong end of its band against the greenback.
Late on Friday, the currency weakened rapidly in its biggest drop since mid-June, when the exchange rate was buffeted by Beijing’s decision to impose laws curbing dissent in the city. The decline was unexpected, given persistent inflows into the former British colony, but may have been triggered by concern about possible financial sanctions and a narrowing of the yield gap between the Hong Kong and U.S. dollars.
Traders are watching the Hong Kong dollar closely for any signs of outflows from the former British colony amid worsening U.S.-China tensions and doubts over the city’s future as a financial hub. Over the weekend almost 600,000 residents defied the new security law to vote in primaries held by pro-democracy opposition parties, even after a government minister suggested that participating could run afoul of the law.
“The depreciation might be an early sign of concerns over the U.S.’s financial sanctions as supportive factors such as large listings and dividend payments may start to cool down later in July,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “The narrower rate spread with the greenback is also hurting the Hong Kong dollar, which may stay away from the strong end and weaken to 7.7550 in the near term.”
The Hong Kong dollar was 0.01% stronger as of 8:48 a.m. local time on Monday, after falling to as low as 7.7527 per greenback in late trading at the end of last week.
There is so far little evidence that traders are betting on sustained weakness. The Hong Kong dollar’s three-month risk reversal, a gauge of bearishness in the options market, is close to the lowest level since August despite a small uptick on Friday. The currency’s forward points of the same tenor are near a four-month low, reflecting limited concerns on depreciation or liquidity tightness.
The gap between the Hong Kong dollar’s one-month Hibor and the borrowing costs on the greenback was last at 22 basis points, close to the 20 basis point level which OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. has said would make the long carry trade unattractive.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority sold HK$48.7 billion ($6.3 billion) last week alone to keep the currency from strengthening beyond its trading band. That was despite news some Trump aides are considering ways to undermine the peg mechanism, according to people familiar with the matter.
Friday’s loss also came after the Hang Seng Index fell 1.8%, paring its gain for the week to 1.4%.

595,"<span>Jul 12, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
Faced with the prospect of restricted access to U.S. dollars, China’s answer is to get more people to use its own currency instead.
The increasing spillover of Sino-American tensions into the financial sphere has ignited a fresh push by China to promote the global use of the yuan. A growing number of government officials and influential market watchers have in recent weeks urged greater efforts on the endeavor, which gained renewed significance after China’s new Hong Kong security law triggered the threat of retaliation from Washington.
While such drastic action is far from being implemented by the U.S. -- and could potentially do major damage to American interests and the entire global financial system -- the risks alone have raised alarm bells. With almost a trillion dollars in offshore bonds and loans and $1.1 trillion in state-owned bank liabilities, access to the greenback is vital for Chinese companies and lenders.
“Yuan internationalization morphed from a desirable to an indispensable thing for Beijing,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China and north Asia at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc. “China needs to find a replacement for the dollar amid the political uncertainty, otherwise the nation will see financial risks.”
Similar calls for moving away from the dollar followed the 2007-09 financial crisis. While China over the years made some progress -- promoting offshore yuan trading, winning official reserve-currency status from the International Monetary Fund and launching commodity contracts priced in yuan -- the renminbi is a small player on the global stage.
The yuan’s share in global payments and central bank reserves remains low, at about 2%. And while a steady opening of China’s financial markets to overseas investors has lured inflows, foreign ownership of mainland stocks and bonds is relatively minor.
Among the recent voices expressing urgency in China:
Zhou Yongkun, an official at the People’s Bank of China, said last week that the country will introduce direct trading between the yuan and additional currencies, without specifying which ones.
To accelerate reaching a par with counterparts such as the yen or euro, China would need to pull down its capital controls, which were tightened in the wake of a messy devaluation in 2015. But that would raise the risk of destabilizing outflows. China could alternatively expand imports and run persistent current-account deficits -- as the U.S. does -- to generate a pool of yuan balances overseas. That, too, would require a hard-to-envision policy shift.
“Yuan globalization is largely hinged on convertibility under capital account -- which China is not yet ready for,” said Yu Yongding, a former adviser to the People’s Bank of China. “China is facing a severe challenge of a series of potential U.S. financial sanctions and we can’t even rule out the possibility that they may freeze China financial assets one day. I believe regulators have a contingency plan.”
What’s unclear is how hard the Trump administration is prepared to push. Moves to curb a government pension fund from investing in Chinese stocks are already under way, along with tighter scrutiny of Chinese companies’ listings on American exchanges. But systematically restricting access of the world’s second-largest economy to dollar funding and transactions would be a step unprecedented since the U.S. first tolerated unregulated use of its currency abroad in the 1960s.
Chinese regulators are building the China International Payment System to settle transactions outside the dollar-based platforms where the U.S. holds sway. Hong Kong, which supplies around half of the world’s offshore yuan liquidity, is also aiming to become a more prominent yuan trading center.
Hong Kong regulators last month kicked off the Wealth Management Connect, which will allow cross-border investments among residents of Hong Kong, Macau and southern China. The move has implications including boosting the yuan’s international use and testing capital-account opening, analysts have said.
Stronger steps could include China insisting on paying for some imports in yuan, making direct investments abroad in yuan and providing loans in renminbi -- the currency’s official name. Still, the fact that over half of Hong Kong bank deposits are denominated in foreign currencies (led by the U.S. dollar) and Chinese banks themselves have about $747 billion in foreign-exchange deposits speaks to enduring demand in greater China for greenbacks.
“It’s not possible for China to have a significantly internationalized currency as things stand” now, said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and author of “Red Flags: Why Xi’s China Is in Jeopardy.”
With a global yuan still years or decades away, what’s left to China meantime could be the threat of countermeasures, and highlighting the global implications of the most extreme U.S. action. Chinese banks and offshore bonds have after all become key cogs in the world system.
“Cutting off the banking system’s U.S. dollar funding would be a serious blow -- for this reason, I don’t expect it to happen” to mainland China, said Magnus.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Friday, helped by its safe haven status as coronavirus cases continued to surge in the United States and unemployment data pointed to a slow recovery in the labor market.
At 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.3% at 96.915. GBP/USD was down 0.2% at 1.2580, while USD/JPY was down 0.3% at 106.84. 
The number of coronavirus cases in the U.S., the world’s economic engine, continues to grow, with more than 60,000 new Covid-19 infections reported on Thursday.
With populous states like California, Florida and Texas recently breaking records, and having to restart some social distancing measures, hopes are fading for an aggressive economic revival.
The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits dropped more than expected last week, data showed Thursday, but the figure remained above one million for the 16th straight week. Continuing claims also remained above 18 million, suggesting the labor market would take years to recover from the pandemic.
However, while the dollar gained against the euro Friday--EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1263--it’s still a little lower against the single currency year to date. And further losses look likely.
“Recent virus problems in the U.S. present a material risk to the U.S. recovery in the coming months, whereas the euro area service sector recovery is set to continue barring any second virus waves during the European holiday season,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Danske Bank calls for EUR/USD to reach 1.15 on a one-three month time frame.
Adding to the sense of a European recovery, French industrial production increased sharply in May, up 19.6%, as lockdowns were eased and factories reopened.
Attention will now turn to the meeting of the EU leaders next week, to see if there can be agreement allowing the proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund to be distributed to the economies hit hardest by Covid-19 in the region, although also of interest with be Fitch's review of its credit rating for Italy.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's national security law for Hong Kong and moves by the United States to begin withdrawing privileges enjoyed by the city under U.S. law have unsettled investors.
They have also raised fears about the stability of the Hong Kong dollar's (HKD) 36-year old peg to its U.S. counterpart, prompting local officials to issue several reassurances.
HOW THE PEG WORKS
The HKD is pegged in a narrow range of 7.75-7.85 to the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) buys and sells the currency at either limit to maintain the range. Buying HKD boosts it by reducing its availability and raises the costs of betting against the currency. Sales do the opposite.
The HKMA has sold HK$106 billion ($13.68 billion) so far this year to keep a strengthening Hong Kong dollar within this range, according to Reuters' calculations.
To maintain the peg, official Hong Kong interest rates track U.S. monetary policy. The currency's movement within the band is influenced by differences between market interest rates in both. Hong Kong interbank rates are higher than their U.S. equivalents, helping keep the HKD strong in spite of concerns about outflows related to the new law.

HOW VULNERABLE IS THE PEG?
There are fears that escalating U.S.-China tensions could result in the United States potentially limiting Hong Kong banks' access to U.S. dollars, thus jeopardizing the peg.
A Bloomberg report suggested this week that U.S. President Donald Trump's policy advisers explored that option, though the idea did not gain any traction.
Analysts say the White House cannot hurt the peg in Hong Kong, one of the world's largest U.S. dollar trading centers, without also hampering the greenback's hegemony as a global currency. Some call it a ""nuclear option"".
""For the U.S. dollar, exorbitant privilege is not risk-free,"" Geoff Yu, senior EMEA market strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), said in a note. ""The bottom line is that current rhetoric surrounding the Hong Kong dollar peg will likely stay as rhetoric.""
Hong Kong also has more than $400 billion in reserves - six times the currency in circulation. The HKMA can also call on China's central bank for U.S. dollars, the city's top finance official said recently.
Graphic: HILI spread https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyzoampg/HILI%20spread.jpg
WHY THE HKD MATTERS
Hong Kong's economy has shrunk in its importance relative to the mainland since the territory's 1997 handover to China but its financial significance has grown. Any real threat to the peg risks undermining that.
With China maintaining tight capital controls, Hong Kong acts as a key financing conduit, hosting one of the largest stock markets in the world and acting as the biggest gateway for international investment in mainland stocks and bonds. It has also become one of the world's biggest currency trading centers and ranks third globally for U.S. dollar trading.
China's wealthy have put faith in the city too, with more than half of Hong Kong's estimated private wealth of more than $1 trillion coming from mainland individuals.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Friday morning in Asia. Investors turned to the safe-haven asset as the U.S. reported over 60,000 COVID-19 cases on Thursday, and dampened hopes of an economic recovery.
The U.S accounts for over 3.1 million of all cases. There are over 12.2 million cases and 550,000 deaths globally as of July 10, according to John Hopkins University data. Some states, including Florida, Texas and California, reported a record number of new cases on Thursday.
“The market was in a mild risk-off mood, following pretty bad [COVD-19] figures from Florida,” Kyosuke Suzuki, director of currencies at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), told Reuters.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.13% to 96.802 by 10:06 AM ET (3:06 AM GMT).
Another event giving the dollar a boost was Thursday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing prosecutors access to U.S. President Donald Trump’s financial record. The ruling dealt a blow to Trump’s battle to keep the details of his finances under wraps and is an unwelcome surprise to his for re-election in November.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.17% to 107.
The risk-linked Antipodean currencies gave up their gains from the previous day, with the AUD/USD pair down 0.22% to 0.56947 and the NZD/USD pair falling 0.10% to 0.6562.

599,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As the dollar shows signs of exhaustion, the yuan is taking over as the barometer of global risk sentiment.
A worldwide rally in stocks, bonds and commodities is decoupling from the U.S. currency, which entered a bearish phase in June and is grinding lower for a fourth month. The rally is increasingly mirroring moves in the Chinese currency as it breaks psychological barriers and builds on its best month since October.
The closer relationship is no coincidence. At the heart of the global advance -- and the yuan’s appreciation -- is the growing optimism that China will lead the world out of the economic slump brought on by the pandemic. A tide of central bank liquidity, including from the Federal Reserve, is pouring into yuan assets as well as markets with close ties to the second-largest economy.
China Factory Deflation Eased in June With Recovery on Track (2)
This is the culmination of a process that started after the yuan’s shock devaluation in August 2015, with turning points for the Chinese currency often coinciding with shifts in global markets. And now, it may also be an indication that troubles in the U.S. -- including a second wave of coronavirus infections -- may have less effect on overseas markets if China’s recovery continues.
Here are some ways the yuan and global markets are joining hands:
The euro and the yuan are now following each other more often than at any time in the past 13 months. Their positive correlation increases in times of global risk-on rallies, such as in 2016, and falls in turbulent times, like last year when trade worries dominated. It even turned negative during the 2013 taper tantrum.
The relationship is thus an indirect indicator of the fortunes of euro-denominated assets, as well as Eastern European currencies that closely track the shared currency.
But nowhere else is the yuan’s influence more pronounced than in commodity prices. The Bloomberg Commodity Index now has the strongest beta with the yuan since 2011. That means a one percent gain for China’s currency translates into almost a 1.3% increase in commodity prices.
When the yuan rises, bond yields fall. That’s the signal from the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Total Return Index, which is heading for the longest streak of monthly gains since May 2017. The negative correlation is a weak 0.26, but that’s still the deepest in three years.
U.S.-China Yield Gap Is Widest on Record. Yuan Would Love It.
Emerging markets have always lived under China’s shadow, which is only lengthening now. As Shanghai stocks extend a rally, the country’s market capitalization has reached $9.3 trillion, the highest since June 2015 when Chinese markets went into a tailspin after runaway increases. Now China accounts for 45% of emerging-market stock values, the most dominant in more than four years.
‘No Way I Can Lose’: Inside China’s Stock-Market Frenzy (2)
The increasing role of China’s markets in the macro picture backs the idea that watching the yuan’s moves helps to understand shifts in global markets. There’s just one risk: if Beijing increases its involvement in the market, that could distort the relationship, making the yuan a poor indicator.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar and other safe-haven currencies were well bid on Friday after a surge in new coronavirus cases in the United States further undermined the case for a quick economic recovery.
More than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections were reported across the United States on Wednesday, the greatest single-day tally by any country in the pandemic so far, discouraging some American consumers to return to public spaces.
The caution helped to lift the dollar index (DXY) to 96.798 from near one-month low of 96.233 touched on Thursday.
The euro fell to $1.1288 (EUR=), slipping back after having scaled a one-month high of $1.1371 on Thursday.
Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar traded at 107.20 yen , having touched its lowest level in 10 days in the previous trade.
The Swiss franc also strengthened to its highest level in six weeks against the euro, to 1.0609 franc per euro (EURCHF=).
Against the dollar, the franc changed hands at 0.9407 per dollar  after having touched a four-month high of 0.93625 to the dollar.
""The market was in a mild risk-off mood, following pretty bad coronavirus figures from Florida,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of currencies at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Some market players also said a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that a New York prosecutor can obtain President Donald Trump's financial records could have undermined risk sentiment and boosted dollar as he faces an uphill battle for re-election.
Trump has fought tenaciously to keep his tax returns and other elements of his finances secret.
Many risk-sensitive currencies took a step back following their rally in recent weeks.
The Australian dollar stood at $0.69605 , off Thursday's one-month high of $0.7001.
Commodity currencies lost traction also as oil prices dipped on worries about the renewed lockdowns in some parts of the United States.
The yuan, which often tends to align with risk-sensitive currency groups, bucked the trend, supported by hopes of capital inflows as Chinese shares prices have surges after Beijing indicates it wants a healthy bull market.

The offshore yuan traded at 6.999 yuan per dollar , down about 0.03% in early Asian trade, having touched near-four-month high of 6.9808 on Thursday.

601,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 08:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- One consequence of the Philippines’ struggling economy is turning into a boon for its currency.
A collapse in imports has had a positive effect on the nation’s trade deficit, leading to lower demand for overseas currencies and helping to strengthen the peso. The Philippine currency is the best performer in Asia this year, up more than 2% against the dollar.
“With Philippine growth likely to be hamstrung by enforced and voluntary social distancing, imports will remain weak,” said Eugenia Fabon Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB AB in Singapore. “This will cap the trade deficit, allowing the peso to strengthen.”
Imports slumped 65% year-on-year in April to their lowest since the global financial crisis. That was a continuation of a trend seen in the first quarter, when a decline in goods imports outpaced a drop in exports, narrowing the country’s goods trade deficit to $10.2 billion from $12.2 billion a year previously.
The narrower gap is helping offset the impact of a decline in remittances from the Philippines’ overseas workers, which is expected to weigh on the currency. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas estimates a 5% slide in remittances this year to $28.6 billion.
The Philippines is bracing for its deepest economic slump in more than three decades, with a contraction of 2% to 3.4% on the cards for this year as virus cases continue to rise. President Rodrigo Duterte said he will “have to be very circumspect in reopening the economy” given the recent spike.
This year will be the year that investment drops off, and with it demand for imports and dollars, “which translates to the stronger peso story,” said Nicholas Mapa, senior economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Manila.

Investing.com – The loonie fell against the dollar on Thursday as falling oil prices and increased appetite for safe-haven demand offset data showing better-than-expected Canadian housing activity.
USD/CAD rose C$1.5358.
Canadian housing starts inched up to 212,000 in June, adding to strong gains following a bottom in April, and beating forecasts for a rise to 198,000.
The move was largely expected given the favorable backdrop of low-interest rates and government stimulus that has helped cushion the fall out from job losses.
""Against that backdrop it is not so surprising that housing activity has been more resilient than many had been expecting,"" RBC said. ""Government support programs like CERB payments mean that household incomes have probably held up significantly better than job markets to-date.""
The better-than-expected housing data was offset by renewed a fall in oil prices and an uptick in safe-haven demand for the greenback.
Oil prices fell nearly 3%, the most in over two weeks, as growing Covid-19 cases have forced some states roll back reopening measures and raised investor concerns that strong gasoline demand will be short-lived.
A day earlier, the Energy Information Administration released data showing U.S. gasoline demand rose to its highest in four months. But the peak could prove shortlived amid signs demand is tailing off.
""[T]he week building up to the July Fourth weekend may prove to be a temporary peak ... both activity trackers and retail sales indicators recording week-on-week falls in the last few days,"" JBC Energy said. "
603,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Regardless of what the spread of the coronavirus does to demand for risk, market indicators suggest the euro will rise.
The common currency is inching toward a close above its 200-week average for the first time in a year. A convincing break would be the latest in a string of signals from traders that the momentum behind the euro’s third monthly advance -- for the first time in more than two years -- is growing.
What’s driving the rally is optimism over the European Union’s handling of the virus, including talks of a joint recovery fund, and governments’ relatively swift implementations of lockdowns. That stands in contrast to the pandemic response from across the Atlantic.
The euro area’s recession as a result of those lockdowns probably won’t be as deep as previously feared, according to some European policy makers. Meanwhile, with the virus spreading across the U.S., which took time to implement lockdowns, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic suggested that economic activity in parts of the country is showing signs of leveling off.
This divergence in views from policy makers in the U.S. and EU, together with central banks worldwide backstopping financial markets with unprecedented stimulus, has weighed on Bloomberg’s dollar index.
The gauge has fallen three straight months, the longest such run in more than a year. It measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, of which the euro accounts for about a third.
Betting that the euro will gain over the next six months against the dollar now comes at a premium, as shown by so-called risk reversal options. While these signaled bearish sentiment on the common currency in recent months, this week they turned the most positive since March.
The Signs
A close above its 200-weekly moving average would be the euro’s first in a year. Should it surpass a key resistance level at the June 10 high of $1.1422, it will be trading at the highest in four months.
Propelling the euro forward is the strongest bullish sentiment since 2018, with bulls taking over the price action for six straight weeks, the longest streak this year, according to Bloomberg’s Fear/Greed indicator.
Bloomberg’s option probability calculator shows the common currency is 50% more likely to trade above $1.15 in a week’s time than to drop below $1.12.

604,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 06:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak faces the prospect of having to raise taxes to repair the public finances after his 30 billion-pound ($38 billion) stimulus package left the U.K. on course to borrow more this year than any time since World War II.
The extra spending will increase the cost of the government’s response to the crisis to almost 190 billion pounds, putting the budget deficit on course to hit 350 billion pounds in the current fiscal year, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. That would be equivalent to about 17% of GDP.
For now, the pressure on the chancellor is political, rather than market driven. He needs to avoid a second wave of the virus and a wave of mass unemployment. With U.K. 10-year gilt yields close to zero, and hovering around record lows, he can afford to borrow, and postpone the question of how to pay for his largess during the crisis.
“The time to pay for this will come -- but not this year and not next,” said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “Our capacity to do so will depend above all on how the economy recovers. A reckoning, in the form of higher taxes, will come eventually.”
That would be a problem for Sunak, given his party’s election promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or the U.K.’s sales tax. Any increases could also see some of the stardust fall from the chancellor, whose spending announcements during the crisis have boosted his popularity and left some considering him as a future prime minister.
“These interventions will cost an extraordinary amount of money,” Sunak told the BBC on Thursday. “We can’t sustainably live like this, and over the medium term we can and will return our public finances to a sustainable position.”
So far, Sunak has been helped by the Bank of England’s vast program of government bond purchases, which have kept borrowing costs near the lowest on record. The central banks has supported demand and left billions of pounds of bonds funded at the BOE’s 0.1% interest rate, rather than market rates, bringing down the cost of debt servicing even further.
Yields on 10-Year gilts barely budged after Sunak’s announcement on Wednesday, and are currently at about 0.18%.
But the scale of the budget deficit risks testing the equanimity of investors, with debt issuance in the first five months of the fiscal year already dwarfing the full-year record reached during the height of the financial crisis.
“We are borrowing at record-low rates that enable us to carry a higher degree of debt,” Sunak told the BBC. “But it would be important that we remain alert to changes in those interest rates.”
A sudden rise in interest rates isn’t the only risk he faces. This week, he also published a reminder of the threat the virus poses to his efforts to balance the books.
Buried in the Treasury document accompanying his statement was an announcement that he had allocated an additional 49 billion pounds to Britain’s public services since March, three times the latest estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility.
Of that money, almost 32 billion pounds is going to health services, including 15 billion pounds for personal protective equipment and 10 billion pounds for the government’s track and trace program.
“No amount of fiscal support can mask the fact that the U.K. recovery hinges almost solely on avoiding a return to repeated, widespread lockdowns,” said James Smith, a developed markets economist at ING.

In a quarterly regional report Thursday, the central bank lowered its assessment for all nine of Japan’s economic regions, cutting them across the board for a second straight quarter. The bank said all of the areas had either “deteriorated” or were “in a severe situation.”
The report comes ahead of a BOJ policy meeting next week at which more than 90% of economists expect the bank to make no major policy changes. After a raft of measures taken since March, more action isn’t needed because financial markets are relatively stable and companies aren’t facing significant funding problems, people familiar with the matter said.
The cautious tone of the regional Sakura report, the BOJ’s equivalent of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey, is likely to be reflected in a quarterly outlook the BOJ will release next week along with its policy statement. Many economists surveyed by Bloomberg see the bank making some downward revision to its economic projections.
In a speech earlier Thursday, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda repeated his recent mantra that the bank is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and won’t hesitate to take additional easing measures if needed."

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Thursday, with traders seeking out riskier currencies as a bet on economic growth, denting safe-haven demand for the U.S. currency.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 96.252, dropping over 1% over the last week. EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1356, while USD/JPY was largely flat at 107.27. 
“The USD took a broad-based dive yesterday, which continued overnight. It was particularly visible in EUR/USD. The pair moved firmly above the 1.13 level and close to the peak from early June,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Lingering worries about the spread of the coronavirus could keep some currency pairs in a tight range, but the dollar's losses are gradually increasing as sentiment favors riskier bets on long-term economic growth.
With this in mind, focus will quickly turn to the release of the weekly unemployment data from the U.S. later in the session. Jobs trends have been positive as states and cities come back from Covid lockdowns, but some areas have now been forced to slow down or reverse reopenings. 
Initial jobless claims are expected to be 1.4 million for the week ending July 3, which would be about even with the prior week.
Finance ministers from the euro area are due to meet Thursday, ahead of a summit of their leaders on July 17-18, amid optimism there will be an agreement allowing the proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund to be distributed to the economies hit hardest by Covid-19.
Sterling has also shown some strength, with the greenback close to a three-week low against the pound. Helping this move was the U.K. government’s announcement of its latest pandemic economic rescue plan, to the tune of 30 billion pounds ($38 billion).
GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.2643, although sterling was largely flat against the euro, at 0.8981.
That said, further gains may prove tricky, particularly against the single currency.
“The announced measures today do not significantly alter our U.K. growth outlook, and with the overriding GBP driver (U.K.-EU trade negotiations) still looking fairly uncertain, more gains in GBP are unlikely,” analysts at ING said in a research note.
“We see EUR/GBP moving towards 0.92 within three months as the lack of anticipated progress in UK-EU trade negotiations should translate into further risk premium being built into the currency.”
Elsewhere, the USD/CNY pair slid 0.2% to 6.9878. The yuan was boosted by better-than expected inflation data for June, with producer prices falling 3% year-on-year. The drop in the PPI was smaller compared with the previous month’s drop of 3.7% and the 3.2% drop analysts had generally forecast. However, the pair is being supported most by the rally in Chinese stocks, which continued for an eighth straight day on Thursday."

The city’s de facto central bank sold a combined HK$15.8 billion ($2 billion) to purchase the greenback on Wednesday, the biggest intervention since it started defending the peg on the strong end of the trading band in late April. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has now spent almost $12 billion this year to keep the currency from strengthening further.
Wednesday’s intervention came shortly after news that some Trump aides are considering plans to undermine the peg mechanism in retribution for Beijing’s crackdown on civil liberties in the former British colony. Mainland-based investors showed their support for the city through buying more than $1 billion worth of Hong Kong shares on the day.
The events show how the city’s financial system is increasingly being caught up in the rivalry between Washington and Beijing. For now, Hong Kong’s markets seem immune to the tensions. Red-hot Chinese equities, a stronger yuan and low valuations have helped push Hong Kong stocks into a bull market. Mainland purchases of local equities since Beijing first announced plans for Hong Kong’s controversial security law are now nearing $9 billion.
“Bullish sentiment is pushing short-term funds and liquidity into Hong Kong,” said Banny Lam, managing director at CEB International Capital Corp. “China’s stock market is very hot and you see a lot of people using the stock connect to buy these shares. All these factors are attracting liquidity.”

Investing.com – The U.K. unveiled an ambitious £30 billion stimulus package to spur economic growth as the country emerged from lockdown, but the rise in sterling will be fleeting as the revamp measures do little to alter the growth outlook, ING warned.
GBP/USD rose 0.61% to $1.2616.
""While the size of the stimulus announced is modestly larger than expected, in our view it is not significant enough to prompt further GBP gains,"" ING said.
The analysts said the stimulus measures ""don't significantly"" alter their U.K. growth outlook and estimated that the uncertainty over U.K.-EU trade negotiations, the ""over-riding driver"" of the pound would continue to weigh on the currency.
Others agreed, and said the measures, which sought to boost jobs, construction, house prices and consumption, do not reach far enough to avert the looming consequences of coronavirus-related economic problems.

Undermining the peg was seen by some advisers as one way to hit back at China for its moves to whittle away at Hong Kong's political freedoms, the report said. 
Other administration members pushed back against the proposal, worrying that such a move would only hurt Hong Kong banks and the United States, not China, sources told Bloomberg. The idea also was not elevated to White House senior levels, the report said.
The report will increase speculation over the stability of the 37-year-old exchange rate peg. 
Discussions about the peg's fate had already been swirling after Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong, leading Washington to begin withdrawing some privileges it accords to the city.
A Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) spokesperson told Reuters that the HKMA had commented on the matter on a number of occasions and had nothing further to add. 
Hong Kong Finance Secretary Paul Chan said last month there were no plans to change the peg to the U.S. dollar.
Market watchers are pondering what measures could be implemented to undermine the peg and what the fallout would be. 
Analysts at broker Hamilton Court FX predicted this could be done by reducing or rescinding swap lines, curbing Hong Kong authorities' ability to buy and sell dollars in order to keep the currency within its defined trading range.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Hao Zhou called it a ""low-possibility"" event but with risk of huge market impact. 
""The idea of sanctions, which limits certain entities to get access to the U.S. dollar, consequently will threaten the HKD peg if markets speculate that the HKMA needs to scrap the current regime at some point,"" Zhou told clients.
The Hong Kong dollar did not budge on the news, trading at 7.75 against the greenback, near the upper end of the peg's range . Hong Kong dollar forward points up to three-month maturities  were trading marginally higher.
A top priority for the U.S. administration has been to find ways to punish banks based in Hong Kong, particularly  HSBC Holdings  Plc, according to the Bloomberg report. 
London-listed shares in HSBC (L:HSBA) tumbled as much as 4.2% on Wednesday while  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) slipped 2.4%. Both lenders have come into U.S. crosshairs after backing China's national security law last month.
The U.S. Treasury, State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

HSBC and Standard Chartered declined to comment on the report.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, with the safe haven currency in demand as a resurgence of the coronavirus in the United States cast doubt over the strength of the economic rebound.
At 3:050 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 96.873.
EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1280, while USD/JPY was flat at 107.52. 
There are almost 11.8 million COVID-19 cases globally as of July 8, according to Johns Hopkins University data, of which the U.S. has the highest known numbers of cases and deaths in the world.
A number of Federal Reserve officials expressed concern Tuesday that the surge in infections could adversely impact the economy just as some stimulus programmes are set to expire.
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic warned that the spike in the number of cases has made business owners “nervous again” and that ‘there is a real sense this might go on longer than we have planned for.”
Still, the rise in cases is not simply a matter for America. The AUD/USD pair lost 0.2% to 0.6935, with the Australian dollar weakening after the country’s second-largest city Melbourne re-imposed lockdown measures to curb the outbreak. 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD gained 0.2% to 1.2559 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the U.K. remains committed to working hard to find an agreement over trade with the EU. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is due to announce details of the country's latest fiscal stimulus package later Wednesday.
Sterling has gained around 0.6% this week against the dollar and 0.4% against the euro, but still remains one of the weakest G7 currencies as doubts still remain as to whether a trade deal will be signed by the end of the year.
Additionally, skepticism exists that a proposal by some of Donald Trump’s advisers to undermine Hong Kong’s currency peg would come to fruition, as such a move would be difficult to implement and risk hurting U.S. interests as much as it would punish China.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's rupee has the backing of a healthier trade account, steady foreign investment inflows and a return in global risk appetite, but its gains are being limited by a central bank keen to prevent wild swings and build dollar reserves.
The Reserve Bank of India's stated foreign exchange policy has been to only curb extreme volatility but recent actions suggest it is not letting the local unit appreciate despite its relative underperformance versus peers.
Traders suspect the RBI bought dollars in May and June as the return in risk appetite and overseas investments by a dozen firms, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), into the digital arm of telecommunications firm Reliance Jio brought in billions of dollars into the country.
Graphic: India foreign portfolio flows in 2020 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvorlkypd/Pasted%20image%201594182552063.png
Reliance is scheduled to get a total of $15.8 billion, part of which has already come in. India's external account has also improved owing to the sharp fall in global crude oil prices and a collapse in imports in an economy weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies have raised $2.49 billion through external commercial borrowings in April and May.
The flows coming in are only temporary and cannot be taken for granted as a recovery in growth would push up imports and widen the current account deficit eventually, said Suyash Choudhury, head of fixed income at IDFC AMC.
""It is also in this context that we see RBI's more aggressive stance in accumulating forex reserves lately. It is prudent to shore up external defenses given the long haul ahead.""
Graphic: India's foreign exchange reserves https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeaymypr/Pasted%20image%201594182740343.png
The rupee  was at 74.98 to the dollar on Wednesday and is down 4.74% so far this year, making it the worst performing Asian currency. 
The RBI's foreign exchange reserves have climbed to a record above $500 billion and are now adequate to cover around 13 months of imports, far higher than the average over the last 5 years.
Graphic: India's foreign exchange reserves https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwwrxbpw/Pasted%20image%201594182377650.png
The rupees released by the RBI's dollar buying intervention are adding to the cash circulating in the banking system. There is, however, little evidence the RBI has mopped up that excess cash, and clearing house data shows state-run banks are ploughing more money into government bonds. 
The RBI is, however, expected to purchase government bonds either directly or via open market bond purchases to help tame market yields and ensure the government is able to meet its record borrowing needs.

Rahul Gupta, head of currency research at Emkay Global Financial Services, sees the range around 74.20-74.30 becoming a floor for the dollar-rupee pair, and expects it to head towards 76.20 or 77.00 within a couple of months. 
""The government's stimulus also needs to be financed from somewhere, imports also will start rising as the economy recovers and we will again start seeing pressure on the currency,"" he said.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia, with investors turning to the safe-haven asset amid continuously-rising numbers of COVID-19 cases.
Investor sentiment was further dampened over a warning from several U.S. Federal Reserve officials that the rising number of cases could jeopardize economic recovery, with some stimulus programs from central banks due to expire soon.
“The mood changes day by day, but the dollar looks to be supported for now as investors turn more cautious about the virus,” Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Reuters.
“The Fed’s comments on the economy sound sombre. There’s reason to worry because it is hard to see when the virus will be brought under control.”
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.06% to 96.895 by 12:09 AM ET (5:09 AM GMT). The USD/JPY pair was up 0.09% to 107.60.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.08% to 0.6941. The AUD took a hit after the country’s second-largest city Melbourne re-imposed lockdown measures to curb the outbreak.
The NZD/USD pair fell 0.07% to 0.6542.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.09% to 7.0188, with the yuan taking a hit after the People’s Bank of China set a lower-than expected daily midpoint for the yuan.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.14% to 1.2557. The pound was boosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s re-commitment to reaching a trade deal with the European Union.
But investor skepticism remained alongside the risk that the deal will not materialize."
615,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A proposal by some of Donald Trump’s advisers to undermine Hong Kong’s currency peg was met with skepticism by traders and analysts, who said such a move would be difficult to implement and risk hurting U.S. interests as much as it would punish China.
Doubts that the idea would gain traction within the Trump administration were reflected in markets on Wednesday, with the Hong Kong dollar holding in a tight range near the strong end of its trading band against the greenback. An increase in the local dollar’s 12-month forward points suggested a slight pickup in hedging demand, but they remained well below a May peak. Shares of  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), the biggest player in Hong Kong’s banking industry, slipped 2.7%.
Here’s what people are saying about the proposal:
Patrick Bennett, head of macro strategy for Asia at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
It’s a fairly whacky idea that they would be able to force Hong Kong off the peg by some means. I’ve been against the idea that Kyle Bass and others trying to break the peg -- that has been a spectacularly unsuccessful idea so far, and I expect it to be the same.
Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp
Why this is bad not to mention an unlikely move: First, direct U.S. action against the peg could trigger China’s response by putting U.S. assets, including USTs or equities. Second, such a move could destabilize USD pegs elsewhere, including U.S. allies around the world, especially those in the Middle East. Third, the unthinkable instability that it would trigger in the USD-based global financial ecosystem could drive a selloff in US equity markets – an outcome abhorrent to the White House ahead of the November presidential election.
Xia Le, chief Asia economist at BBVA (MC:BBVA) Hong Kong
It’s technically difficult to impose, and it’ll hurt U.S. a lot. The peg is maintained by Hong Kong, which doesn’t need approval from the U.S. and not something the U.S. could easily manipulate. Technically, it’s very hard for them to prevent any businesses from investing in the city or limiting the ability of Hong Kong banks to buy U.S. dollars.
Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank
At the moment, the Trump administration isn’t seriously considering this as it’s very risky for them. It’s more about specific restrictions for financial institutions under the sanctions. Hong Kong is the world’s third-largest U.S. dollar trading center, which would mean if the HKD can’t be pegged to the USD it would be unfavorable to the U.S. by curbing the number of transactions in U.S. dollars and would lower investor confidence in the greenback.
Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank
At this stage I personally assign a relativity low possibility for this to happen. Having said that, in the recent days U.S. has taken some totally unexpected actions by withdrawing from the WHO. So the likelihood of the U.S. doing something is still very likely, it’s just likely to be less drastic in terms of impacting the convertibility between the HKD and the USD, like setting a limit on how much exposure banks are able to have on the Hong Kongdollar or setting limits on the amount of exposure U.S. companies can have towards the Hong Kong dollar.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held onto gains on Wednesday as a resurgence of the coronavirus in the United States and the return of lockdowns in some countries boosted safe-haven demand for the U.S. currency.
Risk sentiment was also undermined after Federal Reserve officials expressed concern that rising coronavirus cases could harm economic growth just as stimulus measures start to expire.
On the day, traders will be looking to see whether the dollar's overnight gains will slow a recent rally in the yuan sparked by optimism about the outlook for Chinese equities.
""The mood changes day by day, but the dollar looks to be supported for now as investors turn more cautious about the virus,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""The Fed's comments on the economy sound sombre. There's reason to worry because it is hard to see when the virus will be brought under control.""
The dollar traded at 107.58 yen  in Asia following a 0.3% gain on Tuesday.
Against the euro, the dollar was quoted at $1.1274, also holding to a 0.3% gain from the previous session.
The greenback bought 0.9426 Swiss franc , little changed on the day.
Sterling  changed hands at $1.2540 and was quoted at 89.88 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The pound was near three-week highs against both the greenback and the common currency after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated his commitment to reaching an early trade deal with the European Union.
However, some traders remain reluctant to buy the pound because there is still a risk that trade talks could fail to yield an agreement.
Equities weakened and U.S. Treasury yields edged lower as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States pushed past 3 million on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, stoking fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed.
The United States has the highest known numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world. 
Adding to the cautious tone, three Fed officials expressed concern that the surge in infections threatens to pinch consumer spending and job gains just as some stimulus programmes are set to expire.
One Fed policymaker pledged more support ahead from the U.S. central bank.
Some traders warn that the dollar could break out of its range against the yen because currency options are set to expire later Wednesday and Thursday.
The yuan, which rallied against the dollar this week, stood at 7.0241 in offshore trade , down from an almost four-month high reached on Tuesday.
Investors will monitor the opening of onshore trade in the yuan  to see if it retreats further from its recent rally.
The Australian dollar  bought $0.6945 following a 0.4% decline on Tuesday. Sentiment for the Aussie has taken a hit after coronavirus lockdown measures were reimposed in Australia's second biggest city of Melbourne on Tuesday.

The New Zealand dollar  was little changed at $0.6553.

617,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Some top advisers to President Donald Trump want the U.S. to undermine the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the U.S. dollar as the administration considers options to punish China for recent moves to chip away at the former British colony’s political freedoms, according to people familiar with the matter.
The idea of striking against the Hong Kong dollar peg -- perhaps by limiting the ability of Hong Kong banks to buy U.S. dollars -- has been raised as part of broader discussions among advisers to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and hasn’t been elevated to the senior levels of the White House, suggesting that it hasn’t gained serious traction yet, according to people who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity.
The proposal faces strong push back from others in the administration who worry such a move would only hurt Hong Kong banks and the U.S., not China, they said.
Another person cautioned that the idea of attacking the dollar peg is lower on the list of possible options now under discussion. Those ideas include canceling a U.S.-Hong Kong extradition treaty and ending cooperation with Hong Kong’s police, the person said.
Hong Kong has pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar since 1983, allowing it to fluctuate within a fairly strict band that has generally centered around 7.8 per U.S. dollar.
The very idea that undermining the peg has even been raised offers some insight into the range of discussions now underway for punishing China. The idea has primarily been discussed at the State Department, where Pompeo has emerged as the administration’s loudest critic of Beijing’s recent decision to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong.
Two of the people familiar with the matter said a top administration priority has been finding ways to punish banks based in Hong Kong, particularly  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). In a statement last month, Pompeo singled out Peter Wong, the bank’s Asia Pacific chief executive officer, for signing a petition supporting “Beijing’s disastrous decision to destroy Hong Kong’s autonomy.”
What the Hong Kong Dollar Peg Is and Why It Matters: QuickTake
“That show of fealty seems to have earned HSBC little respect in Beijing, which continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London,” Pompeo wrote in the June 9 statement.
A peg can provide stability but it also puts the city at the mercy of U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. That means it can be less able to respond to local economic conditions because in times of uncertainty, individuals and businesses can opt to hold U.S. dollars over the less widely traded local currency. That would pressure Hong Kong authorities to weaken the peg to maintain competitiveness.
The State Department declined to comment when asked about the issue on Tuesday, as did the Treasury Department.
The possibility of the Hong Kong dollar peg’s demise has become a focus of major financial bets including by Hayman Capital Management founder Kyle Bass, who started a fund last month making wagers on a collapse in Hong Kong’s currency peg, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Speaking on Monday to Fox News, Pompeo said the U.S. was mulling the possibility of banning ByteDance Ltd.’s social media app TikTok in the U.S., though he didn’t explain what authority the administration would use to do so.
“We’d love to preserve the freedom in Hong Kong; but if we can’t, we’re going to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable,” Pompeo said.

Investing.com – The pound marched higher against the dollar on Tuesday, as the U.K. and EU prepared to get post-Brexit talks underway, but an analyst warned that sterling's strength will fade as time is running out for both sides to strike a deal.
GBP/USD rose 0.60%, to $1.2570.
With the clock ticking down on the opportunity for the U.K. and EU to agree a trade deal before the Brexit transition ends in December, sterling is likely to weaken, RBC's Adam Cole warned.
The U.K. and EU have struggled to find a compromise on key sticking issues including the level playing field, security and fisheries. Ahead of post-Brexit talks, set to get underway on Wednesday, both sides have given little sign that the deadlock will be broken.
The EU ""wants an agreement … but not at any price,"" EU negotiator Michel Barnier said.
RBC has warned the threat of a no-deal Brexit is growing. ""As time ebbs away and the two sides remain far apart, risks of a no deal, or a deal on unfavorable terms for the U.K. are growing.""
For the fourth quarter, RBC sees GBP/USD falling to 1.22 from 1.2574 at present and expects the currency pair to continue to fall in 2021 as the U.K. may require a weaker currency to prop up the economy."

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, reversing earlier losses as traders sided with the safe haven as the recovery in German industrial production was less impressive than expected in May.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 96.896.
EUR/USD was down 0.2% at 1.1290, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2477, while USD/JPY was up 0.2% at 107.54. 
Germany's industrial production rebounded in May, rising by 7.8% on the month after falling by a revised 17.5% in April. However, this recovery was more modest than the 10% rise widely expected.
Despite the recovery, production is still well below the levels recorded before the onset of the coronavirus crisis. May output was down 19% in calendar- and season-adjusted terms compared with February, the month before lockdown measures were imposed.
Also adding to the demand for the safe-haven greenback has been the ever-increasing number of Covid-19 cases, with over 11.5 million cases having been reported globally as of July 7, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The dollar had fallen sharply on Monday as better-than-expected U.S. services data strengthened investor expectations for speedier economic recovery.
There are a number of Federal Reserve speakers due later Tuesday, including Raphael Bostic, Mary Daly and Thomas Barkin. The market will pick up on comments with respect to the Fed's plans for QE and forward guidance.
Elsewhere, AUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.6943, after Australia’s second-most populous state announced a six-week lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne after a coronavirus outbreak.
As expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate at 0.25% and made no changes to policy at Tuesday's board meeting.
“We expect the RBA to reiterate the Australian economy is performing better than feared, and any move higher in the cash rate is some years away,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analyst Joe Capurso told CNBC.
But he added, “the main downside risks for AUD/USD are an escalation in U.S.-China tensions and the risk partial lockdowns become more widespread.""
Also, USD/CNY rose 0.1% to 7.0207, with the dollar rebounding after the yuan hit its highest level in nearly four months after the sharp gains seen in the Chinese share markets."

Investing.com – The dollar fell sharply on Monday as better-than-expected U.S. services data strengthened investor expectations for speedier economic recovery, but some on Wall Street expect the greenback to regain its footing.

""The service sector has definitely experienced a v-shaped rebound from the initial Covid-19 shock … We’re back at readings in February before the shutdowns,"" Scotiabank said. ""July’s reading could easily be stronger as reopening momentum is imperfect, occurring in fits and starts across some states, but nevertheless ongoing both at home and abroad for exporters.""
Still, the sharp rise in U.S. coronavirus cases means the current economic recovery may prove short-lived, triggering renewed demand for safe-haven assets such as the dollar, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.
""The current recovery is as sharp as the collapse of output when the lockdown started, but this should not be a surprise for markets,"" BofA analysts said, pointing to recently improved economic data.
The bank expects the global economy to be ""dealing with the consequences from the Covid-19 crisis for years to come,"" even if a coronavirus vaccine is developed.
The dollar's decline was also exacerbated by a strong climb in the euro. 
EUR/USD rose 0.58% to $1.1313 as Germany, the economic powerhouse of the EU, reported that factory orders rebounded 10.4% in May, as the country reopened from lockdown.

Investing.com - The euro posted gains in early European trade Monday, helped by signs of a German economic recovery and well as hopes of more stimulus for the region in the near future. 
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), EUR/USD gained 0.4% to 1.1294, while EUR/GBP climbed 0.3% to 0.9032.
German factory orders rose 10.4% in May with demand rebounding after the country loosened restrictions to contain the spread of the coronavirus, adding to evidence that Europe’s economy is starting to recover.
“After two devastating months, today’s increase is the largest monthly increase ever,” said analysts at ING, in a research note, although “even after today’s increase, order books are some 30% below the first quarter levels.”
“Today’s industrial orders data brings two important messages: the lifting of the lockdown measures has brought V-shaped surges in activity but the return to pre-crisis levels will not be easy,” the bank added.
With this in mind, the market will be looking out for any new signals on the region’s recovery fund from the meeting of euro area finance ministers on Thursday, before the July 17-18 summit of the region’s leaders.
Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, will be very keen to arrange a consensus about the structure of the Covid-19 recovery fund as it now has the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.
Elsewhere, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was 0.5% lower and heading toward a two-week low at 96.852. GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2504, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.64.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against most currencies on Monday as investors awaited data expected to show the U.S. services sector stopped contracting, which would further lift hopea for an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The euro moved in a narrow range before economic data from Germany and the eurozone that are also forecast to show a sharp rebound in corporate activity and retail sales, which would ease concerns about the economic outlook.
The yen fell against most major currencies as gains in Asian share prices encouraged some risk-on trades.
A steady rise of new coronavirus infections in the United States has discouraged some investors from taking big positions in the currency market, but most market participants remain focused on the growing likelihood that major economies will continue to recover.

""The markets are focused on other currency pairs, like the Australian dollar, which is still in a clear uptrend against the U.S. dollar due to the rise in copper prices.""
The dollar edged up to 107.68 yen  on Monday following a 0.3% gain last week. Market activity was subdued after the July 4 long weekend holiday in the United States.
The euro (EUR=D3) rose 0.36% to $1.1287. Against the British pound, the common currency edged up to 90.35 pence (EURGBP=D3).
Sterling  moved in a narrow range at $1.2494.
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar  dipped to 0.9432.
The Institute for Supply Management's index for non-manufacturing activity due later on Monday is expected to rise to 50.0 in June from 45.4 in the previous month, indicating activity stopped shrinking.
The greenback has been locked in narrow trading ranges recently as concerns about a resurgence in U.S. coronavirus infections offset growing optimism about the economy.
The euro will come into focus later in the trading day as Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, is scheduled to release industrial orders for May.
Retail sales for all of the eurozone will also be released later on Monday. Both indicators are forecast to recover strongly from large declines caused by the spread of the coronavirus.
The yen fell 0.5% against the euro (EURJPY=) to 121.56. Japan's currency also fell around 0.5% against the Australian (AUDJPY=) and New Zealand dollars (NZDJPY=) as risk sentiment improved.
However, the yen could quickly reverse course given the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, analysts said.
The onshore yuan  rose to 7.0490 per dollar on Monday, the highest since April 30. The yuan drew strength from a jump in Chinese share prices to the highest in five years as investors shrugged off concerns about diplomatic tension between the United States and China. 
The Australian dollar  rose 0.3% to $0.6962 on Monday following a 1.2% gain last week, with the market focused on a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) policy meeting on Tuesday.
Analysts expect the policy rate to stay at 0.25% amid signs Australia's economic downturn will not be as dire as first feared.
Recent gains in prices of copper and other commodities that Australia exports, combined with a more positive tone for the RBA, are likely to support the Aussie, analysts say.
However, there are still reasons to be cautious about the Aussie. On Monday, Australia's Victoria state said it will close its border with the country's most populous state of New South Wales to contain a sudden spike in coronavirus infections.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar  was quoted at $0.6550.

Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predict a reading of 50 for the Institute for Supply Management non-manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI).
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases globally is close to 11.5 million as of July 6, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.37% to 96.940 by 12:29AM ET (5:29 AM GMT). The USD/JPY pair was up 0.20% to 107.71.

The dollar was offered for as much as 215,500 rials, softening from 208,200 on Friday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com. The economic daily Donya-e-Eqtesad's website gave the dollar rate as 215,250, compared with 207,500 on Friday.
In May 2018, President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme and reimposed sanctions that have since battered the economy.
A drop in oil prices and a slump in the global economy have deepened the economic crisis in the country, which also has the highest death toll in the Middle East from the pandemic.
The rial's decline has continued despite assurances from Iranian Central Bank Governor Abdolnaser Hemmati last week that the bank had injected hundreds of millions of dollars to stabilise the currency market.
The rial lost about 70% of its value in the months after May 2018 as Iranians snapped up dollars, fearing Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and sanctions could shrink vital oil exports and severely impact the economy.

The official exchange rate is 42,000 rials per dollar and is used mostly for imports of state-subsidised food and medicine.

628,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s rupiah sank by the most in two months ahead of a parliamentary hearing on the nation’s debt monetization plan, prompting intervention by the central bank.
The currency dropped as much as 1.5%, its biggest decline since May 4. Even after the intervention, it was 1.3% lower at 14,570 per dollar at 2:05 p.m. in Jakarta
“Investors are a bit spooked by debt monetization concerns, increasingly so since the figure is quite big and will be a pain to unwind later,” said Yanxi Tan, a foreign exchange strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd.
Parliament’s financial commission in a hearing on Monday will scrutinize Bank Indonesia’s agreement to fund $40 billion of the government’s fiscal response to fight the coronavirus.
Febrio Kacaribu, head of the finance ministry’s fiscal office, said Friday that both sides were being careful to make a plan that would be “very prudent” and maintain monetary independence, fiscal integrity and stability.
Still, some investors are concerned that it has sparked the risk of a downgrade of Indonesia’s sovereign rating.
Indonesia Risks Losses by Deeper Dive Into Debt Monetization
“Markets are concerned that there will be a marked increase in liquidity as Bank Indonesia increases holdings of government bonds to support fiscal authorities,” said Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
The nation’s 10-year government bond yield was steady at 7.23% on Friday.
Meanwhile, a spike of coronavirus cases was also weighing on the currency after the country reported 1,624 infections on Thursday, the biggest single-day jump so far.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, with volumes hit by the U.S. holiday and traders weighing the conflicting influences of positive economic data and the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 97.203.
EUR/USD was flat at 1.1240, GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2477, while USD/JPY was flat at 107.50. 
Economic data released earlier Friday pointed to a brisk pickup in the Chinese service sector, with the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index coming in at 58.4 in June, the highest reading in two months. This helped USD/CNY drop 0.1% to 7.0606.
With the U.S. recording Thursday an addition of 4.8 million jobs in June and manufacturing activity rebounding more than expected, the economic signs suggest that the vast sums of money injected by the monetary and fiscal authorities around the world are bearing fruit.
“Fed money printing has now secured what seems to be a stable negative correlation between risk assets and the dollar,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
“As long as the Fed is still buying assets and prepared to do more, we expect this negative correlation, Risk On, Dollar Off, to dominate financial markets over the coming quarters. Economies slowly getting back on their feet should mean a backdrop of a benign dollar bear trend in the second half of the year.”
Even so, another spike in coronavirus infections threatens to put the brakes on economic activity once again.
The U.S. recorded more than 52,000 new cases on Thursday, just under its daily record, with Florida alone accounting for over 10,000 of them. The U.S.  accounts for around a quarter of the 10.8 million coronavirus cases recorded worldwide.
More than three dozen U.S. states have seen increases in Covid-19 cases as of Thursday, prompting them to delay and in some cases reverse plans to let stores reopen and activities resume.
Elsewhere, USD/INR traded 0.2% higher at 74.872, with the rupee just coming off its highest level in more than three months. The Indian currency has gained almost 1% against the dollar this week alone, helped by strong inflows amid expectations that the central bank may be slowing its dollar purchases.
The Fed's balance shrunk for a second week in a row last week as the volume of cross-currency swaps with other central banks, a feature of the early stage of the Covid crisis, was wound down further.

Investing.com – The dollar was down but not out on Friday morning in Asia, with investors retreating from the greenback after positive data from both China and the U.S. gave market sentiment an end-of-week boost.
Non-farm payrolls rose to 4.8 million in June, higher than the 3 million in analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com as well as May’s figure of 2.699 million.
But rising COVID-19 figures globally, and particularly in the U.S., stemmed the safe-haven asset’s losses. The number of global cases topped 10.8 million as of July 3, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
“New infections in the United States have been on an uptrend since June,” Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities, told Reuters.
“The market is leaning more toward buying the dollar, particularly against emerging market currencies, because the dollar is considered the safest asset around.”
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.05% to 97.248 by 12:37 PM ET (5:37 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.04% to 107.53.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.09% to 0.6928 and the NZD/USD rose 0.10% to 0.6517. The AUD got a boost after the country announced that retail sales soared by a record 16.9% month-on-month in May.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.01% to 7.0657. The CNY was boosted by June’s Caixin Services Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) of 58.4, higher than the previous month’s figure of 55, as well as the highest reading in two months.
But the yuan’s gains were muted by rising tensions between China and the U.S. over the national security laws in Hong Kong. The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved sanctions against Chinese entities involved with implementing the law, and the legislation is now on U.S. President Donald Trump’s desk for his approval or veto.

631,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European governments are fast learning that they’ll have to live with aid programs to save jobs and businesses longer than thought to keep the economy from falling off a cliff.
Across the continent, furlough programs that shielded close to 50 million jobs at the height of lockdowns, as well as tax deferrals and loan moratoriums, are being extended even as restrictions on movement are lifted. That’s because the sustainability of the economic bounce back is uncertain, with many businesses still closed or serving fewer customers than before.
The outlook has forced officials to set aside concerns over rising debt to prolong their crisis measures, some of which had initially been set to expire this week. The alternative would risk a greater spike in unemployment, spook already cautious consumers and dent the recovery.
“Governments have to tread a fine balance between cutting support and watching the impact on the economy, or continuing the support, perhaps more generously than originally envisaged, and watching finances balloon,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY). “So its a very tricky balance to strike. Maybe governments underestimated the demand for support.”
Another reason to remain wary is that some places have seen a resurgence in the virus. Cases have surged in the U.S., while the English city of Leicester and some districts on the outskirts of the Portuguese capital of Lisbon have reinstated lockdowns to contain new clusters of the pandemic.
Core to the measures to combat the economic slump were government-subsidized furlough programs, which kept workers in employment. The U.K., Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland and Ireland have all expanded theirs through at least the end of August. France has introduced a new version of a partial furlough scheme that companies could use for up to two years.
Germany loosened the conditions on its longstanding Kurzarbeit program to make it easier to protect workers’ wages during the pandemic, and will extend that relief if needed.
In many cases, it’s not simply a case of extending support, but adjusting as the situation evolves. The Peterson Institute last month recommended shifting carefully from funding job retention to wage subsidies to help get people back to work.
It also said the usual reallocation process that allows some firms to collapse shouldn’t apply now. Given the extreme and unusual situation, its view is that protecting businesses and jobs should get a higher priority than normal.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“Europe’s coronavirus outbreak will be the biggest peacetime economic shock on record -- that much is clear. Less certain is how quick the rebound will be and how far social distancing will allow it to run.”
--Read the full EURO-AREA INSIGHT
The challenge of unwinding stimulus is a lesson that’s long been apparent to central banks. More than a decade after the financial crisis, many had barely moved policy off emergency settings. Their efforts to get back to a more normal stance were, on various occasions, scuppered by sluggish growth, weak inflation or market volatility.
For governments, the need to act is so far outweighing any immediate budgetary concerns. There’s also the argument that pulling away the crutch too fast could choke off growth and do even greater damage to public finances.
Italy is a case in point. Even with the debt ratio set to top 150% of GDP this year, it’s extended tax breaks for companies and lengthened its furlough program for workers to 18 weeks from an initial 14 weeks. Rome is considering a further extension, Ansa news agency reported on Tuesday.
While the measures deployed across the region were sweeping, they have their limits, and some industries have been hugely damaged.
The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the euro area and the U.K. economies will shrink by more than 10% this year, among the sharpest declines in the world. Companies including Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), Swissport and  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) Plc have announced thousands of job cuts, and unemployment is rising.
That’s keeping the mood cautious even as measures of confidence, retail sales and activity rebound from their lockdown lows.
For governments, the high uncertainty means they’ll probably have to tweak their schemes somewhat on the fly -- just as they did when they launched them a couple of months ago.
“As time passes, we will have more evidence and that will be the moment when we can adapt the economic policy instruments,” Bank of Spain chief economist Oscar Arce said. “We have to wait a little more,” he said, “to see what the outlook will be like.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was hemmed into a narrow range on Friday, supported by safe-haven flows as a resurgence of the coronavirus in the United States discouraged some investors from taking on excessive risk.
The yuan held steady after data showing a strong rebound in China's services sector, as investors avoided big positions due to worries about diplomatic friction between Washington and Beijing over civil liberties in Hong Kong.
The U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in June, data showed on Thursday, but reaction in the currency market has been muted because another spike in coronavirus infections threatens to once again put the breaks on economic activity.
""New infections in the United States have been on an uptrend since June,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities.
""The market is leaning more toward buying the dollar, particularly against emerging market currencies, because the dollar is considered the safest asset around.""
Against the euro (EUR=D3), the dollar traded at $1.1243 on Friday in Asia.
The dollar held steady at 0.9460 Swiss franc  after three straight days of gains.
The British pound  traded hands at $1.2465 and stood at 90.20 pence per euro (EURGBP=).
The dollar was little changed at 107.57 yen .
A wave of coronavirus infections has prompted the halting of or back-pedalling on plans to reopen economic activity in several U.S. states after months of strict lockdowns.
Officials are also taking steps to curtail activity during the extended Independence Day holiday weekend starting on Friday.
Trading in other Asian currencies on Friday was subdued before the U.S. holiday, but analysts say sentiment favours more gains in the dollar as investors turn cautious.
Relations between the United States and China are also in focus. 
The U.S. Senate unanimously approved legislation on Thursday to penalise banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement Beijing's new national security law for Hong Kong, raising the chances of further friction between the world's two- largest economies.
The onshore yuan  traded at 7.0665, little moved after data showed China's services sector expanded in June at the fastest rate in more than a decade.
The Australian dollar  held steady at $0.6921 after data confirmed retail sales rebounded by a record in May.

633,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday will tell Britons to act responsibly as the U.K.’s pubs prepare to re-open, warning he’ll act to shutter parts of the economy again if the coronavirus pandemic runs out of control.
Restaurants, hotels, cinemas and hairdressers will also be allowed to open their doors again Saturday after 3 1/2 months of an economic lockdown brought in to contain the outbreak. They’ll join non-essential shops, which were allowed back earlier in the month.
“We are not out of the woods yet,” Johnson will say at a press conference Friday, according to a statement emailed by his office. “The success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”
Johnson is trying to jump-start the U.K. economy after the pandemic killed more than 43,000 people, pushing the country into what may be the worst recession in three centuries. Earlier this week, the premier brought forward 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) of spending, pledging to “build, build, build” in an effort to revive economic activity, and next week, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is due to unveil more measures.
Sunak is focusing on preserving as many jobs as possible so that the economy is in the best place possible to bounce back. His statement next week is likely to include a few targeted measures to help him in that aim, with a wider package of measures due in a budget in the fall.
‘Targeted Strategy’
On Friday, Labour Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds will deliver her first major speech in the post, setting out four tests for Sunak’s statement, according to an emailed statement from the party. She’s previously called for an emergency budget rather than Sunak’s planned “summer statement.”
Dodds will say Sunak’s package must create and protect jobs, ensure any economic bounce-back extends across the country and cut greenhouse gas emissions. The chancellor should also pledge not to raise taxes or cut support for low and middle-income people during the recovery, according to Dodds.
She’ll also call on Sunak to extend the government’s furlough program -- due to end on Oct. 31 -- in areas where local lockdowns are needed and in sectors of the economy that are struggling to restart, saying “the reward for months of sacrifice cannot be a redundancy notice.”
“As with the lifting of lockdown, what we have now is an exit without a strategy. Government must abandon its one-size-fits-all wind-down of the Job Protection and self-employed schemes,” Dodds will say. “We need a targeted strategy that acknowledges that workers in struggling sectors cannot and should not be treated the same way as workers in sectors that are already back to full capacity.”
‘Will Not Hesitate’
The government is paying 80% of the wages for 9.3 million private sector jobs at a cost of 25.5 billion pounds under the program, which will begin to taper next month as companies take on more of the costs.
With the country emerging from lockdown, the government is still wary of a resurgence in coronavirus cases, and has pledged to deploy a “whack-a-mole” strategy to quash any localized outbreaks by having more targeted lockdowns. The central English city of Leicester was placed under such provisions earlier this week.
When the pubs re-open, the government is keen to avert scenes such as on the country’s beaches last week, when social distancing was abandoned as warm weather lured Britons in their thousands to the coast. On Thursday, the Health Department published guidance for the hospitality sector to help with the government’s test and trace program. Pubs, hotels and restaurants were told to collect the names and phone numbers of clients and retain them for 21 days so that they can be contacted if anyone at the venue is later identified as suffering from the virus.
“The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that,” Johnson will say. “If it starts running out of control again the government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions.”

Powell's calendar is silent on the contents of the half-hour May 1 phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Murat Uysay. But it took place as the Turkish lira was falling rapidly, ultimately hitting an all-time low on May 7.
That month Ankara was urgently seeking access to funds from other central banks to head off a potential currency spiral, with analysts saying tens of billions of dollars might be needed. 
The Turkish central bank had been buying record amounts of government bonds in an effort to backstop the country's financial response to the pandemic, putting downward pressure on Turkey's lira. 
The Fed has swap lines with more than a dozen other central banks to help them with currency pressures, but not with Turkey. 
Ultimately Ankara secured some aid from Qatar, tripling an existing currency-swap agreement to $15 billion in late May. The deal provided much-needed foreign funding to reinforce Turkey's depleted reserves and help steady the currency.

Still, analysts have raised concerns over Turkey's depleted currency reserves and only partial success in gaining access to foreign funding.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar remained on track for a second-straight weekly loss despite turning positive on Friday, as a spike in coronavirus cases in the U.S. cooled the flight to risk and stoked demand for safe-haven greenback.  
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.14% to 97.28.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday reported 2,679,230 cases of Covid-19, up by 54,357 cases previously, with the death toll rising 725 to 128,024.
Rising cases stoked investor worries that measures to curb the outbreaks including states rolling back the reopening of businesses could slowed the economic recovery.  
The U.S. created 4.8 millionjobs last month, well above economists' forecast of 2.9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May. Economists expected it to drop to 12.4%.
""While the quick turnaround is very encouraging, sustainability remains in question given the Covid resurgence and the rollback of reopening in some states,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The dollar has fallen 5% since hitting a three-year high in March as investor sentiment on risk improved amid a rally in global equity markets following a slump earlier this year.
Adding further pressure on the greenback, the Federal Reserve has rolled out stimulus measures including dollar swap lines in a bid to boost credit markets and steady the economy.

Investing.com - The dollar was on the defensive in early European trade Thursday, with traders turning to perceived riskier currencies amid optimism surrounding a potential Covid-19 vaccine as well as solid economic data.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 97.013.
EUR/USD was up 0.2% at 1.1272, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2493, while USD/JPY was largely flat at 107.50. 
News emerged late Wednesday that a potential Covid-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX) produced positive results in early-stage human trials, raising optimism that an antidote to the virus which has infected over 10 million and killed over 500,000 people can be found.
This followed economic data which had suggested that a global recovery is starting to gain momentum:  U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded more than expected in June, with the manufacturing activity index by the Institute for Supply Management, released Wednesday, hitting its highest in 14 months. Similar surveys from China, Germany and France all rebounded too.
Attention will now shift to the official U.S. employment report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) - a day early due to Friday’s U.S. public holiday - which is expected to show an increase of 3 million nonfarm payrolls in June.
However, it’s debatable whether the U.S. economy can sustain its recovery as coronavirus infections surge in many states -- Arizona, California, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas all had record-high new case reports on Wednesday -- resulting in rolled back efforts to reopen their economies.
“We are more nervous about the July [nonfarm payrolls] figure that will be published in early August, which could significantly disappoint markets,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “If renewed containment measures across numerous states make it unviable for businesses to operate then it will only add to the problems in the jobs market.”
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard offered up a grave warning about the financial implications if the coronavirus outbreak isn’t contained.
""Without more granular risk management on the part of the health policy, we could get a wave of substantial bankruptcies and (that) could feed into a financial crisis,"" Bullard said in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday.

He added emerging market currencies would bear most of the brunt in the event that investors and traders became defensive once again. But he said global conditions would gradually improve, meaning less exposure to the dollar.
While the real is expected to strengthen almost 8% from Wednesday's rate in one year, it would still end 2020 with a 21.2% loss, the biggest since the currency crashed almost 33% in 2015 as Brazil struggled with major political upheaval.
The rouble is forecast to trade 4.7% higher in 12 months after probably shedding 9.6% this year, which would be its weakest since 2018, when it was hit by sanctions related to Russian businessmen and the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain.
GLOBAL LIQUIDITY SUPPORT
Global liquidity, another determinant for high yielding assets, will probably remain a positive driver for emerging market currencies in coming months as the world's top central banks take stock of the likely repercussions from the latest coronavirus spike.
Extremely low rates and quantitative easing (QE) steps adopted since the initial virus wave will probably keep supporting currencies from developing nations. But no additional stimulus seems to be in the pipeline for now.
Trade frictions are also set to play a role in the near future, despite Washington's efforts to tone down any excessive rhetoric against China in the face of persistent differences with the United States.
Estimates for the yuan show the strictly-regulated unit trading at or above the mark of 7.0 per dollar in the next 12 months, an additional sign of caution for the world's No.2 economy and for the entire set of EM FX.
The Indian rupee is forecast to fall 5.7% on an annual basis by the end of year, its 9th year in the last 10 in the red. After that, it is expected to recover marginally to trade nearly 1.0% higher a year from now.
The outlook for South Africa's rand  remains challenging. ""Funding pressures will prove to be the dominant driver in the period ahead, leading to further ZAR weakness,"" said Anezka Christovova, FX strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
The Turkish lira  is set to depreciate nearly 20% this year and then remain stable. It has traded relatively steady since mid-May, after officials said the government was searching for funding among allies.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will gain towards the end of the year if Britain and the European Union (EU) thrash out a deal over future trade relations as most analysts expect, a Reuters poll found.
But London and Brussels remain far apart in negotiations, and the risk of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 remains firmly on the table, analysts also say.
The pound , down around 6.5% against the dollar this year, made some gains on Tuesday - largely due to end-of-quarter rebalancing rather than improvement in sentiment or reaction to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to fast-track 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) of infrastructure investment.
Cable was hovering around $1.24 on Wednesday and the June 25-July 1 poll of almost 60 foreign exchange analysts said it would be at the same level in one and three months' time.
It will then shift up a gear to $1.27 by end-December when Britain's transition period after leaving the EU is due to expire. The pound will be around 4% stronger than current levels at $1.29 in a year, the poll found.
""Our central scenario is that some kind of Brexit deal or delay will be agreed. With this in mind, we think sterling will rise, however, given recent developments, the risks to our forecasts are to the downside,"" said Simona Gambarini at Capital Economics.
While successive Reuters polls since the June 2016 referendum decision to leave have said the two sides would agree a deal, forecasts for the 12-month horizon were wide, ranging between $1.18 and $1.49, highlighting the uncertainty. [ECILT/GB]
The dollar's dominance will slowly melt away over the coming year on weakening global demand and a sombre U.S. economic outlook but a second shock from the coronavirus would push it higher. [EUR/POLL]
Over 10.5 million people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and there are fears that as countries ease restrictions, there will be a resurgence of cases, as has been seen in some U.S. states.
Against the euro the pound will not see much action for a year. One euro will be worth the 90 pence it was on Wednesday in six months. In a year it will fetch 88 pence, the poll found.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive against more growth-sensitive currencies on Thursday, following upbeat U.S. and European economic data but renewed worries about the coronavirus blunted more aggressive risk taking.
The market sentiment gained an additional boost from the news that a COVID-19 vaccine developed by German biotech firm BioNTech (O:BNTX) and U.S. pharmaceutical giant  Pfizer  (N:PFE) has shown potential and was found to be well tolerated in early-stage human trials.
Sterling traded at $1.2477 , flat in early Thursday trade but having gained 1.1% so far this week. The Australian dollar fetched $0.6919 , having gained 0.7% on the week.
The euro changed hands at $1.1252 (EUR=), maintaining its gain of 0.3% since the start of week.
The U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded more than expected in June, with the manufacturing activity index by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) hitting its highest in 14 months as firms and businesses resumed operations.
Similar surveys from China, Germany and France all pointed to a recovery in factory activity while the ADP National Employment Report showed June private payrolls increased 2.369 million jobs.
Data for May was revised upward to show payrolls surging 3.065 million, instead of tumbling 2.76 million as previously estimated.
More closely watched jobs reports from the government, due later in the day ahead of U.S. public holiday on Friday, are expected to show an increase of 3 million non-farm payrolls in June.
There are concerns about whether the U.S. economy can sustain its recovery as coronavirus infections surge in many parts of the United States.
California dramatically rolled back efforts to reopen its economy on Wednesday, banning indoor restaurant dining in much of the state, closing bars and stepping up enforcement of social distancing and other measures as COVID-19 infections surge.
Against the yen, the dollar traded at 107.45 yen , having fallen 0.4% the previous day as it was unable to recover losses made in Asian trade on safe-haven bids.

""If we see further spikes in coronavirus cases, I would expect both the dollar and the yen to strengthen against other currencies,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan market research at J.P. Morgan.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's dominance will slowly melt away over the coming year on weakening global demand and a sombre U.S. economic outlook, according to a Reuters poll of currency forecasters whose views depend on there being no second coronavirus shock.
Despite fears a surge in new COVID-19 cases would delay economies reopening and stymie a tentative recovery, world stocks have rallied - with the S&P 500 finishing higher in June, marking its biggest quarterly percentage gain since the height of the technology boom in 1998.
Caught between bets in favour of riskier investments, weak U.S. economic prospects as well as an easing in the thirst for dollars after the Federal Reserve flooded markets with liquidity, the greenback fell nearly 1.0% last month. It was its worst monthly performance since December. [ECILT/US]
While there was a dire prognosis from the top U.S. medicalexpert on the coronavirus' spread, the June 25-July 1poll of over 70 analysts showed weak dollar projections as Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday reiterated the economic outlook for the world's largest economy was uncertain.
""The dollar rises in two instances: when you see risk off or when there is a situation where the U.S. is leading the global recovery, and we don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon,"" said Gavin Friend, senior FX strategist at NAB Group in London.
""The U.S. is playing fast and loose with the virus, and chronologically they're behind the rest of the world.""

Currency speculators, who had built up trades against the dollar to the highest in two years during May, increased their out-of-favour dollar bets further last week, the latest positioning data showed.
About 80% of analysts, 53 of 66, said the likely path for the dollar over the next six months was to trade around current levels, alternating between slight gains and losses in a range. That suggests the greenback may be at a crucial crossroad as more currency strategists have turned bearish.
But more than 90%, or 63 of 68, said a second shock from the pandemic would push the dollar higher. Five said it would push the U.S. currency lower.

Much will also depend on debt servicing and repayments by Asian, European and other international borrowers in U.S. dollars.
While an early shortage of dollars in March from the pandemic's first shock pushed the Fed to open currency swap lines with major central banks, international funding strains have eased significantly since. In recent weeks, usage of the facility has reduced dramatically.
That trend is expected to continue over the next six months with major central banks' usage of swap lines to ""stay around current levels"", according to 32 of 46 analysts. While 13 predicted a sharp drop, only one respondent said use of them would ""rise sharply"".
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against six other major currencies, has slipped over 5% since touching a more than three-year high in March.
When asked which currencies would perform better against the dollar by end-December, a touch over half of 49 respondents said major developed market ones, with the remaining almost split between commodity-linked and emerging market currencies.[EMRG/POLL]
""The dollar is so overvalued, and has been overvalued for a long time, it's time now for it to come back down again, as we head towards the (U.S.) election,"" added NAB's Friend.
Over the last quarter, the euro has staged a 1.8% comeback after falling by a similar margin during the first three months of the year. For the month of June, the euro was up 1.2% against the dollar.
The single currency was now expected to gain about 2.5% to trade at $1.15 in a year from around $1.12 on Wednesday, slightly stronger than $1.14 predicted last month.
While those findings are similar to what analysts have been predicting for nearly two years, there was a clear shift in their outlook for the euro, with the range of forecasts showing higher highs and higher lows from last month.
""In comparison to even a month or two ago, the outlook in Europe has improved significantly,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG.
""I think that makes the euro look relatively more attractive and cheap against the likes of the dollar. We're not arguing strongly for the euro to surge higher, we're just saying, after the weakness we have seen in recent years, there is the potential for that weakness to start to reverse.""

642,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro’s best rally in more than two years looks set to extend, with a host of market metrics reflecting growing confidence in Europe’s pandemic response.
The currency completed its biggest two-month advance against the dollar and a trade-weighted index of its strength rose for a third quarter. At the same time, options are relaying optimism on multiple fronts -- signaling gains versus the greenback over the next three months, and a drop in bearish sentiment versus the yen, a traditional haven currency, to the lowest since January.
The latter in particular is an indication of confidence that governments in the euro area will continue to be quick to protect the public from a second wave, or an extended first wave, of the pandemic better than many other regions with lockdowns or social restrictions.
That in turn suggests a better chance of the region outperforming in terms of economic growth, potentially attracting larger capital inflows that would support the euro. And with bets the Federal Reserve will implement yield-curve control on the rise, coupled with the slim chance of rate cuts by the European Central Bank, interest-rate differentials aren’t potential headwinds for the euro.
Euro optimism isn’t limited to options. The spot market too is sending bullish signals in the form of two developing technical patterns versus the dollar.
The so-called golden cross formation on the daily chart suggests the common currency has the potential to challenge its June 10 high of $1.1422, which is backed up by Tuesday’s first close above the 21-monthly moving average since August 2018.
Still, expectations remain relatively low for such a move to happen soon, as shown by demand for options that pay out on large moves. That, in turn, suggests there are still risks that euro-bullish views may not pay out, should demand for havens return on renewed virus and trade-war concerns, or around the U.S. elections in November.
On Wednesday, the euro swung between modest gains and losses, following data that showed factories across the euro area recorded a stronger performance than initially reported in June.

643,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the forecasts about dollar weakness, history shows that the greenback is poised to appreciate after November’s presidential election -- regardless of who wins.
The dollar strengthened in the 100 trading days after nine of the past 10 elections from 1980 to 2016, according to Richard Falkenhall, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm. The currency performed better following Democratic wins, rising an average 4% after these votes versus about 2% when Republicans prevailed, he said, noting that the 1984 and 2008 votes were excluded from this calculation due to outsized drivers beyond the election.
The findings “suggest that Joe Biden being elected for president would be the best possible outcome” for the dollar, he wrote in a note Monday. “It would then be a Democrat candidate winning his first term, both being positive factors for the USD in the past.”
Specter of Drawn-Out November Election Spooks Currency Traders
The greenback has defied naysayers this year, up 3% even as prognosticators forecast the currency will peak in the third quarter and weaken through 2021. A stream of bad news continues to undercut the dollar bears: coronavirus cases globally have exceeded 10 million, governments are battling the worst economic downturn in recent history and protests over racial injustice continue across the U.S., boosting haven demand.
Meanwhile, recent polls show the Democratic nominee Biden leading President Donald Trump, capturing the support of 50% of registered voters versus 40.4% for the president.
Of course, not all gauges of the dollar suggest strength is inevitable. While Falkenhall looked at a trade-weighted measure of the dollar against seven economies, a narrower index run by the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc. shows less historical agreement on the dollar’s direction after elections.
The dollar data “offers a taste” of what to expect later this year in the election cycle, Falkenhall wrote.

Investing.com - The dollar has drifted in early European trade Wednesday, with worries over the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus competing with encouraging economic data for prominence.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was largely flat at 97.343.
EUR/USD was flat at 1.1232, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.238, while USD/JPY was down 0.2% at 107.67. 
The U.S. recorded 47,000 infections on Tuesday, its biggest single-day spike since the pandemic began.
""Clearly we are not in total control right now,"" the country's top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, told a Senate committee on Tuesday, adding that cases could increase by as much as 100,000 daily if the outbreak is not contained.
That said, the foreign exchange market has traded in tight ranges Wednesday, with investors wary ahead of some closely-watched economic data.
German retail sales soared 13.9% in May, data showed Wednesday, rebounding strongly after the fall of a revised 6.5% in April, while the Chinese manufacturing sector showed promising signs of recovery, according to the Caixin manufacturing PMI. 
Later Wednesday, the U.S. Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index for manufacturing is expected to show that activity in June continued to recover from the 11-year low marked in April, while Thursday’s closely-watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report is forecast to show the economy added 3 million jobs in June.
Also of interest will be the release of the FOMC minutes from the June meeting.
“Of particular interest are the Fed members' discussions on yield curve control, as mentioned by Fed Chair Powell in his prepared remarks at the press conference after the policy announcement,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Elsewhere, Sweden’s Riksbank is set to make its latest rate announcement later Wednesday,  but market participants are not expecting a policy change.
“This time around it seems likely that the Riksbank will present actual forecasts for growth inflation and the policy rate rather than just different scenarios as was the case in the previous policy report,” Danske Bank added.
EUR/SEK traded flat at 10.4682 and USD/SEK at 9.3193.
Elsewhere, the Russian ruble fell to its lowest in over a month after fresh allegations in the U.S. press that it offered Afghan militia bounties for killing U.S. servicemen. The reports have heightened fears that the U.S. will broaden existing sanctions on Russia.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held onto gains against the yen on Wednesday ahead of data expected to show U.S. manufacturing activity and hiring continued to recover from the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The euro was hemmed into a narrow range as traders awaited data on Germany's manufacturing sector, retail sales, and the jobless rate to gauge the health of the eurozone economy.
A surge in coronavirus infections in the U.S. south and southwest has worried some market participants, but most investors are betting this will not be enough to derail a broader rebound in the global economy.
""The dollar will be supported against the yen if U.S. economic data are positive, but U.S. yields are not rising much because of speculation about yield curve control,"" said Shusuke Yamada, head of foreign exchange and Japan equity strategy at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities.
""The euro looks stable, but there are questions about Brexit and the pace of economic reopening, which means the euro could soon be overvalued.""
The dollar traded at 107.99 yen  in Asia on Wednesday, close to the highest in three weeks.
The mood for the yen soured after Bank of Japan data showed business sentiment fell to an 11-year year low.
The euro (EUR=D3) held steady at $1.1234. Against the British pound, the common currency (EURGBP=) traded at 90.65 pence following a 0.9% decline on Tuesday.
Sterling  bought $1.2394 as it held on firmly to the previous session's gains, but traders may be reluctant to buy the pound further due to worries about Britain's trade negotiations with the European Union.
The U.S. Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing due later on Wednesday is forecast to show that activity in June continued to recover from an 11-year low marked in April, when the coronavirus paralysed large swathes of the global economy.
Investors also await the closely-watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Thursday, which is expected to show the economy added 3 million jobs in June.
The dollar has managed to remain strong against the yen due to signs of economic revival, but the greenback has failed to make headway against commodity currencies, showing that some investors remain wary of downside risks.
Normally Treasury yields would rise due to an improving economy, but benchmark 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) have moved in a narrow range around 0.65% since mid June, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said policymakers discussed yield curve control, which can be used to cap bond yields.
The Australian dollar  bought $0.6895 on Wednesday following a 0.5% gain on Tuesday.
The New Zealand dollar  stood at $0.6447, also holding onto gains from the previous session.
The Swiss franc , a currency traditionally sought as a safe haven during times of heightened risk, also perked up against the greenback, which shows that positive economic data alone is not enough to support broad-based dollar gains.
The euro has lacked conviction amid mixed signals about the eurozone economy and limited progress in talks on the future trade relationship between Britain and the EU.

Data due later on Wednesday from Germany are expected to show retail sales in Europe's largest economy fell at a slower pace but the manufacturing sector continued to contract, which could hurt sentiment for the euro.

Investing.com – The pound surged against the dollar after clawing back early-day losses Tuesday, as the Bank of England suggested that the U.K. was on track for a stronger than expected rebound following its worst slump in more than 40 years in the first quarter.   
GBP/USD rose 0.74%, to $1.2385.
U.K. gross domestic product declined 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020, its worst slump since 1979.
The Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane was set for a V-shaped recovery but flagged rising unemployment as a growing threat to the recovery. ""It is early days, but my reading of the evidence is so far, so V,"" Haldane said.
""Today's unexpected downward revision to GDP numbers came as the pound seemed on course for its fourth consecutive down week against its main peers, largely on concerns about the risk of the U.K. leaving it transitory membership of the EU's single market at year end and shifting to trading on less-favourable WTO terms,"" Action Economics said in a report.
The strong rebound in the pound comes despite little sign of progress on the latest post-Brexit talks.
EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier slammed Britain for choosing not to extend the deadline for the transition period that ends on December 31 and trying to keep as many single market benefits as it can while showing little compromise on key sticking points including the level playing field, security and fisheries.

Investing.com - Sterling was under pressure in early European trade Tuesday, with the release of the final gross domestic production figure suggesting that the contraction in the first quarter was deeper than originally estimated.
The U.K.’s GDP dropped 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak, according to a revised estimate released by the Office of National Statistics Tuesday.
This figure was revised downward from the previous estimate of a 2% decline and marks the joint largest quarterly contraction of the U.K. economy since 1979.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), GBP/USD was down 0.2% at 1.2276, just above the one-month low of 1.2252 on Monday, and down almost 2% over the last week. EUR/GBP fell 0.1% to 0.9133, after climbing to a three-month high of 0.9175 on Monday, and is up 1.6% on the week.
The pound has been weighed down by a number of factors of late, not least is the economic damage caused by the shutdown associated with the coronavirus and the way the government has handled the outbreak.
There are concerns about how Britain's government will pay for its planned infrastructure program following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's promise to increase spending. Johnson is due to give a keynote speech on the topic later Tuesday.
""This is the moment for a Rooseveltian approach to the U.K.,"" Johnson said Monday, referring to former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ‘New Deal’ program, whose job-creating public works projects helped the United States recover from the Great Depression.
On top of this, there is great uncertainty surrounding Britain’s trading relationship with the European Union as little progress has been made on agreeing a trade pact.
“Indeed, the most senior government official (considered a soft Brexiteer) is now being replaced by more hawkish David Frost, the U.K.’s chief Brexit negotiator,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Elsewhere, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 97.645. EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.1212, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.64. 
The greenback has seen demand as a safe haven as the Covid-19 pandemic showed no signs of adapting, while the “worst is yet to come” given a lack of global solidarity, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said at a briefing in Geneva Monday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Safe-haven currencies were on the back foot on Tuesday as hopes of an economic turnaround boosted stock prices while sterling was under pressure after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised a ""Rooseveltian"" boost to public spending.
Spurring fresh optimism on the U.S. economy was pending home sales data, which showed that housing market activity had quickly recovered in May from a plunge triggered by the pandemic.
Pending home sales, based on contracts signed last month, surged 44.3%, compared to economists' forecast for 18.9% rise.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a plan to fast-track infrastructure projects on Tuesday, stoking investor worries about the country's bulging debt load.
U.K. public debt has exceeded GDP for the first time since 1963, after the government borrowed a record £55bn in May to fund its fiscal stimulus programs to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, government data showed earlier this month.   
Fears are also running high that the U.K is preparing for a no-deal Brexit after a government spokesperson reportedly confirmed Johnson would ""be ready to leave the transition period on Australia terms if an agreement (with the EU) could not be reached.""
The U.K and EU resumed post-Brexit talks on Monday, but hopes of a resolution on key issues such as fishing policy and the commitment to a ""level playing field"" in competition are fading.
The U.K. has made it clear it wants to take control over access to its waters and fish when the Brexit transition period ends, rather stick with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which set fishing quotas among EU member states.  
While the EU has suggested it is willing to compromise on some issues, the economic bloc has reiterated it would not agree to any measures that threaten the four freedoms - goods, people, capital, services -  of the single market.
EU Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier met with his U.K. counterpart David Frost on Monday to kick off back-to-back trade negotiations.
""Barnier signalled on Wednesday his willingness to find a compromise on the level playing field and fishing issues,"" Morgan Stanley said.
But Frost ""rejected the possible compromise floated in the media – that the U.K. would have the right to deviate from the EU’s level playing field if it chooses to but the EU could impose tariffs if this happens,"" it added.",,,,,

With dollars growing ever more scarce, the Lebanese pound has plunged since last year by nearly 80% from an official peg of 1,507.5, now only available for vital imports.
Inflation, unemployment and poverty have soared. The government is trying to enlist IMF help to claw out of the crisis, which is seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since its 1975-90 civil war.
Banks have since October frozen people out of their savings and blocked transfers abroad. Under an April central bank circular, they now pay depositors with dollar accounts in cash in the local currency at a ""market rate"" within limits.
At the new withdrawal rate, depositors would still lose around 50% of the value of their savings relative to the informal market, where two currency dealers said the greenback traded at 8,000 pounds on Monday.
Two bankers at two of Lebanon's biggest lenders said they raised the rate from 3,000 to 3,850. One of them described it as an attempt ""to narrow the gap between the bank withdrawal rate and the rate on the parallel market,"" which has become a main source of cash.
A banking official said several banks started adopting the 3,850 rate this week and others would soon follow.
There was no official announcement from Lebanon's banking association.
A fresh, sharp fall in the currency this month has sparked new protests across Lebanese cities.
The central bank has sought to stabilise the rate at exchange houses by setting a unified rate with them each day, with penalties for dealers not adopting it. That announced rate was 3,850/3900 pounds for buying and selling on Monday.
Still, importers say they have found it nearly impossible to secure dollars.

Investing.com - The dollar has drifted lower in early European trade Monday, as sentiment surrounding currency traders continues to fluctuate between optimism over a global economic recovery and worry as the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 97.170.
EUR/USD rose 0.4% to 1.1259, GBP/USD climbed 0.4% to 1.2378, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 107.11. 
The World Health Organization reported almost 190,000 new cases for the 24-hour period through early Sunday, a new high. This means the total number of global Covid-19 cases has now topped the 10 million mark, with more than 500,000 deaths recorded globally.
America continues to be hard hit, accounting for over a quarter of all cases. A number of the more populous states, including California, Texas and Florida, have had to curtail the opening of a number of businesses, as cases nationwide soar to record levels. 
“Renewed lockdowns stand to delay the U.S. recovery,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “But we also know that Congress and the Fed have a light trigger-finger when it comes to fresh stimulus.”
Economic data released globally has tended to suggest a swift recovery. Profits at China's industrial firms rose for the first time in six months in May, while in the U.S. retail sales have bounced strongly and economists are forecasting there will be three million jobs added in June after a shock 2.5 million gain a month earlier. The offshore yuan strengthened 0.2% against the dollar in response.
Investors will now look to eurozone confidence data, at 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT) for the latest gauge of the region's economic health, as well as to German and Spanish preliminary inflation numbers for June.
Additionally, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to host French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on Monday, with the two leaders likely to discuss what strategy to employ to get agreement on the recovery fund for the region.
Hopes for a united EU response to the virus and a swift regional recovery have helped the single currency post gains of around 1.5% against the greenback so far this month.
Elsewhere, the EU-U.K. free trade negotiations are scheduled to restart this week in Brussels, amid few signs of any progress.
“We expect little progress during the summer months, keeping the uncertainty about UK growth and trade outlook in place and in turn making GBP one of the G10 FX underperformers,” said ING.
Sterling hit a month-low on Friday, and has fallen by 0.7% over the last week against both the U.S. dollar and the single currency. U.K. consumer credit and mortgage lending data are due at 4:30 AM (8:30 GMT)."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar struggled to make headway on Monday, and riskier currencies inched ahead, as investor sentiment swung between hopes for a global economic recovery and fears that a fresh wave of coronavirus cases could undermine the revival. 
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the greenback retreated from a one-week high hit on Friday and dipped 0.2% to 97.303. The trade-exposed Australian and New Zealand dollars rose about 0.2% to near the middle of recent ranges.
California ordered some bars to close on Sunday, following similar moves in Texas and Florida, as cases nationwide soar to record levels. Washington state and the city of San Francisco have paused re-opening plans.
Yet elsewhere - from New York to Europe and Asia - re-openings continue apace and data illustrates a swift rebound.
""The debate is still very live,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow. ""How seriously are you going to bet that retreats in reopening in selected U.S. states are enough to actually puncture the rally?""
For now the dollar has dithered rather than deflated.
The Aussie and kiwi are headed for monthly gains around 3% but made most of that ground in the early days of June and have tracked sideways since then. [AUD/] 
The Aussie , which has gained nearly 25% from a more than 17-year low hit in March, was last up 0.2% at $0.6877. The kiwi  rose by the same margin to $0.6431.
Simultaneous safe-haven gains also point to heightened caution, even as the thirst for dollars has eased off as the U.S. Federal Reserve has flooded markets with liquidity.
The yen  and Swiss franc  seem set for their best months against the greenback this year, with gains of 0.6% and 1.5% respectively. Each made a small rise on Monday.
Elsewhere, sterling  bounced 0.3% from a month-low plumbed on Friday as investors fretted about whether Britain can settle a post-Brexit trade pact with the European Union. A fresh round of talks is due to begin this week.
RISKS BALANCED
Globally half a million people have died from COVID-19, about a quarter them in the United States. 
The jump in U.S. cases has been most pronounced in a handful of Southern and Western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively and investors are closely watching to see the extent and severity of renewed restrictions.
Elsewhere, rollbacks of lockdowns seem to be trouble free and outbreaks in other global hotspots, from Germany to Melbourne and Beijing appear localised, for now.
And economic data continues to surprise on the upside.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose for the first time in six months in May, China's national bureau of statistics said on Sunday, suggesting the recovery is gaining traction.
Investors are looking to eurozone confidence data due at 0900 GMT and German inflation figures at 1200 GMT for the latest gauge of the region's economic health.
It is also an important week for U.S. data with the ISM manufacturing report on Wednesday and payrolls on Thursday, ahead of the Independence Day holiday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is also testifying on Tuesday.
The euro (EUR=) is set to wrap up its best two months against the dollar in a year and a half, as hopes for a united EU response to the virus and a swift regional recovery propel the single currency ahead about 2.5% since the beginning of May.
The single currency rose 0.2% to $1.1239 in Asia on Monday.
""Given the euro area's high (sensitivity) to global trade, we expect more global uncertainty around the pandemic to keep any upside capped,"" ANZ bank analysts said in a note.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, retreating from earlier gains.  Spiraling global COVID-19 numbers dampened hopes of a quick economic recovery and gave the safe-haven asset a boost earlier in the session.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, there are now over 10 million COVID-19 cases and over 500,000 deaths globally as of June 29. These numbers indicated that global economic recovery would be slower and more painful than expected.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.11% to 97.293 by 12:50 AM ET (5:50 AM GMT).
Some investors raised concerns that the re-implementation of lockdown measures in some U.S. states to curb the spiking number of cases would delay the U.S. economic recovery. California was the latest state to implement such measures on Sunday as some bars were ordered to shut.
“A double-dip U.S. recession is possible if widespread restrictions are re-imposed, leading to a surge in the dollar... lockdowns are the key indicator to watch,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) FX analyst Joe Capurso told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.14% to 107.06. Earlier in the day, Japan reported a 12.3% decrease in May retail sales year-on-year.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.14% to 0.6869 and the NZD/USD pair rose 0.03% to 0.6425.

655,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea said unemployment and other economic fallout from the pandemic will accelerate already existing declines in South Korea’s potential growth rate.
Higher jobless rates, more people dropping out of the workforce, and a delayed recovery in corporate investment will exacerbate a downward trend that started before the coronavirus, the bank said in a report Monday.
Slowing population growth and the economy’s maturation were reasons the BOK last year cut its estimate for South Korea’s potential growth rate to 2.7%-2.8% for 2016-2020, down from rates above 3% for decades before that. An economy’s potential growth rate measures what it can theoretically produce without causing inflation to rise or fall.
BOK’s Lee Flags Need to Normalize Policy Once Crisis Calms
One positive factor that could help slow the decline would be if productivity improves amid a switch to a more a digitalized economy, the BOK said. President Moon Jae-in has pledged to create more tech jobs as part of a “New Deal” project that aims to boost South Korean innovation.
Still, the BOK’s report said it could take two to four years for employment to reach pre-pandemic levels, raising the risk of a jobless recovery as business hire less and people stop looking for work.
South Korea Jobless Rate Jumps to 10-Year High Amid Pandemic
Inflation may also stay low for some time as people respond to the crisis by saving more and shifting to online shopping, the BOK said. The central bank also said the government’s latest expansionary policies are aimed at disaster relief and unlikely to drive prices higher.
The BOK has cut its key rate by 75 basis points this year to a record low 0.5% to cushion the economy and keep companies afloat. This month, it extended its unlimited liquidity supply via repurchase agreements until the end of July.

Investing.com – The dollar posted a weekly loss as data showed bearish bets on the greenback surged to a more-than-two-year high.
Speculators increased their net short dollar position in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, the largest bearish position since April 2018.
The value of the net short dollar position rose to $16.83 billion in the week ended June 23, compared with a net short of $15.69 billion the previous week, Reuters reported.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.07% to 97.09.
Rising Covid-19 infections in the U.S. and other parts of the world did little to spark investor appetite for the safe-haven greenback, and one analyst suggests that is a sign to sell into dollar strength.
The dollar may attract safe-haven demand in the wake of renewed market uncertainty, but any rebound remains a selling opportunity, Unicredit (MI:CRDI) said.
""It is true that the dollar is once again benefiting from fears of a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, but so far these concerns have not been sufficient to trigger an aggressive return to the greenback,"" Unicredit FX strategist Roberto Mialich said."

The currency crisis poses the biggest threat to the stability of import-reliant Lebanon since the 1975-90 civil war.
Food importers were being quoted a price of 7,500 to buy dollars on Friday, said Hani Bohsali, president of the Syndicate of Importers of Foodstuffs, Consumer Products and Drinks. A second market participant cited exchange rates of 7,300/7,600.
That compares to rates of 3,850/3,900 at licensed foreign currency dealers and the official peg of 1,507.5, which the central bank is still applying for imports of wheat, medicine and fuel.
The central bank said ""liquidity was secured"" at the 3,850/3,900 rates in a statement announcing the activation on Friday of a new electronic trading platform at licensed currency dealers. Black market volumes were ""tiny"", it said. 
But Bohsali said food importers have only been able to secure 20% of their foreign currency needs at the licensed dealers in the last two weeks, leaving them dependent on the parallel market for the rest.
""Food imports are being reduced. It cannot continue this way. If you can't find dollars to import, you don't have any guarantee that if you ship something you will be able to get the funds for it.""
The pound has continued to slump despite President Michel Aoun's pledge on June 16 that the central bank would supply the currency market with dollars to prop it up.

Lebanon defaulted on its foreign currency debt in March, citing critically low reserves.

658,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Option traders are stacking bets that the euro’s drop versus the Swiss franc has gone too far -- and charts seem to agree.
More than 80% of contracts that changed hands since Monday were aimed at a stronger euro, data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation show. That contrasts with the trend seen earlier in June, when demand for bullish and bearish options were more balanced.
Europe’s shared currency is heading for a third weekly drop against the franc -- a favorite of haven seekers during bouts of risk aversion -- on concern about a second wave of Covid-19 infections and the threat of a global trade war. A chart pattern now in the making, known as the inverted hammer, suggests that the trend is about to reverse.
A decisive euro rebound against the Swiss currency could be a sign of global market mood over the coming months -- one where the typical summer lull tempers any sentiment upheavals fueled by pandemic and economic headlines.
This week’s euro-bullish transactions in options went through amid an overall slowdown in trading flows -- and that’s significant.
The drop in volumes suggests investors see a smaller chance of market turmoil into the summer -- which would work against a haven asset such as the franc. This is also reflected in a slump in appetite for options that pay out on large moves, with a one-week demand gauge having fallen to the lowest since early March and below its past-year average.
The euro was little changed Friday around 1.0637 versus the franc in relatively quiet trading, largely dominated by quarter-end flows. Should it stay near these levels, technicals will support views for a rebound in the common currency.
The pair is about to complete a bullish pattern on the weekly chart. This points to a reversal and suggests that the latest drop was just a correction of the sharp rally seen between May 18 and June 5.
Such a formation has been seen only once since the Swiss National Bank removed the 1.20 exchange-rate floor in 2015 -- and the euro rose by more than 4% within two months after that.

Investing.com - The dollar has maintained its strong tone in early European trade Friday, with traders seeking out the safe haven as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. continue to grow. 
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1% at 97.420. 
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1211, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2408, while USD/JPY was down 0.1% at 107.13. 
“With data likely to play second fiddle to the virus headlines, investors are likely to remain rather jittery today, with the balance of risks for pro-cyclical assets tilted to the downside and the dollar may remain supported on safe-haven bids,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Economic data pointed to an economic recovery in the U.S. Thursday, with another small drop in jobless claims and a substantial rise in durable goods orders. Friday offers up spending data as well as Michigan sentiment numbers.
However, this has tended to be overshadowed by news of a record number of new coronavirus cases throughout the U.S., with state health departments reporting a total of over 37,000 new cases on Thursday.
“There is a growing concern that new restrictive measures will be deployed. In turn, while we maintain a positive medium-term view on risk assets, it will mostly be about infection numbers that drives sentiment in the short-term,” ING added.
That said, the second virus wave no longer appears to be a U.S.-only story. The development in EM/developing countries continues to be problematic for their recoveries and not least tourism. 
“It is hard to see things get much better until we get to a vaccine, which so far is still on track to arrive within 6-9 months,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Remaining in the emerging market sphere, the first round of the presidential election is set to be held in Poland on Sunday. 
Incumbent president Andrezej Duda from the government party is favorite to win, but if he doesn’t get a majority there will be a second round in two weeks’ time, likely against the main opposition candidate Rafal Trzaskowski from the pro-market reform party civic platform. 
“Should Trzaskowski surprise and win this could be positive for sentiment toward Polish assets including PLN,” said Danske Bank.
USD/PLN traded 0.1% higher at 3.9712 and EUR/PLN 0.1% higher at 4.4520.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Friday as caution over rapid rises in U.S. coronavirus cases cast doubt over the reopening of the economy, keeping the allure of its safe-haven value.
The dollar index (=USD) stood at 97.360, having pared a large part of this week's losses.
Against the yen, the dollar traded at 107.17 yen , having gained 0.5% in the overnight session.
The euro eased to $1.1221 (EUR=), losing steam after hitting a one-week peak of $1.1348 on Tuesday though the currency has maintained weekly gains of about 0.4%.
Sterling slipped to $1.2422 , off this week's high of $1.2541 touched on Wednesday.
Also supporting the greenback was the broader rise in corporate demand typically seen towards the end of the month. That helped the dollar stay firm despite the stubbornly upbeat risk appetite seen in global equity markets, which comes even as new coronavirus infections surge. 
The governor of Texas temporarily halted the state's reopening on Thursday as COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations surged and new daily cases around the country climbed to record levels.
""When you look at things like restaurant bookings data, it looks as if they are heading back to square one after a strong recovery,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""If this continues day by day, people will likely have to review their recovery scenario.""
Data on Thursday showed weak demand is forcing U.S. employers to lay off workers, keeping new applications for unemployment benefits extraordinarily high, even as businesses have reopened.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits stood at a seasonally adjusted 1.48 million for the week ended June 20, down 60,000 from a week earlier but still double their peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
More economic data is due next week, including U.S. jobs and manufacturing surveys but ahead of that trade could be moved by month-end and quarter-end flows, traders said.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar fetched $0.6891 , stuck in its rough $0.68-0.70 range in the past couple of weeks.
The Turkish lira stood flat after the country's central bank unexpectedly halted a nearly year-long easing cycle on Thursday, by keeping its key interest rate unchanged at 8.25% and citing upward pressure on inflation.
The lira stood at 6.8538 per dollar .

The Mexican peso hovered above a one-month low after Banxico, the country's central bank cut its interest rates by 50 basis points as expected late on Thursday.

662,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- There may be opportunities for investors to sell the dollar as the global economy rebounds in the second half of 2020, but they need to be fussy about what to trade it against as the U.S. currency looks set to remain broadly resilient.
That’s the view of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists who recommend selling the greenback against currencies of industrialized nations with strong current account balances, such as Sweden and Japan, even as they caution against taking an underweight stance on the dollar more generally. On the emerging-markets side, JPMorgan recommends sticking to bets on currencies with high real yields like Mexico’s, Russia’s and Indonesia’s, according to a mid-year outlook published by the bank on Thursday.
The global economic collapse triggered by attempts to contain the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has spurred drastic policy action from central banks around the world, compressing interest-rate differentials between countries. That means structural drivers should become more relevant for currencies, while carry trades should become less salient in driving the market, according to Paul Meggyesi, JPMorgan’s head of global foreign-exchange strategy.
“In a zero interest-rate world, currency markets should become more fundamental,” Meggyesi wrote in the report. “Currencies with structural resilience, big current account surpluses, and cheap valuations should do well, and thus we expect the Japanese yen to perform well.”
The Japanese yen has gained against the greenback over the past three months, but has lagged against a majority of its Group-of-10 peers as riskier assets have outperformed. The dollar, meanwhile, has dropped against all of its G-10 counterparts and a Bloomberg gauge of the currency is down more than 6% from its late March peak, although it has plateaued in recent weeks amid growing concern about the virus and the economy.
“To transition to a period of outright weakness in the dollar, we would need to see a stronger and more completeglobal economic recovery than our economists are expecting,” Meggyesi wrote. For the dollar to weaken to the levels at the start of the year, global growth would need to be around 2 percentage points higher or there would need to be a 3 percentage point deterioration in the relative growth outlook between the U.S. and the rest of the world, according to the strategist.
He expects trade-weighted measures of the dollar to be broadly flat over the next three months or so and then bounce by 0.5% to 1% around the turn of the year as the economic scarring from the pandemic “becomes more apparent and dulls enthusiasm for the recovery trade.”
One factor that could weigh against that is America’s presidential election. According to JPMorgan, a change of administration could potentially dent the dollar by 2% to 3%, depending on the policies of Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic challenger to incumbent Donald Trump.

Investing.com - The dollar has come back into favor in early European trade Thursday, with concerns about the mounting coronavirus cases and the impact on the economic recovery prompting a return to the safe haven.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 97.293.
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1239, GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2410, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 107.15. 
Signs of a sharp uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases in many U.S. states have resulted in traders seeking the reassurance of the greenback amid concerns a second wave of infections could trigger fresh lockdown measures.
The states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have already decided that visitors from states with high rates of infections will have to self-isolate for 14 days.
“It will now be crucial to keep an eye on the rising number of hospitalizations as this will likely determine whether new extensive lockdowns will have to be put in place and/or reopenings stalled further,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Eyes will also focus on the weekly unemployment numbers, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21 are expected to be 1.3 million, while continuing jobless claims are expected to fall to 19.9 million. These figures would represent progress, but unemployment is still at post World War II highs. 
Elsewhere, USD/CAD rose 0.1% to 1.3649, after Fitch downgraded Canada’s long-term foreign currency debt rating to AA+ from AAA, the first treble-A rated nation to lose this prestigious mark since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak.
The rating agency cited a bigger general government deficit this year, with Canada set to emerge from the recession with much higher public debt ratios given the spending needed to counteract a sharp fall in output in the wake of the virus.
Turkey’s central bank is scheduled to announce its latest interest rate decision later Thursday, and is widely expected to cut its one-week repo rate once more, to 8.0% from 8.25%.
Turkey’s key interest rate was at 24% almost a year ago following a currency crash, and the central bank has authorised nine straight rate decreases since.
USD/TRY traded at 6.8587, up 0.1%, some way off the all-time high of 7.27 reached in early May.
The Bank of Mexico is also expected to cut its key rate by another 50 basis points at its policy meeting later in the day.

The Australian dollar traded at $0.6864 after losing 0.90% the previous day while the Canadian dollar drooped to C$1.3644 to the dollar, not helped by Fitch's downgrade of Canada's sovereign rating.
The rating firm cut Canada's rating to ""AA+"" from ""AAA,"" citing deterioration of the country's public finances in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Against the yen, the dollar also jumped back to 107.05 yen from a 1 1/2-month low of 106.075 touched on Tuesday.
The International Monetary Fund slashed its 2020 global output forecasts further as it sees deeper and wider damage from the pandemic than first thought.
It now expects global output to shrink by 4.9%, compared with a 3.0% contraction predicted in April, with U.S. output now forecast to shrink 8.0%, more than 2 percentage points worse than the April forecast.
While massive stimulus by many governments have cushioned initial blows from the pandemic, helping many companies survive lockdowns, investors fear a deeper recession would mean corporate income will not recover as quickly as they have initially hoped.

Bob Prince, Co-Chief Investment Officer of Bridgewater Associates, said U.S. stimulus efforts may be able to support corporate cash flows for the summer but that economic risk from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to extend far beyond that.

Investing.com – The dollar bounced sharply from session lows on Wednesday on renewed safe-haven demand on fears that the progress over reopening the economy could be rolled back as coronavirus cases continue to mount.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.48%, to 96.07.
Signs of a sharp uptick in Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and abroad have put risk assets on the backfoot, with many fearing a second wave of infections could trigger fresh lockdown measures to contain the outbreak.
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will require visitors from states with high rates of infections to self-isolate for 14 days, N.Y. Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday.
The restrictions come as hotspots such as California and Florida have reported a daily record in new cases.
California reported more than 5,000 new coronavirus cases in its daily update Tuesday, the highest number reported in a day since the pandemic began.
Governor Gavin Newsom said he was prepared to reimpose stringent coronavirus restrictions to contain the outbreak.
Florida, meanwhile, confirmed that cases in the state jumped by 5,508 on Tuesday, a record, and now total 109,014.
The fall in risk sentiment took its roll on both the pound and euro, helping the greenback push higher.
EUR/USD fell 0.43% to $1.1256 and GBP/USD fell 0.76% o $1.2422.
Others, however, are more cautious on the dollar, citing the Federal Reserve's action to support the economy.

666,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders in the $6.6 trillion-a-day global currency market are starting to contemplate the unthinkable: The possibility that the U.S. presidential election produces no clear winner, leading to protracted uncertainty.
A measure of volatility in the yen -- a traditional safe haven -- shows a steep jump in price movement around election day that persists into 2021, while options contracts for both November and December are pricing in a premium versus October. That contrasts with the run-up to the 2016 election, when gauges of turmoil reflected only a temporary minor uptick in volatility as investors overlooked the likelihood of a Trump presidency, or any controversy surrounding the results -- leaving them painfully exposed to those events.
Not this time. Investors are concerned the election could spill into late November due to recounts and court challenges, according to Greg Anderson, Bank of Montreal’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy. While it’s impossible to disentangle the impact of fears about the coronavirus or the economy on expectations for price swings later this year, the extra political uncertainty has helped lift the premium on dollar-yen options for just after the November elections to an eight year-high versus shorter-term counterparts.
Investors will “have to consider how the FX market would react to a protracted phase of uncertainty if the outcome was unclear,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of foreign-exchange strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
The prospects of a delay are a reminder of the 2000 election match-up between Republican nominee George Bush and Democratic candidate Al Gore, when a recount dispute fueled a month-long legal fight. It was a wake-up call for traders, who’d seen the options premium remain subdued throughout the vote and suddenly had to price in political uncertainty.
This time around they are already gearing up for an impasse. Polls are showing Donald Trump lagging Democratic nominee Joe Biden in key states. And the president has already questioned the validity of voting by mail, tweeting on Monday that “millions of mail-in ballots will be printed by foreign countries” and that the election will be “rigged” against him if voting by mail persists.
While those claims were made without offering evidence, more Americans are requesting to vote by mail, and that could complicate the tallying process. In what could be a hint of things to come, New York State’s election board said it won’t begin counting votes in Tuesday’s Democratic primary until July 1, so that it can double-check county records. The nation’s fourth-most populous state has seen a 10-fold increase in requests for absentee ballots.
No wonder then that traders are racing to take cover. Implied volatilities for this year’s Election Day are as elevated as they were during the height of the turmoil seen in mid-March, at over 30%. Four years back, overnight volatility in the dollar-yen pair spiked past 50% the night election results were being tallied.
The sentiment has also been reflected in the equity market with options investors piling into hedges against losses around the Nov. 3 voting period.
There’s plenty at stake. The pandemic has left more than 20 million Americans out of work. Meanwhile, the biggest wave of civil rights protests in 50 years has sent people flooding into the streets. And simmering in the background, U.S.-China tensions are once again heating up, while there’s risk that the virus could intensify again as the election approaches.
Election Bets
For investors across asset classes, there may be no better place to express a view on the U.S. outlook months down the road than the currency market, which offers a way to bet on America’s prospects relative to practically every other country.
Olivier Korber, FX and derivatives strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA, suggests watching the options spread between the dollar-yuan and dollar-yen currency pairs as one way to track investors’ perception of the Trump-Biden match-up. These pairs capture global risk sentiment, geopolitical tensions and trade relations, he said.
“Past elections did not have such geopolitical implications” given Trump’s actions on trade and tariffs, Korber said. “Compared to past elections, the economic agenda of the two candidates will matter more than ever because 2020 will be a recession year.”
In the view of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists including Paul Meggyesi, investors should buy a six-month dollar-yen versus dollar-franc correlation swap to take advantage of an increase in implied volatility around that time. In general, as volatility increases, correlations usually follow.
“Economic uncertainty is likely to be compounded by political uncertainty,” they said.

Investing.com - The dollar weakened in early European trade Wednesday, with traders seeking riskier currencies, latching more on to the signs of economic growth rather than the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
At 3 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 96.595, from a high of 97.719 at the start of the week.
EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1322, having been as low as 1.1167 on Monday, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.60, off the six-week low of 106.06 seen earlier this week.
These moves came after the release of better than expected PMI data Tuesday in Europe, the U.K. and the U.S., which lifted sentiment.
“The uptick in global PMIs was a key driver of EUR/USD jumping nearly a figure to 1.1330,” said analysts at Danske Bank. ”These PMIs continue to suggest the macroeconomic surprises are positive (beginning with U.S. payrolls a while back). In our view, positive surprises will be enough to propel further USD weakness for a while longer, even if positioning data suggest EUR speculators are nearly stretched long. We forecast 1.15 on three month horizon.”
There’s also the Covid-19 virus to consider, with the number of cases mounting worldwide and with several U.S. states seeing record infections.
""The dollar and risk sentiment are likely to remain broadly negatively correlated, barring the U.S. displaying clear and enduring leadership in the global economic recovery, something hard to square with the grim U.S. news on Covid,"" Reuters reported Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB, as saying.
That said, sterling has struggled to post gains against the dollar amid worries that the U.K. government is opening up the economy too quickly. 
On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers in England will be able to reopen from 4 July. The four countries that make up the United Kingdom are regulated separately when it comes to health matters.
However, both the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty stressed Mr Johnson's plan was not ""risk-free"". 
Additionally, a number of influential health leaders have signed an open letter published in the British Medical Journal Wednesday, warning that the U.K. runs a ""real risk"" of a second wave of coronavirus.
At 3 AM ET, GBP/USD was down 0.1% to 1.2513 and EUR/GBP was up 0.2% at 0.9046.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was under pressure on Wednesday, after upbeat data in Europe boosted the euro and helped stoke hopes for a global economic recovery, underpinning appetite for riskier currencies.
The euro (EUR=EBS) is headed for its best month against the dollar since October, and inched higher to $1.1316 in the Asia session. The Australian dollar  led small gains in risk-sensitive currencies, firming about 0.2% to $0.6942. [AUD/] 
IHS Markit's June euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a broad gauge of economic activity, beat expectations with a bounce to 47.5 on Tuesday from May's 31.9.
Although that is still below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, the improvement in business sentiment - together with upbeat data in Britain and the United States - lent support to a sense that growth is returning at pace.
The next test comes from a German business confidence survey due at 0800 GMT, with markets expecting another strong rebound.
In the meantime, the positive signals seem enough to offset worries about a resurgence in U.S. coronavirus cases, and to draw bets - reflected in a rising gold price - on broad dollar weakness. 
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar was flat at 96.653, just above a one-week low touched on Tuesday. The trade-exposed Korean won  was up half a percent and the Aussie's rise put it near the top of a range it has held for weeks. 
""We're still seeing the counteracting forces of the economic recovery on the one hand and concerns around the virus spreading on the other hand,"" said Kim Mundy, FX analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in Sydney.
""But overnight the Eurozone PMIs lifted, PMIs in the UK lifted and PMIs in the U.S. lifted, so the economic story, that we are seeing the recovery, is helping to underpin the commodity currencies.""
The British pound found support, recovering from a three-month low touched against the euro on Tuesday (EURGBP=) and holding steady against the dollar  at $1.2514.
The yen  held on to overnight gains at 106.53 per dollar, reflecting caution and also corporate flows as investment juggernaut SoftBank (T:9984) started a $21 billion sale of its stake in U.S. telco T-Mobile (O:TMUS).
Against the tide, the New Zealand dollar  dipped to $0.6468 after the country's central bank said the balance of economic risks remains to the downside and it is prepared to use additional monetary tools as necessary. 
The RBNZ kept interest rates on hold, as expected. 
NEVER MIND THE VIRUS, HERE COMES MORE STIMULUS
The moves extend markets' stubborn optimism in the face of spiking coronavirus cases in the United States, Germany and elsewhere.
For a second week Texas, Arizona and Nevada set records in their coronavirus outbreaks and 10 other states from Florida to California were grappling with surging infections.
Australia's Victoria state has re-imposed restrictions on gatherings amid an upswing in new cases there and German has imposed localised lockdowns after an outbreak at a meatpacking plant.
So far the market assumes there is a very high bar to shutting down entire economies again, so the impact on business activity will not be too great - at least as yet.
""We expect over the coming couple of weeks as we get more clarity on this, state Governors will be in a better position to decide how to proceed,"" RBC Capital Markets' Chief U.S. Economist, Tom Porcelli, said of the U.S. cases.
""For now, we have not seen any negative shift in consumer behaviour as a result.""

Remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, flagging more fiscal stimulus aimed at getting people back to work quickly, also helped the positive mood.

Investing.com – The dollar wobbled before retreating on Wednesday morning in Asia. Investors increased their risk appetite earlier in the day after Europe and the U.S. released positive data on Tuesday.
Europe's IHS Markit’s Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for June surpassed expectations, jumping to 47.5 from the 42.4 mark predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. The figure also topped May’s 31.9.
Although short of the 50-mark indicating growth, the better than expected figures, alongside similarly upbeat data from the U.K. and the U.S., gave investor sentiment a boost.
But investors are also continuing to keep a wary eye on the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases and the impact on the global economic recovery.
There are over 9.2 million cases globally as of June 24, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Meanwhile, investors are also continuing to monitor simmering U.S.-China tensions. Although White House trade advisor Peter Navarro quickly clarified his comment that its trade deal with China was “over” by stressing that phase one of the deal was still intact, the confusion still sent markets on a wild rollercoaster ride.
“The market swings underscore how much the market is worried about possible deteriorations in U.S.-China relations,” Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank, told CNBC.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.02% to 96.590 by 11:42 PM ET (4:42 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.6% to 110.14.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.21% to 0.6944 and the NZD/USD pair slid 0.22% to 0.6474. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said earlier in the day that with the balance of economic risks remaining on the downside, it is prepared to use additional stimulus measures where necessary.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.17% to 7.0694 and the GBP/USD pair slid 0.01% to 1.2517, giving up some of its earlier gains."

Turnover for the $6.6 trillion a day FX markets is difficult to quantify, but data from some of the world's top trading and settlement platforms, including Refinitiv and CLS, showed volumes hit a record in March.
""We saw a lot of rebalancing flows, which contributed to a large pickup in volume as volatility increased,"" said Guy Debelle, chairman of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, a panel that monitors developments in the FX markets.
""Whereas in '08 liquidity was sparse and transaction volumes were very low, in March this year, whilst it wasn't great, the volumes going through the system were some of the largest we've seen,"" Debelle, who is also the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said in a call.
Neill Penney, managing director of data provider Refinitiv, said customer volumes rose by half in March and inter-dealer volumes more than doubled.
""Comparing to previous crises, the investment the industry has made in automation and risk management has really paid off, in terms of letting the market as a whole continue to function,"" he said.
March saw volatility soaring to multi-year highs as investors panicked over the impact of the coronavirus in an environment where traders had to work from remote locations.
Akira Hoshino, head of FX at Citi in Tokyo, said March turnover doubled from February, but that was not unprecedented, and that volatility fell almost as fast as it rose thanks to central bank liquidity.
In 2008, it took more than a year for volatility to fall by half - something which has already happened in the three months since March. A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) FX volatility index <.DBCVIX> is trading below 8%, more than halving from a peak of over 16%.
""Timely and decisive central bank and government action - this is the key to stop markets collapsing,"" Hoshino said. ""Without these actions, we may have seen more collapsing markets, but it's not happening.""  
Refinitiv's Penney noted adoption of algorithmic trading in the FX markets rose during the crisis.
While in aggregate, only 56% of the overall market is traded electronically, the share is much higher in some products, like spot trading, where the market share is nearly 90%. Some other products, such as FX forwards, are also catching up.

671,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","DUBAI (Reuters) - A further slump in Iran's rial is ""temporary"", Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday after the currency sank to its lowest value in decades. 
A U.S. dollar was offered for about 205,000 rials on Tuesday, up from 188,200 rials on Friday and 198,000 rials on early Monday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com, which tracks the unofficial market. 
The official rate, cited by the central bank website, is 42,000.
""The shock created in the foreign exchange market is temporary and has no fundamental economic reason and balance must return to the exchange market,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying by Iran's state TV.
The latest fall comes four days after the U.N. nuclear watchdog urged Tehran to stop denying it access to two suspected former nuclear sites. 
Iranian authorities have dismissed as ""an exaggeration"" the rial's slump following the resolution, which has raised diplomatic pressure on Tehran. 
""Psychological warfare against Iran as well as the creation of an unrealistic anxiety among people, are the main causes of the recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange market,"" said Rouhani.
In 2018, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that mainly targeted its main source of revenue - its oil exports - as well as its financial sector. 
Iranian authorities said last week that the country's oil revenues have dropped to $8.9 billion in the year to March, from $119 billion in 2011, Iranian media reported.

Already strained by U.S. sanctions, Iran's economy has further deteriorated during the coronavirus outbreak. Iran is one of the worst-affected countries in the Middle East with 209,970 infected cases and 9,863 deaths, according to Iran's health ministry.

 Investing.com - The dollar was steady in early European trade Tuesday, after some volatile trading in Asian hours on the back of uncertainty surrounding the standing of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
 At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was largely flat at 96.993, having climbed as high as 97.207 earlier in the session. 
 USD/JPY was up 0.3% at 107.19, EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.1268, while AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.6911, having earlier fallen at low as 0.6858.
 The dollar surged higher, and risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian dollar weakened, after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the trade deal with China is ""over"".
These moves didn’t last long however, as Navarro quickly backtracked, stating that his comments had “been taken wildly out of context.”
U.S. President Donald Trump provided further assurance by tweeting that the deal was “still intact.”
Tensions between Washington and Beijing are already fraught, and Navarro’s comments revived memories of the trade war between the two countries, which roiled financial markets and dented global growth before being partially settled with the deal in January.
Another currency in the spotlight of late has been sterling. 
The Bank of England added to its quantitative easing program last week, but it also suggested that the pace of its asset purchases is set to decline in the remainder of the year.
However, sterling failed to gain any support from this due to fears about the depth of the economic downturn, which means the market remains focused on the odds of  the Bank cutting rates below zero in future. In addition, negotiations with the EU over post-Brexit trading relationships have produced little hope for a breakthrough.
“This is important for sterling's prospects as the stalling UK-EU trade negotiations suggest that the market will likely take a glass half empty approach and keep GBP risk premium in place,” said ING, in a research note.
“This suggests GBP is to continue struggling, EUR/GBP to move to /above 0.91 this summer and GBP/USD in turn to underperform EUR/USD,” ING added.
At 03:05 AM ET, GBP/USD gained 0.1% to 1.2471 and EUR/GBP was up 0.1% at 0.9041.

Although there were few details on actual policy implications, his comments resurrected fears that already tense relations between United States and China may now worsen and disrupt supply chains and capital flows.
Navarro linked the breakdown in part to Washington's anger over Beijing's not sounding the alarm earlier about the coronavirus outbreak.
The Australian dollar lost 0.5% to $0.6874 , erasing earlier gains while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.65% to $0.6440 .
The offshore Chinese yuan dropped 0.35% to 7.0815 per dollar .

Until early Tuesday, risk currencies had been supported and the dollar had been soft as markets clung to hopes of an economic recovery from the pandemic despite rising infections in some parts of the world.
Traders bought into riskier bets as some big cities in North America, such as New York and Toronto, eased lockdowns and reopened their economies, though that came against setbacks elsewhere in the fight to contain the coronavirus. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a recordincrease in global novel coronavirus cases on Sunday, with spikes in infections in southern and western U.S. states as well as Brazil. 
Against a basket of currencies (DXY), the dollar gained 0.16% to 97.189.
The safe-haven yen was little moved, stuck at 106.96 yen per dollar . The euro slipped a tad to $1.1252 (EUR=).
Investors are now looking to European business activity surveys due later in the day.

Economists expect the euro zone composite flash PMI to rise to 42.4 in June from 31.9 last month as European economies gradually reopen.

Investing.com – The dollar looked set to snap a four-session winning streak on Monday, but analysts warn that the path lower for the greenback will run out of road as the Covid-19 pandemic's lasting impact on the global economy will renew safe-haven demand. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.52%, to 97.03. The dollar has fallen nearly 7% from its highs in mid-March.
""As the pandemic sweeps on through Latin America, the global economy isn't out of the woods yet, and I suspect we need to see the worst of the global picture before we can see a long-term dollar downtrend start properly,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said.
The fall in the dollar on Monday was driven by a ""technical correction"" following Friday's rally, led by demand related to option and future expiries, the bank added.
The warning against bearish bets on the greenback comes days after data on Friday, showed the traders increased their net short dollar position, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The dollar was also dragged lower by losses against the pound and euro as risk-on sentiment kept a lid on safe-haven demand.

Investing.com - The dollar has drifted lower in early European trade Monday, but that’s off three-week highs as investors looked for safety amid renewed worries about a second wave of coronavirus infections.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 97.493. The index had earlier climbed to a daily high of 97.677, a level not seen since the start of this month, while USD/JPY was up 0.1% at 106.94.
“The main driver has been concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and arguably the speed of the global recovery, emphasizing the still strong FX versus risk correlation,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Sunday saw a record 183,020 cases globally, according to the World Health Organization, with the bulk in North and South America. The number of global cases is now almost 9 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
EUR/USD last traded up 0.1% at 1.1191 after dipping to a three-week low of 1.1168 in early trade. This followed the failure of the European Union leaders to agree on a structure for the planned 750 billion euros Covid-19 recovery fund.
“From the comments from the leaders, the disagreement does not seem to be about the size of the package, but rather about grants versus loans distribution,” said Danske Bank.
This is proving a tricky obstacle, with four members [Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands] being particularly vocal in their opposition to the plan to pay out the majority of this stimulus in grants instead of loans.
The EU leaders are aiming to reach an agreement before the summer break, which may mean late July/early August, potentially at a physical meeting.
GBP/USD gained 0.2% to 1.2379, holding just above a three-week low, weighted as well by Brexit worries since there has been little progress in trade discussions with Europe.

(Reuters) - A global crunch for U.S. dollars that was a hallmark of the early moments of the coronavirus crisis appears to have passed, the latest milestone in a remarkable turnaround in financial conditions engineered by the Federal Reserve and other top central banks.
Data from the Fed on Thursday showed its peer banks around the world this week tapped it for the fewest dollars in nearly three months, and it was the main factor driving a surprise reduction in the Fed's $7 trillion balance sheet - the first since February and the largest since the waning days of the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
GRAPHIC: Fed's balance sheet shrinks, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeqdwmpr/Pasted%20image%201592513591207.png
The balance of the Fed's foreign exchange swaps with other central banks dropped by $92 billion as of Wednesday to $352.5 billion from $444.5 billion a week earlier. The total amount outstanding in the swap lines, designed to ease a surge in demand for U.S. currency in the participating banks' jurisdictions during the early weeks of the crisis, was the lowest since early April.
Coupled with other indications of slackening demand for the Fed's bevy of emergency liquidity facilities, the reduction in currency swap line usage is for many analysts a sign that global financial markets are returning to near-normal after being upended by the coronavirus outbreak in February and March. 
In that period, stocks plunged into bear markets at record speed, risk premiums in credit markets mushroomed and demand for greenbacks overseas well outstripped supply, making the dollar unbearably pricey for foreign governments and companies with dollar-denominated liabilities. The Fed acted swiftly to try to restore order, and along with facilities aimed at U.S. markets, expanded currency swap line agreements to nine central banks in addition to the five with which it has had standing agreements.
""Given the restored health of (dollar) funding markets, and the fact that the swap lines will still be there serving as a backstop, we expect this handoff from central bank liquidity to the market to be relatively uneventful,"" said John Roberts, U.S. rates strategy analyst at NatWest Markets.
But the drop-off from here may be swift.
""We expect a more rapid decline over the coming months as the majority of the swaps will roll off,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) economists wrote in a note to clients on Friday.

In addition to the decline in swap line usage, several of the Fed's emergency facilities have seen falling demand in the past several weeks. Outstanding balances in programs offering credit to primary dealers, commercial paper issuers, money market mutual funds and direct loans to banks to meet reserve requirements have all plateaued or fallen sharply since May.
Perhaps most emblematic of the turn is the plunge in demand for repurchase agreement - or repos. Amounts outstanding in these short-term funding deals between commercial banks and the Fed are at their lowest levels since last September, when a cash-squeeze forced the central bank to pump billions of dollars into the market.
The repo squeeze exploded onto the scene again in mid-March as state after state issued stay-at-home orders and mass closures of non-essential businesses in an attempt to control the spread of COVID-19. 
On March 18, the Fed recorded a record repo balance of nearly $442 billion. On Wednesday last week, that had plunged to $79 billion after a one-week decline of $88 billion. It was the lowest level since mid-September when the Fed was first forced to intervene in that market.
Zoltan Pozsar, managing director, investment strategy and research,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said in a research note last week that if foreign banks ""no longer need the U.S. dollars they took from the swap lines and stop lending in the FX swap market, the Fed will be there to step in with the repo facility."" 
GRAPHIC: Repo demand weakest since September, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmgmxqvr/Pasted%20image%201592579378496.png
The waning demand has come as markets more widely have regained their footing after March's big swoon. Stocks have recovered around 90% of their losses, companies are raising capital in the bond market at a record pace, and risk premiums embedded in corporate bonds yields are back to where they were in early March.
Dollar funding costs, too, have largely normalized. For investors in Japan and Europe, whose central banks were the largest users of the Fed's swap lines since March, the cost to access greenbacks to fund transactions is back where it was in late February.
One potential upside to easing dollar-funding pressures is it makes U.S. assets such as Treasuries more appealing, which could support demand for U.S. government bonds amid a record $3 trillion borrowing binge by the Trump administration to fund pandemic relief efforts.

""The cheapening of USD funding has made it more attractive for foreign investors to buy long-dated US Treasury bonds,"" NatWest's Roberts said. ""We see this as one measure that would support foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries.""

Investing.com – The dollar reversed its small earlier gains on Monday morning, with investors facing the possibility of renewed lockdowns as COVID-19 cases spiked over the weekend.
Sunday saw a record 183,020 cases globally, according to the World Health Organization, with fears of a second wave of cases and a return of restriction measures to curb the number of cases.
The number of global cases is almost 9 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.06% to 97.523 by 11:23 PM ET (4:23 AM GMT). Investors initially turned to the safe-haven asset, helping it reach a three-week high, as their risk appetite decreased, before starting a retreat.
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.02% to 106.89.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.38% to 0.6858 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.23% to 0.6420, with the AUD reversing its earlier retreat. Australia’s second-largest state, Victoria, re-imposed some restrictions with a spike of cases over the weekend.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will announce its latest benchmark interest rates settings on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates at 0.25%, but investors will be looking for any mention of future negative rates, as well as the tone of the announcement.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.10% to 7.0777. China said earlier in the day that it would leave its benchmark lending rate steady.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.16% to 1.2376.
Some investors expected sentiment to be risk-adverse for the coming week.
“It won’t take much for the market to see this as a liquidity headwind...and when we mix in rising concerns around a renewed COVID crisis then it may keep risk on the back foot this week,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told CNBC."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar touched a three-week high and commodity currencies were stalled on Monday, as renewed worries about a second wave of coronavirus infections sent investors into safer assets.
Moves were modest, as few expect spiking case numbers to prompt fresh lockdowns at this point.
But with the World Health Organization reporting a record increase in global cases on Sunday, especially in the Americas, and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) protectively closing 11 U.S. stores last week, there was no immediate cause for optimism either.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the dollar held on to small gains won last week and moved a whisker higher to 97.744, before edging back to flat.
The greenback was marginally lower against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and steady on the yuan, euro and British pound.
The yen  was firm at 106.92 per U.S. dollar, not far from a one-month high of 106.58 hit earlier this month.
""We expect the FX markets to remain caught between recovering economic indicators and concerns about a second-wave of COVID-19 infections in the week ahead,"" analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note.
Barclays expects continued pressure on the kiwi, but said gains in the euro are possible if Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data due on Tuesday beats expectations and recommended going long on euro/dollar, with a $1.14 target.
The single currency (EUR=) last traded flat at $1.1176 after dipping to a three-week low of $1.1168 in early trade - squeezed as European Union leaders remain divided on how to structure a planned COVID-19 recovery fund.
The pound , weighted as well by Brexit worries since there has been little progress in trade discussions with Europe, held just above a three-week low at $1.2363.
LOCKDOWNS LINGER
Total global coronavirus cases are now over 8.7 million and focus has been on whether this may drive fresh lockdowns.
While that is seen as unlikely, localised restrictions have been re-imposed in Beijing to contain an outbreak there and Australia's Victoria state has also re-imposed limits on gatherings to contain a spike in cases.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  slipped against the U.S. dollar and yen in morning trade, before paring losses to inch about 0.2% higher against both. It last bought $0.6844 and 73.18 yen. 
The New Zealand dollar  was also a fraction stronger at US$0.6418, though both currencies have lost the momentum they had in early June.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand announces its latest benchmark interest rate settings on Wednesday. It is all but certain to keep rates on hold at 0.25%, leaving markets to focus on its tone and on talk of negative rates in the future.
Besides Tuesday's PMI data and German sentiment surveys, also due on Tuesday, investors will also be looking to U.S. consumer sentiment figures to gauge whether encouraging signs of recovery from May can be sustained. 
A jump in net short bets on the U.S. dollar last week to their highest since 2018 suggests investors are positioned for the world's rapid economic recovery to continue apace - leaving plenty of room for surprises on the downside.
At the same time, a slowdown in global central banks drawing on the U.S. Federal Reserve's emergency dollar funding lines could also provide dollar support.
While the reduction in central bank currency swaps, on one hand, suggests a return to normality, it also marks a pullback in one aspect of the Fed's enormous support for global markets.
""It won't take much for the market to see this as a liquidity headwind,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.

""And when we mix in rising concerns around a renewed COVID crisis then it may keep risk on the back foot this week.""

680,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 08:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- June is shaping up to be a good month for Southeast Asia’s currencies, with every one gaining.
The rebound is narrowing coronavirus-induced losses sustained by just about every foreign exchange in the region this year. While the Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit all showed improvement, the Philippine peso is by far the best-performing currency in 2020 with its 1% gain.
The rupiah, which has surged 15% this quarter, may be positioned to challenge the peso given strong foreign demand for the nation’s debt. Here’s a closer look at the main factors influencing the region’s FXs in the second half.
Peso
The peso’s outperformance is partially due to an improving current account, with imports in April down by the most since 2009 as the nation was under lockdown.
However, it is facing growing headwinds from declining oversees remittances. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has also signaled concern over the appreciation by intervening to stop further gains. Investors will be awaiting guidance on the currency from BSP’s policy meeting on Thursday. The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged after slashing rates by 125 basis points this year.
Rupiah
Foreign funds have returned for local debt, attracted by the second-highest yields in Asia, after selling about $9.5 billion of government bonds in February and March. There have just been $996 million of inflows since then, indicating potential for further rupiah gains.
Bank Indonesia still considers the currency as undervalued amid low inflation in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, and expectations that the current account deficit will narrow to 1.5% this year. However, near-term gains maybe limited as the central bank cut its key rate by 25 basis points last week, opening the door for further easing.
Baht
The Thai baht rose 5.8% this quarter, narrowing the year’s loss to 3.4%. The nation’s current account surplus has given it a boost, but it’s dwindling in the absence of tourism revenues in the lockdown. However, rising gold prices have provided some support for the bullion trading hub.
Headwinds to baht’s further gains are likely to come from the Bank of Thailand. It warned this month it’s ready to take steps to ensure the currency’s strength doesn’t hurt the economy. Investors will be monitoring the Wednesday policy meeting, where it’s widely expected to keep its key rate unchanged at 0.5%, to see there are currency-related measures.
Singapore Dollar
The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages the currency against major trading partners as a policy tool, rather than using interest rates like other central banks. While the nation’s relaxation of virus-related curbs last week is positive for the local currency, data on Tuesday is forecast to show core inflation has deteriorated further in May.
That’s likely to support the MAS’ current stance of allowing for a weaker currency to spur the trade-reliant economy. The Singapore dollar is down more than 3% this year.
Ringgit
Volatile oil prices and political turmoil have weighed on the ringgit, leaving it at the bottom of the region’s currency rankings so far this year. After falling more than 5% in the first three months, it’s barely up 1% in the second quarter. The ringgit may struggle given FTSE Russell has kept Malaysia on a watchlist for possible exclusion from its World Government Bond Index.
Inflation data on Wednesday is expected to provide cues on Malaysia’s economy and any disappointment could set the stage for additional rate cuts.

Investing.com -- Europe’s relative success in beating back the novel coronavirus and its economic damage, plus a hotly debated plan in the region to inject stimulus into the recovery effort, may be signaling a buy opportunity in the euro.
The region has not suffered the same magnitude of problem that the U.S. faces, particularly as states and cities return to business only to confront a fresh round of cases and fears that more U.S. lockdowns are in the future.
Geoffrey Smith argues the bull case for the euro, saying the massive scale of the recovery fund being considered suggests that European leaders are putting budget balancing on the back-burner for the time being and that the mindset around burden sharing in the region has changed. 
Liz Moyer, on the other hand, says the outlook isn’t so rosy. Europe continues to struggle with growth, and the Covid-19 shutdowns have only exacerbated the eurozone’s issues with zombie companies and negative interest rates. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
The euro is a buy for one big reason: the pandemic has changed the face of eurozone fiscal policy and, quite possibly, the course of the European Union.
For one thing, the scale of the budgetary support being required means that austerity as a doctrine has been firmly canned. The chorus of hawks calling for a return to balanced budgets as soon as possible will be small and faint.
Germany, whose years of budget surpluses have acted as a brake on eurozone growth, is now on course to run a deficit of 7.5% of GDP this year. France’s will be north of 11%. The Netherlands’ may hit 12%. Evidently, austerity is enjoyed more as sadism than as masochism.
Just as importantly, the pandemic has made it impossible to sustain the fiction that Italy, Greece and maybe others can rescue themselves from sovereign bankruptcy by tightening their own belts.
This is the calculation behind the European Commission’s proposal for a 750 billion-euro Recovery Fund, to be raised by joint borrowing and distributed according to need, rather than economic weight. It’s the biggest step yet to acknowledging that a single currency needs a single treasury, backed the full faith and credit of its members. 
There is even talk – albeit so far just talk - of the ECB dusting off plans for a eurozone ‘bad bank’ that would take billions more in risks off the balance sheets of a stressed banking system. Finally, Europe gets it. The fat tail risks are visibly thinning. The lack of agreement at this week’s EU summit doesn’t change that - the EU doesn’t agree on anything without a good deal of haggling first. The key factor is that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has changed her mind - and is not reaping any backlash for it in domestic politics (her approval ratings, after 15 years in power, are at 80%).
That hasn’t spared the euro zone a sharp recession. But recent data suggest that the euro zone has at least as good a chance of a V-shaped recovery as the U.S., with new infection rates picking up only marginally as lockdowns come to an end across the continent. Data over the last two weeks have shown German business sentiment, French household consumption and eurozone car sales all rebounding faster than expected, helped by generous and effective measures to ensure job preservation.
Even doubts about the effectiveness of the ECB’s own policy appear less well-founded after this week’s events. The huge take-up of new ‘targeted long-term refinancing’ at rates as low as -1% on Thursday – the biggest operation in the ECB’s 21-year history -- has ensured a net injection of over 540 billion euros into the system. If a second wave of infections can be avoided, the economy is primed for a rebound. 
The Bear Case
The trouble with the euro is Europe has too many zombie companies, it still suffers from deeply negative interest rates, and there is major execution risk with the EU recovery fund.
A zombie company is one that doesn't earn enough to cover interest payments and would otherwise go out of business. More than a decade of low interest rates have benefited over-leveraged firms in Europe, creating these zombie companies, and they have feasted on cheap credit and government intervention in capital markets. 
Those at the lowest end of the credit spectrum now risk default amid a steep drop in consumer spending owing to Covid-19 lockdowns. They represent a broad cross section of sectors, such as transportation, cyclicals and industrials, not to mention travel and leisure companies. The latter won't come back until consumer confidence returns and the virus is subdued.
Meanwhile, central banks are already against the fence when it comes to rate cuts, as rates in the eurozone are already below zero. Negative rates were introduced in Europe around six years ago and have persisted as the eurozone struggled to come back from the 2008 financial crisis and its aftershocks, including the debt crisis of a few years later. Despite efforts to reverse course, the EU has had to instead further stimulate the economies to encourage growth, with uneven results.
While negative rates make borrowing cheap, they don’t restore confidence. A lack of spending by consumers and businesses can't be helped by central bank intervention. And they punish savers at a time when spending has been curtailed, forcing people into risk assets like stocks, a precarious move when volatility is rising and markets are over-bought.
Negative rates have also pressured Europe's banks at a time when the goals of growth and economic recovery from Covid-19 would demand banks lend more.
EU leaders can't even agree on the structure of the proposed Covid-19 recovery fund, Reuters reported this week. The proposed fund, a combination of grants and loans, is meant to finance the EU's recovery and smooth over differences in regions where there have been varying national responses to the crisis and related economic fallout.
Hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain could do well with the support because they have less financial flexibility than their northern neighbors, but there are major differences among members about the best way to provide that support without burdening their own taxpayers with extra risk.

Investing.com – The pound suffered back-to-back weekly losses against the greenback for the first time in more a month, and experts warn the rout is far from over as the risk of a no-deal Brexit and the potential for a second Covid-19 hit to the economy will offset monetary stimulus from the Bank of England.
GBP/USD fell 0.52%, to $1.2360, and remains on track to post a second-straight weekly loss for the first time since May 10.
The pound is likely to continue to cede ground to the dollar as the Bank of England's recent actions may not be enough to offset the economic impact from virus and the risk of a no-deal Brexit, said ActivTrades.
The Bank of England decided earlier this week to slow the pace of its bond-buying program from the current £10-to-11 billion run rate per week.
The sour turn in sentiment on sterling followed better-than-expected U.K. retail sales, released earlier today, that sparked some hopes that the economy was on the mend following reopening measures.
""The country is affected by the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in Europe, its shell-shocked economy may soon be facing a no-deal Brexit and potentially a second wave of the disease,"" ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista said.
The weakness in cable was also exacerbated by an uptick in demand for safe-haven following a rise in Covid-19 cases in the U.S., China and other parts of the world.
Against the backdrop of rising infections, and without the prospect of a vaccine anytime soon, some are worried the economic recovery is likely to stall.
""If there is a second wave, I would expect the unemployment rate to climb again. I think the real number today is around 20%,"" Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said on Twitter."
683,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Russia cut interest rates by the most in five years and signaled another reduction is likely to help stimulate an economy heading toward a deep recession.The benchmark interest rate was cut 100 basis points to 4.5%, the lowest level since inflation-targeting began in late 2014, the central bank said in a statement on Friday. Policy makers warned that a slump this quarter could be worse than expected and inflation could “significantly deviate” from a 4% target next year.
“If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings,” the bank said.
A majority of analysts in a Bloomberg survey forecast the move, while a handful had expected a smaller reduction. Five-year government bond yields fell the most in more than a month to trade near a record low and the ruble largely held onto gains.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a news conference at 3 p.m. Moscow time Friday.
After years of keeping borrowing costs in Russia relatively high, Nabiullina turned dovish earlier this year as the economy of the world’s biggest energy producer took a double hit from the coronavirus pandemic and slump in oil prices. Government bonds have rallied in recent months in expectation of deeper rate cuts.
The economy is forecast to contract by 5.5% in 2020, almost double the global rate, while a recovery next year will be slower than elsewhere, according to the International Monetary Fund. The central bank has said the economy may shrink as much as 6% this year.
Inflation was at 3.1% in mid-June, the bank said, and a recent slump in consumer demand due to Russia’s coronavirus lockdown is likely to add to disinflationary pressures. A 13% surge in the ruble against the dollar this quarter will also curb price growth, the central bank said Friday.
What Our Economists Say:
“With price pressure so weak, the central bank is likely to ease further. Another move could come as soon as July, though on a smaller scale.”
--Scott Johnson, Bloomberg Economics
Economists at Citibank in Moscow said last month that Russia could end up cutting the rate as low as 3%, without specifying timing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) was less dovish, forecasting 3.5%.
The rate reduction may erode a carry trade that has kept Russia’s government bonds and currency attractive to foreign investors in recent years, though other emerging markets are also easing monetary policy and the Federal Reserve has pledged to keep rates near zero.
“The ruble remains one of the highest yielding emerging-market currencies,” said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. “The central bank may have to intervene verbally in the coming days or weeks if today’s cut doesn’t dent the ruble’s bullish momentum sufficiently.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan, the biggest taker of cheap dollar funding from the U.S. Federal Reserve during the coronavirus pandemic, is weaning itself off that supply as it shies away from emergency swaps and returns to now sedate interbank markets.
When the Federal Reserve announced cheap dollar swap lines for global central banks in March as it tried to stave off a dollar funding crunch wrought by the pandemic, Japan was first out of the blocks.
From April through this week, the Bank of Japan was the biggest user of that cheap funding, taking up as much as $225 billion or more than half of what was on offer, as a banking sector addicted to investing and lending overseas struggled to get the dollars it needed from interbank markets.
That helped Japanese banks and funds to keep investing in higher-yielding U.S. stocks and global bond markets, as they have traditionally done, to beat the near-zero returns on offer at home.
Data this week, however, shows Japanese institutions are not keen to renew their three-month yen-for-dollars swap contracts with the Fed, which they access through the Bank of Japan.
The BOJ's outstanding dollar swaps with the New York Fed stood at $171.4 billion on June 18, which is down from a peak set in late May but still accounts for 61% of the Fed's total outstanding dollar swaps with major central banks.
(GRAPHIC - Outstanding dollar swaps with the New York Federal Reserve: https://tmsnrt.rs/37HWVNp)
Analysts expect Japan to steadily reduce its reliance on the Fed swap window, since interbank markets have normalised and banks would rather go there than borrow from what is deemed a central bank emergency window.
""Dollar borrowing costs have become cheaper, so Japanese banks would like to reduce unnecessary use of central bank swaps,"" said Osamu Takashima, head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan.
""Too much reliance on central bank swap lines is not healthy. Of course, Japanese banks recognise this.""
The cross-currency basis swap  - the premium investors pay over interbank rates to swap yen for three-month dollars - is currently 17 basis points. In March it blew out to 152 basis points.
In comparison, the Fed lowered the cost for dollar swaps with other central banks in March to 25 basis points over the overnight index swap rate , which was only 13 basis points at the time.
Japan's commercial banks pounced on the cheaper dollars to fund their dollar lending overseas, especially because some of these banks do not have enough dollar-denominated deposits to lend out, analysts said. 
Some of these cheaper dollars also made their way to Japanese institutional investors, who regularly turn to commercial banks to secure dollars for overseas investment. 
A spokesman for Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group (T:8316) said the bank used the BOJ's dollar funding to meet its customers' foreign currency needs but did not use the money to invest on its own accounts.
Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411) and Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group (T:8306) declined to comment.
In March, Japan's net investment in overseas equities surged to 1.8 trillion yen ($16.8 billion), the highest ever based on comparable finance ministry data going back to 2005, while investment in foreign bonds rose to an 18-month high of 3.5 trillion yen.
""I go to commercial banks to get my dollars, so it is certainly possible for the Fed's dollars to end up with Japanese who invest overseas,"" said one Japanese institutional investor, who declined to be named.

""I don't think this is a big problem. In terms of economic scale, our dollar funding needs are not that big.""

Investing.com - The dollar slipped back in early European trade Friday, but remains not far off a two-week high as an increase of Covid-19 infections increased worries about a potential second wave.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 97.352. The index had earlier climbed to a daily high of 97.495, a level not seen since the start of this month.
USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 106.91, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.6867.
An uptick in coronavirus cases in many U.S. states this week, along with rising hospitalizations, have prompted worries that some of the social distancing measures that have been lifted as the states reopened may have to be reintroduced.
More than 150 new cases have also been detected in Beijing since last week, prompting a lift in the city's alert level and a reintroduction of travel curbs.
Additionally, the initial jobless claims figures on Thursday showed an improving employment market, but the progress is slowing and suggests the recovery will take time.
Elsewhere, the euro was up 0.1% at $1.1212, a little above a two-week low of $1.1186 touched on Thursday.
EUR/USD is down around 0.4% this week, but still up 2.1% over the month, as questions grow about the political viability of the European Union's stimulus plan.
The bloc's 27 national heads get together Friday via a video conference to discuss the European Commission’s proposal to borrow 750 billion euros against the EU budget to try and boost the region’s recovery from its unprecedented economic downturn.
There are major disagreements over the size of the recovery package, and whether two-thirds of it should be paid to member states in grants as the commission proposes.
“The latest noises make an agreement already there seem unlikely (we think a deal may be struck as late as end-July),” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note, “but it will still give some clues whether the market EURphoria of recent weeks was warranted or whether the initiative is on course to be meaningfully watered down.”
Elsewhere, GBP/USD pushed 0.2% higher to 1.2452, helped by a jump of 12% in retail sales in May, rebounding partly from the record fall of 18% the month before.
Sales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, with DIY shops and garden centres reopening.
That said, the pair is just above a two-week low at 1.2403, following the Bank of England’s decision Thursday to increase its bond buying by just 100 billion pounds through 2021.
“We think it is likely that the BoE needs to expand the QE programme by GBP50-100bn in the autumn,” Danske Bank said.
Later Friday, Russia’s central bank is scheduled to meet, and is widely expected to cut its benchmark rate by one percentage point to 4.5% with forward guidance possibly showing further cuts are in the making.

686,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Britain’s budget deficit swelled further in May, taking government debt above 100% of gross domestic product for the first time since the financial year ending 1963.
Borrowing stood at 55.2 billion pounds ($69 billion) last month as spending surged and tax revenue plunged, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. It brings the total since the start of the fiscal year in April to 103.7 billion pounds, the biggest two-month total on record.
The increase reflects the cost of Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s unprecedented interventions to help prop up the economy, and the deficit is likely to swell further this year. The government is currently paying the wages for almost 12 million jobs and more stimulus including tax breaks and infrastructure projects potentially in the pipeline.
May’s number was the highest single month for borrowing on record, after April’s record figures was revised down to 48.5 billion.
The figures show central government spending surged almost 50% in the month and revenue plunged by over 28%. Net debt including Bank of England programs jumped to 100.9% of GDP.
The budget deficit in the current fiscal year, forecast to be around 55 billion pounds when Sunak took over, is now on course to top 270 billion pounds, according to the latest survey of private-sector economists compiled by the Treasury. That’s equal to about 14% of GDP, more than at any time since World War II.
The pain may last beyond this year, with a separate report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies Friday warning that persistent economic weakness could mean that U.K. borrowing levels remain elevated well into the future.
A slow recovery could mean borrowing could be as much as 70 billion pounds more in the 2024-25 fiscal year then was predicted in March, the IFS said, while even a faster rebound may mean the figure is 40 billion pounds higher.
For now though, the precise cost of the pandemic is so unpredictable that the Debt Management Office has only announced its issuance plans through the end of July. The total for the first four months of the fiscal year stood at 225 billion pounds, and the DMO will release an updated outlook on June 29.
The saving grace for Sunak is that support from the Bank of England is keeping borrowing costs manageable. The central bank increased its bond buying plan by 100 billion pound on Thursday, leaving them on track to buy almost 300 billion pounds of gilts by the end of the year.
Both numbers are still well above any figure before the virus hit, with monthly borrowing never exceeding 22 billion pounds even in the depths of the financial crisis."
687,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England’s surprisingly restrained tone on the economy hasn’t gone down well with investors.
Both the pound and U.K. government bonds were sold off after the central bank said Thursday it would slow the pace of its asset purchases, despite a 100-billion-pound ($124 billion) boost to the size of the program. With the BOE aiming to complete the program later this year, its weekly bond buying will likely be about half its current 13.5 billion-pound binge.
“If the BOE is now buying half as much, who will step in to fill the gap?” said Jordan Rochester, a group-of-10 currency strategist at Nomura International Plc. “This is a negative for U.K. assets.”
Governor Andrew Bailey added more pressure on gilts when he said policy makers didn’t discuss negative interest rates and yield-curve control at their meeting this week.
The market’s gloomy response to the BOE suggests U.K. assets will be more vulnerable to shifts in sentiment in the coming weeks, as investors grapple with uncertainties from Brexit to the growth shock from the coronavirus pandemic. Gilts in particular may face increased pressure when the Debt Management Office unveils its debt-sales plan for the next quarter on June 29.
Issuance in the 2020-21 fiscal year is already set to dwarf the financial-crisis era record as the U.K. stares at one of the deepest recessions among advanced economies. The OECD predicts a contraction exceeding 11% this year as the government struggles to map out a smooth exit from a lockdown imposed later than much of Europe.
Too Little?
The BOE was among the first major central banks to act in response to the crisis, cutting rates twice in March before the government shuttered most of the economy. It restarted its bond-buying program and said repeatedly -- including on Thursday -- that it stands ready to do more if necessary.
“If we get another episode of market stress like we saw in March, then they’ll pick up the pace again” with their bond buying program, said James Smith, an economist at ING in London. “So they are providing the necessary backdrop to keep markets in a calm state.”
Most market watchers, however, appear to focus on the risks the BOE chose not to mention -- from the prospect of a no-deal Brexit to a second wave of the virus. Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg, said the economic outlook doesn’t justify slowing down bond purchases.
“The risks associated with providing too much stimulus are much lower than the risks associated with providing too little,” he wrote in a report. “It is better to risk doing too much now and pull back if and when the economy rebounds faster than expected than do too little.”
Big Difference
Market reaction to the BOE was in stark contrast to what the European Central Bank saw earlier this month, when it announced a bigger-than-expected boost to its quantitative-easing program. That had helped propel Italian bonds higher, narrowing risk premiums across the region.
For  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)., the U.K. yield curve is set to steepen more than its U.S. equivalent, underscoring how the BOE’s policy is less accommodative than the Federal Reserve’s offer of “unlimited” support. The yield premium on 30-year gilts over their five-year peers jumped by the most in three months.
Speculation is growing that both nations will have to adopt yield-curve control as they remain reluctant to follow the negative interest-rate path taken by the Bank of Japan and the ECB.
BOE’s Chief Economist Andy Haldane voted to keep asset purchases unchanged, the only one in the monetary policy committee’s nine members to do so -- a sign that more easing isn’t a foregone conclusion. Bailey for his part said that policy makers didn’t discuss negative rates and isn’t targeting the yield curve.
Curve Control
“If you implement yield-curve control while the curve is selling off, it will require a larger degree of buying to rectify it,” said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho International. “The problem with this level of disappointment is that, if the gilt curve stays this much higher and steeper, it will feed through negatively in pound risk assets.”
A Treasury poll this week showed economists private-sector economists on average expect a 9.1% contraction this year, followed by growth of 6.2% in 2021. That would leave gross domestic product 3.5% below 2019 levels by the end of next year.
They’re far less optimistic about a potential rebound in growth than the scenarios produced by both the BOE and the government’s fiscal watchdog. The latter two saw lost growth reclaimed by 2021 and didn’t include the impact of a potential second wave of virus infections.
Borrowing costs in the U.K. are still close to record lows, with the 10-Year yield hovering around 0.2%. Still, government bonds across tenors fell, and the pound is set for its second week of losses.
Brexit trade talks meanwhile are still struggling to make significant progress. The U.K. is planning a “shock and awe” information campaign to prepare companies for Brexit, with the possibility of a cliff-edge exit a real possibility.
“Markets are beginning to focus on the end-June Brexit deadline,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategist Michael Hartnett, who sees increased risks that the BOE would be forced to take interest rates into negative territory after cutting to 0% in November, wrote in a note to clients. The bank sees the pound weakening further.
“It’s the uncertainty combined with a lack of policy ammunition that should be policy makers’ main concern now.”"

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Friday morning in Asia, ending the week by giving up some of its earlier gains.
Investors will continue to monitor the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Beijing and the U.S., with the number of cases stemming from an outbreak at Xinfadi market almost at 200. Simmering U.S.-China tensions will be another focal point in the aftermath of U.S. President Donald Trump warning on Thursday that cutting ties with China remains a possibility.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.03% to 97.373 by 12:41 AM ET (5:41 AM GMT), with the greenback trading in a tight range of between 96 and 97.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.11% to 106.84.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.12% to 0.6860, with the AUD buoyed after the Bureau of Statistics said earlier in the day that May’s retails turnover has surged 16.3% month-on-month.
Meanwhile, the NZD/USD pair lost 0.09% to 0.6421.
Some investors expressed caution over the AUD’s gains however.
“We’re seeing a few wobbles in commodity currencies as focus is returning to the increasing infections...[with] the key element is going to be whether or not we see governments re-impose lockdown measures,” Kim Mundy, FX analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), told Reuters,
“We still think the general trend of the global economy improving should weigh on the U.S. dollar and support commodity currencies, we’re just seeing a bit of a pause,” she added.
The USD/CNY pair was down 0.01% to 7.0864
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.03% to 1.2428, with the GBP boosted by the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program announced on Thursday. But investors were concerned that the program could be insufficient to support confidence into 2021."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar headed for its best week in a month on Friday as a resurgence in coronavirus cases knocked confidence in a rapid economic recovery and drove investors to the safety of the world's reserve currency.
Geopolitical tensions on the Korean peninsula, in the Himalayas and between China and its trading partners have also weighed, and the balance of risks kept morning moves modest.
The dollar traded near a two-week high against a basket of currencies (=USD) and has gained about 0.4% for the week, its largest weekly rise since mid-May. That stalled the rally in the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars.
""The bulls need new news and inspiration to push prices higher. That inspiration isn't readily available,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
President Donald Trump on Thursday renewed his threat to cut ties with China, a day after the first high-level talks between the countries in months amid souring relations. The meeting, between top diplomats in Hawaii, was inconclusive. 
Meanwhile an uptick in coronavirus cases in many U.S. states this week, along with rising hospitalisations, reflected a troubling national trend that has seen daily infection numbers climbing after more than a month of declines.
More than 150 new cases have also been detected in Beijing since last week, prompting a lift in the city's alert level and a reintroduction of travel curbs.
The Aussie  was steady on Friday at $0.6854 and testing its 20-day moving average. The kiwi  slipped to $0.6407, its lowest since Monday. The safe-haven Japanese yen  firmed a fraction to 106.90 per dollar.
The British pound  sat a fraction above a two-week low at $1.2403, under pressure as investors fretted that the Bank of England may not be planning enough bond buying to support confidence through 2021.
""We're seeing a few wobbles in commodity currencies as focus is returning to the increasing infections,"" said Kim Mundy, FX analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in Sydney. 
""The key element is going to be whether or not we see governments re-impose lockdown measures,"" she said, though adding that was unexpected. 
""We still think the general trend of the global economy improving should weigh on the U.S. dollar and support commodity currencies, we're just seeing a bit of a pause.""
MIXED BAG
A mixed bag of U.S. economic data overnight also gave investors pause for thought, with a rebound in Atlantic-coast manufacturing offset by weak labour figures.
Elsewhere, the euro (EUR=) was steady at $1.1200, a little above a two-week low of $1.1186 touched on Thursday.
It has lost about 1.3% of its value against the dollar since a Tuesday top as questions grow about the political viability of the European Union's stimulus plan.
The bloc's 27 national heads join a video conference from 0800 GMT to try and reach an agreement on the best way forward for a region that has lost over 100,000 lives to the pandemic, and faces an unprecedented economic downturn.
Investors are also keeping a wary eye on Australian trade ties, as relations strain with its biggest trading partner, China, over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
A ""sophisticated state-based actor"" has been attempting to hack a wide range of Australian organisations for months and had stepped up its efforts recently, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday.

Reuters reported Canberra had determined in March last year that China was responsible for a hacking attack on Australia's parliament. Australia never publicly identified that source of the attack and China denied it was responsible.

Investing.com – The pound extended losses against the dollar on Thursday as signs the U.K and EU relationship remains fragile sowed the seeds of doubt over whether the U.K. will be able to wrap up a post-Brexit deal before the year-end deadline.
The EU said it would sign on with the U.K.'s plan to offer traders a six-month grace period to pay tariffs next year after the Brexit transition period ends.
GBP/USD fell 1.08%, to $1.2419
At the end of the Dec. 31 transition period, the EU said it would impose full customs controls and checks on U.K. goods in 2021, Bloomberg reports.  
The U.K. said that in the first half of 2021, most firms moving goods into Britain would get six months to pay any tariffs due, even if a post-Brexit deal is not reached.
Signs that the U.K.-EU relations still remain fraught with completion has sowed the seeds of doubt over a potential trade deal, cooling some of the recent optimism reported earlier this week.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this week, he would work with the EU to find common ground to break the deadlock. Johnson also claimed that there was no reason why the outline of a Brexit deal cannot be agreed to by the end of July. 
The EU has suggested Oct. 31 as the latest date a deal can be reached to allow ample time for member states to ratify the deal before the end of the transition period.
The fall in the pound also comes in the midst of dovish commentary from the Bank of England.
The Bank of England held rates steady at historic lows of 0.1% and ramped up its bond purchases by £100 billion, as expected.
The central bank said it stands ""ready to take further action as necessary"" to support the economy and boost inflation to its 2% target.
""The overarching message remains ultra-accommodative with indications of further measures to come to stimulate growth in the second half this year,"" Saxo Bank said."

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and Japanese yen held their positions on Thursday as concerns about a rise in new coronavirus cases underpinned demand for safe-haven currencies, while the Norwegian crown was a star performer.
The crown was the biggest mover among major currencies, rising after Norway's central bank said the country's economic prospects had improved more than expected in recent weeks and that its key policy interest rate would be kept unchanged for the time being.
The crown ""seems to be ticking pretty much all the boxes at the moment"", said Adrian Owens, currency and fixed income portfolio manager at hedge fund GAM, noting that the economic ""numbers are coming out better in Norway and the central bank (is) acknowledging this and becoming more hawkish.""
Norway is one of the few countries in the world where inflation is expected to remain around target, supporting the currency, Owens said.
The Norwegian crown was up 0.6% versus the dollar at 9.4560  and by 0.5% versus the euro at 10.6430 (EURNOK=D3).
An index tracking the dollar against a basket of currencies (=USD) was unchanged at 97.09. The dollar has strengthened in recent weeks as investors grappled with fears that the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on economic growth. 
The Japanese yen was last trading neutral at 107  after touching a six-day high of 106.70 in the Asian trading session. It remained close to the one-month high of 106.58 it rose to last week.
""FX markets are mildly risk-off overnight, with only light news flow. Beyond continuing concerns of a COVID-19 second wave, AUD and NZD underperformance is being compounded by weak domestic data,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
More than 8.36 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 447,985​ have died, a Reuters tally found.
A surge in new coronavirus infections in several U.S. states and the imposition of travel curbs in Beijing to stop a new outbreak there have served as a reminder of the risks of re-opening economic activity before a vaccine has been developed.
The Australian dollar fell after data showed the economy shed twice as many jobs as expected in May, highlighting the damage caused by lockdown restrictions.
The Aussie dollar was last flat at 0.6882, having fallen earlier to 0.6838 .
The euro was also little changed against the greenback, at $1.1250 (EUR=EBS).
The common currency has lost nearly 1% of its value in less than a week as investors questioned whether the European Union would be able to pass an ambitious stimulus plan proposed by the European Commission, given that some countries are opposed to handing out aid as grants.
""It would seem as if euro/dollar has found its new comfort zone in the area of 1.12-1.14. Only the political front might provide some momentum,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

Elsewhere, the British pound was trading 0.2% lower both against the U.S. dollar and the euro, at $1.2518  and 89.75 pence (EURGBP=D3) respectively, following the Bank of England announcement on rebuilding its war-chest for fighting the coronavirus crisis.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, ahead of two major monetary developments in Europe.
The European Central Bank will announce the results of its latest long-term lending operation, which is the first at which banks can borrow at the new lower limit of as low as 1%. Given the doubts over the effectiveness of negative interest rates, a high take-up would constitute a vote of confidence in the ability of the ECB to keep supporting the economy through monetary policy (and vice versa). ECB board member Isabel Schnabel last week trailed expectations of around 1.4 trillion euros in demand.
The TLTRO results will be followed by the Bank of England's policy announcement at 7 AM ET (1100 GMT). 
Sterling edged lower in early trading Thursday, amid expectations that the central bank will boost its quantitative easing program by between 100 and 150 billion pounds. The U.K. economy has been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak, and is forecast to shrink the most of all G7 economies this year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
“Our economist thinks the QE target will be raised by 150 billion [pounds] compared to consensus of only 100 billion [pounds],” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “Our expectation is driven in part by practical consideration. If purchases continue at the current pace, the target will be reached around the September meeting - leaving the MPC in a position to take a rushed decision after the summer.”
GBP/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.2538, while EUR/GBP rose 0.2% to 0.8974.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 97.013. EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1251, USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 106.86, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD fell 0.2% to 0.6867.
Norway's central bank is also scheduled to meet later Thursday, and is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0.0%.
“Developments since the May meeting have clearly come out on the upside and at the very least the downside risk is much reduced,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “We therefore expect Norges Bank to revise its projections upwards and that the accompanying interest rate path will indicate a gradual rise in the policy rates from the end of 2022.”
USD/NOK rose 0.1% to 9.5286 and EUR/NOK rose 0.1% to 10.722.
The central bank operations are taking place against a backdrop of a spike in new Coronavirus cases in the U.S. and China, which has hit risk-sensitive currencies this week. 
“The markets are currently weighing two opposing forces for risk assets. The rise in Covid-19 cases in the US and China and its associated risk for the economies, and stimulus measures (both monetary and prospects of further fiscal),” ING analysts said. 
As such, the latest weekly U.S. jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) may play a big role in whether greed or fear sets the tone for the rest of the day.

Investing.com – The dollar held its earlier gains on Thursday morning in Asia, amid growing concern over the spike in COVID-19 cases in China and the U.S.
Beijing reported 21 new cases linked to an outbreak at the Xinfadi market on Wednesday, while Texas reported an 11% jump in hospitalizations on the same day.
The spikes pointed to a troubling trend as the number of cases in both countries had been falling since May, and triggered investor concerns about the risks of resuming economic activity before a cure for the virus is developed.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.12% to 97.028 by 11:40 PM ET (4:40 AMGMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.13% to 106.86
Some investors remained optimistic about the dollar and yen despite their retreats.
“Upside for U.S. stocks and other risk assets has dwindled because more people are talking about a second wave of virus infections...this supports the dollar and the yen because they are both safe havens,” Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities, told CNBC.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.23% to 0.6867, after Australia announced a jump in the unemployment rate for May to 7.1% earlier in the day.
The NZD/USD pair was down 0.22% to 0.6442 and the USD/CNY was down 0.09% to 7.0777.
The GBP/USD pair gained 0.01% to 1.2555, with the pound trading in a narrow range ahead of the Bank of England’s policy meeting later in the day. The central bank is widely expected to give its quantative easing program a boost of at least GBP 100 billion ($125.515 billion) amid an economy hard hit by COVID-19 and tough negotiations for a free trade agreement European Union.
“The pound has its own problems. The British economy is not in good shape and a hard Brexit remains a risk,” Ishikawa said."

Investing.com – The euro fell against the dollar on Wednesday, and analysts are warning that there is little chance that the single currency can mount an imminent comeback after snapping its three-week winning streak last week.  
EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.1233.
""We are inclined to see recent developments as a reason for a pause in the risk rally and pause in the bearish USD decline, rather than a material reversal of the prior risk asset gains (both in the equity and FX spaces),"" ING said.
With the dollar's recent decline on hold, the advance in the euro should ""pause too,"" the bank added, souring the prospect of the eurodollar rising above $1.15 in the immediate future.
The sluggish day for the euro arrived on the back of the data confirming that inflation in the economic bloc remained at near four-year lows, strengthening expectations the European Central Bank will persist with ultraloose monetary policy.
The final estimates of inflation in May confirmed a 0.2% in the headline rate to 0.1% year-on-year, the lowest rate since June 2016.
Some caution, however, of putting too much emphasis on the latest inflation numbers as difficulties collecting data ""have eroded the quality of these inflation figures, with estimates of prices of more than one fifth of items.. were imputed by the statisticians or judged to be of low reliability,"" Daiwa Capital Markets Research said."

Investing.com - The dollar drifted lower in early European trade Wednesday, but ranges are tight as investors try to digest a combination of upbeat economic data, a gloomy prognosis from the Federal Reserve chairman, worries about a second Covid-19 wave and diplomatic tensions in Asia.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 96.852. EUR/USD gained 0.2% to 1.1286 on the back of a clear improvement in EU-wide car registrations in May, but faces a test from eurozone CPI data later.
The risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.2% to 0.6897. GBP/USD was largely flat at 1.2570 after a bout of weak consumer and producer price inflation figures that may raise the chance of further monetary easing at Thursday's Bank of England meeting.
U.S. consumer spending rebounded in May as retail sales rose almost 18%, the biggest monthly increase in records dating back to 1992 - albeit one that followed its biggest ever drop in April. The data point was the latest sign that the worst of the economic shock from the pandemic may have passed.
However, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell poured cold water on any enthusiasm as he painted another bleak picture of the U.S. economy or Congress. His testimony continues later Wednesday.
“Chairman Powell’s semi-annual monetary policy testimony to the Senate reinforces the view that while the Fed is encouraged about the recent data flow as the economy re-opens, we are a long way from ‘normality’ and that won’t arrive there is confidence we have overcome Covid-19,” said analyst James Knightley at ING, in a research note.
Yet Beijing is struggling to contain a fresh outbreak in the Chinese capital, while in the U.S. infections are hitting record highs in six states.
Additionally, tensions have been rising between China and India, with clashes at a disputed border site leaving 20 Indian soldiers dead as well as an unspecified number of Chinese casualties.
Still, Wednesday’s slip by the greenback may prove to be the precursor of a much larger move, if Stephen Roach, Yale University senior fellow and former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Asia chairman, is to be believed.
Roach predicted Monday a 35% decline in the U.S. currency against its major rivals in the near future, citing increases in the nation’s deficit and dwindling savings.
He added that the rise of China and the decoupling of the U.S. from its trade partners is likely to end the supremacy of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm against many of its rivals on Wednesday after U.S. retail sales jumped far more than expected in May,
while risk-sensitive currencies were hobbled by concerns about the coronavirus and geopolitical tensions in Asia.
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell also doused some of the rosy expectations on Tuesday, as he painted a rather bleak picture of the U.S. economy while also cementing market hopes for continued policy support.
The dollar index (=USD) stood at 97.003, having risen about 0.4% on Tuesday.
The euro traded at $1.12635 (EUR=), steady so far in Asia after having lost 0.5% on Tuesday and in consolidation after hitting a three-month high of $1.14225 a week ago.
Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at 107.39 yen , stuck in a narrow range so far this week.
Tuesday's data showed U.S. retail sales jumping 17.7% last month, outstripping economists' median forecast of 8.0% increase.
The surge in retail sales last month recouped 63% of March and April's decreases, raising hopes of a quick recovery in the consumption, the driver of the U.S. economy.
Still, Fed chairman Powell had a word of caution in his testimony at Congress, saying output and employment would remain well short of their pre-pandemic levels for a long time, so there was a ""reasonable probability"" that more policy support would be needed. 
Powell added that a full U.S. economic recovery will not occur until the American people are sure that the novel coronavirus epidemic has been brought under control. 
That still remains far from certain, with new coronavirus infections hitting record highs in six U.S. states, including populous Texas and Florida, on Tuesday.
China also sharply ramped up restrictions on people leaving the capital on Tuesday in an effort to stop the most serious coronavirus flare-up since February from spreading to other cities and provinces.
""Market players are looking to, with caution, how critical the impact from any second wave of infections on the economy will be,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of FX sales at  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
""It's not that markets are pessimistic... But the length of time people hold their positions is getting shorter,"" Kaida said.
The Australian dollar eased 0.27% to $0.6865 , slipping further from Tuesday's high of $0.6977.

North Korea on Tuesday blew up a joint liaison office set up in a border town in 2018 to foster better ties with South Korea, prompting Seoul to say it will no longer accept unreasonable behavior by the North.

Investing.com – The dollar turned positive on Tuesday as fresh signs of a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections in the U.S. and other parts of the world prompted some safe-haven buying.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.36%, to 96.99.
A month after the U.S. begin lifting lockdown restrictions, some states have seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections, stoking fears about a second wave of the virus pandemic.
Texas reported that Covid-19 hospitalizations rose 8.3%, to 2,518 people, the highest number the state has seen since the pandemic began, while Florida for the second time this week set a daily record for new infections.
In Beijing, meanwhile, lockdowns were extended to 18 more residential communities following a fresh 'extremely severe' outbreak of the virus, according to local reports.
""The epidemic situation in the capital is extremely severe,"" Beijing city spokesman Xu Hejian said at a press conference. ""Right now we have to take strict measures to stop the spread of Covid-19.""
The rise in infections has stoked some concerns that lockdowns may return, potentially sparking a pullback in the risk assets, which would see likely see dollar demand return.
""Still, there are risks ahead, which have the potential to return the dollar's role as a safe haven,"" Action Economics said.  The threat of renewed lockdowns, which means that asset markets, many of which have returned to pre-pandemic levels, could ""now be ripe for setbacks,"" it added.
The dollar was also supported by a fall in the pound and euro.

Investing.com -- The dollar sold off in early European trade Tuesday, as the Federal Reserve’s move to start purchasing U.S. corporate bonds boosted sentiment at the expense of safe havens.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.2% at 96.498. EUR/USD gained 0.2% to 1.1340, while the risk-sensitive AUD/USD rose 0.1% to 0.6924.
Late Monday the U.S. central bank flew to the rescue once more, stating it will start purchasing investment grade U.S. corporate bonds in a bid to secure companies' access to cash and ensure credit market liquidity.
“The Fed unloaded additional stimulus measures on Monday after market sentiment had soured over the past week,” said analysts at ING, in a note to clients. “The Fed’s Main Street lending program and expanded bond purchase scheme should help support risk sentiment with Jerome Powell trooping to the Senate to give testimony later on Tuesday.”
Attention will quickly turn to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s virtual testimony to the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Economic Committee on his economic outlook and recent monetary policy decisions, at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
“Powell will testify to Congress later today and will likely repeat the dovish message about the economy delivered after the FOMC meeting last week,” said Chief Economist Timothy Fox at Emirates NBD, in a note to clients.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 107.47 after the Bank of Japan kept monetary settings steady earlier Tuesday, but increased the size of its lending packages for cash-strapped firms to $1 trillion from about $700 billion announced last month.
Sterling gained Tuesday, amid optimistic noises out of London and Brussels after Brexit talks between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 
However, the latest round of U.K. employment data were mixed: the jobless rate unexpectedly held steady at 3.9% over the three months to April, whereas many had expected a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.7%. However, the claimant count in May rose by nearly 530,000 and the rise in April's claims was revised up to over 1 million from 857,000 
GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.2641 and EUR/GBP fell 0.1% to 0.8972.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar slipped and riskier currencies rallied on Tuesday as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepared to start its corporate bond buying scheme, while a report flagging the possibility of more fiscal stimulus helped underpin investor sentiment.
The Fed said it would start purchasing corporate debt on Tuesday as part of an already announced stimulus scheme, and launched its Main Street Lending Program for businesses.
The move boosted confidence across asset classes and underpinned risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
Investor sentiment was further lifted by a Bloomberg News report saying that President Donald Trump's administration is mulling a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure programme to boost the economy, citing anonymous sources.
Taken together, the news served as more proof that authorities will ""do what it takes"" to get the world's biggest economy back on track, said Imre Speizer, FX analyst at Westpac in Auckland. 
Against a basket of currencies the dollar (=USD) was broadly steady at 96.489, about 1% below Monday's high of 97.396. The greenback slipped against most Asian currencies. [EMRG/FRX] 
The Australian dollar  extended gains made late on Monday to hit $0.6977, two cents or almost 3% above the two-week low it touched a day ago. The New Zealand dollar  briefly pushed above 65 cents to $0.6508. [AUD/]
Elsewhere, the euro (EUR=) edged up to $1.1343 and sterling  rose 0.6% to test its 200-day moving average at $1.2680. 
DON'T FIGHT THE FED
The Fed will make its corporate debt purchases in the secondary market, and said it would also be buying bonds directly from issuers ""in the near future"". The combined size of the primary and secondary programmes is up to $750 billion.
Individual investment grade bonds, with a remaining maturity of five years or less, are eligible for Fed purchase.
While  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) figures showed that represented only a small percentage of the U.S. corporate debt universe, it proved enough on Tuesday to support investor confidence.
""It just seems to reinforce that message that you shouldn't and can't fight the Fed here, and everything follows from that really,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX strategy Ray Attrill.
Still, markets have a wary eye on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Senate Banking Committee testimony at 1400 GMT, given his gloomy view on the economic outlook, and on the coronavirus' spread.
Concerns about the depth of economic damage and a growing second wave of infections triggered a sell-off in riskier assets last week and during Monday's Asian session.
While the Japanese yen  was a touch weaker on the day at 107.44 on Tuesday, it has again settled into ranges held since April, suggesting some investors remained cautious.
The Bank of Japan kept monetary settings steady on Tuesday and stuck to its view that the economy will gradually recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is due to hold a news conference at 0630 GMT.
Global cases of the novel coronavirus reached over 8 million on Monday, as infections surge in Latin America and the United States and China grapple with fresh outbreaks.
Beijing has banned high-risk people from leaving the Chinese capital to stop the spread of a fresh outbreak, while New Zealand reported two new cases related to recent travel from the UK, ending a 24-day streak of no new infections in the country.
Later on Tuesday, British labour market data due around 0600 GMT may also offer clues as to the Bank of England's next move at its Thursday meeting.

Traders are expecting it will expand its asset-purchasing programme by around 100 billion pounds ($126 billion).

Investing.com – The pound jumped from session lows against the dollar on Monday as the U.K and European Union agreed to intensify post-Brexit talks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stoked hopes that an outline of a deal could be reached by the end of next month.  
GBP/USD rose 0.37% to $1.259 from a session low of $1.235.
After the latest series of U.K.-EU trade talks failed to yield any progress, Johnson said he would work with the EU to find common ground to break the deadlock. The cautious optimism on a deal comes as the U.K. on Friday said it would not extend trade talks beyond December.
The prime minister added that he sees no reason why the outline of a Brexit deal cannot be agreed to by the end of July.  The EU has suggested Oct. 31 as the latest date a deal can be reached to allow ample time for member states to back and ratify the deal before the end of the transition period on December 31. 
Post-Brexit talks have been held back by a lack of compromise from both sides on the terms of a future agreement concerning ""level playing field"" conditions – a set of common rules to ensure firms in the U.K. and EU compete on an equal footing.

704,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve said Monday that it will begin buying individual corporate bonds under its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, an emergency lending program that to date has purchased only exchange-traded funds.
The central bank also added a twist to its buying strategy, saying it would follow a diversified market index of U.S. corporate bonds created expressly for the facility. The Fed built the index internally, and a spokesman couldn’t immediately say whether its details would be made public.
“This index is made up of all the bonds in the secondary market that have been issued by U.S. companies that satisfy the facility’s minimum rating, maximum maturity and other criteria,” the Fed said in a statement. “This indexing approach will complement the facility’s current purchases of exchange-traded funds.”
U.S. stocks climbed to the highs of the day after the announcement. The New York Fed said in a separate statement that purchases of bonds from eligible sellers will begin on Tuesday.
The SMCCF is one of nine emergency lending programs announced by the Fed since mid-March aimed at limiting the damage to the U.S. economy by the coronavirus pandemic. With a capacity of $250 billion it has so far invested about $5.5 billion in ETFs that purchase corporate bonds.
An index assures the Fed complies with the spirit of the law under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act which says emergency lending facilities must be broad based, and provides a mechanism for the central bank to avoid industry concentration.

705,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Monday and commodity currencies erased some losses as the ""risk-off"" sentiment which dominated overnight trading eased somewhat.
Equity markets fell in early London trading, with many analysts citing fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
China re-introduced restrictions in some areas after Beijing reported its biggest cluster of new infections since February.
In the United States, more than 25,000 new cases were reported on Saturday alone.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose overnight, gaining 0.4% between 0440 GMT and 0700 GMT (=USD). It then erased some gains, and was at 97.12 at 1015 GMT.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) FX strategist Kenneth Broux said the market had reacted to news about rising coronavirus infections. Market consensus is that the dollar's gains peaked in March, and traders are now pausing for profit-taking, he said.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s head of FX and commodity research Ulrich Leuchtmann said there had long been news of new infections, and the fact that other safe-haven currencies did not strengthen suggested the dollar's rise was more a product of its recent weakening.
""In my view it is all much more trivial. Following a pronounced period of USD weakness it is now time for a correction and profit-taking,"" Leuchtmann said.
The Australian dollar fell to a 13-day low versus the dollar in early London trading before erasing some losses to 0.6805 , down 0.7%. The New Zealand dollar was down 0.4% .
The safe-haven Japanese yen held firm against the dollar and was little changed from Friday's close at 107.36 .
Industrial output in China rose for a second consecutive month in May, but the rise was smaller than expected, suggesting the world's second-biggest economy is struggling to get back on track after containing the coronavirus.
""More evidence of economic recovery in China is a positive development for the global economy, although market participants understandably remain on edge over the risk of further disruption from second waves,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman wrote in a note to clients.
European countries eased some border controls on Monday following coronavirus lockdowns, a move that could help salvage part of the summer season for Europe's battered travel and tourism industry.
The euro was broadly flat against the dollar at $1.1251 (EUR=EBS).
Financial markets may be in the process of repricing the world's most-traded exchange rate, with derivative contracts suggesting the euro could surge by as much as 6% against the dollar to $1.20 by year-end.
As oil prices fell, the Norwegian crown hit a 4-week low versus the euro. It then erased some losses to stand at 10.9145 by 1037 GMT (EURNOK=D3), down around 0.5% on the day.

The Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and Norges Bank will all hold meetings on Thursday and are expected to keep their main policy rates unchanged.

Investing.com - The dollar was largely unchanged in early European trade Monday, but risk-sensitive currencies, like the Australian and New Zealand dollars were hit hard by fears of a second wave of the Covid-19 virus, particularly in China.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up marginally at 97.332. It's now bounced over 1.5% from the lows of last week. USD/JPY traded 0.1% lower at 107.25, while EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1235.
China reported dozens of new cases of the Covid-19 virus over the weekend, linked to a major wholesale food market in Beijing.  Japan also reported an outbreak of new cases in Tokyo, many of which were traced back to nightclubs and bars that had recently reopened.
Throw in a mini-surge in new coronavirus cases in the United States, mainly in the south, and it's easy to see why fears of another outbreak that would inflict more damage on the global economy are growing.
AUD/USD fell 1% to $0.6793, while NZD/USD declined by 0.6% to $0.6405.
Both currencies are traded as liquid proxies for risk sentiment because of their close ties to China's economy and global commodities.
“If this driver continues to be at the forefront of markets' attention, we may likely see further retracement of the recent month's positive risk sentiment and e.g. a stronger broad USD,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a note to clients.
Disappointing Chinese industrial production and retail sales data for May did little to help these currencies, while USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 7.0975.
Industrial production rose just 4.4% year-on-year and retail sales declined 2.8% year-on-year.
Sterling has also weakened across the board ahead of a meeting between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel to discuss the way forward in Brexit negotiations.
A breakthrough in the deadlocked negotiations seems unlikely at this point, and Johnson has been vocal in not wanting to extend the deadline for trade talks beyond the end of the year. 
Additionally, the Bank of England is due to meet on Thursday, and is expected to increase its quantitative easing program by around GBP100 billion ($125 billion), with some forecasts predicting even larger increases as Britain’s economy  struggles to recover from the effects of the coronavirus. The OECD warned last week that the U.K. would be the worst hit of the world's major economies, due partly to the greater share of services in its GDP. 
GBP/USD dropped 0.6% to 1.2468 and EUR/GBP gained 0.4% to 0.9012.

Neighbor Japan also reported 47 cases in Tokyo, with 27 of those cases traced back to nightclubs and bars that had recently reopened in the last phase of the city’s re-opening.

The bank is not expected to announce any major changes.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.48% to 0.6829 and the NZD/USD pair lot 0.36% to 0.6421. The two Antipodean risk currencies were the biggest casualties of the increased second-wave fears due to their close ties with the Chinese economy as well as global commodities.
“There’s talk that hedge funds and other short-term speculators came into the market early to sell the Australian dollar because of the new infections in Beijing...hopefully this will not be a big outbreak, and this downward move will not last long,” Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Reuters.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.10% to 7.0877 even after the release of Chinese industrial production and retail sales data for May that fell short of investor forecasts.
Industrial production rose 4.4% year-on-year and retail sales declined 2.8% year-on-year.
The GBP/USD pair fell 0.19% to 0.2517, with the Bank of England policy decision schedule due on Thursday.
The central bank is expected to increase its quantitative easing program by around GBP100 billion ($125.306 billion), with some forecasts predicting even larger increases as Britain’s economy slowly recovers from the effects of COVID-19.

China’s capital shut its largest fruit and vegetable supply center after dozens of people associated with the market tested positive for the virus, adding to concerns over rising infections in 22 U.S. states. S&P 500 futures dropped as much as 1.8%, leading a decline in Asian equities.
“The higher numbers in the U.S. that are starting to emerge have really fed fears about second waves, and the story about Beijing closing a large fruit and vegetable market has fanned that,” said Andrew Ticehurst, rates strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. in Sydney. This has been driving the drop in long-end Treasury yields, he said.
Monday’s flattening move may have been supported by some funds bailing out of popular steepener trades, where investors bet that long-end yields will climb faster. Wall Street banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have all recommended some form of a steepener strategy.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's central bank will begin injecting dollars into the market on Monday, President Michel Aoun said on Friday, as it tries to stop a sharp fall in the local pound currency which has led to economic hardship and sparked unrest.
The Lebanese pound had slumped to about 5,000 to the dollar from around 4,100 a week earlier, igniting protests in several cities on Thursday against the deteriorating economic conditions.
One dealer who was buying dollars at 5,000 pounds before the announcement said the price had now fallen to 4,500, indicating the move may help the local currency to steady.
In total, the pound has lost some 70% of its value since October, when Lebanon plunged into a financial crisis that has seen businesses close, prices and unemployment soar, and the introduction of capital controls that have severed Lebanese from their hard currency savings.
Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni also said the pound was starting to gain ground after the announcement and would continue to do so, according to broadcaster LBCI.
Parliament speaker Nabih Berri said earlier that the government had agreed steps to reduce the dollar price to about 3,000-3,200 pounds.
The heavily indebted country has maintained an official dollar peg of 1,507.5, but dollars at this level have been rationed exclusively for imports of fuel, medicine, and wheat.
In a bid to rein in the parallel market, the central bank began a unified pricing system last week with the goal of lowering the price to 3,200. However, importers said dollars at the lower rate, which was set at 3,940 on Friday and will be gradually lowered each morning, have been unavailable.
Berri also said agreement was reached on speaking to the International Monetary Fund in ""one language"", amid disagreement between MPs, the central bank and government officials engaged in talks with the Fund for an economic reform programme.
Beirut is hoping to secure billions of dollars in financing, but the talks have been stalled by internal disagreements over the value of huge losses in the financial system and proposals for how to cover them.

Aoun said that financial sector losses should not be borne by depositors but instead by the government, central bank, and commercial banks.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European trade Friday, with investors seeking this safe haven amid fears of a second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak and the possibility of renewed lockdowns to curb the spread.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up marginally at 96.743. USD/JPY traded 0.3% higher at 107.12, while EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.1307.
These fears have grown with the U.S. reporting more than 2 million Covid-19 cases as of June 12 and a number of the more populous states reporting increased numbers of infections.
“The three most populous states, California, Texas and Florida, all struggle with high levels of new infections and Texas and Florida have seen a renewed increase lately,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “This may be spooking the markets as to getting the virus under control and seeing a continued normalisation, including a ramp-up in spending.”
That said, “the bar for turning to lockdowns again seems very high, though. Not least in the U.S., where there is strong opposition to this,” Danske added.
Additionally, the market was still digesting a grim picture of the U.S. economic recovery painted by the U.S. Federal Reserve after it concluded its policy meeting on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, sterling has weakened across the board after data showed that Britain's economy shrank by a record 20.4% in April from March as the country spent the month in a tight coronavirus lockdown.
“At the same time, the Brexit news flow does not look encouraging,” Danske said, “as the U.K. and the E.U. still seem far away from each other.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc and the yen held on to gains on Friday while the U.S. dollar also held firm against riskier currencies after global stock prices tumbled on renewed doubts over the prospects of a quick recovery in the global economy.
Doubts over the economy stemmed in part from the U.S. Federal Reserve's dire economic assessment as well as fears over new coronavirus infections, though some analysts said a stock market correction was inevitable after a rally.
The Swiss franc rose to 0.94395 per dollar , having hit a three-month high of 0.9376 on Thursday.
The franc has recovered its lost ground against the euro over the past two weeks to trade at 1.0665 to the euro (EURCHF=).
The yen also rose to 106.79 yen per dollar . It hit a one-month high of 106.58 on Thursday, having gained 3.1% from a 2-1/2-month low hit just a week ago.
Following its two-day meeting, the Fed signalled on Wednesday it plans years of extraordinary support for the U.S. economy, which policymakers project will shrink by 6.5% in 2020, with the unemployment rate at 9.3%.
Although that appears to have triggered selling in shares, analysts have said Fed officials have been cautious all along, especially compared to the bullish mood in financial markets until earlier this year. 
""It is almost mudslinging to blame the stock falls on the Fed's dour assessment. Most market players have acknowledged that the stock rally has been driven by excess liquidity and the Fed's accommodative stance is unlikely to push stocks lower,"" said Makoto Noji, chief currency strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""In short, it was a correction from an overbought market, which should not last long. But what we should be careful is that the market's fall could continue if we have more bad news from China and Europe for instance.""
The tensions between the United States and China have shown limited signs of abating while Europe is facing tough negotiations next week on its recovery fund plan.
Investors were also worried about new coronavirus infections as the world gradually reopened following shutdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the disease. 
In the United States, new infections are rising slightly after five weeks of declines, according to a Reuters analysis. 
Part of the increase is due to more testing, which hit a record high on June 5 of 545,690 tests in a single day but has since fallen.
The dollar held firmer against risk sensitive currencies.
The euro stood at $1.1299 (EUR=), off Wednesday's three-month high of $1.14225.
Similarly, the British pound slipped to $1.2582 from Wednesday's high of $1.2812.
The Australian dollar tumbled to $0.6838 , having fallen 2% in the previous session, the biggest daily fall since the market turmoil of March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury has no plans to accelerate introduction of a $20 bill picturing escaped slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman despite protests over police treatment of African-Americans, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday.
Mnuchin, speaking to reporters on a video call, said there was a longstanding schedule to introduce the next $20 bill in 2030, and decisions regarding its design were years away. He said it was a ""myth"" the Trump administration was delaying its introduction.
""I just want to clarify that we have not changed any of this and this is something in the distant future,"" Mnuchin said, adding he was focused on sophisticated anti-counterfeit technology in the bills. 
The image of Tubman, born into slavery in 1822 and who later escaped from a Maryland plantation and helped hundreds of slaves reach freedom, was first proposed for the $20 note in 2016 by Democratic then-President Barack Obama's last Treasury secretary, Jack Lew. 
Lew's goal was for Tubman to replace former President Andrew Jackson, who owned slaves, on the $20 bill in 2020. 
Republican President Donald Trump derided the idea as a candidate in 2016, later calling it an example of ""pure political correctness.""
Mnuchin told lawmakers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-currency-tubman/u-s-treasury-backs-away-from-plan-for-harriet-tubman-on-20-bill-next-year-idUSKCN1SS2ZK last year the 2020 goal could not be met and on Thursday said the 2030 schedule was set by career Treasury officials due to the $20 bill's widespread use in automated teller machines. A Treasury official said the redesign schedule was set in 2015. 
The next major currency redesign will be the $10 bill in 2026, which Mnuchin said would keep the image of Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury secretary, after discussions of changes prompted ""a lot of pushback.""

The Treasury chief declined to say whether he personally supported Tubman's image for the $20 because that decision was for a future Treasury secretary, even if Trump wins a second four-year term and Mnuchin serves.

714,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 07:36PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The market horizon is littered with risks that could trigger bigger moves in currencies even as the Federal Reserve and other central banks double down on the policies that have anchored volatility close to historic lows.
Growing concern about the prospect of a second wave of coronavirus turmoil and potential variations in how well different economies bounce back from recession have helped fuel a recent uptick in foreign-exchange volatility, while uncertainties also swirl about China-U.S. tensions, America’s presidential election and what path the European Union chooses to take. And with the recent rally in riskier assets in reverse gear, the road ahead appears even more grim.
A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) gauge of foreign-exchange implied volatility is trading near a three-week high, up from record lows in February before the coronavirus pushed it to a decade high in March. Traders were stunned earlier this year as the pandemic shock fueled volatility following a period where price swings mostly languished amid easy monetary policies.
Given the varying economic growth rates, “there will be a higher base level of volatility unlike what we saw pre-Covid when the global economy was very synchronized via trade flows, ” said Jordan Rochester, currency strategist at Nomura International Plc.
Central banks have helped to suppress volatility by using their balance sheets for large-scale asset purchases, driving investors into riskier asset classes for higher returns.
But with economic concerns reemerging, strategists see plenty of opportunities to take advantage of expected spikes in volatility.

For Citigroup’s Tom Fitzpatrick, investors should buy six-month euro-dollar call options, betting on the common currency appreciating against the greenback, while Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), recommends volatility bets on key commodity-linked currencies.
Marinov is “looking for triggers of risk aversion and FX volatility beyond the tranquil months of June and July.” He sees value in buying six-month options on the U.S.-Canadian dollar and Australian-U.S. dollar pairs due to inverted volatility curves.
The so-called inverted volatility term structure shows hedging is relatively less expensive in volatility terms for longer tenors. He also sees demand to hedge against big moves around the U.S. presidential election scheduled for Nov. 3.
SEB’s strategist Lauri Hälikkä suggests investors start buying euro-dollar volatility as risks of the common currency further appreciating against the greenback increase. The euro is up 1.8% this month versus the dollar as the region’s leaders introduce new stimulus to bolster the economy.
“There will be virus differentiation across countries that will have profound economic effects,” said Deutsche Bank chief international strategist Alan Ruskin. That should help to “limit the decline in volatility,” he said.

Investing.com – The pound fell sharply against the dollar on Thursday, and risks an end to its three-week winning streak as bets against sterling hit their highest in eight months amid ongoing Brexit worries.
Currency speculators have raised their bets against sterling, ING said, citing data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Bets on a decline in sterling rose to their highest since November.
Growing Brexit worries have soured sentiment on the pound as the risk of the U.K. leaving the EU without a trade deal increased, ING added. ""Despite markets having become less complacent about the risk of a no-deal exit, we still see some room for additional stress to be built into sterling.""
The U.K and European Union have made little progress on post-Brexit talks so far, amid key sticking points including future fishing rights in U.K. waters, foreign policy, and defense.
Both the U.K. government and the EU have until the end of the month to decide whether to extend the deadline for negotiating a trade agreement should be extended beyond the end of December.
The pound, which has recently followed risk assets higher, was also shunned in the wake of a plunge in global markets as investors assess whether equity markets have run up too fast, too soon.

Investing.com - The dollar pushed higher in early European trade Thursday, with investors willing to head back towards this safe haven after the Federal Reserve’s dreary economic outlook.
 At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.4% at 96.318. USD/JPY traded largely unchanged at 107.09, but GBP/USD dropped 0.7% to 1.2656.
The U.S. central bank projected late Wednesday that the U.S. economy would shrink 6.5% this year and the unemployment rate would be 9.3% at year's end.
That was a gloomier view than many in the market had expected, particularly after Friday’s shock employment report, and sent investors out of stocks, away from riskier currencies and towards bonds and the dollar.
The Australian dollar retreated from an overnight 11-month high, dropping 1% to $0.6929, the New Zealand dollar gave up a four-and-a-half month high and fell 0.7% to $0.6493. 
That said, with the Federal Reserve indicating that its loose monetary policy is set to stay for the long haul, this dollar strength is likely to be a temporary phenomenon.
“The broad trade weighted dollar is within a whisker of return to the mid-March lows, right before the USD funding markets seized up and the dollar hoarding story developed,” said ING, in a note to clients. 
“No doubt investors are jumping on the view that the FOMC median expectation was for unchanged Fed rates right through 2022, maintaining demand for higher yielding assets.”
EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.1358, only registering small losses after hitting a three month peak overnight.
The single currency has been boosted of late by signs of the continent’s countries working together to combat the coronavirus, with the EU's executive Commission proposing a hefty recovery fund, made up of grants and loans for every EU member state.
The Eurogroup, a grouping of E.U. finance ministers, is set to meet later Thursday, to discuss the EU recovery fund. 
However, “given the differences between the EU commission and e.g. the Netherlands and Austria, the proposal for the recovery fund needs some work before it can be passed in the various parliaments,” analysts at Danske Bank wrote, in a research note.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, with investor sentiment down after details emerged from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting the day before.
The U.S. economy will shrink 6.5% this year, and the unemployment rate will be 9.3% by the end of the year, according to the Fed's quarterly projections.
“It is a long road...we can use our tools to support the labor market and the economy, and we can use them until we fully recover,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said via video link on Wednesday.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.38% to 96.315 by 12:39 AM ET (5:39 AM GMT)
“That’s been the follow-through, and it’s played into a broad rebound in the dollar...but the takeaway is the Fed remains fully committed to its ultra-easy monetary policies...that should be supportive for risk assets, and on a structural basis we still think the U.S. dollar is embarking on a cyclical downturn,” Rodrigo Catril, FX analyst at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), told Reuters.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.01% to 107.08, with the safe-haven yen reversing its earlier gains.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.82% to 0.6939 and the NZD/USD pair was down 0.63% to 0.6497.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.15% to 7.0704 and the GBP/USD pair slid 0.43% to 1.2691.
Meanwhile, investors will be looking to U.S. jobless claims numbers, due to be released later in the day."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against riskier currencies and the safe-haven yen hit a one-month high on Thursday, as the U.S. Federal Reserve's dour economic outlook spooked investors.
The moves arrested the greenback's initial slide after the Fed's policy stance, projecting rates near zero for years, was even more accommodative than expected.
The Australian dollar  retreated from an overnight 11-month high and fell as much as half a percent to $0.6966. The New Zealand dollar  gave up a four-and-a-half month high and fell 0.3% to $0.6516. 
The yen  rose marginally to 106.90, its highest since mid May. Though the euro - which hit a three month peak overnight - held firm, pointing to the possibility of more downside to come for the dollar once the dust settles.
The single currency (EUR=) last bought $1.1382.
Fed policymakers projected the U.S. economy to shrink 6.5% this year and the unemployment rate to be 9.3% at year's end.
""It is a long road,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said via video link on Wednesday.
""We can use our tools to support the labour market and the economy, and we can use them until we fully recover,"" he said.
That was a gloomier view than many in the market have gravitated towards in recent days and sent investors out of stocks, away from riskier currencies and in to bonds and the dollar.
""That's been the follow-through, and it's played into a broad rebound in the dollar,"" said Rodrigo Catril, FX analyst at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
""But the takeaway is the Fed remains fully committed to its ultra easy monetary polices,"" he said. ""That should be supportive for risk assets, and on a structural basis we still think the U.S. dollar is embarking on a cyclical downturn.""
Neither Powell nor the Fed's statement brooked any suggestion that the central bank's massive liquidity injections would be waning any time soon, with the statement promising bond buying to continue ""at least at the current pace"".
Powell also said the question remains open as to whether the Fed will use yield curve controls, reinforcing expectations that it is gearing up to do so and pressing benchmark 10-year yields back down under 0.8%.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar was steady at 96.050, just above a three-month low hit on Tuesday. Sterling  held at $1.2738, just above its 200-day moving average.

Markets are looking ahead to U.S. jobless claims data due at 1230 GMT. A slight slowdown in jobless claims is expected, though some traders might be primed for a positive surprise after Friday's payrolls report showed a completely unexpected easing in the jobless rate.

719,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave traders in the world’s biggest bond market the equivalent of a pat on the head after the central bank’s latest meeting. 
The Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to leave the fed funds rate in a range of 0% to 0.25%, as expected, with all but two officials forecasting it will remain near zero until at least 2023. Notably, the Fed’s statement made no formal mention of yield-curve control, the policy tool seemingly on the tip of all analysts’ tongues. More than half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg said they anticipate the FOMC will eventually set target yields for certain Treasuries, likely two- or five-year maturities. Of those expecting that to happen, most said the announcement would most likely come in September.
Powell didn’t box the Fed into committing to the policy. The usefulness of yield-curve control in the U.S. “remains an open question,” he said in his opening statement. “We will continue our discussions in upcoming meetings and will evaluate our monetary policy stance and communications as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.” When the first question from a reporter pressed him about how soon it could happen, he repeated his language from the statement verbatim. 
As for bond purchases, officials surprised some traders by announcing that they’re extending the program in the coming months “at least at the current pace,” which amounts to about $80 billion of U.S. Treasuries and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities a month. (For reference, during the worst of the market tumult in March, the Fed was buying $75 billion of Treasuries each day.) The Fed’s balance sheet stands at $7.17 trillion, up from $4.16 trillion at the end of February.
The Fed has been paring back its buying gradually week by week, so locking in at current levels suggests Powell and his colleagues don’t want to risk any sort of trouble with market plumbing as the Treasury Department ramps up bond sales to fund gaping budget deficits. “We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals,” Powell said. In other words: The Fed stands ready to buy more Treasuries if private investors suffer from indigestion. 
That kind of “floor” was dovish enough to send Treasury yields tumbling across the curve in the wake of the decision. The benchmark 10-year yield dropped as much as 10 basis points, the most since April 15, while five-year yields fell 7 basis points. Yield curves broadly flattened on the perceived support from Fed purchases.
I wrote after the previous FOMC meeting in April that judging by Powell’s comments, the central bank will keep policy accommodative long after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. Wednesday’s decision and his latest remarks merely add more specifics. Moreover, Labor Department data released a few hours beforehand showed the core consumer price index fell for the third consecutive month, the first time that has happened in data going back to 1957. The central bank will be in no hurry to raise interest rates with such a grim outlook for price growth.
Of course, risk-asset prices have been soaring. Powell sought to frame that in the Fed’s preferred terms. “There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to where you would say they were for example in February, before the pandemic arrived. We don’t take those gains for granted,” he said. Powell caught himself as he said the central bank’s bond buying is supporting “highly accommodative — or, accommodative — financial conditions.”
As long as Treasuries stay in their current ranges and credit spreads remain steady enough that investment-grade companies can borrow at some of the lowest costs in history, there’s no incentive for the Fed to change course. Powell made clear, especially in an impassioned answer to Bloomberg TV’s Michael McKee to end the press conference, that stocks can go as high as investors want — he and his colleagues will be focused on setting policy and establishing facilities that cut into the 13.3% U.S. unemployment rate and keep markets wide open.
Keep it up, bond traders. Powell will check back in at the end of July.

Investing.com - The dollar moved off session lows on Wednesday, but remained pressured after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and signaled it was no rush to raise rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.36%, to 96.05, above session lows of 95.61.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and signaled rates would remain in the lower zero bound through 2022.
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said.
The bank also pledged to continue its bond purchases, which has seen its balance sheet expand to over $7 trillion from about $4 trillion in just under three months. 
EUR/USD and GBP/USD, both of which continue to follow risk assets higher, traded flat against the greenback.

721,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Analysts and investors see the Federal Reserve’s pledge to maintain monetary support and plan to leave interest rates unchanged through 2022 as supportive for markets, but whether it will be sufficient to help the economy recover from the blow dealt by the coronavirus isn’t so clear.
The S&P 500 erased losses to trade as much as 0.5% higher after the Fed’s statement before quickly returning to the red. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields sank to session lows of 0.75%.
Here’s what Wall Street is saying about the latest data:
Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates
“Jerome Powell wants financial markets to put their trust in the Fed knowing that the Fed will pump however much money is needed and then some to prop up stocks and bonds and keep a predacious amount of cash flowing through the banking system. Unlimited money printing seemed extremely unlikely given Fed members’ universal rejection of modern monetary theory just a few months ago, but here we are. The Fed is dead; long live the Fed.”
Marc Chaikin, founder of Chaikin Analytics.
“The market has been pricing in the fact that short-term rates are going to be near zero. The market is basically trading on the Fed backstopping liquidity.”
Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird
“Everything they say just reminds me of 2008-09. The bottom line for investors essentially is that the Fed is going to be over-committed to easy monetary policy for a while. They will not do anything that will threaten any sort of economic recovery. You can see in their statement they are committed to large scale asset purchases and low rates for years now.”
“The Fed is the parent and the market is a child that just kind of woke up after a nightmare. The child eventually calms itself down, but the parent is there to help them calm down.”
Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC):
“Seeing blanket agreement across all Fed officials is not common but they are remaining a united front in the current environment. While negative interest rates may be the route of other central banks across the globe, it’s one the U.S. has decidedly steered away from -- and today’s decision to stand pat reaffirms this stance. What is surprising is that on the heels of some v-shape recovery indicators, the Fed sees structural fragility in the U.S. economy -- anticipating zero interest rates into 2022. Powell has made it clear that he will continue to rely on his full range of tools to keep the U.S. economy healthy as jobs and inflation continue to come under historic pressure. The Fed’s cautious tone suggests that we’re not out of the woods yet and they will likely take whatever means necessary to keep key metrics afloat.”

722,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Mortgage investors can take heart knowing the Federal Reserve considers agency MBS a primary arena through which to conduct monetary policy.
The central bank has purchased agency mortgage bonds at a record pace totaling $719 billion -- just over $12 billion a day on average -- according to data from the New York Fed. While the amount of buying over such a short time frame has been surprising, the banks re-entry into the MBS market was not.
“The Fed has used its power to stabilize markets and inject confidence,” Kevin Jackson, a managing director on the mortgage trading desk at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said in an interview. “They drew a line in the sand and said they are going to support the larger part of the housing finance market, which is agency MBS.”
Since the central bank’s first foray into mortgage purchases in late 2008, its opinion that doing so is proper “to support the mortgage and housing markets and to foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally” is little challenged. On a practical level, the highly liquid agency MBS market, with its forward settlement of trades, allows for massive injections of central bank credit more readily than other sectors.
Judging by the Fed’s history, their holdings may grow. The recent buying binge increased the bank’s ownership to about 24% of the market’s total outstanding debt. From 2016 through 2018 that average was about 28%.
“While the current spike is impressive versus last year, going back further puts it in perspective,” said Kirill Krylov, Robert W. Baird & Co. senior portfolio strategist.
Quite the Boost
The tsunami of central bank credit is providing a boost for mortgage bond investors, and has brought about a reversal in the sector’s supply-demand equation. Forecasts saw $490 billion more in supply needing to be absorbed by private investors this year, but after taking into account Fed buying, they may see available supply actually decline by $500 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
Buoyed by this good fortune, the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. MBS Index excess return versus Treasuries has rallied 1.73% since QE’s restart on March 16. The UMBS 30-year 2.5% coupon -- the Fed’s main focus and where over 25% of its buying has occurred -- rallied 2.59%.
Lower coupon prices have surged, with the 30-year UMBS 2%, 2.5% and 3% all increasing by at least three points over the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And as home lending rates are set in the mortgage market the  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record low 3.15% on May 28 from a local high of 3.65% on March 19. Lower lending rates have increased concern about that bane of mortgage investors, prepayment speeds.
A key feature of mortgage-backed securities is that the underlying home loans may be prepaid by borrowers at par at any time. With almost the entire MBS universe changing hands at a premium, getting back funds faster than expected can hurt performance. The last three prepayment speed reports have come in above expectations.
“How low can the 30-year mortgage rate go?” said Walt Schmidt, head of mortgage strategies at FHN Financial in Chicago. “That is a concern investors have, as effective yields for MBS in some cases have already gone negative due to higher prices and faster speeds.”
Where’s the Beef?
From a historic perspective the Fed’s use of QE “to support the mortgage and housing markets” has been only partly successful. Single-family housing starts during the current era of QE are but a pale shadow of what they once were. Despite an 18% increase in population from 1999 to the end of 2019, single-family housing starts dropped 24% over that span, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.
In fact, using the average annual single-family home starts seen during each of the last six decades, 2010-2019 saw the lowest level of building since at least the 1950s. It’s little wonder that home prices skyrocketed 49% over the last decade.
As for a return to the pre-QE era when the central bank held nothing but Treasuries, that seems a far-fetched scenario now.
“I do not see the Fed as an outright seller in any reasonable scenario,” Baird’s Krylov said. “The Fed is here to stay.”

723,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders looking to short the dollar have history and monetary policy on their side as seasonal trends and a dovish Federal Reserve align, further sapping demand for a currency that’s fallen almost every day this month.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has dropped in June in eight of the last 10 years by an average of roughly 0.7%. This month it is already down 2.3% ahead of the Fed’s decision Wednesday, when policy makers are expected to reiterate a commitment to buoy the economy. The index’s decline pushed it below the psychological milestone of 1200, a level unseen since early March.
This month has generally seen haven demand slip and currency traders -- who were caught off guard by the frenzy to snap up riskier assets as economies reopened and central bank stimulus fueled a rally in equities -- may remain hesitant to re-establish long dollar positions.
The greenback “has no big advantage in a risk-on world,” said Steven Englander, head of Group-of-10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). Investors are seeing “diminished” dollar attractiveness as “there looks to be some economic light at the end of the Covid tunnel.”
The dollar’s traditional weakness in June typically follows gains historically seen in May off the back of weaker U.S. equity performance. That’s why traders were caught off guard last month when the greenback dropped 1.2%, its worst month this year, and stocks rallied. The Covid pandemic and policy response has turned tables on the traditional sell-in-May adage and relation between stocks and the U.S currency.
Lee Ferridge, State Street’s head of macro strategy, is bearish on the dollar and said his favorite G-10 currency is the euro as that region’s leaders boost stimulus. In addition, a recent decline in central bank policy rates around the world makes Europe’s negative rate policy less of a drag on the shared currency.
Still, there are some factors that could work in favor of the greenback.
U.S. Treasury yields have come off their lows, with the 10-year trading near its highest level since March and potentially luring those who favor the yield differentials with peers. And for some currency traders, the prospect of the Fed holding off on introducing any market-altering policies could boost yields and decrease the probability of negative rates, making the dollar attractive.
“With the economy seemingly on the mend, the case for negative rates has gotten even weaker,” Win Thin, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said Monday. Negative interest rates are “very unlikely.”
Looking past the Fed meeting, the dollar may also find support should the risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections emerge.
There’s “the very real potential for a second wave of infections to occur in the fall, which could mean a renewed move to ‘safe haven’ asset classes,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco (NYSE:IVZ).
Still, the dollar’s temporary rebound Tuesday -- it climbed at one point by as much as 0.5% before dropping to end the day steady -- wasn’t enough to convince many of a turnaround in sentiment, and it resumed its decline Wednesday.
“Dollar weakness has more to go,” George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), wrote in a note. “We don’t think the move is over.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are betting a weaker U.S. dollar will further boost a rally that has seen stocks, emerging market currencies and other risky assets soar in recent weeks. 
The dollar is down 6.6% against a basket of currencies from a more than three-year high in late March, the sharpest 21-day drop in about 2 years. Net bets against the U.S. currency in futures markets  stood at $7.72 billion last week, near the highest level since May 2018.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. Dollar Index & CFTC Positions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplwzqkvb/Dollar%20index%20and%20spec%20positions.jpg)
Several factors are driving the dollar lower. Investors piled into the dollar and other so-called havens during a coronavirus-fueled global stock sell-off in March. Trillions in stimulus from the world's central banks and, more recently, signs of stabilization in U.S. growth, have reignited risk appetite and boosted the case for shifting back into equities and other comparatively risky areas.
The S&P 500 (SPX) is up 46% from its late-March low, while the Nasdaq (IXIC) recently marked a new bull market. 
At the same time, the Fed’s pledge to keep U.S. rates near zero for the foreseeable future and potentially cap yields has diminished the dollar’s attractiveness to income-seeking investors and raised the allure of higher-yielding currencies.
“The Fed put is bigger than ever,” said Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management. “This is ultimately negative for the dollar and positive for risky assets.”
Upadhyaya is betting the dollar will decline against a range of currencies including the euro, Australian dollar, Indonesian rupiah and Mexican peso. 
Because of the dollar's central role in the global financial system, its fluctuations tend to have widespread repercussions.
A weaker buck is welcome for U.S. multinationals by making it cheaper to convert foreign earnings back into dollars, potentially boosting balance sheets that had suffered in the coronavirus-led slowdown. 
The materials and technology sectors are among the most exposed to currency headwinds, with around 50% of the corporations in both sectors deriving the greater part of their revenues from abroad, an analysis of Russell 1000 companies by Bespoke Investment Group showed earlier this year.
A weaker dollar also tends to be a tailwind for oil and other raw materials, which are denominated in dollars and become more affordable to foreign buyers when the U.S. currency declines. The S&P/Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (SPGSCI) has rallied about 45% over the last 30 days.
The falling dollar ""unleashes a 'virtuous cycle' that lifts the global economy,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN) in Toronto.
Among the risk-seeking strategies that have prospered in recent weeks is the carry trade, where investors borrow in a low-yielding currency and roll their money into a higher-yielding one, pocketing the difference. 
An investor selling dollars and buying the Brazilian real, for instance, would have earned 17.4% over the last month accounting for the difference in yield and the real's swift rise from recent lows, according to Cambridge Global Payments data through Monday. The Mexican peso has returned nearly 10% in the same period, and the Russian ruble 7.7%.
Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at Australian FX services provider AxiCorp, recently sold the dollar to purchase the much higher-yielding Indonesian rupiah . 
Thanks to low U.S. rates, ""the U.S. dollar is looking more attractive as a funding currency than at any time in the past two years,"" he said.
(GRAPHIC - Rate differentials: USD vs select currencies: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpyglrjpg/rates.JPG)
Some believe the dollar's losses may be limited. The gap between U.S. rates and those in Europe and Japan - where many borrowing costs are negative - is unlikely to narrow much further in the near term, with the Fed opposed to moving borrowing costs below zero. 
At the same time, few are willing to completely turn their back on haven assets such as the dollar with the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic still uncertain and the global economy at its weakest in decades.
A rapid resurgence in coronavirus cases or signs that renewed U.S.-China trade frictions may further damage an already-battered global economy could send investors scrambling back into the dollar, analysts said. 
Such a scenario could be disastrous for carry traders, potentially wiping out weeks of gains in several sessions.

""I think of carry strategies as being to similar picking up nickels in front of a steamroller,"" said Schamotta.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bets that pushed the Swiss franc to a five-year high as the coronavirus crisis revived euro break-up fears have gone spectacularly sour, the latest in a line of franc moves to leave traders with bloody noses. 
From a peak close to 1.050 per euro, the safe-haven currency has slumped 4% since the French and German governments jointly proposed a European Union rescue fund on May 18, and was trading at around 1.09 francs on Wednesday. 
That is a small move compared to the ""Frankenshock"" of 2015, when the franc surged 15% in a single day, or the impact of Mario Draghi's hint in June 2017 that the European Central Bank might end policy stimulus, but still painful for speculators.

Those holding to long franc bets before a June 18-19 EU summit could be in for more discomfort if the proposal wins approval.
Coming weeks should bring ""a pretty big shift in the speculative flows and some of our own flows also suggest that,"" said Ebrahim Rahbari, chief G10 currency strategist at Citibank.
""The pressure on Swiss franc specifically to reverse its longstanding long position is probably even bigger than for some of the other safe havens,"" Rahbari said, adding he had turned bearish on the franc in mid-May.
But with the bailout fund's shape still under discussion, leveraged franc bets against the dollar are at four-year highs of $1.2 billion, according to the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission.
In euro/franc, the turnaround is more dramatic; Royal Bank of Canada reports an 11% euro overweight on its client trading platforms, a swing from a 13% short on 15th May but below 2020 highs.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was among those stopped out of the short euro/franc trade with a 1.7% loss, after seeing franc appreciation as ""inevitable"".
""The EU seems to be at least on the surface of things pulling together in a way that caught the market by surprise,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.

SEEN THIS BEFORE
Switzerland's enormous balance of payments surplus makes it a magnet for safety-seeking flows during times of trouble, especially if the problems happen to be in the euro zone.
That has long been a headache for the Swiss National Bank, which leans on the franc to protect the export-oriented economy. That's why it was willing to risk U.S. ire with heavy franc selling over March/April to keep the exchange rate below 1.05 francs per euro.
But sight deposits at the SNB, a proxy for FX interventions, last week fell for the first time since end-February, easing pressure on the SNB to cut its policy rate next week.
Graphic: Swiss sight deposits - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyglyjvg/Pasted%20image%201591716738167.png
The case for more franc weakness is not clear cut, however. 
On the one hand, the franc looks overvalued -- at 1.078, it is well above its 20-year average of 1.35 francs per euro. 
But even if the EU pulls off the rescue fund, economists expect that the bloc's economy will stay in the doldrums for longer than Switzerland's.
""I personally don't like shorting a currency which has (a big) current account surplus,"" said Kevin Zhao, head of global currency and fixed income at UBS Asset Management, adding that the Swiss economy is growing more strongly than the euro zone.
The fate of many previous franc wagers means some, like Andreas Koenig, head of global FX at Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager, say directional bets are a lose-lose proposition.
""To be long Swiss franc you stand against the central bank, which is not normally the nicest situation, but if you are short the Swiss franc you are against a strong fundamental trend,” Koenig said.

726,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's battered pound currency has slid to fresh lows against the U.S. dollar despite a new pricing system Beirut hopes can rein in soaring food prices as it negotiates a deal with the International Monetary Fund to climb out of crisis.
The pound has lost over 60% of its value since October, the result of a dwindling stock of dollars that has prompted banks to cut savers' access to hard currency and ration dollars exclusively for fuel, medicine, and wheat at a pegged rate of 1,507.5 pounds.
One currency dealer said dollars on Wednesday were being bought at 4,250 and sold at 4,500. A second dealer said he was buying at 4,300 versus 4,100 a day earlier but not selling because of scarcity.
Importers said it was getting increasingly difficult to source enough dollars to complete orders, even at higher rates.
""Looking forward only a few weeks ahead, we may not be able to honour our engagements towards our suppliers,"" said Hani Bohsali, general manager of Bohsali Foods, a major food importer.
The government and money changers last week launched a unified pricing system, with a gradually reduced rate announced each day with the aim of reaching 3,200 pounds.
As part of the scheme, money changers on Wednesday set a buying price of 3,890 and selling price of 3,940 and the central bank said dealers who did not comply would be penalised. Importers said dollars at this rate were unavailable.
The central bank said on Wednesday a new electronic foreign exchange trading platform would go live on June 23 as part of further efforts to stabilise the currency.
Under the new platform money changers will be required to enter the details of transactions into an electronic application and adhere to a buying and selling range set each morning by the central bank and subject to change throughout the day.
Lebanon's dollar supply has been further hit by a currency crisis in neighbouring Syria. Syrians are piling into dollars to protect against inflation and hedge against the effect of impending U.S. sanctions.
The Lebanese pound's collapse has threatened renewed unrest as Beirut negotiates an IMF programme tied to billions of dollars in financing to kickstart a recovery.

Fresh protests erupted late on Tuesday in Beirut and Tripoli, triggered in part by the currency crisis.

Investing.com - The dollar was weaker in early European trade Wednesday, with investors wary ahead of the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was down 0.1% at 96.233, around levels not seen since early March. USD/JPY dropped 0.3% to 107.44, while EUR/USD stood at 1.1347, up 0.1%. 
The U.S. central bank concludes its latest two-day meeting later on Wednesday, and while no major changes are expected the Fed could announce steps to curb the recent rise in bond yields.
Most analysts are playing down the chance the Fed will adopt yield curve control to guide 10-year Treasury yields lower, but uncertainty about the outcome of the Fed meeting could keep the dollar under pressure.
“We think the Fed is satisfied with its unlimited, open-ended and flexible QE programme and does not think it will gain much by announcing a monthly purchasing target,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “We do not expect the Fed to implement yield curve control.”
""The Fed can afford to wait and see on yield curve control,” agreed Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, “because the U.S. economy has gotten past the crisis phase and only just entered the healing phase."" 
Elsewhere, GBP/USD traded 1.2766, up 0.3%, not far off a three-month high. Still, it’s debatable how much longer sterling can retain this strength given the uncertainty over its Brexit trade negotiations with the European Union.
“The possibility of extending the transition period expires on 1 July and despite good economic reasons for giving more time to negotiate the permanent relationship (in particular now that both the UK and the EU are in recession), we do not expect the UK to ask for an extension,” said Danske Bank.
The bank’s base case remains that the two sides can reach a simple free trade agreement on goods trading (not services), before the year-end, but the risk of a no deal Brexit has risen.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia on the back of eagerly-awaited details from a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled for later in the day.
Although investors expect no major changes, the Fed could announce steps to curb the recent rise in bond yields, which could bring the dollar down.
“The Fed can afford to wait and see on yield curve control because the U.S. economy has gotten past the crisis phase and only just entered the healing phase,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
“The markets got overly optimistic and are adjusting lower, but this is a good chance to buy the dollar on the dip.”
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.01% to 96.332 by 11:36 PM ET (4:36 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.07% to 107.64.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.17% to 0.6973 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.26% to 0.6529.
Investors remain positive on both currencies as Australia and New Zealand resume economic activity after lifting their COVID-19 lockdowns, and the Antipodean currencies gained from recent investor optimism over the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
But the risk currencies could soon feel an impact as that optimism over the recovery wanes, with the AUD also affected by Australian tensions with China which continue to simmer.
The USD/CNY pair dropped 0.04% to 7.0736. China reported that May’s Producer Price Index fell 3.7% year-on-year earlier in the day. Analysts had expected a 3.3% drop in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is unlikely to make significant moves higher in the near term because of the ballooning budget deficit, Jeffrey Gundlach, the billionaire chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on a webcast presentation on Tuesday. 
Gundlach noted the inverse correlation between the dollar and the twin deficit - the U.S. deficit plus the trade deficit - which has increased dramatically because of the government's stimulus efforts to combat the effects of the coronavirus shutdown. 
""The dollar looks terrible,"" he said, and ""the biggest reason is the way in which we're gunning the twin deficits.""
""We know with metaphysical certitude that the twin deficit is going to go way higher, I'd say to at least 12% of GDP. That would suggest the dollar going all the way back to 2011 levels,"" Gundlach said.
As the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department have issued unprecedented levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus, the amount of public debt outstanding has increased 15% in the first half of 2020 year-over-year, according to Gundlach. 
He believes the rising twin deficit will drive the dollar lower, despite the currency's appeal as a safe-haven investment and the likelihood that such assets will be in demand if U.S. stocks fall from their current levels. 
""If you think that the stock market is going to fall from its fairly lofty perch right now - which I think is a pretty good bet, ... you would probably look for dollar strength in the near term. But the next big move in the dollar is still down, I think."" 

The U.S. dollar index (=USD), which measures the currency against a basket of six rivals, has fallen about 6.4% since hitting an annual high on March 19, prior to the announcement of the Fed and Treasury stimulus endeavors.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against most currencies on Wednesday amid some speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve could take steps to curb a recent rise in bond yields at its policy meeting.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars pulled back slightly against the greenback but sentiment remained positive as economic activity resumes in both countries following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.
The main focus is a Fed policy meeting later on Wednesday. While no major changes are expected, recent rises in yields have pushed up the dollar due to increasing signs the U.S. economy is stabilising, but a full-fledged recovery from the coronavirus outbreak is still distant.
Some analysts are playing down the chance the Fed will adopt yield curve control to guide 10-year Treasury yields lower, but uncertainty about the outcome of the Fed meeting could keep the dollar under pressure.
""The Fed can afford to wait and see on yield curve control because the U.S. economy has gotten past the crisis phase and only just entered the healing phase,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The markets got overly optimistic and are adjusting lower, but this is a good chance to buy the dollar on the dip.""
The dollar was little changed at 107.75 yen on Wednesday in Asia following a 0.6% decline in the previous session.
Against the British pound, the greenback traded at $1.2713, close to a three-month low.
The dollar bought 0.9510 Swiss franc on Wednesday in Asia after falling 0.7% on Tuesday.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was little changed at 0.8253% on Wednesday. Long-term Treasury yields fell on Tuesday and the yield curve flattened slightly as traders adjusted positions before the Fed meeting.
U.S. central bankers on Wednesday will also publish their first economic projections since the coronavirus pandemic set off a recession in February.
Estimates are expected to signal a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years. 
The Australian dollar pulled back from an 11-month high and fell 0.27% to $0.6941, while the New Zealand dollar fell from its strongest level since late January to traded at $0.6487.
The Antipodean currencies have been on a stellar run against the greenback due to hopes for economic recovery, prompting some investors to book profits.
Some traders are worried about a deterioration in diplomatic relations between Australia and China, which has also weighed on the Aussie.
The euro traded at $1.1334. Against the pound, the common currency bought 89.20 pence, on course for a second day of gains.
Concerns about progress in trade talks between Britain and the European Union continue to hamper both the euro and the pound.
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is scheduled to speak later on Wednesday, which may yield details that will help determine whether market sentiment will improve.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar has continued to cede ground against its rivals, slipping to three-month lows on Tuesday, but it is unlikely to languish at lows for long as a slower-than-expected global economic recovery will see demand for the world's reserve currency return, experts say.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.32%, to 96.30.
The dollar looks set to strengthen on increased demand for safe havens in the months ahead as the pace of the global economic recovery is likely to fall short of expectations, Bank of America said.
Developed markets are unlikely to recover before 2022 at the earliest, and in the absence of a vaccine, the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 infections remains on the horizon amid easing lockdowns.
""Markets already appear to us priced for significant recovery and return to normalcy, which we would expect only in the case of a vaccine,"" BofA added. ""We see a long road to recovery ahead, subject to avoidance of many downside risks, including that posed by sticky high unemployment and sectoral shifts impacting the corporate sector.""
The slip in the dollar, which remains on course for a fourth-straight weekly decline, comes just a day ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee decision, which is expected to culminate in an unchanged rate decision.
The Fed is also expected to outline its projections on the economy, inflation and unemployment, all of which should serve as a reminder that the global economy's return to growth will be fraught with struggle."
732,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 01:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Traders looking to short the dollar have history and monetary policy on their side as seasonal trends and a dovish Federal Reserve align, further sapping demand for the currency suffering its longest losing streak since 2006.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index declined in June in eight of the last 10 years by an average of about 0.7%. This month it is already down about 2% ahead of the Fed’s meeting Wednesday when policy makers are expected to reiterate a commitment to buoy the economy. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Brad Bechtel said “more dovishness” could push the dollar index below the psychological milestone of 1200, a level unseen since early March.
The greenback dropped Tuesday, making it the longest run of losses in 14 years. Haven demand is slipping and currency traders who were caught off guard by the frenzy to snap up riskier assets as economies reopened and central bank stimulus fueled a rally in equities, may remain hesitant to re-establish long dollar positions. Last week, Treasury yields jumped to two-month highs, and on Monday U.S. stocks wiped out the year’s losses.
The greenback “has no big advantage in a risk-on world,” said Steven Englander, head of Group-of-10 FX research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). Investors are seeing “diminished” dollar attractiveness as “there looks to be some economic light at the end of the Covid tunnel.”
The dollar’s traditional weakness in June typically follows gains historically seen in May off the back of weaker U.S. equity performance. That’s why traders were caught off guard last month when the greenback dropped 1.2%, its worst month this year, and stocks rallied. The Covid pandemic and policy response has turned tables on the traditional sell-in-May adage and relation between stocks and the U.S currency.
Lee Ferridge, State Street’s head of macro strategy, is bearish on the dollar and said his favorite G-10 currency is the euro as the region’s leaders boost stimulus. In addition, a recent decline in central bank policy rates around the world makes Europe’s negative rate policy less of a drag on the shared currency.
Still, there are some factors that could work in favor of the greenback.
U.S. Treasury yields have come off their lows, with the 10-year trading near its highest level since March and potentially luring those who favor the yield differentials with peers. And for some currency traders, the prospect of the Fed holding off on introducing any market-altering policies could boost yields and decrease the probability of negative rates, making the dollar attractive.
“With the economy seemingly on the mend, the case for negative rates has gotten even weaker,” Win Thin, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said Monday. Negative interest rates are “very unlikely.”
Looking past the Fed meeting, the dollar may also find support should the risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections emerge.
There’s “the very real potential for a second wave of infections to occur in the fall, which could mean a renewed move to ‘safe haven’ asset classes,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco (NYSE:IVZ).
Still, the dollar’s temporary rebound Tuesday when it climbed as much as 0.5% wasn’t enough to convince many of a possible turnaround in sentiment.
“Dollar weakness has more to go,” George Saravelos, global head of FX research at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) wrote in a note. “We don’t think the move is over.”

733,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Kyle Bass is going for broke on a currency trade that has burned bearish speculators for more than three decades.
The Dallas-based founder of Hayman Capital Management is starting a new fund that will make all-or-nothing wagers on a collapse in Hong Kong’s currency peg, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Bass, best known for his prescient bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, will use option contracts to leverage the new fund’s assets by 200 times, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. While the strategy is designed to generate outsized gains if Hong Kong’s currency tumbles against the dollar, investors stand to lose all their money if the peg is still intact after 18 months.
It’s unclear how much money he’s raised for the strategy, which is an offshoot of an existing fund focused on Hong Kong. Bass declined to comment.
The trade is audacious even for Bass, who profited handsomely during the subprime crisis but has since had less success with doomsday calls on everything from Japanese government bonds to the Chinese yuan. A vocal critic of China’s Communist Party, the 50-year-old investor wrote in a Newsweek op-ed last month that Hong Kong has become “ground zero for the ideological clash between democracy and heavy-handed Chinese communism.”
By taking aim at the city’s currency, Bass is betting he can time the demise of a dollar peg that has survived repeated speculative attacks since 1983 and wrongfooted big-name investors including George Soros.
Bass, who began warning the peg was at risk more than a year ago, is starting his fund during a period of extreme economic and political turbulence in Hong Kong.
Anti-government protests and the coronavirus pandemic have plunged the financial hub into its worst recession on record, while China’s decision last month to impose a controversial national security law has stoked fears of capital flight and potentially damaging U.S. sanctions.
Bass told prospective investors that the Hayman Hong Kong Opportunities Fund, LP-Prodigious Series was due to launch on June 1 and could see a 64-fold return if the currency declines by 40%, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because it’s private.

He’s far from the only investor to take aim at Hong Kong’s dollar. Options data compiled by Bloomberg show markets are pricing in a 6% chance the currency will break 7.90 in 12 months, outside the weak end of its 7.75-to-7.85 trading band against the U.S. dollar.
Market participants often characterize such wagers as lottery tickets; they could become hugely valuable if the peg breaks, but are more likely than not to expire worthless. Some hedge funds have allocated small sums to Hong Kong dollar options, capping exposure at levels that they can afford to lose without putting a major dent in their overall performance.
It’s possible that investors in Bass’s fund will take a similar approach, though details of their exposure weren’t immediately available. Bass has told prospective investors that the idea for the fund came from Hayman Capital’s largest client, without saying who it was.
Read about a similar bet by Mark Hart against China’s yuan.
While few doubt that Hong Kong faces serious economic and political challenges, the city’s currency shows little sign of imminent collapse. In fact it’s been so strong in recent months that the city’s de-facto central bank has sold more than HK$40 billion ($5.2 billion) since April to prevent the currency from appreciating outside its trading band.
Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said this month that the city is ready to defend the exchange rate and that mainland China could provide U.S. dollars through a currency swap line should Washington impose sanctions.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has said it doesn’t see evidence of capital outflows. Local deposits climbed in April, while Hong Kong home prices have slipped just 5% from record highs in 2019. The city’s stock market has rallied along with global shares since March. Hong Kong has about $440 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, more than two times the city’s money in circulation, according to the HKMA.
Bass has said that liquid reserves in Hong Kong and China are lower than the reported headline figures and that he expects a “full-fledged banking crisis” in Hong Kong by the end of this year. Citing high levels of financial leverage, he has compared the Chinese territory to Iceland and Ireland before those nations’ banking systems imploded in 2008.
Bass’s new fund will lock in investor cash for two years and charge a one-time management fee of 2%, people familiar with the matter said. It will levy a 15% performance fee that rises to 20% if the fund’s net return exceeds 100%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese investors have clipped the wings of a resurgent U.S. dollar as they position for the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will take steps to flatten the Treasury yield curve.
Ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday, speculation is growing that the U.S. central bank might adopt yield targets on bonds, or some other measures to anchor long-term yields.
The yield curve has steepened in recent days as improving U.S. data drove a sell-off in U.S. bonds, with 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) rising 28 basis points to 0.959% last week. 
Most global investors don't expect the Fed will try to anchor Treasury yields. In Japan, however, the first major economy to adopt yield-curve-control four years ago, there is more chatter about such a possibility.
""Japanese names have been very active since Monday in dollar/yen, trying to trade off the chance of some kind of yield-curve control from the Fed,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""I personally don't think yield curve control is necessary now, but the dollar is under clear selling pressure.""
Traders said Japanese investors have been heavy sellers of dollars for yen this week, positioning for possibly lower U.S. yields. 
The yen  has risen sharply, up 1.8% from lows of 109.85 on Friday.
The dollar had gained 1.6% against the yen last week, its best weekly performance in more than two months, as spreads between U.S. and Japanese yields widened. 
This is a sign that the yield spread is becoming the main trading factor for dollar/yen, said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities.

If the Fed does not take action this week, traders expect the dollar could break into a new higher trading range versus the yen, spurred on by a steepening Treasury yield curve.
Those that expect it to do nothing point to 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) still being quite low.
""The current risk-seeking environment and the shift up in yields has supported dollar/yen's break above 109,"" said Toshinobu Chiba, chief fixed income portfolio manager at Nissay Asset Management Co.

""However, this yen weakness will not continue because dollar liquidity is too much now.""

Investing.com - The dollar pushed slightly higher in early European trade Tuesday, but ranges are tight as investors look to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve for guidance.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.2% at 96.823, having dropped over 3% in the last month.
Last week U.S. jobs data for May caught markets completely off-guard with an unexpected increase in employment, and futures pricing now shows investors have abandoned expectations of U.S. rates dipping below zero next year.
Focus is now firmly on the Federal Reserve. It is not expected to change interest rate settings and investors are now weighing up the likelihood of stepped-up bond buying in the wake of the employment report.
“While the Fed may acknowledge the better jobs report, they are a long way from removing the liquidity punchbowl that has fuelled the rally in financial markets,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “An unchanged FOMC statement with regards to asset purchases should allow the dollar to continue its bear trend later in the week.”
Elsewhere, EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1272, showing limited weakness after data showed German exports slumped in April as the coronavirus crisis slashed demand for goods from Europe's biggest economy.
The euro has been boosted by the European Central Bank’s move Thursday to increase its emergency bond purchase scheme to 1.35 trillion euros, more than had been expected.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.3% to 108.09, edging lower after hitting a high of 108.55 to the dollar earlier in the session, a level not seen since early April.
Sterling has also weakened against the dollar Tuesday, with GBP/USD down 0.2%, but remaining around the 1.27 level.

The USD/JPY pair was down 0.42% to 107.97. The yen hit a week-high of 108.03 to the dollar earlier in the session over the possibility of increased bond purchases, or even a dovish outlook, from the Fed.

The NZD/USD pair was down 0.25% to 0.6541. The NZD hit its’ highest point in almost five months earlier with New Zealand easing all its lockdowns, save boarder restrictions, after the nation was declared COVID-19-free on Monday.

In sparking the biggest peacetime recession in Europe since the 1930s, the coronavirus pandemic has reawakened the image of a Great Depression-like slump in prices and wages that sucks the life out of the economy.
After the ECB extended and almost doubled its emergency bond-buying program to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.53 trillion) last week, Executive Board member Fabio Panetta cited a “resurgence of deflationary pressures.” Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said action was needed “to ensure that risk doesn’t materialize.”
Economists are already predicting policy makers will need to ramp up the program again before the end of the year.
Yet Austrian Governor Robert Holzmann countered, saying that even if consumer prices do fall for a few months, “that’s not deflation in the economic sense.” The Bundesbank predicted support from ongoing supply disruptions and company collapses that give surviving businesses more pricing power.
“Although falling demand is putting pressure on the prices of services and industrial products, this will be mitigated by inflationary factors caused by the pandemic on the supply side.”
-Bundesbank Monthly Report
The discussion reflects a wider debate on whether the crisis, and measures to counter it, will ultimately stoke prices.
“The real issue for me is this obsession that people have, particularly in Europe, that the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus will be inflationary,” Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, told Bloomberg Television. “For the next five years or so, I just don’t see it.”
The ECB’s differences of opinion are reminiscent of 2014, when government austerity after the regional debt crisis was weighing on prices. Then-President Mario Draghi was finely attuned to the risk and started a strategic push for massive bond purchases.
He had to fight opposition led by officials from Germany -- where the hyperinflation of the 1920s is seared into the national psyche -- who argued that the prospect of deflation was overblown. Consumer-price growth finally turned negative in December 2014 and quantitative easing was announced the following month.
It was another two years before Draghi felt able to say the risk had passed.
Deflation strikes fear into the hearts of central bankers because it’s much harder to fight than inflation, which requires painful but relatively straightforward interest-rate increases.
As prices fall, profits are squeezed until companies respond by cutting wages, which reduces demand for their products and worsens the problem. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle that can only be broken with massive spending, normally by governments with central-bank backing.
In the 1930s, constrained by the gold standard, authorities were slow to react to the downturn that followed the 1929 financial crash. Deflation in Europe only disappeared with the onset of German rearmament that culminated in World War II.
Still, this time around, money has been pumped into the global system and the economy has been wrapped in cotton wool. The surprise jump in U.S. employment reported last week raised the prospect of a faster-than-expected rebound. The European Union has even overcome its disputes over jointly issued debt to come up with a common 750 billion-euro recovery fund.
“I wouldn’t underestimate the impact that some of the fiscal measures we’re going to see unleashed on the European economy over the next couple of years will have,” said Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management.
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane acknowledged the upward price pressures in a blog, but said it’s clear the downsides are prevailing.
“Taken together, the scale of the increase in economic slack means that the net impact on inflation dynamics is assessed to be substantially negative in the staff projections, even when allowing for the pro-inflationary impact of some damage to supply capacity.”
-Philip Lane, ECB blog
Annual euro-zone inflation was 0.1% in May and prices fell month-on-month. While the collapse in crude oil costs is a big part of that -- another echo of the debate of 2014, when some officials said lower energy bills are a hidden stimulus -- the concern is that the trend will spread.
Investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) says the proportion of goods in the consumer-price basket that are getting cheaper has increased.
Lane avoided the word “deflation” in his blog, and Lagarde dodged a question on it in her press conference, suggesting they’re sensitive to the internal debate.
The president did however mention it at the European Parliament on Monday, saying the monetary stimulus of recent years had averted that threat and lifted the euro zone.
“These measures have not only prevented the economy from entering depressed and deflationary conditions,” she said. They “have also contributed to supporting employment and reducing financial stability risks.”

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Tuesday as surging commodity currencies paused for breath and a rising yen pointed to investor trepidation over the U.S. Federal Reserve's next move.
The yen  extended big overnight gains to a week-high 108.03 per dollar as investors weigh the possibility of stepped-up bond buying - or even simply a very dovish outlook - from the Fed which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
At the same time the Australian and New Zealand dollars swiftly retreated from milestone peaks in early trade. 
The kiwi  hit a four-and-a-half month high of $0.6576 on the first morning since New Zealand ended all social restrictions - save for its closed borders - after declaring the nation free of infections on Monday.
The Aussie  briefly touched a 10-month top of $0.7040 and sterling  made a three-month high of $1.2755, though all three pulled back to steady by mid-morning. 
""Japanese names have been very active since Monday in dollar/yen, trying to trade off the chance of some kind of yield-curve control from the Fed,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""I personally don't think yield curve control is necessary now, but the dollar is under clear selling pressure."" 
Last week U.S. jobs data for May caught markets completely off-guard with an unexpected increase in employment and over the weekend Chinese export numbers for last month were stronger than forecast.
""Economies are smashed, but not smashed as badly as was expected and I think that's the key to this whole rally,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland. 
""The latest high-frequency data shows you that the recovery probably looking more like a V. It's a relief rally, relief that it's not as bad as feared.""
In New Zealand, an ANZ survey of traffic movement - seen as a forward indicator of economic growth - saw a sharp rebound in heavy vehicle traffic last month.
The virus also appears to be in retreat in Australia where re-opening is gathering pace, prompting RBC Capital Markets to make a modest improvement in its 2020 GDP forecast on Monday lifting it to better than -4% from -4.5%.
The World Health Organization on Monday warned that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""far from over,"" as a record number of new daily infections were reported.
But investors took comfort from cases trending lower in the United States and falling to a fresh low in New York, even as testing has ramped up.
""If we continue to trend lower ... this will go a long way in re-aligning consumer risk assessment about the virus,"" said RBC Capital Markets' Chief U.S. Economist, Tom Porcelli.
Elsewhere the Chinese yuan  held on to chunky gains for the week so far.
Other moves were held in check as markets wait for the outcome of the Fed meeting. The euro (EUR=) last sat at $1.1304 and the pound at $1.2736.
A statement from the Fed is due at 1800 GMT on Wednesday followed by a news conference half an hour later. 

It is not expected to change interest rate settings and, since last week's job figures, futures pricing shows investors have abandoned expectations of rates dipping below zero next year.

Investing.com – The dollar fell to a three-month low against the Canadian dollar Monday, adding to its losses over the past three weeks, but analysts warn of easing risk sentiment in the near term that will keep a lid on further downside.
USD/CAD fell 0.40% to C$1.3371, hitting its lowest since Mar. 4, shrugging of a fall in oil prices amid data showing Canadian housing starts bounced back last month.
Canadian housing starts bounced back to 193,500 in May after falling to 166,500 in April.
The surprising resilience in housing added to a string of recent near-term data flow that has ""clearly been less discouraging than was expected even a few weeks ago,"" RBC said in a note.
Still, the loonie's current three-week winning streak against the greenback is likely to come under pressure over the near-term.
Easing risk-on market sentiment amid ongoing U.S.-China tensions and the threat of a second wave of infections will likely keep the loonie's advance in check, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
USD/CAD is expected to stabilize at current levels ""for the time being,"" the bank added."

Investing.com - The dollar has stabilized in early European trade Friday, following Friday’s shock rise in U.S. employment and ahead of the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was largely flat at 96.888, having dropped nearly 3% over the last month. USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 109.48.
Underpinning the dollar was a surprising recovery in U.S. employment in May after the economy suffered record job losses in April, data showed on Friday.
The jobless rate also fell to 13.3% last month from a post-World War Two high of 14.7% in April, offering hope that the world's largest economy is starting to stabilise after the pandemic triggered a wave of job cuts.
That said, investors may avoid making big trades before the Federal Reserve meeting ends on Wednesday. 
EUR/USD traded at 1.1294, up 0.1%, just off its strongest level in almost three months, after German industrial production slumped 17.9% in April, a record hit, before a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions set off an ever-so-slow recovery.
The euro had been boosted by the European Central Bank’s move Thursday to increase its emergency bond purchase scheme to 1.35 trillion euros, more than had been expected.
Sterling has also continued to push higher Monday, with GBP/USD up 0.2%, at 1.2685, having earlier climbed above 1.27 for the first time since early March.
Still, further gains for the pound may be hard won, after the fourth round of EU-UK future relationship negotiations concluded Friday with no major breakthroughs. 
“We are still of the belief that it is too early for the two sides to reach an agreement, and hence we still expect investors to reprice the no-deal Brexit risk premium soon,”said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against the Antipodean currencies and the British pound after surprising improvement in U.S. labour market data bolstered expectations for economic recovery, which reduced safe-harbour demand for the greenback.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars both rose to their strongest since January after data showed a smaller-than-expected fall in Chinese exports, which supports commodity currencies.
In contrast, the U.S. dollar traded near its highest in more than two months against the yen, supported by recent gains in long-term Treasury yields as investors await the outcome of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday.
Sentiment has improved dramatically in the currency market as traders look for signs of a rebound from the coronavirus outbreak as economies reopen from lockdowns, which has hurt the dollar and driven money into so-called risk-on trades.
""Commodities and emerging market currencies are clearly finding it easier to rise against the dollar on hopes of economic recovery, but it is a different story when it comes to the yen,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""For dollar/yen the focus is more on yields, which is pushing the currency pair higher.""
Japan's economy shrank less than initially estimated in the first quarter, revised data showed earlier on Monday, but the yen took the data in its stride.
The Australian dollar  traded at $0.6965, close to its firmest since Jan. 2.
The New Zealand dollar rose to $0.6537, the highest since Jan. 29, before settling at $0.6512.
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that all coronavirus measures in the country will be lifted from Tuesday, barring border closure restrictions, as the virus had been eliminated from the country.
Against the pound , the dollar fell 0.25% to $1.2702 on Monday, close to its lowest since March 12.
The dollar traded at 109.48 yen , close to a two-month high set on Friday.
Underpinning sentiment was a surprising recovery in U.S. employment in May after the economy suffered record job losses in April, data showed on Friday.
Some investors may avoid making big trades before the Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday to see how Chairman Jerome Powell views a recent rise in 10-year Treasury yields and a steepening in the yield curve.
The onshore yuan  was little changed at 7.0862 per dollar after exports from China, the world's second-largest economy, fell less in May than the market expected, data showed on Sunday.
The pandemic first emerged in China late last year and has caused a sharp contraction in global economic activity, but many traders are now focused on the pace of recovery in the second half of this year.
Some analysts said there are still many risks to the outlook, including any second wave of infections, diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, and the U.S. presidential election later this year. 
The euro (EUR=D3) traded at $1.1290 on Monday. The common currency is riding a wave of optimism after the European Central Bank said last week it will increase bond purchases to help the bloc's weakest economies.

Sentiment will face a test later on Monday with the release of data forecast to show that German industrial output fell the most on record in April.

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning, with investors retreating from the safe-haven asset after the U.S. released a better-than-expected employment report on Friday.
The U.S. jobless rate was 13.3% in May, down from April’s 14.7%, according to the Labor Department’s employment report released on Friday. The U.S. non-farm payroll also increased by 2.5 million, against analyst expectations of an 8-million drop.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies fell 0.05% to 96.873 by 11:51 AM ET (4:51 AM GMT).

The AUD/USD pair gained 0.09% to 0.6975 and the NZD/USD pair jumped 0.22% to 0.6520. The Antipodean currencies, considered riskier compared to the USD or JPY, took advantage of the improved risk sentiment to edge towards levels last seen in January.

Currencies and government bonds issued by emerging-market countries look too expensive given the challenges they face in tackling the virus outbreak, strategists including Nikolaos Sgouropoulos wrote in a research note June 7.
“The medium-term trajectory for EM FX is still lower and their curves are likely to steepen,” the strategists wrote, referring to expectations of wider spreads between short-term and longer-term government bond yields. “Long-term fiscal sustainability will remain a challenge for some, even under optimistic post-Covid-19 assumptions.”
The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index recorded its strongest weekly advance since 2016 last week, with improving economic data and government and central bank stimulus measures helping revive investor confidence. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index headed for an eighth straight daily decline in early Asia trading Monday, extending declines in wake of the strong U.S. jobs report Friday that further eroded demand for haven assets.
Barclays strategists said that the risk rally has left 10-year government bonds in Chile, Korea, India and South Africa all looking “rich” relative to their model estimates.
“Despite still-wide spreads to lower risk-free rates, EM local bonds are not cheap given local and global fundamentals,” the strategists said. “Weakened EM balance sheets are set to worsen, with the largest primary deficits in the last 30 years,” the team wrote. Primary budget shortfalls exclude debt-servicing costs and are a gauge of underlying fiscal trends.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real surged on Friday through 5.00 per dollar for the first time since March, sealing its biggest weekly rise in nearly 12 years after surprisingly strong U.S. employment data sparked a buying spree in riskier, beaten down assets.
The real, long the pariah on international foreign exchanges and one of the worst performing currencies this year, rose 7% against the dollar this week, its strongest performance since October 2008 and one of the biggest weekly gains on record.
(GRAPHIC: Brazil real - spot: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdkqwmvo/BRLSPOT.png)
(GRAPHIC: Brazil real - weekly change: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeqjgkpr/BRLWEEKLY.png)
The real closed up 3% on Friday, hitting an intraday high of 4.9340 per dollar (BRBY) as traders who have been short the currency scrambled to cover their positions and cut their mounting losses as the rebound gathered pace. 
The improving global picture, greater investor appetite for risk and a calmer domestic political scene boosted the real's upswing. It has now rebounded more than 20% from its record low near 6.00 per dollar in mid-May.
""The real may trade better than peers in an emerging-market friendly environment, considering heavy dollar long positions,"" Citi strategists wrote in a note on Friday.
""People are short emerging market FX, and within emerging markets they are underweight the real,"" one hedge fund manager in Sao Paulo said.
Figures on Friday showed that the U.S. economy unexpectedly added jobs in May after suffering record losses in April, a sign that the downturn triggered by the coronavirus pandemic may be over.
This sparked a widespread rally across equity, credit and emerging markets, and a sell-off in safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds.
Meanwhile, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data on Friday showed that funds and speculators increased their net short Brazilian real position slightly to 12,003 contracts in the latest week, the largest net short position in two months.
But that is about a quarter of the size of the short position held in early March, indicating that positioning is still fairly light.

BRASILIA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Brazilian real and Mexican peso have both rebounded strongly in recent weeks, but their rallies are starting to diverge with the peso running out of steam and the real gaining momentum.
The two heavyweight Latin American currencies were pressured this year as their countries' central banks slashed interest rates, historically deep recessions loomed on the horizon and investors dumped emerging market assets due to the coronavirus crisis.
Now, both currencies have surfed the wave of improving global market sentiment and appetite for risky assets, with trillions of dollars of monetary and fiscal stimulus lifting hopes for a quick post-pandemic economic recovery.
The peso's selloff faded earlier, and it has appreciated 15% against the U.S. dollar since mid-April. Brazil's real hit a record low in mid-May but has rebounded more than 20%. 
The real on Friday surged through 5.00 to the dollar for the first time since March, headed for its biggest weekly gain since 2008. 
Two charts suggest potential short-term paths for each currency. 
(Graphic: Brazil real vs EM FX, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpygbkbpg/EMFX2.png)
(Graphic: Brazil real, Mexico peso correlation, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwybwqpw/BRLMXN-CORR.png)
The first shows their performance this year relative to other key emerging currencies. The real has weakened more than its peers, with room to recover further. Over the past 12 months, its relative depreciation has been has even steeper. 
""It has underperformed big time and would be part of any broad dollar weakness rally,"" said Alexandre Song, portfolio manager at Macro Capital in Sao Paulo. 
""The laggards before are the winners now. No one is long the real, it is widely under-owned,"" he said, adding that a sustained break through 5.00 per dollar could accelerate the move (BRBY). 
Analysts said the erosion of the real's yield advantage should be fully discounted by now. The Brazilian central bank is expected to cut its benchmark Selic interest rate by up to 75 basis points this month, but has indicated this will be the last cut.
That puts the real in pole position if the assets most shunned when markets tumbled are due for a sharper rebound, as many analysts expect. 
Brazil's economic and financial position is far from stellar. The economy is poised for its biggest-ever annual slump of more than 6%, according to consensus forecasts, and the government's deficit and debt will balloon to record levels.
But Brazil's $3.5 billion dollar-bond sale this week, its first since 2019, drew huge demand from investors, suggesting foreign capital is ready to return.
Central bank figures this week showed Brazil posted a net foreign exchange inflow in May of $3.1 billion, the first inflow since July last year.
PESO LOSING MOMENTUM
Mexico's economic and financial position has also weakened, but policymakers fear that added pressure on public finances could lead to a sovereign credit downgrade. Mexico could lose its investment grade rating, which would probably force many investors to sell Mexican sovereign bonds because institutional mandates require investment quality assets in their portfolios. 
This is what initially happened to state-owned Pemex's bonds after Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in April became the second ratings agency to cut the firm's debt rating to 'junk' status. 
According to central bank data, more than $12.5 billion fled local debt markets between March and April. That would almost certainly increase if Mexico was cut to 'junk'.
The second chart, a simple 30-day correlation, shows the two currencies have started to diverge in recent weeks. The peso has rebounded from a record low 25.74 per dollar in early April , but has lagged the real.
A recent central bank survey showed investors expect the peso will end this year at 23 per dollar, weaker than the 21.90 it was trading at on Thursday. The survey also shows the economy will shrink by 8% this year, more than the consensus forecast for Brazil.
The latest biweekly survey by Citibanamex shows nine out of 10 analysts expect the dollar to be above 22.00 pesos by year end, while six of 10 expect it to be above 23.00 pesos.
(Graphic: Mexican peso, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrleqlve/MXNSPOT.png)
The peso's loss of momentum in recent days comes as the dollar approaches the 100-day moving average, a technical level likely to act as a magnet for traders' buy and sell orders. A break below could accelerate the dollar's decline, but failure to do so could resume the uptrend. 
Juan Francisco Caudillo, technical analyst at Monex, recommends that his clients buy dollars, characterizing the U.S. currency's recent decline as a ""momentary correction"".

""These levels are beginning to be attractive to consider accumulating dollars,"" agreed Santiago Leal, fixed income and foreign exchange rate strategist at Banorte.

746,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Austria has nearly doubled its borrowing plans in order to help cushion its economy from the worst of the coronavirus crisis, the latest sign of the drastic funding needs being drawn up across the continent.
The country will now raise about 60 billion euros ($68 billion) from debt operations in 2020, an all-time high, according to the Treasury. That compares to a prior estimate of just over half that. At least 35 billion euros will be by way of government bond offerings.
Also, Austria will conduct a further one to two syndications this year, which has been a popular way for nations to raise large amounts of cash.
European countries have ripped up their initial spending plans after the coronavirus forced millions of citizens to stay at home, closing shops and factories across the region. Even frugal Germany has unveiled a landmark stimulus package to help its economy weather what is set to be the steepest recession since World War Two.
The European Central Bank’s 600 billion euro boost to its pandemic bond buying program will roughly match the additional debt supply by euro zone nations, Treasury Managing Director Markus Stix said in an interview.
“Supply and demand are matching again and that means rates should remain relatively stable,” he said.
Ten-year bond yields remain below 0%, due to their status as one of the safest assets to hold in Europe. That means that the government is effectively paid to borrow out to a decade.
Volatility
Given that market volatility has risen, the Treasury will announce auctions two days later than they used to from July, said Stix. Demand for longer-dated bonds, especially those in the 30-year part of the curve, has returned, he added.
Austria has already completed over 40% of its borrowing needs so far this year, the Treasury said.
Italy saw record demand this week for 10-year bonds at a syndication, receiving over 100 billion euros of orders. Unlike conventional auctions, they are typically used for new issues or to mobilize a large amount of money. But borrowers must pay a premium to banks that underwrite the sale and the pricing is often attractive to investors.

Investing.com - The euro has posted strong gains in early European trade Friday, as the European Central Bank’s decision to expand its stimulus measures has boosted optimism of a global economic recovery.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.1357, up 0.2%, just off its strongest level in almost three months, and with its March 9 peak of $1.1495 now in sight. On the week, the single currency has risen 2.4% and is set to clinch a third straight week of gains.
These gains follow the ECB’s move Thursday to increase its emergency bond purchase scheme by 600 billion euros, more than the 500 billion expected by markets, to 1.35 trillion euros and extend the scheme to mid-2021.
These “easing measures were another illustration that the ECB means business and stands ready to do whatever is necessary to help the Euro area survive the corona crisis in one piece,” said analysts at Nordea in a research note.
It also adds to the string of positive surprises that have recently come out of Europe, including the EU's recovery fund and another German stimulus package.
By contrast, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, is down 0.1% at 96.517, at levels not seen in nearly three months, and on course for its third consecutive week of losses. The Aussie earlier broke through 70c for the first time this year, while the kiwi is also now trading at pre-pandemic levels.
This follows broad optimism that global economies will recover as social distancing restrictions are eased, resulting in investors deserting the safe haven.
The U.S. weekly jobless claims report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for benefits dropped below 2 million last week for the first time since mid-March, although the continuing claims figure actually rose.
Official U.S. employment data due later on Friday are expected to show nonfarm payrolls fell by 8 million in May, while the unemployment rate is forecast to soar to 19.8%, from 14.7% in April.
Sterling has also posted gains Friday, with GBP/USD up 0.5%, at 1.2652, at levels not seen for almost three months.
That's despite the fact that the fourth round of EU-U.K. future relationship negotiations is set to  conclude later Friday, with little evidence emerging of any major breakthroughs. This could weigh on the pound going forward.

It has risen 27% after sliding to a near 18-year low in March, and is seen as a favored asset to buy among investors cheering the re-opening of economies from Singapore to Germany.
The Aussie could rise to 75 U.S. cents next year as it benefits from a cocktail of supportive monetary and fiscal policies, improving risk sentiment and the nation’s record trade surplus, Thomas Nash, a strategist at HSBC Bank Australia, wrote in a note. “Buying AUD in the depths of recession has been profitable in the past -- this time should be no different.”
The currency also received an inadvertent boost from Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe, who refrained from talking down the currency’s strength at a recent policy meeting.
The rising trend is likely to continue, according to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
“The rally has come from a position of currency undervaluation and is aligned to improvements in both risk appetite and global growth prospects,” ANZ strategists including Daniel Been wrote in a note. “As a result, at this stage, the move is unlikely to warrant attention from the RBA.

Spreads on the firms’ U.S. currency notes dropped 5.7 basis points compared with last week, according to DBS Bank Ltd. data, even after Moody’s cut India’s rating to the lowest investment grade with a negative outlook on Monday.
There have been some signs of nascent economic recovery as India begins to ease the world’s most stringent restrictions. After 122 million people lost their jobs as a result of a nationwide lockdown, the total number of people employed increased by 21 million in May even before the gradual lifting of the restrictions, according to Center for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. data released this week. Services sector activity in the nation also picked up slightly last month, data showed Wednesday.
“For now, markets could look past India’s rating downgrade,” Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank, said in a note.
The muted reaction to Moody’s sovereign downgrade on dollar-denominated papers comes amid a global rally in risk assets with the premiums on investment-grade bonds declining across Asia.
Still, despite the early signs of improvement, the challenges India faces remain stark, after its lockdown resulted in record low economic activity and fueled the biggest earnings decline in at least six years.
And state-owned Indian firms’ dollar debt didn’t hold up quite as well after Moody’s also took negative actions including one-level rating cuts and changes in outlook against a swathe of government-backed firms. Spreads on their securities widened slightly after the cut, according to DBS Bank.

But optimism over a global economic recovery from COVID-19 continues to remain high, with investors expecting further stimulus measures from governments and the expected development of a COVID-19 vaccine to further boost economic recovery.
According to Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 6.6 million COVID-19 cases and almost 400,000 deaths globally as of June 5.
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.05% to 109.18, and the USD/CNY pair gained a modest 0.01% to 7.1081.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.08% to 0.6947 and the NZD/USD pair jumped 0.11% to 0.6469.
The GBP/USD pair held steady at 1.2595.
Meanwhile, Asian risk currencies such as the AUD basked in the aftermath of the European Central Bank on Thursday increasing the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP).
ECB will now spend EUR1.35 trillion ($1.521 trillion), up from EUR 750 billion, to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. The program has also been extended to at least June 2021, and ECB pledged to reinvest the proceeds until the end of 2022 at the earliest.",,,,,

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts again upgraded their outlook for the Australian dollar in the latest Reuters poll, but were left lagging far behind the market which has already surpassed the one-year target after a week of blistering gains.
Median forecasts for the Aussie  were raised by around a cent to $0.6400 in one month, $0.6450 in three and $0.6800 on a one-year horizon. 
Yet the currency was trading at $0.6940 on Friday having climbed 4% just this week, reaching a five-month peak at $0.6988 at one stage. That beat out even the most bullish one-month forecast of $0.6842, which came from OCBC.
The sea change has seen local banks scramble to upgrade their forecasts for the currency. National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) on Thursday lifted their forecast for June by 6 cents to $0.6800 and for September by 6 cents to $0.7000.
Westpac currency strategist, Sean Callow, cautioned the rally had stretched well beyond fair value driven in large part by markets pricing in a global economic pick up even as the actual data remains largely dire.
Reflecting this, the Aussie has had a particularly strong correlation with the S&P 500 during the past month, higher than interest rate differentials or commodities.
""The contrast is stark between such price action and appalling economic activity data, so risk currencies are likely to be overshooting,"" said Callow. ""We still see AUD lower multi-month, yet only the brave would call an immediate end to the risk rally.""
The New Zealand dollar has also outpaced analysts, having surged 4.3% this week to reach $0.6469 . That was a world away from the trough of $0.5469 touched during the market chaos of mid-March.
It was also well beyond analysts' median forecasts of $0.6000 in one month and $0.6100 in three, and topped the one-year call of $0.6400.
NAB had again just upgraded its forecasts by around four cents and now tipped the kiwi at $0.6300 by June and $0.6600 by December.
""As the sheer depth and breadth of the global fiscal and monetary policy response to Covid-19 continues to influence sentiment, the NZ Dollar rides on the coattails of a seemingly unstoppable wave of increasing global risk appetite,"" said Hamish Wilkinson, a senior dealer at Kiwibank.
""With seemingly no other alternative for risk assets in a low interest rate world, we wouldn't be surprised to see continued NZ Dollar strength.""

752,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia will implement a tough new screening regime on foreign investors seeking to buy sensitive assets, as it bids to bolster national security amid a diplomatic row with China.
Telecommunications, energy, technology and defense-manufacturing companies will be included in the zero-dollar threshold for screening. The changes, intended to be legislated this year and enforced from Jan. 1, will include a new national security test and give the treasurer last-resort powers to force asset sales.
The changes could have implications on Australia’s relationship with its largest trading partner China, which have soured this year after Prime Minister Scott Morrison led calls for an independent probe on the origins of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
Beijing responded with verbal attacks on the conservative government, saying it was doing the bidding of key ally the U.S., while new tariffs on Australian barley and a ban on beef from four meatworks have raised fears in Canberra that the Chinese government is using “economic coercion” in retaliation.
Asked by a reporter in Canberra on Friday whether the changes will create new tensions with China, Morrison said: “I don’t believe why it should. Countries make decisions on their own interests for their own rules and we respect the rules and interests of other countries.”
Wider Concerns
Australia isn’t alone in ramping up its foreign investment screening -- in recent years, economies including the U.S., Japan and the European Union have toughened their own laws to protect national security. The new announcement comes a day after Morrison signed a crucial defense agreement with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and upgraded ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, as both nations navigate fraught relations with China.
“We have to be on our guard against China purchasing critical infrastructure and investing in our vital industries, so it makes sense for the government to extend and deepen its oversight of foreign investment,” said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra. “China will probably take umbrage but it needs to understand that Australia makes these decisions in its own interests.”
The U.S. remains Australia’s largest source of approved investment from overseas, comprising A$58.2 billion ($40.4 billion) -- or 25% of the total -- in the year ending June 2019. China comprised 5.7% of the total, valued at A$13.1 billion.
Under Australia’s current rules, state-owned enterprises already have zero-dollar screening threshold while most private investments under A$275 million, often for large land holdings, are waved through. The monetary thresholds have meant some investments that have raised national-security concerns have escaped screening.
Chinese purchases of agricultural land, including iconic properties such as the Cubbie Station in Queensland and the Van Diemen’s Land dairy in Tasmania, have proved particularly contentious in Australia.
Call in Powers
“The reforms will ensure that our foreign investment regime is able to respond to emerging risks and global developments,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said, labeling the changes the most significant in the area since 1975. The government will spend an additional A$54 million to bolster compliance and monitoring, he said.
After the changes, the treasurer will have power to to “call in” an investment before, during or after an acquisition for review if it raises national security risks and has not captured by the “sensitive national security businesses” definition.
“Technology has been evolving and our geopolitical climate has become more complex,” Frydenberg told reporters on Friday. “In fact, the world over, governments are seeing foreign investment being used for strategic objectives, not purely commercial ones.”
While the treasurer will have the power order disposal of approved foreign investments where national security risks emerge post-approval, the last-resort power will not be retrospective.
As treasurer in 2016, Morrison ordered the Foreign Investment Review Board to step up scrutiny of foreign investment in state-owned infrastructure after a strategic port in Darwin used by the U.S. military was leased to a Chinese company. The prime minister on Friday ruled out the possibility of that sale, which at the time escaped the regulator’s scrutiny as it was managed by the Northern Territory government, being revoked.
Protecting Assets
Sandy Mak, partner and head of corporate at Corrs Chambers Westgarth, said she looked forward to seeing whether details in the draft legislation due for release next month would make a fundamental difference to existing rules, and which sectors would be classified.
“The government’s objective here is protect sensitive assets and you’d hope when the legislation comes out it will achieves that without stymieing investment in the types of sectors and businesses that need it most,” Mak said. “Anything oil and gas related for energy independence, anything telecommunications related, and anything defense related is definitely going to be top of their list,” she said, while data-related investments may also be targeted.
Before Australia’s calls for a probe into the origins of the coronavirus, its diplomatic ties with Beijing were already under stress. The government cited Beijing’s “meddling” into national affairs as a catalyst for its anti-foreign interference laws passed in 2018, the same year it banned Huawei Technologies Ltd. from helping build its 5G network.
FIRB Chairman David Irvine welcomed the new screening package, saying it “appropriately addresses increasing risks to the national interest whilst ensuring Australia remains welcoming and open to foreign investment.”

753,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 09:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The world is still struggling to subdue the coronavirus but the bond and currency markets are already looking past the pandemic.
After sheltering in havens for weeks, investors are back in risk-on mode. The most indicative sign may lie in the dollar, which was the most sought-after asset during the worst of the selloff. It’s down for a third week.
Indonesian bonds, a barometer of risk appetite for emerging markets, have erased losses. Optimism is rising about the reopening of economies even as a growing spat between the U.S. and China threatens to set off another trade war.
“Pessimism surrounding the pandemic that we have seen is almost disappearing from the market,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Kokusai Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Even after huge fiscal stimulus was rolled out in many countries along with monetary easing, additional government spending is still planned or contemplated.”
Here are three charts to show investors are embracing risk again:
Dollar
As the global economy starts to come back online, the dollar has lost some of its haven appeal. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is on course for a third week of losses, the longest stretch since October.
Treasury yields have climbed about half a percentage point since dropping to a record low in March while the VIX index, or the so-called fear gauge, is near a three-month low.
“The dollar is counter-cyclical to risk appetite and so some of the dollar’s recent decline can be attributed to the lift in risk appetite,” Bank of New Zealand strategist Jason Wong wrote in a note Thursday. “Any further improvement in risk appetite alongside an improvement in global economic indicators should be met with further dollar weakness.”
Aussie
The Australian dollar has climbed over 6% since end-April as it tracked a rise in commodity prices. Tentative signs that China’s economy may have hit a trough have cemented expectations for further gains, with traders positioning for a rebound in coal and iron ore demand.
The Aussie rallied to 69.88 U.S. cents on Thursday, the strongest since early January, and AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd. says it may reach 80 U.S. cents by year end.
“There is increasing evidence that April was the bottom in activity and momentum has clearly tuned up and will continue to so” for economic growth, said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital in Sydney. “Most macro guys reflect their view on growth through the Aussie -- it’s highly liquid with a strong correlation with commodities.”
Emerging-Market Bonds
Developing-nation debt, a proxy for risk appetite, is back in favor. A Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) gauge of the debt has climbed almost 10% since crashing to a 16-month low in March.
Global funds are returning to emerging Asian bonds as the lure of yields that are multiple times that on Treasuries is proving hard to resist. An auction of rupiah debt this week drew a record amount of bids, reflecting the strengthening demand for regional securities.
“With the improvement in global risk appetite and signs that the worst for economic activity has passed, foreign investor flows are starting to return to Asia,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Positioning is likely light after the massive selloff we saw in the past couple of months, so there is potential for more inflows to return.”
But, some caution there may be little room for further upside in the risk rally.
“The market still has some uncertainties such as China-U.S. tensions,” said Albert Shau-Lun Leung, emerging Asia strategist at Nomura International Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Most global economies will still grow much weaker than trend even if financial market disruption has subsided.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro held big gains on Friday after the European Central Bank expanded its stimulus more than expected to prop up an economy dealing with its worst recession since World War Two.
The euro's gains helped support appetite for riskier currencies in Asia with the Australian dollar holding gains and the Hong Kong dollar higher.
The ECB increased its emergency bond purchase scheme by 600 billion euros, more than 500 billion expected by markets, to 1.35 trillion and extended the scheme to mid-2021.
The euro fetched $1.1338 (EUR=), having risen to as high as $1.1362 on Thursday, its loftiest level in almost three months. Its March 9 peak of $1.1495 is now seen as a next possible target. On the week, the single currency has risen 2.1% and is set to clinch a third straight week of gains.
Investor confidence in the currency has grown also after Germany last month threw its weight behind the idea of a European Union recovery fund, breaking away from its long-held tradition to resist moves towards fiscal integration in the currency bloc.
""Recent actions by both the EU Commission, as well as the ECB have reduced tail risks around the euro area economic outlook,"" said Zach Pandl, co-head of Global foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in New York.
""Europe's main challenge is its incomplete fiscal policy architecture. However, European institutions are making important changes to correct those weaknesses. And those include the ECB’s bond purchases as well as the EU recovery fund proposal, which we think will go a long way towards improving fiscal policy coordination in euro area,"" he added.
Against the yen, the common currency changed hands at 123.710 (EURJPY=), having risen to a 13-month high overnight.
On the Swiss franc, another safe have currency, it hit a five-month high of 1.0861 (EURCHF=) on Thursday and last stood at 1.0830.
The dollar index (=USD) is on course for its third consecutive week of losses at 96.743, the lowest levels in nearly three months.
The dollar traded at 109.11 yen , off two-month high hit in U.S. trade. Unwinding bets on safe-haven currencies reflected broad optimism in financial markets as easing social distancing restrictions supported economic recovery hopes.
The U.S. weekly jobless claims report showed the number of Americans filing for benefits dropped below 2 million last week for the first time since mid-March, even though that is still three times larger than their peak during the global financial crisis.
Official U.S. employment data due later on Friday is expected to show nonfarm payrolls fell by 8 million in May after a record 20.537 million plunge in April.
The unemployment rate is forecast to rocket to 19.8%, a post-World War Two record, from 14.7% in April.
Still investors are betting governments' stimulus around the world and the development of a vaccine for the COVID-19 will help the economy quickly bounce back from those dismal levels.
The Australian dollar , often seen as a risk proxy in the currency market, stood at $0.6947, having hit a five-month high of $0.6987 on Thursday.
The Hong Kong dollar rose to 7.7500 per U.S. dollar, the strong end of its 7.75-7.85 trading band, for the first time since May 21, prompting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to intervene in the market.
The gains came even amid rising worries about the future of the city after China's move last month to impose national security legislation.

Hong Kong police on Thursday pepper-sprayed some protesters who defied a ban to stage candlelight rallies in memory of China's bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) democracy crackdown.

755,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The longest euro rally in almost a decade is at risk of petering out even as investors’ appetite for risk makes a comeback.
Europe’s shared-currency climbed for a ninth day Thursday -- the longest streak since 2011 -- after the European Central Bank expanded its emergency bond-buying program to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It reached an almost three-month high of $1.1362, more than 4.5% above its May 25 low.
Yet while the euro’s surge against the dollar and other peers took it past key resistance levels, some strategists are urging caution and technical gauges are flashing warning signs.
“The ECB-induced euro rally is running out of steam,” Petr Krpata, a strategist at ING Bank said by email. Any “meaningful” euro gains should stem more from the dollar’s bear trend, rather than additional ECB impact, he said.
The euro currently appears to be overbought against the greenback, based on a relative strength index -- an indicator that measures the speed and size of price movements. A stochastic gauge, meanwhile, suggests that upward momentum may dwindle in coming sessions as the pair nears its year-to-date high of $1.1495.
Citigroup’s global head of foreign-exchange analysis Ebrahim Rahbari reckons now is a good time to take some profits even though he remains bullish on the currency. And ABN Amro’s Georgette Boele says it is premature to expect a “continued strong rally” in the currency as “difficult discussions” are ahead on the European Commission’s stimulus program.
The euro largely traded in lockstep with surging equity markets amid optimism about the prospects for a global economic recovery. Some are concerned that the recent surge in appetite for riskier assets may have gone too far, though, and that could also weigh on the common currency.
There are echoes in the current move of the euro’s rebound in late March, when it recovered from its pandemic lows. Back then, a rally of around 5% in just over a week was followed by a 3.5% slide in a matter of days.
Many observers nevertheless remain solid in their bullish calls for the euro. A trio of Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA’s quantitative models are signaling that the euro is the top Group-of-10 currency that investors should wager on to rally.
Nomura’s Jordan Rochester has a “high conviction” on the euro-dollar pair after last week flipping to a long position from a short one. And Standard Chartered’s Steven Englander says the euro region is looking more attractive.
Yen Cross
The currency busted through several key technical resistance levels against its Japanese peer on Thursday. The euro rose as much as 1.3% to 123.92 yen, the highest since May 2019 and notched its longest such streak of daily advances in over a decade.
The technical significance of the move was further bolstered by the fact that the pair has breached its 55-week and 100-week moving averages.
But, as with the euro-dollar pair, further gains may be difficult to muster. The euro-yen cross has struggled in the past to breach its 200-week moving average -- currently 124.50 -- and RSI gauges are also signaling that it’s getting stretched.
That, combined with concern about waning fundamental factors, could well provide fodder for euro bears.

Investing.com – The euro rose to a 12-week high against the dollar Thursday after the European Central Bank's bold stimulus measures stoked hopes the eurozone could emerge from the Covid-19 recession quicker than many expect.
EUR/USD rose 1.03% $1.0348.
The European Central Bank said Thursday it will increase its pandemic bond buying program by €600 billion ($681 billion) in an effort to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
The move was ""stronger and sooner than markets anticipated,"" said Esty Dwek, head of market strategy at Natixis Investment Solutions. But should ""keep yields low and spreads contained,"" supporting the recent rally of European assets, Dwek added.
The expansion in monetary stimulus comes as the EU proposed a €750 billion coronavirus fiscal rescue plan, which, if approved by member states, will support some of the hardest-hit regions in the bloc.
The steps forward on a fiscal stimulus package combined with the ECB's rapid policy response could see the eurozone recover more quickly from the Covid-19 recession than the U.S. and U.K., J.P. Morgan Asset Management said.
Euro area activity is ""expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favorable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance, and a resumption in global activity,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said Thursday."
757,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- For investors wondering how markets can keep rallying in the midst of economic disaster, just look to the weakening dollar.
Its descent to a three-month low is adding a pillar of support to the bullish foundations powering risk assets across the globe this week. Emerging markets, commodities and equities have surged as money managers look beyond unemployment headlines, and focus on central bank stimulus and business reopenings.
While the greenback’s decline is one sign that risk appetite is rising, it’s also adding extra fuel to the fire. A lower U.S. currency makes American goods cheaper overseas, helping companies boost earnings.
It also eases financial strain among emerging-market countries by allowing them to repay dollar-denominated debt more easily, and boost hard commodities like gold, copper and oil that are priced in the currency. Plus, there’s an added boost to inflation expectations, which benefits stocks most likely to profit from a stronger economy.
In the past month, the dollar weakened against all but two major currencies. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid 0.2% on Thursday, extending an almost 7% retreat from a recent high on March 23. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 30% and copper gained 19% in that time.
The Dollar Is in a Funk and That’s a Good Sign for the Economy
“The falling dollar is a big deal as it eases financial conditions,” said Mark Nash, the head of fixed income at Merian Global Investors in London. “Fiscal stimulus, balance sheet growth of banks and the Fed are a good part of solving the problems we had before, which was not enough lending and dollar strength globally.”
The dollar’s decisive retreat signals that the global liquidation rout for the history books in the depths of the March madness is now over. That’s a risk-on signal for Wall Street banks recommending international trades to clients including high yield and emerging-market debt around the world. The premium investors demand for holding 10-year Italian bonds over benchmark German debt has come down by 88 points from this year’s peak in March.
Carry traders that thrive on a weak dollar to buy higher-yielding emerging-market currencies are also on a high. A Bloomberg currency index that measures carry-trade returns from eight developing nations, funded by short positions in the greenback, posted its first positive month this year in May.
“It is usually the case that when the dollar is not soaking up liquidity i.e. rising, there is room for credit to perform,” said Luke Hickmore, who oversees about $3 billion as investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.
Hickmore is turning to riskier assets such as credit, though he acknowledges that the rally is largely running on central bank stimulus. There’s a good chance that worries about corporate health will come back into the picture later this year, and bring a wave of ratings downgrades.
“I have been very skeptical to say the least about a broad risk-on move. However, the high frequency economic data is improving and we are still getting massive fiscal and central bank buying,” Hickmore said. “It is, on balance, time to be risk-on, but maybe not up to the max budget.”
Tug-of-War Between Bulls and Bears Is Muddling Risk Signals
There’s also skepticism that the dollar’s weakness will last, especially in the middle of a recession. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch’s Athanasios Vamvakidis, the head of G-10 FX strategy, says the team is expecting a 4.3% drop in global economic growth, deeper than the consensus view for a 3% contraction.
“Investors expect a recovery of the global economy after the lockdown,” he said. “The recovery is going to be very weak, as economies cannot really go back to normal.”
Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, is more optimistic. He’s buying up higher risk assets and currencies to take advantage of the “backstop” from the Federal Reserve, and pointed to the violent U.S. protests as part of the reason behind the dollar’s poor performance.
“When I looked at the riots and the way the U.S. is handling the coronavirus pandemic, I thought, ‘Oh my God, we are coming apart at the seam,’” McIntyre said in an interview. “Maybe the U.S. is losing some of its exceptionalism. The dollar has been overvalued for a long time, and this might finally be a catalyst for the dollar to weaken.”

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's foreign currency reserves are falling fast despite the government's tightening of access to dollars, hitting the lowest level since early 2017 in May as the country struggles to control the coronavirus and a long-simmering debt crisis.
Central bank reserves fell almost $1 billion last month as the entity looked to prop up Argentina's peso, and have tumbled around $3 billion since early January. They now stand at $42.6 billion, down from a peak near $80 billion early last year.
The low levels have raised a red flag as Argentina looks to hike emergency spending to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, dig out of a biting recession and appease foreign creditors pushing for a bigger payout in a $65 billion debt restructuring.
The central bank has sought to restrict companies' access to dollars in recent weeks. Private citizens can only buy $200 in foreign currency on the official exchange market per month, and must pay a steep tax.
""Despite the restrictions on buying foreign currency ... growing uncertainty has unleashed a new round of falling reserves,"" local consultancy Ecolatina said, adding the ""alarming levels"" could prompt more tightening.
The South American country imposed tough capital controls last year after a market crash led to a dramatic pick-up in foreign currency demand, as the central bank looked to prop up a weakened peso and savers shifted to safe-haven dollars.
Argentine officials say they want to relax controls once the economy has been stabilized and a debt deal reached. But fears remain about a damaging run on the peso in a country that has struggled to build confidence in its currency for years.
The central bank's current international reserves amount to less than the total value of Argentina's imports last year.
Central bank interventions have helped keep the peso  mostly stable recently, but its value on unofficial markets has plummeted, creating a worrying gap with the official rate.
The government is inching closer to a vital debt restructuring, but still faces tough hurdles to reach a comprehensive deal with creditors.

""While the negotiations last, we expect strong control over foreign exchange operations will remain in place given the backdrop of falling reserves and high demand for dollars,"" said Argentine financial advisory Portfolio Personal Inversiones.

Investing.com -- The European Central Bank said Thursday it will increase the size of its main pandemic-fighting bond purchase program by 600 billion ($672 billion), ramping up its efforts to support a Eurozone economy that is expected to shrink by more than 8% this year.
The ECB also said after its regular council meeting that it will stretch the purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program out until at least the middle of next year. ""In any case, the Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over,"" it added.
The bank will also reinvest the proceeds of any PEPP holdings that mature until 2022, a move that will marginally sustain and prolong the stimulus effect.
""After the announcement of the European Recovery Plan and last night’s powerful German fiscal stimulus package, the ECB has added to real stimulus fireworks,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist with ING in Frankfurt.
The bank made no other major changes to its policy stance, leaving its key interest rates unchanged, as expected and not changing the overall volume of its other bond purchases, which will continue to run at 20 billion euros a month.
The euro hit its highest level in nearly three months against the dollar on the news, reflecting that a minority of investors had expected a further cut in the -0.5% deposit facility rate. By 7:57 AM ET (1157 GMT), the euro was up 0.3% at $1.1268, just off its earlier high of $1.1272."
760,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- From saber rattling with China to fresh fear about Brexit, a uniquely British set of risks is taking the shine off the pound.
Sterling snapped its longest winning streak in nearly three months and slipped against almost all its Group-of-10 peers as the U.K. careens toward a row with Beijing over Hong Kong.
Two major British banks which operate in Hong Kong,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, distanced themselves from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s criticism of Beijing’s planned imposition of a security law on the former British territory.
The banks’ move to support China came as a reminder of the strength of the U.K.’s business links with Hong Kong according to Jane Foley, the head of currency strategy at Rabobank in London.
“This is an issue that certainly needs to be watched closely,” she said.
Johnson has said he will give as many as 3 million Hong Kong residents the chance to seek refuge and a new life in the U.K. if China presses ahead with the legislation.
The U.K. is also taking steps to exclude Huawei from its fifth-generation mobile networks by lining up potential replacements, another move likely to anger Beijing.
List of Risks
It adds a new dimension to the international political uncertainty in London, where the government is already at odds with the European Union over trade, and the next round of talks set to end on Friday.
Brexit fears were highlighted this week when the central bank told U.K. lenders to prepare for a no-deal scenario when the transition period expires in December.
As the pound’s wider boost from a weaker dollar fades, further clouds are gathering with talk of negative interest rates from the Bank of England as the U.K. grapples with what could be the worst recession in 300 years.
“Risk appetite is easing, the market is reflecting on the tightening Brexit timetable following the BOE warning,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of G-10 currency research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.
He also pointed to concern about further coronavirus infections, not least among lawmakers, adding “Covid in Parliament is not a ‘good look.’”
That could also add to doubts about the pound’s resilience in recent days, with a lack of signs of worsening relations at the Brexit talks enough to keep investors upbeat.
Sentiment on sterling is at its least bearish since mid-March, according to options, while implied volatility shows no real concern about the month-end deadline to extend the transition period.
But as its rally fades, attention could soon turn to the need for progress between London and Brussels.
For Rabobank’s Foley, that is likely to be the next focus. “I would put Brexit as the bigger issue for the pound near-term,” she said.

Investing.com - The dollar has gained some buyers in early European trade Thursday, as tensions between China and the U.S. flared up again overnight, but gains against the euro have been limited ahead of the European Central Bank meeting.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 97.502, up 0.3%. However, the index is still down about 5% from its March peak, when the coronavirus pandemic had caused a sprint to this safe haven.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 109.03, GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.2533 and EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.1210.
Overnight, the U.S. administration suspended flights into its country by Chinese airlines effective from June 16, reciprocating after China had barred American carriers from entering its airspace.

Still, EUR/USD remains above the 1.12 level that it broke through on Wednesday for the first time since mid-March. 
The currency has been bolstered by hopes for European Union-wide fiscal support measures after Germany last month threw its weight behind the idea of a European Union recovery fund, breaking away from its long-held tradition to resist moves towards fiscal integration in the currency bloc.
This prompted the European Commission to propose a 750 billion euro recovery fund, with the money divided into 500 billion euros given to EU countries as grants and the remaining 250 billion euros would be available as loans. 
The European Central Bank had been undertaking a lot of the heavy lifting needed to support the region’s weakest economies prior to this, and is still expected to offer up more largesse later Thursday.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning, with investors turning to the safe-haven asset as U.S.-China tensions flared up overnight.
In its latest move, the U.S. suspended flights into the U.S. by Chinese airlines effective from June 16 after China barred American carriers from re-entering China.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will lose recent gains against the dollar and weaken further if Britain does not ask for an extension to its Brexit transition period by a June 30 deadline to allow more time for talks on a trade deal with the EU, a Reuters poll found.
The currency  has strengthened this week, trading at a one-month high of around $1.26 on Wednesday, as Britain indicated that it might be willing to compromise on some sticking points to reach a final Brexit deal.
Talks between the two sides, aimed at setting out a new future with Britain outside the European Union for the first time in 47 years, have all but stalled, but there are hopes for a compromise.
Britain formally departed the EU on January 31, three and a half years after a surprise referendum vote in favour of leaving, and the transition period - during which Britain remains in the EU single market and customs union - is due to finish at the end of this year.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has until the end of June to ask for an extension and has repeatedly ruled this out. All but two of 23 respondents to an additional question in the poll said sterling would weaken in early July if there is no extension.
""The fading prospect of an extension to the post-Brexit transition period, and the risk of supply chain disruption at the start of 2021, casts a cloud over (Britain's) GBP outlook,"" said James Smith at ING.
BREXIT BACK IN SPOTLIGHT
""Brexit is back in the spotlight. There's little to suggest we should expect any real progress, and that's one reason why we've seen some risk premium creep back into the pound.""
The pound is expected to have weakened to $1.23 by end-June, according to the wider poll of over 50 foreign strategists taken this week.
Still, Reuters polls of economists have repeatedly said the two sides would eventually thrash out a free trade deal and the pound was expected to have strengthened around 1.6% to $1.28 in a year. 
""Our central scenario still assumes that the UK will leave the EU in an orderly fashion, most likely on 31 December 2020 and with a free trade agreement being a crucial part of the new relationship,"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
""With the UK and the EU economies already paying a heavy toll from COVID-19, officials on both sides have very few incentives to disrupt the current system even more and to add extra layers of uncertainty at such a critical time.""
Britain has suffered the highest death toll in Europe from COVID-19 and a government-imposed lockdown to try and quell the spread of the coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the economy. GDP is expected to contract 17.5% this quarter.

Countries across Europe have also seen their economies crippled and the euro common currency  will move little against the pound, the poll found. In one month a euro will get you 90 pence and in a year it will be worth 88p.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro held near multi-month highs against rival majors Thursday on expectations the European Central Bank will expand its bond buying programme later in the day to shore up the coronavirus-stricken economy.
The euro's strength helped to push the dollar's index against a basket of key currencies to the lowest level in nearly three months.
The euro stood at $1.12305 (EUR=), having risen to $1.1258 on Wednesday, its highest levels since mid-March and the seven straight session of gains.
Against the Japanese yen, the common currency rose to a 4-1/2-month high of 122.625 overnight and last stood at 122.41 yen (EURJPY=).
It also fetched 1.0798 franc (EURCHF=) on the safe-haven Swiss currency, having risen to as high as 1.0820, its strongest since Jan. 14.
The European Central Bank is widely expected to increase the size of its 750 billion euro ($669 billion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) as early as Thursday.
The ECB delivers its policy decision at 1145 GMT and ECB President Christine Lagarde holds a news conference at 1230 GMT.
The currency has been bolstered by hopes for European Union-wide fiscal support measures after Germany last month threw its weight behind the idea of a European Union recovery fund, breaking away from its long-held tradition to resist moves towards fiscal integration in the currency bloc.
That has largely underpinned the euro's rise against the dollar for seven straight sessions until Wednesday, having gained 2.3% during this period.
""I suspect the market has already priced in an increase of about 500 billion in the PEPP and in the near-term, there is risk of a correction,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""The market could react positively if the ECB expands the target of its bond purchase or scrap its limit on each country. But in terms of the total size, it is hard to expect a positive surprise now,"" he said.
The dollar index (=USD) stood at 97.340, having fallen about 1% so far this week as broad improvement in risk sentiment, underpinned by reopening of economies globally, reduced the allure for the greenback.
On Wednesday data showed that U.S. private payrolls fell less than expected in May, suggesting layoffs were abating as businesses reopen, though the overall economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will be slow. 
Predictably, the safe-haven yen also weakened during much of this period, and was last trading at 108.96 yen , near a two-month low of 108.98 hit in previous U.S. trade.
Sterling was changing hands at $1.2576 , near its highest levels in over a month, helped by signs that Britain might be willing to compromise on sticking points in Brexit negotiations with the European Union.
Britain is expected to indicate flexibility over fisheries and trade rules if the European Union agrees to lessen its demands regarding regulatory alignment and fishing access, the Times newspaper reported on Tuesday as a new round of talks kicks off.

Britain has until July 1 to ask for an extension to the current transition period, which ends in December.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - A fading of the U.S. dollar's allure will continue as global funding strains ease, but a majority of analysts polled by Reuters said there was a high risk that the U.S.-China trade standoff will renew safe-haven bets in the next six months. 
Most major and emerging market currencies have rallied against the greenback. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) is down about 5% from a March peak, when panic over the coronavirus pandemic gripped financial markets.
World shares hit three-month highs on Wednesday as monetary and fiscal stimulus have given traders confidence, despite expectations for a slow economic recovery, growing concerns over U.S.-China tensions, U.S. civil unrest and rising coronavirus infections.
Those risks usually are a recipe for dollar strength but the June 1-3 poll of over 60 analysts predicted the greenback's losing streak would continue on expectations most major central banks would carry on buying government bonds and other financial assets.
""There is clearly a disconnect between news headlines regarding geopolitics and the economy and what's going on in markets. The markets fear about the global economy has been offset by huge amounts of liquidity and monetary stimulus from central banks,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""There are a number of bad risks...and the fact that we are in the midst of falling into a very deep downturn that could certainly harm investor sentiment in the coming months. But for now, the liquidity provision of quantitative easing has been like a morphine injection.""
A slight majority, 29 of 50 analysts, said in response to an additional question that risks were skewed more to the downside for the dollar over the next six months.
In a separate question, more than 70% of 57 analysts said the risk was ""high"" that the U.S.-China standoff would renew bets in favour of safe-haven currencies over the next six months.
""With the U.S. elections just a few months ahead, the de-escalation of U.S.-China tensions looks unlikely. The challenging domestic contest and the USD overvaluation...lead us to see risks skewed to the downside over the next six months,"" said Roberto Cobo Garcia, head of G10 FX strategy at BBVA (MC:BBVA).

International rates to borrow dollars on cross-currency basis swaps, which were extremely high in mid-March, have hit low levels, with the latest euro-dollar three-month swaps rate suggesting it has become more costly to borrow the euro instead.
The euro (EUR=), which rose above $1.12 for the first time in 11 weeks on Wednesday, was on track for a seven-day winning streak against the dollar - its longest since December 2013.
That was largely driven by broad dollar weakness and on expectations policymakers would support the euro zone's weakest economies with debt purchases.
The euro has disregarded a contraction in May economic activity based on the PMIs and the increase in the jobless rate, with traders more focused on expectations the European Central Bank would increase its pandemic-related bond purchases when it meets on Thursday.
While the single currency was expected to trade around $1.10 in one, three and six months, it was forecast to gain nearly 2% to $1.14 in a year. That is a slight upgrade from $1.08, $1.09, $1.10 and $1.13, respectively, for those periods predicted a month ago.
There were also hopes a 750 billion-euro European Commission recovery fund would soon take form and bolster the worst-performing countries in the bloc.

The euro was expected to be ""stronger"" against the dollar in the immediate aftermath if the European Union parliament passes the coronavirus recovery fund but would be ""weaker"" or ""much weaker"" if it fails, a majority of analysts said in response to separate questions.

766,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- When the offshore yuan matched its record low last week, it served notice that China’s exchange-rate fixing had returned as a key variable to participants in the $6.5 trillion-a-day global foreign-exchange market.
With Sino-American tensions on the rise again, China’s appetite to allow significant drops in the yuan will affect the day-to-day moves of a whole raft of other currencies. While correlation is lacking over longer periods, last Wednesday showcased the kind of spot impact the yuan can have for others. The offshore yuan slid 0.7% at one point against the dollar in wake of the bilateral flare-up over Hong Kong. Australia’s dollar dropped as much as 1.3%, while the Colombian peso saw a 1.4% drop.
“The yuan is definitely on my radar,” said Stuart Simmons, a senior portfolio manager at QIC Ltd., which manages about A$83 billion ($53 billion). “I use it more as an indicator to take advantage of opportunities in markets.”
Others are making direct bets on the currency. Mansoor Mohi-uddin, a markets veteran of more than two decades who’s now a macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Singapore, said the yuan is “an increasingly important part of investor FX portfolios.”
“The yuan is in the top two or three currency pairs now that investors will assess for an outlook for global currencies,” said Mohi-uddin. It’s an indicator of global sentiment, and of the trade war, he said.
The yuan’s attention belies it’s still-small share of global trading. It accounted for 4.3% of trades in a Bank for International Settlements survey last year, roughly one quarter the share of the yen, and still behind the likes of the Australian dollar and Swiss franc. Still, part of that is because of capital controls and limits on the free use of the yuan in global markets.
Indeed, Simmons at QIC said “the controls do introduce concerns of unwarranted risk around your hedging.”
‘More Important’
But in a way that, say, Britain’s pound cannot, the yuan can give investors instant insight into the state of U.S.-China ties and, in particular, Chinese policy makers’ willingness to up-the-ante in continuing trade tensions by deploying exchange-rate depreciation as a tool.
“The yuan now is more important than, for instance, the yen or sterling,” Olivier Korber, a foreign-exchange and derivatives strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA in Paris, said of the yuan’s clout on sentiment and risk appetite.
That’s why the People’s Bank of China’s daily fixing for the yuan in the local market is again a fixture for traders to monitor each day. The announcement, about 9:15 a.m. Shanghai time, offers a glimpse of whether officials would like to restrain depreciation.
“Over the last month the PBOC has demonstrated some tolerance for gradual currency depreciation, in our view,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts including Zach Pandl wrote in a May 31 note. The team cut its projection for the yuan to 7.25 per dollar over three months. It was at 7.1086 Wednesday afternoon in Shanghai.
Trading Rises
The yuan has been in the spotlight plenty of times before, notably back in 2015, when a messy devaluation saw reverberations across asset classes, as investors tried to interpret what the move meant for China’s economic outlook.
The attention and occasional impact on global markets belies the currency’s small presence in the world’s payments system and in central bank reserves -- about 2% or less on both counts, as of the end of 2019. The onshore yuan had a daily traded volume of $33 billion last year, compared with $3.27 trillion for the dollar and $1.59 trillion for the euro.
“Yes, people are watching the yuan closely,” said Wong Joo Seng, chief executive of the foreign-exchange platform Spark Systems. “Trading has gone up -- but it still has a way to go yet before it becomes truly global.”

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's central bank said on Wednesday it was speaking to its U.S. and Chinese counterparts to increase flexibility in foreign exchange operations as the coronavirus pandemic ravages the nation´s once-stable economy.
The bank said it had asked the New York Federal Reserve to register for overnight repo operations to facilitate credit swaps, announced in March to help foreign central banks during the crisis to exchange their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for overnight dollar loans.
In a statement, the bank added it was also speaking to China's central bank to expand an existing currency swap agreement worth 22 billion yuan ($3 billion).
""This expansion, which is expected to materialize in the coming weeks, aims to strengthen Chile's financial position and facilitate Chilean foreign trade operations with China,"" the bank said.
Separately, the central bank said it would gradually scale back its foreign exchange intervention program in the non-deliverable forward (NDF) market as volatility of the country´s peso currency has subsided. Policymakers had already suspended similar operations in the spot market as the peso has stabilized.
The bank launched both programs late in 2019 after protests rocked Chile and sent the peso spiraling to historic lows.
The central bank said it would remain vigilant amid the coronavirus outbreak and intervene again in case of ""excess volatility.""

768,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Latin American currencies have staged a rebound since mid-May on fledgling signs of renewed global growth and as central banks pour liquidity into the system. Technical barriers to further gains are few and far between.
Brazil’s real has rallied almost 17% since May 15, while the Mexican peso is up more than 11% -- the biggest gains among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Those two currencies had previously led losses, sinking 31% and 21% respectively this year through mid-May.
A general easing of volatility and gains in emerging-market assets worldwide have help lift Latin American currencies. But there are also idiosyncratic factors in play. The return of the carry trade in Mexico, subsiding political tensions in Brazil and higher copper prices for Chile and Peru also contributed significantly. Such is the new risk appetite that investors are turning a blind eye to the pandemic, even as Latin America now accounts for 40% of the coronavirus deaths worldwide.
“The market seems to be shrugging all bad news off,” said Delphine Arrighi, a London-based portfolio manager at Merian Global Investors. The rally is the result of abundant liquidity offered by central banks, cheap valuations and some lockdowns being lifted, even as political risks flare up, she added.
The Chilean peso strengthened past its 100-day moving average on May 20 and surged through the 200-day average in less than two weeks, reaching overbought territory based on the relative strength index and down only 2% this year. Colombia’s peso is now overbought as well, after trimming 2020 losses to about 8%.
The Mexican peso also strengthened past its 100-day moving average on Tuesday with about 5% to go before reaching the next key resistance at the 200-day average. The Brazilian real is more than 2% away from its 100-DMA and a breach could pave the way for another 9% rally before hitting the 200-DMA.
“Eventually we will begin to see some profit-taking and investors will pay attention to details again,” said Merian’s Arrighi. “But we are probably not quite there yet.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's plans to impose a national security law on Hong Kong and moves by the United States to begin withdrawing privileges enjoyed by the city under U.S. law have unsettled investors. They have also raised fears about the stability of the Hong Kong dollar's  (HKD) 36-year old peg to its U.S. counterpart, prompting local officials to issue several reassurances. 
HOW THE PEG WORKS
The HKD is pegged in a narrow range of 7.75-7.85 to the U.S. dollar. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) buys and sells the currency at either limit to maintain the range. Buying HKD boosts it by reducing its availability and raises the costs of betting against the currency. Sales do the opposite.
To maintain the peg, official Hong Kong interest rates track U.S. monetary policy. The currency's movement within its trading band is influenced by differences between market interest rates in both. Hong Kong interbank rates  are higher than their U.S. equivalents , helping keep the HKD strong in spite of concerns about outflows related to the national security law. 
HOW VULNERABLE IS THE PEG?
There are fears that escalating U.S.-China tensions could result in the United States potentially limiting Hong Kong banks' access to U.S. dollars, thus putting an end to the peg.
Eddie Yue, chief executive of the HKMA, said on Tuesday the peg predates by nine years the 1992 U.S. Act which grants Hong Kong special status - whose provisions Washington is currently reconsidering.
""For the past 36 years, the (peg) has withstood the test of various market shocks and has been operating smoothly,"" Yue wrote in a blog post on June 2. ""It is a pillar of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems and will not be changed because of any shift in foreign policies towards Hong Kong.""
Hong Kong also has $440 billion in reserves - six times the currency in circulation. The HKMA can also call on China's central bank for U.S. dollars, the city's top finance official said this week.
WHY THE HKD MATTERS
Hong Kong's economy has shrunk in its importance relative to the mainland since the territory's 1997 handover to China but its financial significance has grown. Any real threat to the peg risks undermining that.
With China maintaining tight capital controls, Hong Kong acts as a key financing conduit, hosting one of the largest stock markets in the world and acting as the biggest gateway for international investment in mainland stocks and bonds. It has also become one of the world's biggest currency trading centres and ranks third globally for U.S. dollar trading.
China's wealthy have put faith in the city too, with more than half of Hong Kong's estimated private wealth of more than $1 trillion coming from mainland individuals.

Investing.com - The dollar has sold off in early European trade Wednesday, with riskier assets in demand as investors look for more fiscal stimulus amid signs of a global economic recovery.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 97.362, down 0.3%, falling to levels last seen in the middle of March. USD/JPY was largely flat at 108.67.
EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.1220, trading above 1.12 for the first time since mid March, on hopes policymakers will continue to support the euro zone, despite the German government's failure to agree on a second big stimulus package Tuesday. The region’s weakest economies are still struggling to recover from the measures used to combat the coronavirus outbreak, although the gradual reopening of the European economy continued Wednesday as Italy lifted its quarantine regulations for visitors.
The European Central Bank is expected to increase its 750 billion euro  ($840 billion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, on Thursday, probably by around 500 billion euros.
Sterling has also posted gains against the U.S. dollar, up 0.5% at 1.2606, above 1.26 for the first time since mid April, in sympathy with a rally in global equity prices amidst steadily improving investor sentiment regarding the global exit from lockdown.
That said, the U.K. and EU still appear far from a solution to avoid a big disruption to trade after the post-Brexit transition period ends at the end of the year. The two sides started their last scheduled talks on the issue this week, and doubts remain about the likelihood of progress.
Earlier Wednesday, data showed that China’s services sector returned to growth last month for the first time since January.
USD/CNY traded 0.1% higher at 7.1089, but still off the 7.17 levels seen at the end of last week as the tensions between the U.S. and China were at their peak.
Additionally, the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy bet on the strength of the Chinese economy, rose 0.6% to fetch $0.6938, hitting a five-month high against the greenback, despite the country’s GDP falling 0.3% during the first quarter of 2020, a second straight quarterly contraction.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was down on Wednesday morning in Asia after increasing optimism over a global economic recovery from COVID-19 increased investor risk appetite.
Investors focused on countries continuing to loosen lockdown measures and restarting their economies, despite the ever-growing number of COVID-19 cases and no cure.
There are almost 6.4 million global cases of the virus as of June 3, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Gross domestic product fell 0.3% from the final three months of 2019, the first quarterly drop since 2011, compared with a forecast 0.4% decline, statistics bureau data showed in Sydney Wednesday. From a year earlier, it expanded 1.4%, matching estimate
The result sets up an end to Australia’s record run of avoiding two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, having dodged recessions during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 global financial crisis. The current quarter will see a deep contraction, with almost 600,000 jobs lost in April alone and much of the economy in lockdown to contain the coronavirus.
Fiscal and monetary policy are working in tandem to rebuild the economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia has taken the cash rate near zero and lowering the cost of borrowing with its 0.25% bond yield target. The government has injected tens of billions of dollars into the economy to help tide businesses and households through the lockdown.
With the containment of the health crisis allowing activity to resume, how quickly businesses can get back on their feet, workers regain employment and households resume spending is the critical question.
“The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely,” RBA Governor Philip Lowe said Tuesday after keeping borrowing costs unchanged.
“However, the outlook, including the nature and speed of the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy,” he said. “In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell against most Asian currencies on Wednesday as prospects of more government stimulus and a global economic recovery emboldened investors to step up holdings of riskier assets.
The Australian dollar hit a five-month high against the dollar, as funds headed toward economies that are seen to be recovering the fastest from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Aussie, which has benefited from signs its economic downturn may be less severe than initially feared, could get an additional boost if first quarter gross domestic product data due later on Wednesday shows the country dodged a contraction.
China's yuan is also in focus before the release of services sector data from the world's second-largest economy, which could bolster expectations for economic recovery.
The greenback also fell against the British pound and nursed losses against the safe-haven Swiss franc as investors pondered mass protests against racism spreading across the United States.
""The U.S. dollar is generally weak,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""The Australian dollar has a lot of room to run because there are still a lot of shorts that need to be covered. The economy recovery story is the main factor.""
The Australian dollar  rose early in Asian trading to $0.6930, the highest since Jan. 7.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar  jumped to $0.6391, the highest since March 9.
The greenback also slumped to a one-month low of $1.2584 against the British pound .
The Aussie continued to draw buyers after the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday focused on the prospects for a speedy recovery from the coronavirus shock.
Australia's GDP data is unlikely to capture the full impact of coronavirus lockdowns had on the economy, but traders say sentiment for the Aussie has turned bullish because lockdown restrictions are easing and due to rising commodity prices.
Traders will also monitor the yuan's opening in onshore trade  and the release of China's services PMI for May.
The coronavirus first emerged in China late last year, but it is also the first major economy to ease severe lockdown restrictions, meaning it is likely to recover earlier than other countries.
The greenback's fortunes against other safe-haven currencies were mixed.
The dollar bought 0.9619 Swiss franc , close to a two-month low.
However, the U.S. currency briefly rose to a two-month high of 108.40 yen , threatening to break out of its recent trading range.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to use the military to quell spreading protests against racism and police brutality, but U.S. stocks continue to rally, leaving some currency traders groping for direction.
The euro (EUR=D3) bought $1.1180 on Wednesday in Asia, close to the highest since March 16, on hopes policymakers will support the euro zone's weakest economies.
The European Central Bank is expected to increase its 750 billion euro ($839.25 billion) bond-buying programme, the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, on Thursday, probably by around 500 billion euros.

The ECB scooped up all of Italy's new debt in April and May but merely managed to keep borrowing costs for the indebted, virus-stricken country from rising, data showed on Tuesday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real extended its rally in dramatic fashion on Tuesday, taking advantage of improving global market sentiment and demand for riskier assets to chalk up its biggest rise against the dollar in two years.
The real was one of the worst-performing currencies in the world this year as markets tanked and the global economic and public health crises deepened, sinking to a record low near 6.00 per dollar. But it has roared back in recent weeks.
It rallied more than 3% on Tuesday, its biggest one-day gain since June, 2018, to trade at a seven-week high of 5.20 per dollar (BRBY). As traders rotate out of dollar-denominated assets, a test of 5.00 per dollar is now on traders' radar.
""I wouldn't discard it,"" said the head of trading at a bank in Sao Paulo, noting huge global monetary and fiscal stimulus, encouraging signs from countries reopening their economies, and surging stock markets.
""However, I am surprised to see how quickly things have happened,"" he said, also noting that central bank intervention has helped ease the pressure on the real lately.
The real has been closely correlated with Brazilian interest rates recently, generally depreciating when the rates curve steepens and appreciating when it flattens.
The currency's move in the last 10 days has been stronger than the move in interest rates, suggesting any investor cautiousness or bearishness toward Brazil is being expressed in rates, not the currency.

Traders note that political risk surrounding President Jair Bolsonaro persists, the COVID-19 crisis is far from over and fallout from the looming recession has yet to be felt.
Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) reckon record low interest rates, no economic growth and ""rising political noise"" will see the dollar rise above 6.00 reais in the coming weeks.
But for now, at least, real skeptics have been pushed to the sidelines.

Investing.com – The pound eased from one-month highs against the dollar on Tuesday, after failing to break a key technical trading level after the U.K. dismissed reports that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ready to compromise on key sticking points that have stifled progress in post-Brexit talks.
GBP/USD rose 0.34% to $1.2541, but had jumped as high as $1.2575, testing its 100-day moving average, a key technical level at around $1.2573.
The U.K. has expressed a desire to take control over access to its waters and fish when the transition period ends, rather stick with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which set fishing quotas among EU member states.  
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman reportedly said that reports suggesting the U.K. is ready to compromise on fisheries and level playing field rules was ""wishful thinking by the EU.""
“We have always been clear there is no question of splitting the difference on level playing field and fish,"" he added. 
The remarks added to growing concerns over a lack of progress on negotiations so far, ahead of the fourth round of post-Brexit talks, which get underway today before both sides take a break to assess progress.
With the clock running down on the end of June deadline for U.K. to request an extension on trade talks of up to two years, many have warned the path ahead for sterling will likely be fraught with challenges amid a weaker economic backdrop.
Data on Tuesday showed a sharp fall in U.K. mortgage approvals in April, and house prices suffering the steepest monthly decline in 11 years.
""There are significant headwinds to demand in prospect--higher unemployment, falling wages and significant economic uncertainty,"" HSBC said."
776,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury yield curve is approaching its steepest level in three years as policy responses to the coronavirus pandemic and glimmers of hope on the economic front drive a wedge between intermediate- and long-term interest rates.
The spread between 5-year and 30-year yields touched 117.6 basis points on Tuesday as long-maturity yields rose to a two-month high. The curve slope was steeper on just one day this year -- March 19, in the teeth of the liquidity crisis that prompted the Federal Reserve to ramp up its daily buying of Treasuries. The spread touched 118.2 basis points that day, before easing to around 80 basis points within days as the Fed flooded the market with liquidity.
The re-steepening since then reflects Fed policy expectations that are keeping short-term rates low, while the Treasury boosts long-maturity supply to finance economic-recovery measures, said Guneet Dhingra, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). The curve’s move also coincides with a sense that the economy may be starting to revive after months of lockdown measures, with stocks hovering near the highest in almost three months.
“When the news is good, 30-year yields tend to go higher much more than the front-end because everyone understands that when things improve the Fed isn’t going to be rushing to hike rates,” Dhingra said.
But the curve also has been steepening on days when yields decline because investors see the potential for the Fed to respond with measures including a negative policy rate -- which it has so far forsworn -- that could lead to lower short-term yields.
Downbeat economic news leads people “to expect that the Fed will do more in terms of forward guidance,” and “on the margin the market thinks that negative rates start to become possible as things worsen,” spurring bigger declines for 5-year than for 30-year yields, Dhingra said.
Long-maturity rates rose in May for the first monthly increase this year as U.S. stocks advanced, reflecting improved investor sentiment as stay-at-home orders were lifted in some states, allowing businesses to reopen. Also, data on continuing jobless claims last week suggested that the labor market may have begun to rebound. Meanwhile, on the policy front:
“This trade so far has been tactical, but it has the potential to become strategic” in a few months’ time as improving economic data “start to put pressure on yields to go higher,” Dhingra said.

777,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound surged to its highest in over a month against the dollar on speculation this week’s Brexit talks might start to yield a hint of progress.
Sterling is on its longest rising streak versus the greenback since April. While the U.K. and European Union have shown few signs of ceding ground, the Times newspaper reported the potential for compromise from London, ahead of a end-month deadline to extend the Brexit transition period beyond this year.
That is adding fuel to a recovery in the pound after it slumped in May, when intransigence in the Brexit talks compounded with a roster of poor economic data from the coronavirus epidemic. The easing of lockdowns is now improving global sentiment for riskier assets and putting the dollar under pressure, helping to lift sterling.
“There are slightly better odds for a deal and that might be keeping the pound in the upside this week,” said Olivia Alvarez Mendez, a foreign-exchange market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. “Even a no-deal scenario could be a relief for sterling in the medium run as it implies the end of the long-lasting period of uncertainty.”
The pound gained as much as 0.7% to $1.2576, building on Monday’s 1.2% rally to touch the highest since May 1, before trading up 0.4% at $1.2536. Against the euro, it rose as much as 0.5% to 88.67 pence, the highest in more than two weeks.
Pound Investors Have Too Much on Plate to Obsess About Brexit
There’s still the potential for negative headlines in coming days. Traders will now have their eyes fixed on the next EU summit later this month, when heads of state will assess progress on the talks, as well as signs of an economic recovery.

Investing.com - The dollar has few friends in early European trade Tuesday, as the tone remains generally optimistic about the global recovery despite heightened concerns over U.S.-China tensions and civic unrest in many U.S. cities.
At 3:25 AM ET (0725 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 97.793, largely flat on the day, having earlier fallen as low as 97.73, its lowest level since mid-March. USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 107.77.
Earlier Tuesday, Australia’s central bank kept its interest rate and yield objectives unchanged amid early signs of a recovery. 
“It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected,” Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement.
The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy bet on the strength of the Chinese economy, rose 0.1% to fetch $0.6802, having reached its highest levels since late January.
This follows U.S. manufacturing activity easing off an 11-year low in May, feeding into the narrative of an economy turning upwards. 
This has overshadowed continued violent protests in many U.S. cities over alleged police brutality as well as renewed hostility between China and the U.S. over China’s treatment of Hong Kong’s special status.
""There are some potential flash points such as U.S. demonstrations and China-U.S. tensions. But, on the whole, the market is still moderately risk-on,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
The euro has retained its recent strength Tuesday, having been boosted by last week’s EU stimulus package, and ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank, where it is widely expected to raise its asset buying by around 500 billion euros to 1.25 trillion. It's also being supported by reports of another German government stimulus package, due to be debated later Tuesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet.
The EUR/USD fetched $1.1126, little changed so far on Tuesday but holding near a 2-1/2-month high of $1.1154 touched on Monday.
GBP/USD traded at $1.2532, having already hit a one-month high of $1.2554, as the U.K. loosens months-long lockdown measures, while another round of Brexit talks get underway on Tuesday.
“EU demands of so-called ‘level playing field conditions’ remain the major hurdle,” said analysts at Danske Bank, “and we continue to expect no breakthrough ahead of the important deadline on 1 July, when the UK and EU need to decide on whether to extend the transition period.”

779,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank kept its interest rate and yield objectives unchanged as an abatement of the health crisis allows the economy to begin reopening.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe maintained both the cash rate and three-year yield targets at 0.25% on Tuesday, as expected. The bank sharply tapered bond buying in May as financial markets calmed and Covid-19 infections dwindled. Meantime, a gauge of consumer confidence advanced Tuesday for a ninth straight week.
“It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected,” Lowe said in a statement. “The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period. It is likely that this fiscal and monetary support will be required for some time..”
While the outlook has improved, upcoming data are set to show the full force of the shutdown, with the unemployment rate expected to rise further. The government and RBA will need to keep up a positive narrative to avoid sentiment slipping again.
While nearly 600,000 jobs were lost in April, the jobless rate only climbed to 6.2%. The RBA sees it rising to around 10% by June, but below where it could have headed if not for the government’s JobKeeper program that keeps workers attached to firms.
Australia’s sharemarket and currency have strengthened as the authorities contained the virus and announced incremental reopening of the economy. The Aussie dollar has soared about 18% since March 19, when the RBA cut the cash rate to its effective lower bound and began buying government bonds.
Australia has avoided a recession -- defined locally as two consecutive quarters of contraction -- since 1991. A fall in GDP in the first three months of the year would almost guarantee that streak is at an end given the worst of the downturn has been concentrated in the current quarter.
Partial data ahead of GDP released on Wednesday suggest it remains a possibility that the economy expanded in the first quarter of 2020.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on Tuesday as investors stuck to hopes of a global economic recovery despite heightened concerns over U.S.-China tensions and mass protests in many U.S. cities over the death of a black man in police custody.
The U.S. dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies (=USD) stood at its weakest level since mid-March, at 97.790.
The euro fetched $1.11295 (EUR=), little changed so far on Tuesday but holding near a 2-1/2-month high of $1.1154 touched on Monday.
Sterling traded at $1.2491 , having hit a one-month high of $1.2506.
U.S. manufacturing activity eased off an 11-year low in May and although the reading was weaker than forecast, it fit into markets' expectations that the worst of the economic downturn was behind as businesses reopen.
""There are some potential flash points such as U.S. demonstrations and China-U.S. tensions. But, on the whole, the market is still moderately risk-on,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar was at 107.57 yen , stuck in a well-worn range between 106 and 108 over the last several weeks.
President Donald Trump said on Monday he was deploying thousands of heavily armed soldiers and law enforcement to halt violence in the U.S. capital and vowed to do the same in other cities if mayors and governors fail to regain control of the streets.
The protests erupted over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American who died in Minneapolis police custody after being pinned beneath a white officer's knee for nearly nine minutes.
Market risk sentiment was hurt only slightly on Monday when Bloomberg reported that China had told state-owned firms to halt purchases of soybeans and pork from the United States, raising concerns that the trade deal between the world's two biggest economies could be in jeopardy.
The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy bet on the strength of the Chinese economy, fetched $0.6794 , having reached its highest levels since late January.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep rates on hold when it meets later on Tuesday.

The Chinese yuan stood flat at 7.1230 per dollar  in offshore trade, near its highest levels in almost two weeks.

781,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders in India are yearning for the central bank to backstop the rupee and sovereign-bond markets after Moody’s Investors Service cut the credit rating to the lowest investment grade.
“This is definitely not welcome news and we could see some more foreign outflows,” said Ashish Vaidya, head of trading at DBS Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “There will be a knee-jerk selloff in the rupee and bonds but we expect the RBI to jump in to curb any bouts of undue volatility.”
India’s long-term foreign-currency credit rating was cut to Baa3 from Baa2, Moody’s said in a late evening statement on Monday, citing policy challenges in addressing a prolonged slowdown and the deteriorating fiscal position. The outlook remains negative, it said.
The cut brings Moody’s rating on India on par with S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings Ltd., both of which have a BBB- rating. Any downgrade by S&P and Fitch will hurt flows to a nation that relies on imported capital to fund investment. Already, global funds have yanked $14 billion from rupee bonds this year, the highest in emerging Asia.

An RBI spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
“The RBI will have to come out with an explicit support for the bond market after this development, otherwise it’s going to be very tough,” said Vijay Sharma, executive vice president for fixed-income at PNB Gilts Ltd. He expects benchmark yields to climb by 15-20 basis points on Tuesday, he said.

782,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Even with the risk of a hard Brexit hanging over their heads, pound traders seem to be looking the other way.
The currency touched a three-week high against a weaker dollar, one day before fraught trade negotiations resume between London and Brussels. A gauge of sentiment in sterling over the next month, which covers the deadline for an extension to the U.K.’s Brexit transition period, is the least negative since late March.
It’s a sign Brexit has lost some of its power to rattle investors, as concerns shift to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the possibility of a second wave of outbreaks after the U.K.’s lockdown eases.
“It has been a little surprising, frankly, that the foreign-exchange market has been as willing as it has to give sterling a pass this time around,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of foreign-exchange strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “The virus and its aftermath remains the main focus for markets.”
The pound rose as much as 0.7% to $1.2426 on Monday, the highest since May 11.
Few analysts expect a political breakthrough this week. There could be damaging headlines for the process in coming days after the bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier told the Sunday Times the U.K. needs to be “more realistic” in its demands.
Still, there’s been no spike in the cost of insuring against a swing in the pound against the dollar in options. For the next month, it’s hovering near the lowest level since early May.
That contrasts with the roller-coaster ride suffered by the pound throughout 2019 on fears of a no-deal Brexit and turmoil in Parliament.
Traders have stopped hanging on the words of lawmakers and are instead scrutinizing comments from Bank of England policy makers on the possibility of negative interest rates, which have weighed on the currency. It also narrowed the spread between 10-year gilt and bund yields to the smallest gap since since 2016.
Negative rates may become unavoidable especially if there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of the year, said Christian Schulz, director of European research at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Such a move by the BOE could lead the pound to revisit 35-year lows hit in March, according to Lee Hardman, a foreign-exchange strategist at MUFG.
Investors are betting the U.K. will join the negative-rates club by the end of February, according to overnight interest-rate swaps. Last month, the market saw such a move in November this year.

783,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Barely a fortnight ago, currency traders were fretting over the future of the euro. They’re now cautiously optimistic.
The common currency just had this year’s best monthly advance after the European Union finally managed to assemble a stimulus plan to steer the region’s recovery from the pandemic. Option-market sentiment is improving and strategists are beginning to relay a glimmer of optimism on the euro’s prospects.
The median euro-dollar forecast for third quarter edged up in May, the first positive change this year, according to a Bloomberg survey.  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) lifted its year-end call to $1.10 last week, from $1.05 previously, with strategists saying in a note that the “existential tail risk of a euro-zone breakup” has now fallen.
”We have turned cautiously bullish over the last week or so,” said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFG in London. “Building evidence that the euro-zone economy is through the worst of the Covid-19 crisis and EU Recovery Fund proposals have helped to ease downside risks for the euro, and created a firmer foundation for the rebound to extend from still-undervalued levels.”
In addition to the recovery fund, Germany is preparing a second phase of stimulus of between 50 billion euros ($56 billion) and 100 billion euros, which would help boost sentiment in the euro. And also, measures of manufacturing activity in the euro-area suggest the European nations may be on the road to recovery.
The euro rose 0.3% to $1.1140 Monday, advancing for the fifth straight day in the longest winning streak since March. Its 1.3% advance in May was the biggest monthly gain since December. The end-September forecast in the Bloomberg survey climbed to $1.10 from a low of $1.09 in May.
Option Signal
The option market is mirroring the brightening mood. One-month euro-dollar risk reversals, a gauge of positioning and sentiment, convincingly broke above zero last week for the first time in months, signaling a bullish turn in sentiment toward the common currency.
To be sure, there are still uncertainties weighing on the euro. The European Central Bank’s policy decision on Thursday is one, but more importantly, focus is on the June 19 meeting of European leaders to weigh the stimulus proposal, which still needs the go-ahead from the likes of Austria and the Netherlands.
Nevertheless. the view that the worst is behind the euro has gained some ground.
In the “short-term, the euro could test the top of the $1.08-$1.12 trading rage it has been in since last summer,” MUFG’s Lee said. “If it can break above, things would get more exciting, otherwise it remains a hard grind higher for now.”

Investing.com - The dollar has sold off in early European trade Monday, as fewer investors seek this safe haven amid rising optimism about the global economic recovery and as U.S. President Trump offers up a measured response to China’s move to tighten control over Hong Kong.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 97.957, down 0.4%, having touched an 11-week low of 97.877 earlier Monday. USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 107.59.
“Market participants believe that the worst of the health and financial and economic crises are now behind us.

The AUD/USD pair jumped 1.3% to 0.6748 and the NZD/USD pair was up 0.8% to 0.6248.
Helping the risk-on tone, an official business survey from China showed its factory activity grew at a slower pace in May but momentum in the services and construction sectors quickened.
Additionally, President Trump decided not to end phase one of the U.S.’s trade deal with China when he laid out his response to China’s national security law for Hong Kong and Macau on Friday, although he did vow to end Hong Kong's special status.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump did not move to end phase one of its trade deal with China when he laid out his response to China’s national security law for Hong Kong and Macau on Friday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Riskier currencies rose against the dollar on Monday as investors looked to positive signs from China's coronavirus recovery and wagered on an easing in Sino-U.S. tensions.
The trade-sensitive Australian dollar  surged 1% to a three-month high of $0.6742 to lead broader gains that put the dollar close to an 11-week low on a basket of currencies. 
U.S. President Donald Trump made no move to impose new tariffs on China during a news conference on Friday where he outlined his response to Beijing's tightening grip over Hong Kong.
""That removed the near-term risk of any intensification of the U.S.-China trade war,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney.
Moreover, investors were encouraged by the Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers Index showing marginal but unexpected improvement in Chinese factory activity last month.
The New Zealand dollar  rose about half a percent, along with the pound  and Canadian dollar . Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar fell 0.2% to 98.031, close to an 11-week low of 97.944 touched last week.
The market mood was notable given major U.S. cities were bracing for another night of violence, as demonstrations against police brutality have turned into a wave of outrage.
Analysts said the unrest was concerning, and perhaps a pointer to a close-run Presidential election in November, but unlikely to shift short-term optimism about the U.S. economy.

Elsewhere the euro (EUR=EBS) rose 0.2% to $1.1135, just below a two-month high of $1.1145, as investors drew confidence from the European Union's plans for a coronavirus recovery fund.

The pound  hit a three-week high of $1.2414 as Britain moves out of lockdown. The Chinese yuan  was 0.2% stronger at 7.1996, catching up with Friday's relief rally in offshore trade on hopes for easing Sino-U.S. tensions.

Disputes between the two countries now cover a range of issues that are unlikely to be resolved soon, strategists including Zach Pandl wrote in a May 31 note. Furthermore, over the last month the Chinese central bank has demonstrated some tolerance for gradual currency depreciation, they added.
“As result, we expect ongoing capital outflow pressures to weigh on the exchange rate and are revising our dollar-yuan forecasts higher,” they wrote.

“No decisions have been made on that at all,” Mester said Friday in an interview with Michael McKee and Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE) on Bloomberg Television. “I don’t think of that as something that would be in this phase of what we’re doing, to make sure the markets continue to function. But as a tool I think it’s worthwhile thinking about.”
Members of the Fed’s policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet June 9-10, when they are widely expected to leave interest rates just above zero to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. Mester is a voting member this year on the FOMC.
Officials are also likely to at least discuss yield-curve control, a policy tool that hasn’t been used in the U.S. since Word War II. The approach involves purchasing, or selling, Treasury securities in order to target the yield on a specific maturity. New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said May 27 that U.S. central bankers were “thinking very hard” about using that tool.

Mester said she didn’t want to take yield-curve control off the table, but that, “right now that’s a discussion for the future phase,” Mester said. “I just don’t see it here in this phase. Nor do I see going forward that we would necessarily need to use it.”
As more of the U.S. moves to lift virus-related restrictions, Mester said the Fed will move into a phase of more “traditional” monetary policy aimed at supporting the recovery. In recent weeks, it has focused on keeping financial markets functioning and launching other emergency facilities that extend credit to companies as well as state and local governments.
“The tools that we have are our interest-rate tool, which is already at zero, forward guidance, which we’ve used before, and also asset purchases, but asset purchases not to improve market functioning but to really support the economy,” she said.
Following the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the Fed used large-scale asset purchases to lower long-term borrowing costs after slashing the benchmark fed funds rate to zero. In this crisis, the Fed has also bought trillions of dollars in Treasuries, but with the goal of simply restoring liquidity to that market after an extraordinary period of investor flight in March.
Slow Recovery
To date, the Fed hasn’t viewed those purchases as stimulative for the economy because so much of the country remains locked down in an effort to contain the virus.
Mester said once the public health crisis has passed the economic rebound may be sluggish.
“The recovery could be slow,” she said. “When you have so many people out of work it’s hard to imagine that we’d see a quick, v-shaped recovery.”
Asked about increased tensions between the U.S. and China, Mester said the increased uncertainty could act as another headwind for the battered economy.
“We’ve played this game before and saw how the uncertainty did dampen the expansion earlier,” she said. “So we have to just take this on board as an uncertainty added to an incredible amount of uncertainty we already have.”

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in early European trade Friday, but trading ranges have been tight as traders attempt to weigh up the conflicting forces of a continued economic recovery with heightened tensions over China’s move to tighten control over Hong Kong.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.293, down 0.1%, while USD/JPY fell 0.4% to 107.18 and GBP/USD rose 0.2% at 1.2344.
German retail sales fell at their fastest pace since 2007 in April, data showed on Friday, but the drop - at 5.3% on the month - was not as steep as expected in a sign of the relative resilience of Europe's largest economy during the coronavirus crisis. March's figures were also revised to reflect a gentler decline.
While in the U.S., Thursday’s initial jobless claims data showed that more than two million Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week. This is another horrendous figure, but the weekly totals have continued to fall since hitting a peak of 6.8 million in late March.
""At the moment, hopes for economic recovery are strong, but I expect this to gradually fade to increased concern about the U.S.-China relationship,"" said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.
""When that happens, there will be more risk-off trades, which supports buying of both the dollar and the yen.""
At the moment the foreign exchange markets are holding their breath ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s statement in response to China parliament’s passing of an anti-sedition law relating to Hong Kong.
“The question is how far Trump will go at today’s press conference, as removing Hong Kong’s favored status would probably spark negative market developments, hitting global risk sentiment,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note to clients.
At 2:55 AM ET, USD/CNY traded at 7.1515, not far off the record of 7.1966 reached on Thursday.
The euro has continued to strengthen Friday, driven by increased confidence in the global economy but also by EU institutions starting to agree that an accommodative stance is indeed needed, especially in terms of fiscal policy. 
“We see the latest European Commission proposals for an increase in the EU Budget and a recovery fund of €750bn as a potential game changer,” said analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a research note.

Investing.com – The dollar ended the week with gains in Asia, with U.S.-China tensions nearing a boiling point.
Tensions have been simmering throughout the week, triggered by China’s national security laws for Hong Kong and Macau during the previous week. China’s National People’s Congress approved the enactment of the law in Hong Kong on Thursday.
U.S. President Donald Trump will announce his response to the approval at a press conference later in the day.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.03% to 98.405 by 11:22 PM ET (4:22 PM GMT), with investors turning to the safe-have asset.
“At the moment, hopes for economic recovery are strong, but I expect this to gradually fade to increased concern about the U.S.-China relationship,” Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank, told CNBC.

Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair was down 0.22% to 107.39.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.10% to 7.1521. Investors will be paying close attention to the yuan, as well as the Chinese stock market, to gauge investor sentiment ahead of the press conference.
The AUD/USD pair was up 0.11% to 0.6643 while the NZD/USD pair slid 0.03% to 0.6205.
The GBP/USD pair rose 0.09% to 1.2327, with the pound supported by broad dollar selling during the week."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was hemmed into a narrow trading range on Friday as traders' focus shifted to U.S. President Donald Trump's response to China's passage of a national security law for Hong Kong.
The yuan pulled away from a record low in offshore trade, but investors remain nervous ahead of Trump's announcement later on Friday of policy moves that could ignite a diplomatic row between Washington and Beijing.
The greenback was on course for a weekly loss against major currencies as progress in lifting coronavirus lockdowns and stimulus plans in Europe weakened demand for safe havens, but the mood could quickly worsen if Sino-U.S. tensions increase.
""At the moment, hopes for economic recovery are strong, but I expect this to gradually fade to increased concern about the U.S.-China relationship,"" said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.

The dollar stood at $1.1073 per euro (EUR=EBS) in Asia on Friday, close to its lowest since March 30.
The common currency was headed for its second weekly gain against the greenback as the EU's announcement of a 750-billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund fuelled optimism about the euro-zone economy.
The dollar last bought 0.9644 Swiss francs , on course for a 0.7% weekly decline.
The greenback was little changed at 107.67 yen .
The Australian dollar  bought $0.6630, close to its highest in more than two months, while the New Zealand dollar  traded at $0.6204, near its strongest since March 11.
The Aussie and the kiwi were on course for weekly gains as investors cheered the gradual re-opening of business activity in the two antipodean economies.
China's parliament on Thursday approved national security legislation for Hong Kong that Western countries fear could erode the city's freedoms.
Trump, who has vowed a tough U.S. response, told reporters he would hold a news conference on China on Friday.
The risk is Hong Kong could lose some of the special privileges in enjoys under U.S. law, which would threaten its status as a global financial hub.
The potential stand-off has stirred memories of last year's bruising Sino-U.S. trade war, which weighed on the global economy and roiled financial markets.
Offshore, the yuan  traded at 7.1725 per dollar, near a record low of 7.1966 reached on Thursday.
Investors will closely watch the opening of the onshore yuan and moves in Chinese stocks to gauge market sentiment before Trump's announcement.
This week the euro led the charge against a weakened dollar after EU policymakers unveiled fiscal stimulus combining grants and loans intended to ease dissent among euro-zone countries.
Analysts say the euro may struggle to extend its gains, because fiscally conservative member states may still push to alter the plan.
Some traders will focus on the release of German retail sales and EU consumer prices later on Friday to measure the health of the euro-zone economy.
Elsewhere, the pound  held steady at $1.2317. Sterling was on course for its second weekly gain, supported by broad selling in the dollar this week.

However, sentiment for the pound has been somewhat negative due to calls for the resignation of an influential aide to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, lack of progress in EU trade talks, and speculation about negative interest rates.

Fed holdings of ETFs invested in corporate debt rose to $2.98 billion as of May 26, according to the data released Thursday, up from $1.8 billion a week earlier. The ETF purchases, which began on May 12, are part of an emergency lending program designed to backstop large corporate borrowers amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Total assets held in the special-purpose vehicle set up for that program, known as the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, was shown as a much larger amount. But a note with the release explained that this reflected the U.S. Treasury Department’s equity contribution to the facility to shield the Fed from losses, of which 85% must be invested in non-marketable Treasury securities and reported in the net holdings of the program.
The Fed also added a line item for another emergency lending program for state and local government borrowers, known as the Municipal Liquidity Facility, which has yet to launch.
“On May 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York received Treasury’s equity contribution for the MLF program,” the explanatory note said.

793,"<span>May 28, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic is worsening U.S. inequality along income and racial lines, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.
“This health crisis has not so much changed things as simply exposed, and in some cases accelerated, trends that were already present in our society,” Harker said Thursday in remarks prepared for a virtual event. “The United States went into this crisis a troublingly unequal place, beset by serious inequities in income, wealth, and opportunity.”
The Philadelphia Fed chief cited Census Bureau statistics showing U.S. income inequality in 2018 reached the highest levels in 50 years of data, as well as a St. Louis Fed study indicating that, as of 2016, the top 10% of American households controlled 77% of the nation’s wealth. He added that researchers at his own bank had found that lockdowns implemented to stop the spread of the virus had disproportionately hit employment in low-income neighborhoods and families.
“American inequality is a moral and ethical challenge to our country’s founding creed. But research shows it’s also a growing economic problem,” said Harker, who votes on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.
“That makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners save,” he said. “That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of our country’s total GDP. Ensuring an equitable recovery from Covid-19 is critical in making sure the next expansion is not only fair but also strong and durable.”

Investing.com - The euro has continued to show strength in early European trade Thursday,  as traders continue to upside in the single currency following the announcement of a hefty plan to prop up the bloc's virus-hit economies.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1013, remaining above the 1.10 level, after earlier rising to an eight-week peak of $1.1035. 
This follows the EU Commission announcing its plan for a European recovery fund Wednesday, with the proposal exceeding market expectations as it envisages 250 billion euros in loans on top of the 500 billion euros in grants, which were originally proposed by France and Germany last week.
The blueprint, if ratified by all, would be a step towards mutualized debt as a major funding tool for the first time, paving the way for greater EU powers of taxation.
“Overall, we believe the recovery fund proposal is a strong signal from the Commission and European leaders (if confirmed) of support for the European project,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a note to clients.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.828, down 0.2%, while USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 107.84.
Losses to the safe-haven greenback came despite tensions between China and the U.S. being stretched even more, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the Trump administration could no longer certify Hong Kong's political autonomy from China under the new national security law. 
This could open the door to options including visa restrictions, asset freezes and potential tariffs.
That said, U.S. business groups have urged President Donald Trump to go slowly in responding to Beijing's planned imposition of new national security laws on Hong Kong.
At 3:05 AM ET, the yuan, often seen as a barometer of relations between the world's two biggest economies, gained 0.2% to 7.1556 per dollar.
Another currency showing strength Thursday is sterling, after the U.K. government announced plans late Wednesday for its test and trace system to combat the coronavirus outbreak. 
The aim of the system is to lift national lockdown restrictions and move towards more localised, targeted measures.
At 03:05, GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2270.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held its own on Thursday as rising Sino-U.S. tension put crushing pressure on the Chinese yuan and proved a counterweight to optimism about the coronavirus recovery.
The escalating war of words between the world's two biggest economies also spilled over to the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as a far more cautious mood holds in currency markets compared with the ebullience rallying stocks. 
Hong Kong is the newest flashpoint, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying on Wednesday that China's plan to impose laws there was ""only the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine"" the city's autonomy and freedoms.
The Chinese yuan , a barometer of U.S.-China relations, hit a record low of 7.1966 per dollar in offshore trade overnight and held close to that level on Thursday at 7.1805. 
The Aussie and kiwi backed off two-month highs hit in the London session and were becalmed, even as the re-opening of the world's economies kept stock markets rallying. The Aussie  was last at $0.6621 and the kiwi  at $0.6188.
""Overall, the macro story is hard to ignore, and things are picking up,"" said Jason Wong, senior market strategist at BNZ in Wellington.
""But down under, here, obviously China is an important part of what drives markets. Markets are awaiting China's response (on Hong Kong) and we're caught in the middle a little bit.""
A Financial Times report which said coal traders and analysts expect China to tighten import rules also weighed on the Australian dollar, he said. 
Tensions have flared between Australia and China over the COVID-19 pandemic, while U.S.-China relations have nosedived amid regular attacks from the Trump administration over China's handling of the virus.
The United States is currently crafting a range of options to punish China over its tightening grip on Hong Kong, including sanctions, tariffs and restrictions on Chinese companies, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Elsewhere, the dollar was marginally firmer against the Japanese yen , at 107.83 yen per dollar, and a touch weaker on the euro and pound.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) it was steady at 98.863, a fraction above a two-month low hit overnight.
The euro (EUR=) rose to an eight-week peak of $1.1031 on Wednesday, climbing above its 200-day moving average, after the European Union's executive unveiled a 750 billion euro plan to prop up the bloc's virus-hit economies.
It pulled back as doubts over the way forward in achieving the plan emerged and last sat at $1.1021. The pound  was at $1.2263.
""It is probably too early to say that the rally in the euro is the start of a major re-rating of European risk,"" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING, in a note.

""The path to getting (the) recovery fund carved out of the long term EU budget will be a bumpy one ... thus it is hard to make the case that euro moves higher in a straight line from current levels.""
 
"
796,"<span>May 27, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. treats Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous part of China, differently than the mainland in trade, commerce and other areas. Now U.S. President Donald Trump could rescind that “special status” to punish China for recent moves to tighten its grip on the city amid a resurgence of pro-democracy street protests. In its most extreme form, that would effectively mean treating the global financial hub no differently than any other Chinese city, a seismic shift that could harm both economies at an already difficult time. China has promised countermeasures against any foreign “interference.”
1. Is the special status in jeopardy?
Possibly. The president has long had the power to suspend it with an executive order, yet hasn’t. Then came an added pressure: a U.S. law passed last year requires the secretary of state to certify -- as part of an annual report to Congress -- whether Hong Kong remains “sufficiently autonomous” from Beijing to justify its unique treatment. That includes assessing the degree to which Hong Kong’s autonomy had been eroded by the government of China. (Hong Kong is part of China but has a different legal and economic system, a holdover from its time as a British colony.) On May 27, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress that the Trump administration no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China.
2. So is that the end of the special status?
It’s too soon to say. Pompeo’s decision opens the door for a range of options, from visa restrictions and asset freezes for top officials to possibly imposing tariffs on goods coming from Hong Kong. Other measures could target Chinese Communist Party officials. It’s up to Trump to decide how quickly he wants to move while he’s also threatening consequences for China over its handling of the coronavirus. Hurting China also carries additional risks for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements, which could affect Trump’s odds of winning re-election. U.S. officials have given mixed signals about what might happen next, and when.
3. What would losing it mean for Hong Kong and China?
While Hong Kong remains a key gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the country’s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China’s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and has made a much lower priority of making the yuan an international currency. Nonetheless, the city still matters. Hong Kong’s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. Revoking the special status would be “the nuclear option” and “the beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,” said Steve Tsang, director of the University of London’s SOAS China Institute.
4. What about for the U.S.?
It has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2018 was with Hong Kong — $31.1 billion. Some 290 U.S. companies had regional headquarters in the city that year and another 434 had regional offices, it said. Hong Kong’s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: “We are not just getting the benefits – it’s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.”
5. And more broadly?
Pompeo’s decision, let alone any sanctions or move to rescind the special status, will further strain the relationship between the U.S. and China, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, the Hong Kong protests, an ongoing trade war and other issues. In addition to the annual review of Hong Kong’s trading status, the new law requires the president to freeze U.S.-based assets of, and deny entry to the U.S. by, any individuals found responsible for abducting and torturing human rights activists in Hong Kong. Such sanctions could come sooner than a suspension of the trading status, and would obviously complicate things further.
6. How autonomous is Hong Kong?
When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China, the Chinese government pledged that the city would have a “high degree of autonomy” in its legal and economic affairs for 50 years, under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems.” The 2019 U.S. report on conditions in Hong Kong said the city’s autonomy was “sufficient -- although diminished.” After the protests erupted in June 2019, the State Department said that “continued erosion” of Hong Kong’s autonomy put its “long-established status in international affairs” at risk.
7. How has China responded?
“Hong Kong is purely China’s internal affair,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing on May 27, promising to take “necessary countermeasures” against any “interference” by “external forces.” After the U.S. law was passed last year, China said it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. “China urges the U.S. side to correct its mistakes and stop any words and deeds that interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal politics,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said then. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as “groundless” accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.
8. And Hong Kong?
The city’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has defended the national security law (as has Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest tycoon). Lam also has said it would be “totally unacceptable” for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the problems in the city. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.
9. Is this what the protesters have been seeking?
As a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists including Joshua Wong had testified in Washington in favor of the bill, seeking to put pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” and calling on Trump to “liberate” Hong Kong.

797,"<span>May 27, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea cut its key interest rate to a new record low on Thursday, the latest stimulus move to shore up an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
The decision to cut the seven-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% was predicted by 18 of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One economist forecast a 50 basis point cut, while the rest saw no change.
The cut underscores concern within the board over risks the economy could continue slowing sharply, or even contract, despite progress in containing the outbreak at home. Exports are slumping as key overseas markets struggle to reopen from lockdowns, while job losses are surging and inflation is slowing.
“The external sector slowdown remains a severe headwind and is unlikely to be offset by domestic demand,” Krystal Tan, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore, said before the decision. “Broad-based weakness in economic activity along with low oil prices has intensified the risks of deflation.”
Thursday’s cut is the second since the outbreak after the BOK lowered rates by 50 basis points at an emergency meeting in March. The central bank has since taken a series of unprecedented steps to ease liquidity strains among firms and in the market.
The government has also set aside its usual fiscal prudence and is now planning a third extra budget that is likely to be bigger than the previous two.
Still, economists expect the economy to shrink this year for the first time since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. The BOK is set to update its economic outlook later Thursday, having forecast 2.1% growth and 1% inflation in February.
BOK watchers will be keen to see what other measures Governor Lee Ju-yeol can deploy should the economy worsen, with conventional policy room running low. Some analysts expect the bank to announce plans to increase bond purchases as the government’s stimulus will inevitably require more debt issuance.
Thursday’s decision was the first under the BOK’s new board. With the policy preferences of its three new members still unknown to the public, any sign of dissent within the board will be watched closely for cues. One of the new members, Cho Yoon-je, didn’t take part in the vote Thurday, the BOK said.
Governor Lee typically announces whether the decision was unanimous or not in his post-decision press conference.

798,"<span>May 27, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China will soon provide a hint on how far it will let the yuan’s slide go after the offshore rate sank overnight to match its weakest level on record.
A weaker-than-expected fixing will show greater tolerance for depreciation, while a stronger rate will reflect preference for limiting declines. The People’s Bank of China’s daily reference rate, which limits the onshore yuan’s moves by 2% in either direction, is published at 9:15 a.m. local time. Rates set on Monday and Tuesday were both the softest in more than a decade.
“There will likely be more pressure on the yuan,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Today’s fix itself will be closely watched for signs of whether the authorities are seeking to slow down the recent weakness.”
The offshore yuan tumbled to 7.1965 per dollar in U.S. trading Wednesday as tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated over China’s controversial security law for Hong Kong. The Trump administration said it could no longer certify the city’s political autonomy, a decision that could lead to sanctions for top Chinese officials or tariffs on goods coming from the former British colony.
The Chinese embassy in the U.S. said it would take “necessary countermeasures” against what it called “foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs.”
From its daily fixings to mopping up liquidity in Hong Kong, China’s central bank has many tools at its disposal should it wish to steer the currency. But declines can get extreme when key support lines are broken, like last August when the yuan weakened past 7 per dollar for the first time since the global financial crisis. Moves can also accelerate when the PBOC is seen allowing for weakness -- in early 2018, the yuan fell the most in two months as authorities gave banks the green light to submit quotes for weaker fixings.
The reference rate is decided based a formula that takes into consideration of the onshore yuan’s official close at 4:30 p.m. on the previous day and major currencies’ moves overnight.
The offshore yuan dropped 0.05% to 7.1802 per greenback as of 8:11 a.m. in Hong Kong. Onshore trading starts at 9:30 a.m.

Invesing.com – The euro was flat against the dollar, following a wild day of trading after EU detailed a €750 billion ($842 billion) coronavirus response plan that will seek to support some of the worst-hit economies in the bloc.  
EUR/USD was roughly flat at 1.0991, after hitting a high of $1.1031
The pooled relief program, which includes €500 billion in grants and €250 billion in loans to worst-hit economies of member states, still requires the backing of all 27 member states. Still, that is more than the €500 billion Franco-German proposals revealed last week.
Negotiations between the member states will take place over the coming months, and, if approved, some funds would be disbursed in 2020. But the largest share would come next year, when the first bonds would be issued under the program.
Some market participants, however, raised concerns about the lack of details on how the relief program would be financed. It is ""unclear how the bonds issued to finance the fund are to receive a AAA rating,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
""It is unlikely that an agreement as sought by the EU Commission will be reached by July and that the first funds will flow as early as September,"" the bank added.
The proposal comes ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting next week, with many eyeing fresh forecasts, which will offer an update on the Covid-19 impact on the bloc's economic outlook."
