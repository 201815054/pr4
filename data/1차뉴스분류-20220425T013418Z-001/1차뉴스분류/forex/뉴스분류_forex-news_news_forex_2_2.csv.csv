Investing.com - The U.S. dollar bounced in early European trade Tuesday amid rising risk aversion given the mounting tensions between China and the U.S. over the new security law for Hong Kong. 
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.207, up 0.3%, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 107.56, while GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2308.
Protests occurred in Hong Kong Wednesday as the national security law - which critics have called a direct attempt to curtail the city's unique freedoms - underwent a second reading in the city’s Legislative Council.
U.S. President Donald Trump has promised a U.S. reaction to the law by the end of the week. Meanwhile, China retaliated by threatening countermeasures against any U.S. action, including sanctions.
“We are in a broad risk-on trend, but the only thing that can change this is the U.S.-China relationship,” Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities, told CNBC.
“More problems between these two countries would slow the dollar’s recent decline and potentially lead to dollar buying as a safe haven.”
At 2:45 AM ET, the yuan, often seen as a barometer of relations between the world's two biggest economies, slid 0.4% to 7.1604 per dollar on Wednesday, taking its four-week decline to 1%, and edging toward its record low of 7.1965 per greenback set in September last year.
The Australian dollar also weakened, linked as it is to the performance of the Chinese economy, falling 0.2% to 0.6639.
Another currency in focus Wednesday is the euro, after Isabel Schnabel, a member of the European Central Bank’s executive board, in an interview with the Financial Times, made it clear that the central bank is ready to act and use any instrument ""if it judges that the medium-term inflation outlook has worsened"". 
“This is another comment similar to the French Central Governor's made earlier this week, that the ECB will act if needed,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a note to clients. “We believe this raises the probability that the ECB will increase the PEPP (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme) at next week's ECB meeting.”
This comes as the latest estimates from INSEE, the French national statistics bureau, suggested that France's economy is on course to contract 20% in the second quarter as the country emerges from a nationwide coronavirus lockdown.
That would mark a sharp deterioration in France's recession after the euro zone's second-biggest economy contracted 5.8% in the first quarter.
At 02:45 AM ET, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.0955.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Wednesday morning in Asia with U.S.-China tensions mounting over the latter’s national security laws for Hong Kong and Macau.

U.S. President Donald Trump promised a U.S. reaction to the law by the end of the week. Meanwhile, China retaliated by threatening countermeasures against any U.S. action, including sanctions.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 0.26% to 99.168 by 12:06 AM ET (5:06 AM GMT), with investors turning to the safe-haven asset.

The offshore yuan slid as much as 0.35% to 7.1698 per dollar on Wednesday, taking its four-week decline to 1%. That’s the biggest drop among at least 32 major currencies after those in Peru and Argentina. The offshore rate is edging toward its record low of 7.1965 per greenback set in September last year.
There are signs Chinese authorities are content to allow the yuan to fall as the U.S. administration steps up its criticism over Beijing’s initial handling of the coronavirus and intention to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. The People’s Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) had this week set its daily yuan reference rate at the weakest level since 2008. The fixing was slightly stronger on Wednesday.
“The PBOC will allow the yuan to continue weakening as U.S. China trade tensions continue rising, as long as it is orderly,” said Qi Gao, a currency strategist at Scotibank.

“I don’t see anything on the horizon that’s going to fundamentally change that,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Li said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “But it’s required of all of us to maintain confidence, to maintain our belief this great city is going to become even greater once we are able to get over on the other side of the current public health challenges and other challenges.”
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. faces what could be an even more turbulent year than 2019, when political unrest dragged down trading and brought revenue growth to a near standstill. At the same time, the bourse is now set to welcome a slew of China’s corporate giants after years of lobbying from Li and growing political tension between the U.S. and China.
HKEX shares have retraced losses after on Friday posting their biggest drop in a year as investors were spooked by a Beijing plan to impose security legislation on the city. The push sparked protests over the weekend and more are brewing on Wednesday near the city’s Legislative Council, where lawmakers plan to hold a hearing on a bill that would criminalize disrespect toward China’s national anthem.
Li said he was not “looking into any specific political initiatives” since “they come, they go.”
“We have no control over them,” he said. “We just have the commercial initiatives that go into the heart of enhancing Hong Kong’s global competitiveness. And that remains unchanged.”
Authorities, including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, have this week sought to reassure investors that Beijing’s plans wouldn’t alter the city’s freedoms and threaten its status as a financial hub. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a statement late Tuesday, saying the security law wouldn’t impede the free flow of capital.
That would be crucial for Li’s vision to make the exchange a gateway to China for foreign investors. The CEO, who announced he’s stepping down when in October next year, has pushed through a number of changes to lure more of China’s corporate giants to list in the city, away from New York.
Reforms over the past years have allowed the exchange to attract tech behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Holdings Inc. to do a $13 billion dual listing last year. Companies such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. are planning to follow suit next month even amid rising tension.
Before the security bill rekindled protests, the exchange last week received a string of good news. The U.S. Senate unveiled a bill that could bar Chinese listings, while Nasdaq Inc. moved to clamp down on such listings after an accounting scandal erupted at Chinese coffee chain  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) Inc., which is listed in New York. Optimism was also stoked by changes to the city’s benchmark Hang Seng index to include China’s corporate giants.
The exchange on Wednesday revealed a licensing agreement with MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Inc. to offer 37 futures and options contracts based on MSCI equity indexes in Asia and emerging markets.
The agreement is “absolutely a vote of confidence” in Hong Kong, Li said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real rose for the fifth day in a row on Tuesday, sealing its longest winning streak against the dollar this year as buoyant global markets and ebbing of domestic political tensions added fuel to the rally.
The real's near 2% jump brought its gains since the start of last week to around 10%, and a dollar fall below 5.00 reais now seems more likely than a pierce up through 6.00 reais, traders said.
""There's still a lot of room for recovery. 5.00 (reais) is still high for the dollar,"" said Cleber Alessie Machado, broker at Commcor DTVM in Sao Paulo.
""If the political situation cools and impeachment is taken completely out of the question... yes, we could go back to 5.00 and below,"" he said, noting growing optimism that a global economic recovery could soon start as the world emerges from coronavirus lockdown.
Pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro built up this month due to his alleged role in changing senior federal police officials amid investigations of members of his political clan.
The real traded as high as 5.3350 per dollar (BRBY) and continued its close correlation with local interest rates. A flattening curve between short- and long-term rates is a sign of improving investor sentiment and easier financial conditions.
(GRAPHIC - Brazil FX and rates futures: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxdddmvx/BRAZILFXRATES.png)
This follows central bank president Roberto Campos Neto's reaffirmation last week that the bank stands ready to dip into its large pool of foreign exchange reserves and continue intervening in the market if needed.
That helped defuse some of the gloom surrounding the real and punctured the consensus view that a fall through 6.00 per dollar was inevitable.

""The real was very unloved (but) ran out of dollar buyers at 5.95. It was a bit too extended,"" said a hedge fund manager in Sao Paulo.

5,"<span>May 26, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Foreign-exchange options traders anxious about worsening U.S.-China relations are using key currency proxies to hedge against the uncertainties.
Tuesday saw nearly $1.4 billion of options traded on the Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar that will be profitable if the Asian currency is below 7.61 per greenback in three months’ time, while another $640 million worth of similar derivatives was traded that are tied to the 7.64 level. They could also prove profitable for traders even without spot breaking below the official trading band of 7.75-7.85 if option-implied volatility were to rise sufficiently.
The volume seen Tuesday made the U.S.-Hong Kong pair one of the most actively traded in options for the day, according to Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. data. Option activity in the Taiwanese dollar was also notably higher than normal with turnover in greenback call options nearly four times that of puts.
Traders purchasing the options will likely benefit from a broad increase in yuan’s implied volatility, even if the Hong Kong currency peg is maintained. Swings in the yuan, Taiwan dollar and Hong Kong dollar both moved sharply higher in August when U.S.-China trade tensions erupted.

The hectic activity in the options market came on Tuesday as China’s decision to impose a security law on Hong Kong drew ire from the U.S. and helped push the spread between two-year Hong Kong dollar and greenback swap rates to levels last seen in the late 1990s.
Traders were also worried about possible sanctions as the Trump administration continued to push allies to avoid Chinese businesses perceived as threats to their national security, and criticized China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
“There’s clearly lots of concern with respect to whether or not the U.S. will hit China and HK with sanctions,” said Bipan Rai, strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “The forwards market has eased up a bit on concerns over the past few sessions, but if imposed, U.S. sanctions would be damaging and might lead to changes with respect to the USD/HKD trading band eventually.”

Invesing.com – The pound had its biggest one-day surge against the dollar in more than a month on Tuesday, but is still likely to cap off the month in the red and likely faces a bumpy road ahead amid little progress on Brexit talks so far.
GBP/USD rose 1.23% to $1.2332.
""For the embattled pound, the news doesn't seem to get any better these days,"" UBS said, highlighting several headwinds for the currency including safe-haven demand for the dollar, renewed Brexit concerns and expectations for the Bank of England to adopt negative rates.
But negative rates are likely not baked in yet as the economy would have to get ""materially worse"" to prompt the BoE to cut rates to below zero, UBS suggested.
While cable is on track to end the month about 2% lower - following a coronavirus impact to the economy that has seen growth in the first quarter contract by a record 5% and ongoing worries about Brexit – it will end the year higher, the bank added.
Brexit talks have yielded little progress so far. Without a positive outcome in the final round of negotiations - set for next week before a conference in June to assess progress before the year-end transition deadline - some have raised concerns of a stalemate.
Heading into the talks, the EU is reportedly willing to extend an olive branch and ease its stance on fisheries.
The U.K. has expressed a desire to take control over access to its waters and fish when the transition period ends, rather stick with the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which set fishing quotas among EU member states.  "
7,"<span>May 26, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Leaders in the euro area need to make its widely-touted recovery fund a reality to revive the fortunes of its battered currency.
The euro’s comeback was threatened after the so-called frugal four -- Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands -- countered a joint proposal by France and Germany for a 500 billion euro ($548 billion) fund by suggesting aid in the form of loans, not grants.
“The euro’s road to recovery will likely be bumpy as markets assess the scope for the commission to come up with a plan acceptable to all member-states,” Gaétan Peroux, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a client note. “Continuing signs of a global and European recovery should eventually open the window to euro-dollar levels above 1.10.”
The Recovery Fund proposals have several key elements that would in theory help Europe’s weakest economies: the European Commission would issue the debt, money would be distributed through grants and repayments would come via the EU budget.
How much of that makes it into the final plan will start to emerge this week with negotiations beginning formally and the European Commission unveiling its own proposal.
The lack of region-wide fiscal framework has long been seen as a thorn in the ambitions of EU leaders to make the euro a stronger rival to the U.S. dollar. The currency weakened to its lowest level in three years in March, when Europe became the epicenter for the coronavirus, with the bloc’s most-indebted nations, including Italy and Spain, suffering severe outbreaks.
That same month, five-year Italian credit default swaps -- a gauge of EU breakup risk -- spiked to the highest since 2013, spurred by worries of a another sovereign debt crisis in the bloc. That measure fell to the lowest level in over a month after the Franco-German proposal.
“This proposal isn’t a fix of any kind yet,” wrote Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe General SA, in a note to clients. “For now, it’s just something to shake out euro shorts, against the yen as much as the dollar. We will go on bumping along the bottom of the post-2014 range.”
Bearishness on the euro was the strongest since 2018, according to Citigroup's FX Pain Index for the currency, an indicator of active trader positions. It’s a sign to some analysts that a so-called short squeeze is looming.
Sure enough, while one-week risk reversals on the euro-dollar pair eased since hitting the highest since March last week, it still shows a preference for the common currency, which rose as much as 0.7% as of 10:17 a.m. in London to $1.0973.
“It is only one step and more will be required,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of foreign-exchange strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “If it is able to get across the line with the other EU members, it does represent an important step forward.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar sold off in early European trade Tuesday amid optimism over the global recovery given positive news of a potential coronavirus vaccine as well as the further reopening of economies, prompting investors to edge out of this safe haven.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.582, down 0.3%, EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.0922, GBP/USD gained 0.5% to 1.2240, and USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 107.87.
Late Monday, U.S. biotech company  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) said it has begun trials for a coronavirus vaccine in Australia. It expects preliminary results from the Phase 1 clinical trial in July, and upon successful completion Phase 2 will be conducted in several countries, including the United States.
Novavax is one of many drugmakers around the world racing to find a way to fight a pandemic that's infected over 5 million people worldwide.
This followed news that a drop-off in virus cases led the Japanese government to end its state of emergency, adding to the increasing number of countries that are reopening their economies as the course of the coronavirus slows. 
Still, ranges are tight as the U.K. and the U.S. return from Monday’s holiday while investors keep a wary eye on the tensions between the U.S. and China and the protests in Hong Kong. 
""Markets are caught between two conflicting currents,"" said Michael McCarthy, CMC Markets' chief strategist. ""Rising tensions between China and the U.S. are raising concerns, while easing Covid-19 lockdown measures are fuelling growth optimism.""
The Chinese yuan, a barometer of relations between the world's two biggest economies, firmed a bit to 7.1324, though it remains near a two-month low of 7.1465 hit on Friday.The Australian dollar was at $0.6580, up 0.5%, and the kiwi up 0.6% at $0.6136.",,,,,
9,"<span>May 26, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound is heading for this year’s worst monthly slide, and a lengthening list of risks is pointing to more turbulence in June.
Sterling traders look set to face heightened uncertainty on multiple fronts next month -- the end-June deadline to extend the Brexit transition period, the possibility of negative interest rates in the U.K. and the economy’s tentative exit from the pandemic lockdown.
That suggests the market will likely break with the trading lull typical for the time of the year, with volatility possibly scaling highs unseen in June since the 2016 Brexit referendum. Sterling has slid more than 3% versus the dollar this month to around $1.2190 on Monday, falling in May for the 11th year in a row.
“Much uncertainty hangs in the balance around Brexit and the end of June,” said Neil Jones, head of foreign-exchange sales to financial institutions at Mizuho Bank. “Uncertainty generally pushes volatility higher.”
The current Brexit transition period finishes at year-end, which means Britain and the European Union have only until then to forge a new trade deal in order to avoid tariffs and quotas. The other option is to extend the interim period -- and the last date to do so is June 30. Talks between negotiators resume on June 1, after this month’s discussions made little progress.
Brexit Gets Personal as Officials Trade Barbs Amid High Tension
Unwillingness to extend the transition period would leave negotiators with the tall task of cobbling together a trade pact -- a process that often runs into years -- in a matter of months. That would only heighten concern that the two sides may part ways without an agreement.
Sterling volatility will likely rise on such a prospect as well as any move to extend the transition, albeit not to highs seen during the peak of the pandemic turmoil in March, according to Mizuho’s Jones.
The pound may also see wide fluctuations around the Bank of England’s meeting on June 18. Money markets are already pricing in the prospect of sub-zero U.K. interest rates by year-end after recent comments by Monetary Policy Committee members suggested the central bank isn’t ruling out the possibility. That prospect sent two-year U.K. bond yields to a record low below 0% last week.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“Risk managers will be hedging negative rates given they can’t be completely ruled out now, but they remain unlikely to become policy anytime soon with upsizing quantitative easing the preferred option. It’s only until we get a real signal that two-year yields can go a lot more negative, as was the case in Germany”
-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist
According to Bloomberg Economics, negative rates probably won’t be a game changer for the economy and a more potent policy mix may be for the BOE to continue with asset purchases, complementing government fiscal stimulus.
“I think an extension to QE is in the price, but negative rates would still increase pressure on pound at this point,” said Jane Foley, a senior foreign currency strategist at Rabobank International.
Pound Risks 35-Year Low With BOE Fueling Sub-Zero Rate Bets
Should the U.K. become the next major nation with negative interest rates, the pound could also face pressure from the options front, where risk reversals suggest that traders have stayed less bearish compared with the spot market.
The gauge, a barometer of market positioning and sentiment, shows that overall downside risks still prevail for the U.K. currency. The latest data reveal the depth of the economic damage from the Covid-19 crisis and investors will be on the lookout to assess the impact of the easing restrictions on the rate of the spread of coronavirus in the country.
For Rabobank’s Foley, expectations for pound swings next month should have been higher already as Brexit news is back.
“Given that Brexit tensions look set to rise as well as political pressure on the government over its handling of Covid-19, it is almost inevitable that we will see further volatility and downside pressure on the pound into June,” she said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar inched lower on Tuesday as growing optimism about a global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic supported riskier currencies, though concerns about Sino-U.S. tensions held further moves in check.
After a quiet start to the week due to holidays in Britain and the United States, the greenback was a fraction softer against most Asian currencies.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar was roughly where it ended last week, holding at 99.692. The Japanese yen  fetched 107.79 per dollar.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars rose about 0.3%, but kept below last week's highs even as stock markets forged ahead.
""Markets are caught between two conflicting currents,"" said Michael McCarthy, CMC Markets' chief strategist. ""Rising tensions between China and the U.S. are raising concerns, while easing COVID-19 lockdown measures are fuelling growth optimism.""
The Chinese yuan , a barometer of relations between the world's two biggest economies, firmed a bit to 7.1427, though it remains near a two-month low of 7.1465 hit on Friday.
The Australian dollar  was steady at $0.6559, and the kiwi  at $0.6112.
ANZ Bank upgraded its forecasts for the Antipodean currencies, but still expects both to fall, with the Aussie forecast at $0.60 and the kiwi at $0.55 in December.
""At current levels a global recovery is in the price, and we believe it's a question of when, not if, depreciation resumes,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Tuesday. 
Trade, the handling of the pandemic and China's move to impose laws on Hong Kong are all seen as potential catalysts for a further deterioration in already testy U.S.-China relations.
The latest salvos came over the weekend, with White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien warning of potential sanctions if Hong Kong's autonomy was undermined, and China's top diplomat Wang Yi criticising U.S. attacks as a ""smear"".
A third downgrade in Singapore's growth forecast also provided a fresh reminder of the pandemic's devastating impact on the global economy. The trade-exposed city-state expects gross domestic product to contract between 4% and 7% this year.
Still, from Europe to Japan, restrictions on businesses and movement are lifting and barring a second wave of infections, there is plenty of hope for a swift return to growth.
Together with low interest rates, and talk of them heading even lower, the calmer conditions had some investors on the lookout for carry trades.
The British pound  rose 0.3% to $1.2215 and the euro (EUR=) tacked on 0.2% to $1.0908. Both currencies lost between 4% and 5% on the Mexican peso and Brazilian real last week.

""We've got the perfect ground right now for Mexican peso or Brazilian real outperformance,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone. ""It's basically choose your carry vehicle, or funding currency, and get paid.""

12,"<span>May 25, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Fears that capital could flee Hong Kong are visible just about everywhere in the currency market, testing the local dollar’s resilience to economic recession.
Speculators are all-in betting on significant depreciation with derivatives, sending a measure of bearishness to near its highest level of the year. Volume on Hong Kong dollar options soared to $3.7 billion on Friday, with a third of the trades betting the pegged currency would hit or break the weak end of its trading band.
Conviction that turbulence will get worse is also evident in the swaps market, where the spread between local and U.S. rates reached levels last seen in the 1990s. One-year forward points closed at the highest since 1999, suggesting a spike in demand to hedge against depreciation in the currency.
Hong Kong is the epicenter of escalating U.S.-China tensions following Beijing’s shock decision last week to impose a law to curb dissent in the city. That stoked the Hong Kong dollar’s biggest drop in six weeks and the worst stock rout since 2008. The Trump administration is considering responses that could include revoking Hong Kong’s special trade status, a risk that threatens to undermine the city’s standing as a global financial hub.
The sudden bearishness is crashing against the city’s elevated borrowing costs, which have kept the long Hong Kong dollar carry trade profitable since November. Liquidity in the financial system remains relatively tight for now, keeping the city’s interbank rates wide versus those in the U.S. Plans from some of China’s biggest companies to sell shares in Hong Kong in June should make that more pronounced by increasing the demand for cash.
The key question is how the Hong Kong dollar’s yield advantage over the greenback can act as a support for the currency.
“Some capital inflows chasing new listings in the city could offset some fund outflows this quarter,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “However, the main risk is how the U.S. will deal with Hong Kong’s special status.”
The Hong Kong dollar’s recent strength was upended last week as China confirmed it would effectively bypass the city’s legislature to implement its controversial national security laws, which critics say will erode freedoms of speech, assembly and the press. The currency had traded near the strong side of its narrow band since April largely thanks to a popular trade where hedge funds sold the greenback for the city’s higher-yielding dollars.
As long as that strategy remains profitable and popular, weakness in the currency will be limited. Share sales from NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. in June will mop up liquidity as traders set aside funds to buy stock, driving up borrowing costs in Hong Kong. The premium between one-month Hibor and the U.S. equivalent is near the widest since 1999, meaning traders will still lose money if they sell the city’s currency against the greenback.
June will also be a month when local banks hoard cash to meet quarter-end regulatory checks, driving up demand for Hong Kong dollars. Listed Chinese companies will buy the city’s currency to pay dividends in the summer, also pushing up interest rates. The Hong Kong dollar traded less than 35 pips from the strong end on Monday, down from 78 pips last week.
That delicate balance will depend in part on how the U.S. responds to China’s actions.
“Investors have been quite concerned with capital outflows,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. “We haven’t seen signs of that yet and I don’t think Hong Kong will see massive fund exodus unless the U.S. makes an extreme response to the law. The panic will likely last for one to two weeks.”

The Memorial Day weekend in the U.S. has largely muted news flow out of that country, but the dollar drifted back towards its March high against the Chinese yuan after pro-democracy protests again erupted in Hong Kong, prompting a strong response from local security forces.
The dollar was at 7.1552 yuan in the offshore market by 3:45 AM, up 0.1%.
The euro was sluggish after data confirming that Germany, the currency union’s biggest economy, fell into recession in the first quarter, as gross domestic product contracted by 2.2%. The data are somewhat backward-looking and arguably more weight will be put on the release of the Ifo business climate for May, due at 4 AM ET.
Analysts at Nordea argued in a weekly preview that the euro has yet to price in any benefits from the Franco-German proposal for joint debt issuance and modest fiscal transfers to fund the EU’s coronavirus recovery fund – something that would represent a big step towards a central fiscal arm at European level.
Nordea’s Andreas Steno Larsen argued that the lack of enthusiasm for the euro reflected the hurdles that the Franco-German plan still faces: although the EU Commission is likely to endorse it in an important strategy document later this week, four countries – the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Finland – detailed their opposition in a jointly authored paper at the weekend.
Even so, the euro’s stagnation below $1.09 “leaves a pretty good risk/reward in playing the outside chance of a breakthrough for the proposal via long EUR/USD structures in option space,” they argued.
The British pound, meanwhile, was stable but under pressure from the prospect of the Bank of England cutting official interest rates below zero at its next policy meeting in June.
“GBP is not looking good with a perpetual underlying double deficit and a very clear risk of negative carry ahead,” Steno Larsen wrote.
The Sterling index fell 2.2% last week and is starting the week near a two-month low, while GBP/USD was at $1.2171, effectively unchanged from Friday."

Investing.com – The dollar was down on Monday morning in Asia, giving up its earlier gains after protests in Hong Kong on Sunday escalated U.S.-China tensions.
Thousands took to the streets in the Special Administrative Region after China formally tabled national security laws for both Hong Kong and Macau as the National People’s Congress opened on Monday.
U.S.-China tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said overnight that the U.S. risked “a new cold war” with China after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened strong action should the law be enacted.
The U.S. Commerce Department added 33 Chinese companies and institutions to a blacklist on Friday, and two U.S. Senators proposed sanctions on entities enforcing the law.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.02% to 99.868 by 11:37 PM ET (4:37 AM GMT) with investor risk appetite soured by the rising tensions.

“The biggest concern is the tension between the United States and China,” Takuya Kanda, general manager of research at Gaitame.com Research Institute, told Reuters.
“Things were already bad, and it is likely to get worse because of the Hong Kong security law. This supports risk-off trades, which is positive for the dollar and the yen.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against most Asian units on Monday as worries about a standoff between the United States and China over civil liberties in Hong Kong fuelled demand for safe-haven currencies.
The yuan and Australian and New Zealand dollars fell as risk-aversion hit foreign exchange markets.
Sterling was on the defensive after members of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's party called for the resignation of an influential aide for breaking travel restrictions during the coronavirus lockdown.
A senior White House official has said Beijing's plan to impose a security law on the former British colony of Hong Kong could lead to U.S. sanctions, which could worsen an already tense relationship between the world's two-largest economies.
""The biggest concern is the tension between the United States and China,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of research at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.

The greenback held steady at 107.65 yen .
In onshore trade, the yuan  eased slightly to 7.1372 per dollar, approaching a seven-month low hit on Friday. 
Trading may be subdued on Monday with financial markets in Singapore, Britain and the United States are closed for public holidays.
China's proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong could lead to U.S. sanctions and threaten the city's status as a financial hub, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said on Sunday.
Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Sunday to protest Beijing's national security law.
Washington and Beijing are also at loggerheads over Chinese companies' access to advanced technology and criticism of China's response after the novel coronavirus emerged late last year in Hubei.
The threat of sanctions over Hong Kong risks a repeat of last year's damaging trade war between the United States and China.
The British pound  was little changed at $1.2185. Against the euro, sterling traded at 89.44 pence (EURGBP=D3).
Johnson has backed his senior adviser Dominic Cummings on Sunday, despite calls from within his own Conservative Party for the aide to resign.
Cummings, who is the architect of the 2016 campaign to leave the EU and widely considered to be Johnson's most influential strategist, came under pressure after reports he travelled to northern England from London during a nationwide lockdown in March when his wife was ill with COVID-19 symptoms.
The Australian dollar  gave up early gains to trade at $0.6537 as risk aversion offset optimism about the country's emergence from coronavirus lockdowns.
In New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices.
Australian states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July.

17,"<span>May 24, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore’s currency looks set to remain under pressure as global headwinds outweigh the benefits of an easing in the nationwide lockdown.
The U.S. dollar-Singapore dollar pair has failed to break below technical support at its one-month low, suggesting its next move could well be higher. Data this week is expected to show the nation’s economy contracted 1.8% y/y in the first quarter, according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The Southeast Asian currency has been pressured by the negative impact of the coronavirus on the Singaporean economy and is down over 5% against the greenback so far this year. The government is projecting gross domestic product will shrink 1%-4% in 2020.
“We see significant challenges ahead for the Singapore dollar, given Singapore is one of the most open economies in the region,” said Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc. strategist Divya Devesh. “Given the subdued outlook for global growth and global trade, and a sharp decline in global manufacturing PMI’s, we expect the recent improvement in Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports to reverse course.”
The nation’s exports unexpectedly climbed for a second straight month in April, mainly due to a jump in pharmaceuticals, according to data released on May 18. The government said the shipments tend to be volatile and fluctuate across months.
Also keeping the local dollar under pressure is the willingness signaled by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to let the currency weaken at its March 30 policy decision, in a bid to support the trade-reliant economy. The MAS doesn’t set rates, but instead manages the currency against major trading partners as a policy tool.
The Singapore dollar’s nominal effective exchange rate -- the focus of the MAS -- began May at a similar level to where it was at the time of the March policy decision, suggesting there is still room for the currency to weaken further.
The U.S. dollar-Singapore dollar pair traded at 1.4222 on Friday at 5:20 p.m. local time, more than 1% above its April 30 low of 1.4070. Its failure to breach this support leaves the door open for a grind higher toward technical resistance at the April 6 high of 1.4417.
Still, pressure on the currency should be alleviated somewhat as the domestic economy starts to pick up with Singapore allowing more businesses to reopen on June 2. That will increase the active proportion of the economy to three-quarters -- after a nationwide lockdown cut transmission of the coronavirus among citizens and permanent residents.

Investing.com – The euro is on track to snap a two-week losing streak against the dollar, but this is unlikely the start of a trend as the coronavirus impact will leave a bigger economic dent on eurozone than the U.S., Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.
EUR/USD fell 0.50% to $1.0894.
EUR/USD will depreciate in the coming months as the eurozone fiscal response to the pandemic has not been as strong as that of the U.S., Bank of America said.
The fiscal response from the EU has been hampered by infighting as member states have disagreed on the best way forward to structure a coronavirus relief package. But a Franco-German effort has sparked hopes of a breakthrough after both nations earlier this week agreed a $545 billion pandemic response.
The funds raised from the proposed bond, which needs the backing of other member states, would be distributed as grants rather than loans to EU member states worst hit by the pandemic.
While this is a ""positive step,"" it isn't a Eurobond and fails to address ""unsustainable debt dynamics"" in the eurozone periphery, Bank of America said.
On the monetary policy front, meanwhile, minutes of the ECB meeting in April signaled the central bank stands ready to roll out more stimulus, if needed, at its June meeting.
At the June meeting, the Governing Council would ""have to stand ready to adjust the PEPP and potentially other instruments if it saw that the scale of the stimulus was falling short of what was needed.""",,,,,
19,"<span>May 22, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank officials have given up on the idea of a swift economic rebound and are ready to add stimulus again next month if new information suggests existing efforts aren’t enough.
Policy makers agreed at their April 30 meeting that a “V-shaped recovery could probably already be ruled out at this stage,” though their emergency asset purchases prevented the likelihood of a self-reinforcing downward spiral, according to an account of the virtual discussion.
“At the June meeting, more information would be available, including new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections,” the account showed. “The Governing Council would have to stand ready to adjust the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and potentially other instruments if it saw that the scale of the stimulus was falling short of what was needed.”
Policy makers decided at the meeting to ease the terms of their long-term loans to banks and introduced a new liquidity tool, but opted against expanding quantitative easing. Most economists expect the 750-billion euro ($815 billion) emergency bond-buying program will be increased, perhaps as soon as the next policy meeting on June 4.
The ECB has pledged to buy more than a trillion euros of debt this year -- the most in its history -- using the pandemic program and an earlier one. The institution has led the European-level response, with most fiscal action coming only from national governments.
A concern was voiced that the ECB’s large-scale interventions in sovereign bond markets could give rise to “fiscal dominance’” -- encouraging irresponsible spending by governments. The Governing Council agreed that “fiscal policy also needed to play an essential role.”
It may get its wish. German and French leaders finally proposed a 500 billion euro aid package this week that might ease some of the pressure, though it requires approval by all 27 European Union member states and would only kick in next year.

20,"<span>May 22, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Speculation that the U.K. could be the next major nation with negative interest rates is hurting the pound and driving a record rally in the country’s haven bonds.
Sterling tumbled against a stronger dollar and gilt yields touched fresh all-time lows after Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden became the latest policy maker to signal that interest rates below 0% could be a possibility. Traders in money markets are betting the U.K. could see sub-zero interest rates by year-end.
Ramsden’s comments “are broadly in line with other Monetary Policy Committee members this week which have signaled that the BOE is giving serious consideration to putting in place negative rates,” said Lee Hardman, a foreign-exchange strategist at MUFG. “I don’t think it would surprising to see the pound fall back towards the March lows if negative rates were put in place.”
The pound slid 0.4% to $1.2176, taking its losses this quarter to 1.9%, making it the worst performer among Group-of-10 major peers. It fell to a 35-year low of $1.1412 in March as London, the world’s largest foreign-exchange trading hub, headed for a lockdown as the coronavirus spread.
Data out Friday showed a record U.K. budget deficit of 62.1 billion pounds ($76 billion) in April. Retail sales data collapsed by almost a fifth in the same month.
The BOE’s forecasts expect an economic contraction of 14% this year. The pound is also being weighed down by a lack of progress on Brexit trade talks, which could see a so-called cliff-edge exit from a transitional period with the European Union at the end of the year.
BOE Governor Andrew Bailey hinted at his own change of heart on negative rates when giving testimony to parliamentary lawmakers earlier this week. That took two-year gilt yields, which are most sensitive to interest-rate expectations, to a record low below 0%.
The yields fell further Friday in the wake of Ramsden’s comments to a new record at -0.07%, down by as many as three basis points. While the U.K. is boosting debt supply to fund its crisis response, the BOE is soaking up much of that through its asset-purchase program, leading investors to keep buying gilts."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was in demand during early European trade Friday as simmering U.S.-China tensions flared up, prompting investors to seek the traditional safe haven.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.627, up 0.2%, EUR/USD dropped 0.2% to 1.0925, while GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2203.
The latest source of Sino-U.S. disagreement came after Beijing moved to impose a new security law on Hong Kong after last year's pro-democracy unrest.
The decision drew a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react ""very strongly"" against the attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.
The yuan has also been hit by China's decision to omit an economic growth target for 2020, which renewed concerns that the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will last longer than originally expected.
At 2:45 AM, USD/CNY traded at 7.1238, up 0.1%, hitting a two-month high. The offshore yuan, which trades in a more flexible range, also fell to a two-month low. The Aussie, which is widely seen as a rough proxy for Chinese commodity demand, was the day's biggest loser, falling 0.6%.
Washington and Beijing also have differing opinions over telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies’ access to advanced technology and as well as Beijing's response to the coronavirus outbreak. 
""There have been problems between the United States and China for quite a while now,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""Some very short-term players are changing positions from one day to the next, which makes it difficult to see the trend, but overall the dollar looks to be supported.""
In Japan, core consumer prices fell for the first time in more than three years in April on an annual basis. 
However, the yen showed some strength after the central bank extended the deadline for a series of measures it has deployed to combat the virus fallout, including accelerated corporate debt buying, by six months to March 2021, but kept its short-term interest rate target of -0.1% unchanged.
USD/JPY traded at 107.46, down 0.1%
In emerging markets, the central banks in Turkey and South Africa both took advantage of their currencies' recent rebounds to cut interest Thursday in effort to help their battered economies. The llira and rand both dipped but held on to most of their gains. 
USD/TRY traded 0.2% higher at 6.7946 and USD/ZAR up 0.8% at 17.7113.
The lira was still up 1.5% on the week, while the rand was up 4.6%.

22,"<span>May 22, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Britain posted a record budget deficit in April as the government unleashed an unprecedented package to prevent the collapse of the virus-stricken economy.
The budget deficit stood at 62.1 billion pounds ($76 billion) last month, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. The figure is equal to the total borrowing in the whole of the previous fiscal year.
The monthly deficit is the most since modern records began in 1993, and over 50 billion pounds more than April 2019. Even during the financial crisis, monthly borrowing was never more than 22 billion pounds.
Central government spending surged 57% and revenue plunged 27%.
The figures reflect the cost of interventions announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, including paying the wages of 8 million furloughed workers, a surge in welfare claims and the hit to tax revenue from a shrinking economy.
With net debt predicted to exceed 110% of GDP by September, a debate is raging over how Britain should pay the bill. Borrowing costs are at record low and pressure is mounting on the government not to return to the era of austerity and instead reduce the burden by letting growth rip.
Despite some easing of the lockdown measures in place since March 23, shops remain shuttered and businesses closed, putting the country on course for its deepest recession since the early 1700s.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, which prior to the crisis predicted borrowing of 55 billion pounds in the current fiscal year, now expects a shortfall of over 300 billion pounds, or 15% of gross domestic product.
The deficit in the whole of the 2019-20 fiscal year, which ended last month, was revised up to 62.6 billion pounds.

23,"<span>May 22, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s central bank cut interest rates in an unscheduled announcement on Friday, ramping up support for an economy it expects will contract for the first time in more than four decades.
The benchmark repurchase rate was lowered by 40 basis points to 4%, Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a live streamed address. The reverse repurchase rate was reduced to 3.35% from 3.75%. The monetary policy committee met ahead of its scheduled meeting in early June, Das said.
The economy is expected to contract in the fiscal year through March 2021, Das said, as the impact of the coronavirus and measures taken to contain the pandemic severely affect domestic activity.
“After extensive discussions, the MPC voted unanimously for a reduction in policy repo rate and for maintaining the accomodative stance of the monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth and to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target,” Das said.
The RBI last cut its benchmark rate on March 27 following an emergency policy meeting. Das said at the time that the RBI will continue to remain vigilant and would not hesitate to use any instrument -- conventional and unconventional -- to mitigate the economic fallout of the virus and preserve financial stability.
The economy is heading for a 45% contraction in GDP in the quarter through June, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., and facing a full-year decline as consumption -- the backbone of the economy -- collapsed due to the government’s strict stay-at-home measures.
High frequency data has showed that demand is virtually non-existent. India’s dominant services industries crashed last month, while car sales also collapsed. Large swathes of the population have been left destitute, with an estimated 122 million people losing their jobs in April, many of them daily wage earners, a survey by the private sector Center for Monitoring Indian Economy showed."
24,"<span>May 22, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Two of Europe’s most cash-strapped countries are stepping up bond sales to fund the surge in spending needed to shore up their pandemic-battered economies.
Spanish officials on Thursday boosted net debt issuance for this year to 130 billion euros ($143 billion), a fourfold increase from a target set in January. That exceeds a previous record set in 2009, in the depths of the region’s last major economic contraction.
In Italy, the Treasury sold a record 22.3 billion euros of five-year retail notes. Mom and pop buyers submitted around 14 billion euros in orders and the proceeds are tagged to fund the “Covid-19 emergency.”
Borrowing costs for both countries have dropped after France and Germany announced a plan to support a 500-billion-euro fund, backed by debt, as part of the euro area’s effort to help the most indebted countries avoid an economic crisis that could tear the monetary union apart.
Italy and Spain have been among the hardest-hit by the virus. Already saddled with much higher debt levels than northern neighbors, their economies are suffering a deeper recession because of strict lockdowns to curb the disease. Economists say the cost of spending too little could only mean a bigger fiscal crisis in the future.
But until European Union members endorse a deal to share the burden, support from the European Central Bank remains the main thing keeping bond yields from spiraling out of control. The ECB is vacuuming up securities issued by euro area members as part of its bolstered bond-buying program, which economists say could be expanded as early as June.
The German-Franco plan should boost demand for so-called peripheral debt “in theory,” but until more details emerge, markets will continue to assign a much greater probability to monetary easing measures rather than fiscal stimulus, said Antoine Bouvet, a rates strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
Italian and Spanish benchmark bond yields are roughly half of what they were in March, helped by increased ECB purchases. The spread of Spain’s 10-year bond yield over German bunds widened as much as five basis points, but then shrank after the Treasury’s borrowing announcement.
Spain’s central bank, which regularly buys sovereign debt under the ECB program, said it doesn’t comment on daily transactions.
Spain’s new target “does suggest a re-acceleration of issuance versus what we’ve seen so far in May, which should play out through June and July in particular,” said Henry Occleston, rates strategist at Mizuho International Plc.
What Bloomberg Economists’ Say...
“France and Spain look to have done too little, though automatic stabilizers are stronger in these countries; while Italy has done enough, but we are concerned that it has come too late.”
-- Jamie Rush, Maeva Cousin and David Powell. 
In a briefing with journalists, Spanish Economy Ministry officials said Madrid was also likely to tap a new, joint European Union employment insurance fund worth 100 billion euros.
They said the government would likely be able to access around 15 billion euros in credit lines from the fund, which is being rolled out to help countries meet the spike in labor costs. Nations across Europe have underwritten the cost of furloughing tens of millions of private-sector workers.
Italy hasn’t ruled out tapping those funds, either, or another leg of the pandemic-crisis package -- the cheap credit lines from the European Stability Mechanism -- even though it has become a source of political contention.
The head of the nation’s debt agency, Davide Iacovoni, sees bond issuance rising by at least 90 billion euros this year.
One Fund Too Far
Meanwhile, Spain has said it doesn’t plan on borrowing from the ESM program because it has been able to meet most of its financing needs from the bond market.
ECB policy maker Pablo Hernandez de Cos earlier this week urged Spanish lawmakers to avoid “dramatizing” any discussion in Spain or elsewhere about tapping the region’s bailout fund.
“I would try to take the conversation out of the political sphere,” said Hernandez de Cos, who is also the governor of Spain’s central bank. “The government will decide if it’s appropriate.”

Investing.com – The dollar ended the week on a high note on Friday, with investors turning to the safe-haven dollar as simmering U.S.-China tensions flared up.
The greenback was boosted by reports on Thursday that China was planning controversial national security laws for Hong Kong in the aftermath of pro-democracy protests in the city in the second half of 2019.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said during the opening session for the National People’s Congress earlier in the day, “We will establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two special administrative regions and see that the governments of the two regions fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.”
The plans drew an immediate response from the United States, with President Donald Trump saying the United States will react strongly if China imposes the laws, and two U.S. senators were preparing a bill imposing sanctions on entities involved in upholding the law.

The USD/JPY pair was down 0.07% to 107.53. Japan reported on Friday that its April core consumer prices fell for the first time in more than three years year-on-year, with deflation risks heightened by weak oil prices and COVID-19 lockdown measures.
On the same day, the Bank of Japan launched a new lending facility aiming to channel more funds to small-and-medium-sized businesses to cushion COVID-19's economic blow. It also extended the deadline for a series of other COVID-19-combatting measures, including accelerated corporate debt buying, by six months.
Meanwhile, monetary settings, including the short-term interest rate target of -0.1% and a pledge to guide the 10-year government bond yield around 0%, remain unchanged.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.07% to 7.1186 as tensions flared up with the U.S. after China unveiled its plans for Hong Kong. Li also said during the opening session that China, in a break with years of tradition, failed to set a numerical GDP target.

The United Kingdom 5-Year fell below zero for the first time on Thursday, as traders continue to price in the Bank of England cutting rates to below zero from 0.10%.
The prospect of negative rates has gathered momentum after the U.K. sold its first government bond with a negative yield at auction this week and BoE policymakers said negative rates cannot be ruled out.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said Wednesday that negative rates were being considered alongside other measures.
While a further increase in quantitative easing by the Bank of England at its June 18 meeting should be taken as a given, negative rates hinge on the speed of U.K. recovery, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
As well as negative rates, the pound's decline has been exacerbated by ongoing worries about Brexit, with talks between the U.K and EU yielding little in the way of progress so far.
The UK's chief negotiator David Frost said there had been very little progress on talks after both sides wrapped up the third round of Brexit talks last Friday.
The U.K has until June 30 to extend negotiations, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not expressed any willingness to seek an extension, raising the risk that the U.K may not have enough time to secure a trade deal beyond the transition period, which ends Dec. 31."

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis may have dealt a lethal blow to the idea that the euro could one day replace the dollar as the world's preferred currency, by exposing euro zone frailties and cementing the U.S. Fed's role as global lender of last resort.
These months have highlighted - and possibly entrenched - the dollar's dominance of global commerce, investment, borrowing and central bank reserve savings, not least because of the differing U.S. and European responses to the crisis.
This week's proposals for a European Union recovery fund financed by jointly issued debt may burnish the euro's international role if it leads to more cohesion within the bloc.
But economists say that even if the proposal makes it past a late-May EU meeting, squabbling, whether over budget spending or the issuance of coronabonds to aid poorer states, has re-ignited fears that the euro could even break up.
""The crisis has again demonstrated that the euro may not be forever,"" said Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at Pimco, the world's biggest bond manager. ""The dollar reigns even more supreme as the (world's) reserve currency.""

Already in recent years the euro's share in global finance has shrunk - International Monetary Fund data shows its weight in allocated central bank reserves at around 20%, down from nearly 26% in 2010, though negative European Central Bank interest rates are partly to blame. The dollar, meanwhile, has a 61% share.
An ECB index of the euro's international role has tumbled from over 27% in the early 2000s to below 22% in 2017, the last time the measure was updated.

The euro has also steadily lost ground in forex trading and currency derivatives https://tmsnrt.rs/2zdiYPd, and lags the dollar in international borrowing. Latest SWIFT data shows it accounts for 31% of global payments versus over 40% in 2012. The dollar's share has risen to 44% from 30%.

DOLLAR RUSH
The world's dollar dependence was underscored during the March market panic when businesses dashed for greenback liquidity to pay bills, redeem debt or just increase their buffers. 
It was proof that access to dollars is paramount in times of crisis, so ""central banks will anticipate that, going forward, they will need to hold dollars,"" said Brad Setser, senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.
The rush, which sent the dollar up 8% in 10 days (=USD), only eased after the Federal Reserve activated hundreds of billions of dollars in swap lines to central banks to ensure greenbacks continued flowing, with other central banks also seeking swap lines with the Fed.
To other countries which needed emergency dollars, it offered repo loans, if they had Treasury bonds to post as collateral. 
Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, contrasted the Fed's actions with the ""timid"" ECB.
""If you look at what's happening now versus in 2008, the Fed made lightening progress in recognising its role as the lender of last resort,"" Ribakova said.
In recent months the ECB has only established swap lines with Bulgaria and Croatia, but ""there isn't a similar conversation about what happens if euro funding dries up,"" she added. 
""You have to be more proactive if you ever want to challenge the dollar's position.""
OPPORTUNITY
Since the euro's birth in 1999, its backers have pushed to end the dollar's post-World War Two dominance. The calls got louder when President Donald Trump resorted to weaponising the dollar in overseas dealings, such as the trade spat with China or while re-imposing sanctions on Iran.
Francesco Papadia, former market operations director-general at the ECB, said the dollar's ""ultimate safe asset"" role gave it an advantage ""not even the incompetence and vagaries of the U.S. President can offset"".
The current crisis may hurt the euro's international position further, he added, if the U.S. policy response fuels a faster recovery than in Europe.
But it also offered a chance to address one of the euro's drawbacks for reserve managers: the lack of a big pool of 'safe' assets, comparable with U.S. Treasury bonds.
Central banks usually hold reserves in bonds denominated in their chosen currency. U.S. government bonds, with $17 trillion-plus of AAA-rated paper in circulation, are the closest thing to a risk-free asset.
German, French and Italian bond markets combined come to less than half that size https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZmA0W3, and only Germany carries the top AAA score.
(Graphic: 2020 commercial debt stock by issuer - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/oakpezboxvr/eikon.png)
Even increased borrowing to fund COVID-19 recovery programmes will not bring Germany's debt pool anywhere close to that of Treasuries. 
Backing for the Franco-German recovery fund plan may lay the foundation for joint euro bonds, which could eventually offer reserve managers a viable risk-free alternative to Treasuries. 
In the near term, renewed Sino-U.S. tensions could discourage China from holding the majority of its reserves in dollars, according to Barry Eichengreen, economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has long argued that there is room for more than one major reserve currency.
Some central banks have begun to diversify. Russia for instance slimmed down its Treasury holdings after being slapped with U.S. sanctions in 2014, and Russian oil firm Rosneft has switched export contracts to euros.
""I wouldn't write off the Europeans quite yet,"" Eichengreen added. ""As the father of European integration, Jean Monnet, famously said, 'Europe is forged in crises'.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar posted gains in early European trade Thursday, as investors digested the latest downbeat comments from the Federal Reserve, while Asian data offered no real recovery clues.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.403, up 0.3%, EUR/USD dropped 0.1% to 1.0962, while USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 107.76.
Earlier Thursday, a trade report from South Korea, a bellwether for global commerce, showed exports may be set to drop more than 20% in May for a second month. Meanwhile, Japan’s overseas shipments also plunged by more than a fifth in April and a purchasing managers index showed manufacturing activity weakening further in May.
Adding to this, Federal Reserve members said the impact of the coronavirus would ""weigh heavily on growth in the near term, and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,"" according to the minutes of their April meeting out Wednesday.
An air of positivity had returned to the market as countries started to reopen their economies, but the wary nature of these comments coupled with the disappointing data served to hit risk appetite, sending buyers back to the safe haven U.S. dollar.
Attention will now turn to the release of the key weekly U.S. jobless claims figures, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with economists looking for a dip from last week, but a slight one as companies are still forced to shed jobs.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to come in at 2.4 million, compared with nearly 3 million the week before.
Elsewhere, sterling has continued to weaken, weighed by apparent difficulties in Brexit trade negotiations with the EU as well as the prospect of negative interest rates given the likely depth of the economic slowdown ahead.
U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned earlier this week that the country faced a “severe recession, the likes of which we haven't seen.”
And that was before the country’s inflation rate fell to 0.8% in April, its lowest since August 2016.
”[The data] keeps the debate about negative rates alive and kicking,” Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale, told CNBC.
At 02:45 AM ET, GBP/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.2193.
Elsewhere, central banks in Turkey and South Africa are both scheduled to hold policy meetings later Thursday and both are expected to cut rates again despite the heavy losses their currencies have recently endured.
Analyst polls predict South Africa will cut its 4.25% main rate by another 50 basis points, while Turkey’s central bank will likely cut another 50-100 basis points off its 8.75% repo rate.
At 02:45 AM ET, USD/TRY traded flat at 6.7888 and USD/ZAR up 0.6% at 18.0291.

Investing.com – The dollar was up on Thursday morning in Asia, gaining back some of its losses from earlier in the session.
Earlier, positive investor sentiment about the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 virus soured as investors digested a grim report from the U.S. Federal Reserve as it released its Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes overnight.
The minutes warned that the COVID-19 virus posed both a severe economic threat and a risk to financial stability, but also hinted at more stimulus measures for economic recovery.
“Almost everywhere, policy makers are continuing to stress that whatever resources are required will be made available,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.24% to 99.370, just under the $100 mark, by 12:07 AM ET (5:07 AM GMT).
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.11% to 107.62. Japan’s Ministry of Finance said that the country’s April exports took a 21.9% dive year-on-year. Analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 22.7% drop.
The AUD/USD pair slid 0.54% to 0.6562 and the NZD/USD pair dropped 0.29% to 0.6124.
The Antipodean currencies could not hold onto their gains from bullish overnight trades that saw the AUD hit a ten-week high and the NZD see a 10-day high.
The USD/CNY pair was up 0.18% to 7.1056, even after a fresh aim from the U.S. at China’s handling of COVID-19 overnight.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the $2 billion pledged by Beijing to fight the virus is “paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world.”
Meanwhile, Chinese relations with both the U.S. and Australia continue to simmer in the background as the two countries join a growing group looking to probe the origins of COVID-19 and China's handling of the virus.
The GBP/USD pair dropped 0.32% to 1.2200 after the release of inflation data fueling continuous speculation that the Bank of England would introduce negative rates.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar nursed broad losses on Thursday and riskier currencies held gains as investors looked to a bright recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, shrugging off diabolical forecasts and rising Sino-U.S. tension.
In bullish overnight trade, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar  broke free from two months of rangebound moves to hit a ten-week high of $0.6616. The kiwi  hit a ten-day top of $0.6157 and both seemed poised for further gains.
""I think they might keep going,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer.
""It's one big rally and that rally hasn't finished yet,"" he said. ""The trend is clearly still upward for equities and currencies are mostly following it, even if not as strongly.""
The S&P 500 (SPX) is up about 35% from its March lows and the Australian dollar has rallied about 20% since then.
Both the Aussie and the kiwi were lower in morning trade, but moves were slight as markets await a speech from Australia's central bank chief at 0230 GMT and purchasing manager surveys in Britain, Europe and the United States later on.
Japan's flash purchasing managers' index on Thursday showed manufacturing activity slumping again in May.
Overnight, traders interpreted economic outlook downgrades in the U.S. Federal Reserve's April meeting minutes as likely to herald more stimulus, pushing stocks higher. (N)
""Almost everywhere, policy makers are continuing to stress that whatever resources are required will be made available,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Thursday.
The euro (EUR=) hit its highest in three weeks, the Swiss franc  its highest in two weeks and the Chinese yuan  its highest in one week, while emerging market currencies also surged.
In Asia, the euro last sat just below that peak at $1.0975 and the dollar inched higher on the Japanese yen  to 107.68.
The yuan was steady at 7.1067 in offshore trade, even as diplomatic tensions between China and Australia simmered and after the United States took fresh aim at Beijing's handling of the coronavirus on Wednesday.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the $2 billion that Beijing has pledged to fight the pandemic ""paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world.""
The exception to the broad dollar weakness was the British pound, which remains under pressure following inflation data that fuelled more speculation the Bank of England would cut interest rates below zero.

32,"<span>May 20, 2020 07:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The tidal wave of dollar liquidity, which eased a global credit crunch, has left Japanese and South Korean bonds reeling in its wake.
Investors funded with the U.S. currency are seeing returns on hedged holdings of these bonds shrink.
Funds that offer dollars in the swap market to borrow yen or South Korea’s won and park the proceeds in short-dated onshore government debt earn a yield of 0.38% and 1.10%, respectively, according to Bloomberg’s analysis. The rates were 2.87% and 3.11% at the start of 2019.
The shrinking returns illustrate how a concerted global push to pump dollars into the world economy has left some investors worse off. As yields decreased, global funds sold more than 8 trillion yen ($74 billion) of Japanese debt in the last two months.
“Hedge premiums have become less compelling for foreigners to buy Japanese government bonds,” said Akio Kato, general manager of strategic research and investment at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Kokusai Asset Management. Without those premiums, global interest in negative-yielding JGBs will fade, he said.
The stress in dollar funding has eased after the Federal Reserve extended liquidity through swap lines to its global peers, including the Bank of Japan and the Bank of Korea. Persistent speculation that U.S. interest rates may turn negative has also undermined the dollar’s premiums in the FX swap market.
While the recent decline in hedged yields has eroded the appeal of South Korean bonds, the notes are still reeling in global funds, thanks to their relative advantage over Treasuries. Investors bought 5.2 trillion won ($4.2 billion) of the debt due in less than a year in April, the most since 2008.
“We recommend looking beyond the usual candidates for yield enhancement to other markets with developed market-like characteristics,” Tom Nash and Himanshu Malik, strategists at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), wrote in a research note last week. “Korea stands out in this respect with relatively elevated bond yields in comparison” with other low-yielding peers, they wrote.

33,"<span>May 20, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) --
China’s top leaders should reveal on Friday how much they’re planning to spend on stimulus to support the post-virus economy, when they belatedly announce their economic policy blueprint for the rest of 2020.
The centerpiece event will be the work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang, which typically contains the economic growth and spending targets, as well as the goals for jobs and inflation.
Growth  Target  (NYSE:TGT)
The most important number to watch is the target for gross domestic product growth, which is the anchor for policy making and affects spending and debt sales. With the nation facing the slowest growth in more than 40 years and uncertainty still high with the virus raging globally, the government may however not even announce a target this year. It’s possible that a description of the desired level of growth or a range is announced.
If the leadership does follow convention and publish a numerical target, the pace and the language describing the number should be closely watched. That will illustrate the balance Beijing is trying to strike between restoring growth and avoiding an unsustainable increase in debt. Economists mostly expect a target below 3% or no number at all.
Unemployment
It was already clear that jobs would be top of the agenda this year, with Premier Li previously indicating that employment would be prioritized over economic growth.
A steady supply of new jobs is crucial for both social stability and government legitimacy and with only meager unemployment benefits, getting people into work is also key for supporting domestic spending. The plan is expected to detail targets for new job creation and the jobless rate for the year.
Millions of Newly Jobless in China Pose a Looming Threat to Xi
Last year the government aimed for more than 11 million new urban jobs and a jobless rate of around 5.5% last year, and claimed to have met those targets, despite the trade war. However, the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak threw uncounted millions out of work and caused the jobless rate to spike above 6% earlier this year.
The government is likely to focus on getting those people back into work and ensuring jobs for the millions of people who will join the workforce this year. Nevertheless, Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) Ltd’s Larry Hu in Hong Kong expects the jobless rate to peak at around 10%, and the increase in urban jobs to be about half the level of last year.
Monetary Policy
The general “prudent, flexible and appropriate” stance of monetary policy isn’t likely to change, but investors should look for any shifts in the wording on monetary stimulus in the report, which should flesh out the People’s Bank of China’s promise earlier this month to use “more powerful” policies.
PBOC Vows Stronger Pro-Growth Policy But Leaves Details Vague
The government could target faster credit growth in 2020 than last year and may promise to keep it expanding slightly faster than nominal GDP growth. It will also likely drop the promise to “avoid excess liquidity flooding the economy.” That phrase was cut from the PBOC’s regular report earlier this month and its removal indicates there will be less control on the expansion of lending and debt.
In the past, the work report has set explicit goals for bank lending or forecast detailed monetary policy actions such as cutting banks’ required reserve ratios and interest rates. Any indication of a reduction in the benchmark deposit rate would also be an important signal of stimulus.
Fiscal Policy
Three numbers will set the tone of fiscal stimulus in 2020: the official budget deficit ratio, the amount of local government special bonds and the amount of sovereign special bonds. Combined, these determine the real size of China’s spending deficit.
Economists expect the government to drop the long-held deficit limit of 3% of GDP for the first time in at least a decade, but anything below 3.5% will disappoint expectations for a substantial increase in spending.

Special bonds sold by local governments will indicate how much more infrastructure spending there will be this year. The quota for those bonds is estimated to be between 3 to 4 trillion yuan ($420-$560 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan last year.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“China stands out among emerging markets as one of the few that’s able to finance significant deficit spending. Others, hamstrung by dependence on foreign borrowing, have limited space to act.”
Tom Orlik & Scott Johnson, economists

The central government could also sell as much as 2 trillion yuan in sovereign debt for anti-virus spending, but when considering the stimulus effect investors should look closely at not only the size but also the purpose of the debt. The economic effect will be much larger if the money is borrowed to pay for infrastructure projects rather than general spending.
Poverty Alleviation
The government’s long-term goal of ending absolute poverty will be center stage this week.
That’s partly because it was meant to be achieved this year, and also because the virus made the other target of doubling incomes by this year from 2010’s level less likely. In the months since the outbreak President Xi Jinping has repeatedly expressed his resolution to accomplish the poverty mission on time.
That involves billions of yuan in investment in relocating rural villagers, building homes, infrastructure and schools. The program involves spending by all levels of government as well as bank loans. There’s usually no overall number that includes all the spending, but any concrete amount in the work report is worth noting.

34,"<span>May 20, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Lee Jong-chul, a 57-year-old truck driver who lives just south of Seoul, says it took little more than a minute to access his 400,000 won ($330) cash handout from the South Korean government earlier this month.
For 2.8 million Korean households it didn’t take any time at all: the money was automatically wired to their bank accounts without even an application.
In nearby Japan, hundreds of Tokyo residents trying to process their claims for 100,000 yen ($930) handouts had to line up for hours outside a government office in Setagaya. Many of them were queuing because there was no other way to get their passwords reset for online applications they were supposed to complete at home.
Like many people in Japan, 41-year-old hairdresser Emiko Sato, has reached the conclusion that it’s less hassle simply to wait for the paperwork to arrive by snail mail.
“It’s really dawned on me how outdated government policy and administration is in Japan,” said Sato, by phone from Saitama, north of Tokyo, where she lives as a single mother with two small children.
The contrasting speed and efficiency of distributing virus relief to people in need in Japan and South Korea come despite a remarkably similar trajectory in putting together the funding for the handouts in the two Northeast Asia rivals. That difference reveals a nimbler and more tech-savvy administrative infrastructure in Korea more suited to swift action than the lengthy paper-centric approach of Japan.
It took Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan and President Moon Jae-in in Korea about a month each to get their extra budgets approved on the same day: April 30. During that time, both leaders buckled to the populist idea of giving handouts to everyone rather than those most in need.
Japan Scrambles to Get $930 to All Who Apply as Virus Spreads
In both countries, some local communities acted faster than the central government to dole out cash.
The similarities appear to end there.
In South Korea, 80% of households had received handouts as of May 19, according to a daily tally by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The government runs a dedicated website on the program, offering quick search links that show how much families can receive, and ways to apply -- either online, via websites or credit card apps, or in person at banks or municipal offices.
“I’m really happy we’re getting this cash, because we’re all going to go bankrupt otherwise,” said Lee. The Korean trucker has worked only twice in the past month, driving his 15-ton dumpster to transport sand and stones to construction sites.
South Korea’s centralized administrative capability and a national identification system are key factors behind its speedy delivery of the handouts. The identification number enables the government to access personal records, saving South Koreans from the heavy paperwork required in Japan to verify basic information such as place of residence.
Smartphones are also playing a prominent role for South Korea, which has one of the fastest broadband and wireless networks in the world and is home to technology giants like Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co.
Each time Lee uses his credit card, his mobile app pings him an update of how much of the cash handout remains. To encourage him to spend the cash instead of saving it, the app also reminds him he has a three-month deadline to use it or lose it.
Waiting Game
In Japan, people want to know when they’ll get the money in the first place.
As of May 19, 72% of Japan’s municipalities had started mailing out application forms but only 19% had started to actually deposit money into bank accounts from postal claims, according to the internal affairs ministry. Around a third of local governments had started distributing handouts in response to online claims as of May 14, the ministry said.
The mail-based approach is dominating largely because only 16% of Japan’s 127 million population have obtained a card and PIN code to go with their national identification number needed for online applications.
Obtaining the card itself takes about a month, and if you get the PIN number wrong multiple times, you get locked out of the process and have to physically go to a government office to unlock it.
Nami Kobayashi, a 39-year-old freelancer who runs a flower shop and music school in Osaka, personally told Abe how strained her budget was after the government invited her to attend a hearing with him and other cabinet ministers and 10 freelancers in March.
Even she is still waiting for financial help from the government.
Kobayashi tried to apply for the 100,000 yen online, but the system crashed due to heavy traffic and she is now waiting for an application form in the mail.
“Nothing has come my way and I’m almost giving up. It’s like, whatever,” she said.

The rand’s comeback seems to be gathering momentum.
The South African currency advanced a third day on Wednesday to its strongest level in five weeks, breaching two key resistance levels that stood between it and further gains.
The dollar-rand cross busted below its 50-day moving average of 18.1507 for the first time this year. It also breached the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement from April’s record-weak level at 18.044, which could set up a move to the 38.2% retracement line at 17.235.
With no local news to drive the market, traders are looking to Thursday’s South African Reserve Bank interest rate decision. Expectations are for the monetary policy committee to cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time this year as it seeks to support an economy that could contract as much as 16.1%.
“I suppose one would say no news is good news” for the rand, said Cristian Maggio, the head of emerging-market research at TD Securities in London. “There hasn’t been any major announcement or event in a while and the market may have come to a conclusion that the rand is undervalued relative to other EM currencies.”
The rand, Wednesday’s best emerging-market performer, advanced as much as 2% to 17.9743 per dollar by 1:22 p.m. in Johannesburg. That pared the currency’s decline this year to 22%, still the second-worst performance after Brazil’s real.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey secured a tripling of its currency-swap agreement with Qatar to $15 billion, the central bank said on Wednesday, providing some much-needed foreign funding to reinforce its depleted reserves and help steady the Turkish lira. 
Ankara had been urgently seeking access to funds from Doha and elsewhere to head off a potential currency spiral, and analysts say tens of billions of dollars might be needed. A senior Turkish official told Reuters talks are continuing. 
Turkey's central bank said the deal with its Qatari counterpart - which raised the existing FX limit from the equivalent of $5 billion - would support financial stability and trade. 
The lira touched a historic low earlier this month as investors fretted over a drop in the central bank's net FX reserves and the country's relatively high foreign debt obligations, accelerating Ankara's overseas funding search.
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xegvbkygzpq/index.html)
Reuters reported last week that officials from Turkey's Treasury and central bank had appealed to counterparts in Qatar and China about expanding existing swap lines, and to the United Kingdom and Japan about possibly establishing them.
Turkey has a roughly $1.7 billion swap facility with Beijing. 
""Talks on swaps are continuing and especially some are in a very positive situation. We expect positive results from them soon as well,"" the senior Turkish official said before the central bank's announcement. 
The official, who requested anonymity, characterized some of the conversations as ongoing and others as on hold. 
The lira  has rallied over the last eight trading days on expectations of new funding that would stem earlier selling in the lira that some analysts said risked escalating as in 2018, when Turkey's currency crisis shook emerging markets. 
It was down 0.2% to 6.795 versus the dollar at 0822 GMT on Wednesday. 
The Turkish central bank said the amendment of the limit on the 2018 swap agreement with Qatar's central bank aimed to ""facilitate bilateral trade"" in local currencies and ""support financial stability of the two countries"". 
Under the facility, the central bank in Doha would accept Turkish lira in exchange for Qatari riyals. 
Turkey has moved on from its preferred source of dollar funding, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which appears unlikely to extend a swap line based on comments from current and former Fed officials. 
Tatha Ghose, analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said the lira rallied on speculation about deals with Tokyo and London, but added that swaps are a ""secondary story"" to prospects of a rebound in Turkish exports now that European economies are re-opening from coronavirus-related lockdowns. 
Stronger export numbers would ""dispel the lira's current woes, although many problems will remain in the longer-term,"" he wrote in a client note. 

Net FX reserves at the central bank have fallen to $26 billion from $40 billion this year, in part due to state bank FX interventions to help stabilize the lira, analysts say. Turkey's 12-month foreign debt obligations are $168 billion.
 
"
37,"<span>May 20, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank tripled the limit on an existing swap agreement with Qatar’s monetary authority to $15 billion.
“The core objectives of the agreement are to facilitate bilateral trade in respective local currencies and to support the financial stability of the two countries,” Turkey’s central bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
Turkish policy makers have been in talks to sign currency-swap arrangements with central banks of Group of 20 nations after the central bank ran down its foreign-currency buffer to prop up the lira.
Authorities have been leaning on state lenders to flood the market with dollars, and finding a source of foreign exchange has become increasingly urgent with gross central bank reserves down $17 billion since the beginning of the year to $89.2 billion.
The lira erased losses following the news and was trading little changed at 6.7800 per dollar at 9:20 a.m. in Istanbul.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher in early European trade Wednesday amid doubts over a potential vaccine for the Covid-19 virus, but it’s been the euro which has shone the brightest as the Franco-German proposal for a common EU recovery fund gains traction. 
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.457, up 0.1%. 
Late Tuesday, a report from medical news website STAT cast doubt over encouraging early results from a  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine trial, stating the U.S. drug maker had provided insufficient data to determine the vaccine’s efficacy.
Investors turned to the safe-haven dollar after the report deflated hopes of a potential cure for the virus.
However, the dollar hasn’t been able to make any gains against the euro, with the single currency still basking in the glow of the joint proposal by France and Germany of a European recovery fund.
This fund, totalling 500 billion euro ($545 billion), would be distributed to EU countries worst affected by Covid-19, with the monies provided as grants rather than loans.
""The Franco-German agreement is big news. This has made it difficult for speculators to close their short positions on the currency,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), in a Reuters report.
The proposal will undoubtedly face opposition from some of the wealthier EU members, but is being seen as a significant step toward a stronger common fiscal policy, complementing the euro’s monetary foundations.
At 3 AM, EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.0945, having earlier hit a two-week peak of $1.0975.
Sterling remains under pressure after U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned the country faced a “severe recession, the likes of which we haven't seen.”
Adding to the pessimism surrounding the economic woe have been fraught negotiations with the EU over a potential trade deal.
“We continue to think that the negotiations will get worse before they get better (including that we do not expect an extension of the current transition period ending by the end of this year), which is the main reason why we are still looking for more GBP weakness in coming months,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note to clients.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is due to speak at 9:30 AM ET, amid strong speculation that the Bank will cut its key interest rate below zero at its next policy meeting.
At 3 AM ET, GBP/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2243.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 107.75, after the country’s Tankan survey showed that Japanese business confidence hit decade lows in May.
USD/CNY was up 0.1% to 7.1040, after China's central bank announced earlier in the day that it would not change its loan prime rates, in line with investor expectations. Meanwhile, the Russian ruble hit a two-month high against the dollar as oil prices recovered further.

Investing.com – The dollar rose on Wednesday morning in Asia after a report casted doubt on a potential vaccine for the COVID-19 virus.
Medical news website STAT released a report on Tuesday casting doubt on  Moderna  's (NASDAQ:MRNA) annoucement on Monday that its potential vaccine was generating an immune response in all 45 patients in its phase one trial.
The report said that the U.S. drug maker had provided insufficient data to determine the vaccine’s efficacy.

The level of expected increase in supply this year -- about $2.1 trillion -- is offsetting the $1.9 trillion demand for bonds to the tune of $200 billion, the JPMorgan team concluded, implying upward pressure on yields. Goldman Sachs strategists last week said more issuance adds to the case for higher rates and steeper curves.
Policy makers have endeavored to force down yields in sovereign markets as governments spend trillions to help soften the blow from the coronavirus pandemic that’s caused economies to almost totally shutdown. A debate about the subsequent recovery and any ensuing reduction in help from central banks is forcing some to conclude yields have hit their lows.
Quantitative easing “might need to be upsized from here to prevent a rise in bond yields, especially if there is further fiscal stimulus or if our projections for private sector bond demand prove optimistic,” the JPMorgan group, including strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a May 19 report.

Despite the huge surge in demand for bonds from central banks, JPMorgan expects that appetite to wane during this year for commercial banks, pensions funds and insurance companies, and foreign-exchange reserve managers.
The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will ensure demand expands by $4.2 trillion in 2020, though commercial lenders will see demand drop to the tune of $1 trillion, according to the report.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro held firm on Wednesday, basking in the afterglow of a Franco-German proposal for a common fund that could move Europe closer to fiscal union.
The dollar also edged higher against the safe-haven yen to edge near a five-week high though it was capped by renewed scepticism on coronavirus vaccine developments.
The euro stood flat at $1.0924 (EUR=), having hit a two-week peak of $1.09755 in European trade. 
The common currency also fetched 1.0615 franc (EURCHF=), after rising almost 1.0% so far in the week against the safe haven currency while against the yen, it stood near five-week highs of 118.20 yen (EURJPY=).
""The Franco-German agreement is big news. This has made it difficult for speculators to close their short positions on the currency,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
France and Germany proposed on Monday a 500 billion euro ($543 billion) Recovery Fund to offer grants to regions and sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and to allow borrowing by the European Commission on behalf of the whole EU.
The proposals, while facing opposition from wealthier EU members, could move the European Union a step closer to a transfer union that would help mitigate various economic imbalances in the currency bloc.
Also helping the common currency was a survey showing German investor sentiment improved much more than expected in May as concerns eased over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Europe's largest economy.
The U.S. dollar tacked on 0.2% against the yen to 107.94 yen, near a five-week high of 108.085 hit in U.S. trade on Tuesday.
The U.S. currency lost traction on Tuesday after a report from medical news website STAT said early data from  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine was insufficient, pouring cold water on optimism sparked a day earlier by the company's announcement.
Data showed U.S. homebuilding dropped by the most on record last month and permits for future construction tumbled, a stark reminder of the heavy economic toll exacted by the outbreak. 
The dollar index (=USD) stood at 99.571, essentially stuck in its well-worn range since early April.

42,"<span>May 19, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- After lagging other Asian currencies for most of the year, Thailand’s baht has staged a sharp rebound to outperform its peers.
The baht has rallied almost 1.5% in May after dropping over 7% in the first four months of 2020. The catalyst? Traders are betting Thailand’s tourism-dependent economy will recover swiftly from the virus-induced slump as economies begin to reopen.
“The sooner availability of a vaccine will mean a quicker recovery in industries such as retail and tourism, and as such currencies relying more on these sectors may respond more,” said Frances Cheung, Singapore-based head of Asia macro strategy at  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp.
Yanxi Tan, a foreign exchange strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. expects the baht to rise to 31.7 per dollar by year-end as the pandemic dissipates. The currency rallied as much as 0.5% to 31.872 per dollar Tuesday, with sentiment bolstered by signs of progress in developing a vaccine against the virus.
Still, the baht’s rebound may be curtailed after the government warned the economy could contract as much as 6% this year due to the outbreak. The central bank is expected to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.50% at a review Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Analysts say a relaxation of curbs will boost confidence. Thailand has allowed shopping malls to resume business as part of a phased rollback of its lockdown, even as it remains in a state of emergency through May.
“Thailand has done well to contain the coronavirus outbreak, with the country gradually reopening businesses and easing restrictions,” says Chang Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “This has given investors confidence that tourism could recover over time, in turn supporting the baht.”

43,"<span>May 19, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s sovereign bond market is re-emerging as an attractive proposition for Japan’s yield-hungry investors.
A combination of superior yields and currency-hedging costs at a 17-year low is boosting the appeal of Aussie debt over Treasuries for Japanese funds, just when they are looking at ways to secure returns amid the virus-induced market turmoil. They have contributed to the record demand seen at Australia’s recent auctions.
“We view Australian sovereign bonds quite constructively and have started buying, including at last week’s sale,” said Akira Takei, a Tokyo-based global fixed-income money manager at Asset Management One Co. “Australia’s yield curve is outstandingly steep among developed nations, which makes the bonds attractive.”
The revival in demand from the typically long-term Japan funds comes as Australia vies for global investors to help fund the record stimulus measures taken to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic. Japanese investors last year turned net sellers of Aussie debt for the first time since 2013 amid risks related to the U.S.-China trade war.
However, latest figures from Japan’s Ministry of Finance show they bought a net 107.9 billion yen ($1 billion) of long-term Aussie debt in March, the biggest purchase since June 2019.
With Australia’s 10-year yield edging back up toward 1%, Japanese money flowing into the securities looks set to increase.
‘Stands Out’
The cost for yen investors to hedge their exposure to the Australian dollar sank to the lowest since 2003 this month. Ten-year Aussie bonds now offer Japanese funds a currency-hedged yield of about 48 basis points, versus 15 basis points on similar-maturity U.S. notes.
Australia last week sold A$19 billion ($12.4 billion) in new 10-year sovereign debt, a second record-breaking sale in as many months. At A$53.5 billion, bids received were also an all-time high.
“It’s easier for Japanese investors to buy at auctions as the cost is low at the time of the debt’s issuance,” said Eiichiro Miura, general manager of the fixed-income department at Nissay Asset Management Corp. in Tokyo. “The yield levels on Aussie bonds in tenors 10-year and longer are incomparably high.”
The support being lent to Aussie bonds by the Reserve Bank of Australia’s massive quantitative easing program is also encouraging investors to buy the debt.
“The huge number of bids at the Australian debt sale shows that debt monetization as a concept is accepted by investors, which means they will buy in positive-yielding markets before they turn negative,” said Asset Management’s Takei. “Investors can’t’ go wrong betting long in countries where the curve is steep. In that regard, Australia stands out.”

44,"<span>May 19, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- American financial conditions have loosened at the fastest pace since at least 1990, belying mounting investor skepticism that a V-shaped economic recovery will follow the pandemic-induced crash.
A Bloomberg measure of market health across bond, stock and liquidity indexes has staged a revival like never before -- bouncing back to early March levels, when recorded coronavirus cases globally were around 90,000 versus more than 4.8 million today.
All told, this gauge of animal spirits has improved from the nadir by 5.4 standard deviations in just 37 trading days, a feat that took 50 days back in 2008.
Explaining why investors are getting their mojo back is the easy part. Thank historic policy stimulus, indications that the collapse in the investment and consumption cycle has bottomed, as well as the global race for an experimental vaccine.
But figuring out whether the everything-rally -- from stocks and Libor to credit spreads -- is sustainable is the hard part. With 68% of money managers in a Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). survey saying a bear-market rally is underway, sentiment remains febrile.
“The market is clearly pricing in chances of a vaccine or effective treatment,” said Vasileios Gkionakis, head currency strategist at Banque Lombard Odier & Cie. “A strong second wave of the virus, with new rounds of lockdowns, would change all this.”
While data like Germany’s ZEW survey of investor expectations flash hope, quantitative investors warn reopening economies could trigger fresh waves of virus cases and renewed market volatility.
A key component of market stress, the VIX index, has underperformed the other eight elements of the measure. The so-called fear gauge of S&P 500 volatility currently has a reading of about 29, well above the 20 average of the pre-2008 era, or 1.3 more in standard deviation terms.
Global coronavirus deaths ticked down to 3,154 on Monday, similar to levels seen during the last week of March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That gives hope to investors, who know that while new daily infections have hovered near the 90,000 level for about six weeks, that reading is somewhat inflated by increased testing.

Investing.com – The euro pared most of its gains against the dollar on Tuesday, despite cautious optimism over the coronavirus relief package, which experts say could deliver a boost to the single currency. 
EUR/USD rose 0.14% to $1.0928, after easing from session highs of $1.0976.
France and Germany on Monday proposed a $500 billion coronavirus relief program to support an economic recovery in the EU. The stimulus proposal would be raised through bonds and is based on grants rather loans.
""EUR/USD is now looking to run the key 1.1000 level after the Germans and the French put forth a proposal for 500 billion euro rescue package that was based on grants rather than loans,"" BK Asset Management said.
If the Franco-German proposal is backed by members states, the European Commission would raise the funds through the public markets. The proposal is expected to discussed by EU ﬁnance ministers at their meeting on Wednesday, though the ofﬁcial decision-making process on both the EU budget and the recovery fund will only start with the release of the European Commission proposal expected next week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.

Speaking some two weeks before the ECB’s next policy meeting, Lane stressed the importance of monetary support reaching all 19 members of the euro area as they try to rein in the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
“We continuously examine each of our measures to assess whether these are still adequately calibrated and appropriately sized to provide the necessary degree of accommodation in this uncertain economic environment,” he told a webinar on Tuesday. “Accordingly, we are fully prepared to further adjust our instruments if warranted.”
Policy makers have been sending strong signals that the ECB will increase the size of its 750 billion euro ($821 billion) emergency bond-buying plan, potentially as early as next month, to support the region during its worst postwar economic crisis.
Since the program’s start in late March, the ECB has focused purchases on countries including Italy to avoid a situation where rising yields cancel out stimulative effects of loose monetary policy for all euro countries.
Lane said the embedded flexibility allows for “fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions,” calling them “a crucial element in fostering its effective market stabilization function.”
While ECB buying has prevented severe disruptions in European bond markets, the economy still suffered badly from restrictions imposed to contain the virus. Output shrank nearly 4% in the first quarter and is set to decline significantly more in the current period.
ECB staff are working on a new round of forecasts that will be presented to the Governing Council at their June 4 meeting. The ECB is working under the assumption that the economy will hit the bottom in the second quarter, Lane said.
After increased calls on governments in recent weeks, the ECB’s efforts are finally set to get some fiscal backing. Germany and France laid out a plan on Monday that would see the European Union collectively finance its response to the virus-induced recession.
While lauded by ECB President Christine Lagarde as ambitious and welcome, the proposal for a 500 billion-euro recovery fund could still be doomed by opposition from countries including Austria and the Netherlands.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar drifted lower in early European trade Tuesday, continuing the sharp losses seen overnight as signs of progress in the search for a Covid-19 vaccine sparked growing risk appetite. 
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.438, down 0.2%, well off Monday’s three-week high. USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 1.0738.
U.S. drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said late Monday that clinical results suggested its vaccine has a ""high probability"" to provide protection from coronavirus disease.
The positive update bolstered hopes that a vaccine may be found sooner rather than later, prompting investors to dump the safe haven dollar for currencies which may offer greater reward.
“There has been a big improvement in risk sentiment because of hopes for a vaccine,” said Junichi Ishikwa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities, told CNBC.
“Volatility is falling for stocks and dollar-funding costs are lower. It’s easy for the dollar to fall and for other currencies to ride the dollar’s losses higher.” 
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to update government officials on the economic stimulus programs approved so far.
The thorny issue of negative interest rates could be raised, and Powell is expected to repeat that a negative policy rate is not on the cards right now.
Also of note was the news late Monday that France and Germany are proposing a 500 billion euro ($545 billion) European recovery fund to be distributed to EU countries worst affected by Covid-19, with the funds provided as grants rather than loans.
This marks a shift in position by Germany, who had previously rejected the idea of nations sharing debt.
Other EU countries must agree with the proposal, however, and the idea of shared debt has proved an extremely difficult hurdle to pass in the past.
Still, EUR/USD climbed 0.2% to 1.0936, reaching levels last seen at the start of this month.
While the U.S. central bank members are doing their best to rule out the possibility of negative interest rates, their U.K. equivalents are doing exactly the opposite. 
Over the weekend the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said the central bank was looking more urgently at negative interest rates, while rate-setter Silvana Tenreyro Monday talked up the benefits of such rates, citing the experience of other countries in Europe. 
This comes as the number of Britons seeking jobless benefits soared by 856,500 to more than 2 million in April, the most on record.

Despite billions spent by the Swiss National Bank to curb the franc’s advance, traders pushing the currency toward parity with the euro might have their way.
With the global economy in recession and the euro area risking a new debt crisis, the currency -- a popular haven -- has already risen more than 2% against the euro this year. Options data suggest the pair may soon be on equal footing for the first time since 2015.
“There’s only really one thing that will change that story around and that would be harmony in the euro zone,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank in London, referring to the franc’s advance. “And we’re far from having a harmonious situation.”
The central bank has struggled to tame the currency for years, with the institution injecting over 440 billion francs ($454 billion) into the foreign-exchange market since 2009. And yet the currency rose about 30% in a decade, fueled by recurring anxiety over global growth and a euro-area breakup.
Fears of how badly the coronavirus will hurt economies worldwide are just the latest in a long list of reasons why demand for the franc is high. The franc is a haven because neutral Switzerland, with its banks, rule of law and political stability, has for decades been considered the one of the safest places for the world’s rich to park their money.
It emerged from the global financial crisis much less bruised than many of its neighbors, with little government debt and low unemployment.
Round Numbers
There’s been market speculation that officials have their eyes on a new exchange-rate target that they’ll defend to the hilt. Some investors are focused on 1.05 per euro, after previous thresholds such as 1.12 and 1.08 were taken out. Strategists warn these triggers are largely fictional, meaning the race toward parity could come faster than anticipated.
“Markets like nothing more than talking about round numbers, so much so that they can become self reinforcing,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of G-10 currency research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. “Does the SNB really care explicitly about the number? Probably not.”
If the franc breaks through 1.05 per euro, it could “easily” head toward 1.02 per euro, according to Stretch. So far this year the franc has outperformed all Group-of-10 peers against the dollar save the Japanese yen, a fellow haven.
What Does SNB Care About?
The SNB says it doesn’t target levels and instead takes the currency situation broadly into account.
Switzerland’s desire to control the franc stems from its small, export-reliant economy and its outsized financial center. The euro area is the biggest destination for Swiss exports, including parts for the German automobile sector.
Simply handing the franc over to the vicissitudes of the market would send it soaring, making Swiss goods abroad more expensive, and potentially causing manufacturers to lose orders and banks to see profitability evaporate.
Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) AG Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek has been one of the most prominent advocates of a weaker currency. So too have left-of-center politicians, who fear companies whose margins have dried up due to the rallying currency will fire staff to compensate.
Another consideration is what a stronger franc means for inflation. While cheaper imports are a boon for shoppers, they’re a headache for policy makers whose mandate is to keep the rate of inflation positive but under 2%. Consumer prices have dropped for the past three months on a year-on-year basis.
“As long as you don’t have a 5% or 10% move in the franc in a matter of weeks or months, a small 1% move here or there doesn’t impact inflation,” said Viraj Patel, a currency and macro strategist at Arkera Inc.
Rhetoric Has Changed
In a country whose financial sector prizes discretion, SNB President Thomas Jordan and his colleagues provide few details about what they’ve been up to in the foreign-exchange market. Weekly data hint at the scope of activity, but the only hard evidence is the annual report’s tally of money spent on interventions.
But rather than stem the advance in the franc altogether, it seems the SNB’s approach has shifted. While it used to say the currency would weaken over time, that turn of phrase was abandoned several years ago.
“Their modus operandi is now one of damage limitation -- slowing the appreciation of the franc rather than putting a fork in the road,” said Kamal Sharma, director of G-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
That’s a comfort for investors who, in 2015, saw the franc jump to parity with the euro in a matter of minutes after the SNB scrapped its cap on the currency. Brokers as far away as New Zealand went out of business as their clients racked up hundreds of millions worth of losses.
Investors have been on high alert for another jolt ever since.
Trigger Points
As the region grapples with the fallout from the pandemic, banks are assessing the triggers that could send the franc roaring against the common currency.
It could rally if the ECB’s quantitative-easing program looks in danger of being derailed because of a landmark German court ruling earlier this month that questioned its legality. If that comes to pass, strains on the finances of highly indebted nations such as Italy could worsen, and the euro’s decline may accelerate.
At the start of the year, investors were bearish about the euro’s prospects against the franc, but that’s accelerated significantly since the coronavirus spread across the globe. Demand, meanwhile, is growing for insurance against further swings in the franc against the dollar.
The isn’t much the SNB can do about the currency’s “direction until the ECB starts tightening and that is light years away,” said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA in London. “All it might take is a second wave of Covid-19 after the summer and we could be drifting closer to parity with the euro by year end.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses against major currencies on Tuesday after encouraging data from the trial of a vaccine for COVID-19 reduced safe-haven demand for the greenback.
The euro held onto hefty gains against the Swiss franc and the dollar following a proposal by France and Germany for a 500 billion euro ($543 billion) recovery fund offering grants to regions hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis.
Currencies linked to commodities and other riskier assets were broadly supported thanks also to a sharp rebound in oil prices as investors' focus turned to recovery from the pandemic.
""There has been a big improvement in risk sentiment because of hopes for a vaccine,"" said Junichi Ishikwa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Volatility is falling for stocks and dollar-funding costs are lower. It's easy for the dollar to fall and for other currencies to ride the dollar's losses higher."" 
Wall Street shares, emerging market assets, and commodities all rallied after encouraging data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial by U.S. drugmaker  Moderna  (O:MRNA) added to the optimism as more governments scale back lockdown restrictions.
The euro (EUR=EBS) bought $1.0917 in Asia on Tuesday, having gained 0.9% against the greenback in the previous session.
The common currency (EURCHF=EBS) traded at 1.0607 Swiss franc after jumping on Monday to the highest in more than two months.
The euro's rally overnight came after France and Germany proposed that the European Commission borrow money on behalf of the whole EU for the recovery fund. The news also sent Italian government bond yields skidding to their lowest in more than a month.
The proposed fund is mostly expected to benefit Italy and Spain, whose economies have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic but have weak public finances.
The euro's sudden rise will face a test later on Tuesday with the release of the closely-watched ZEW survey on German investor sentiment.
The pound  also benefited from the dollar's losses and rose to $1.2215.
The dollar  was little changed at 107.43 yen. 
While coronavirus infection rates in many places have now fallen to levels low enough to allow factories and businesses to re-open, some concern remains because the outbreak is not completely under control.
The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 illness, first emerged in China late last year and has paralysed global economic activity as it spread across the world.
Elsewhere, the antipodean currencies stood tall against their U.S. counterpart, benefiting from the improvement in risk appetite and rising commodity prices.
The Australian dollar  rose 0.25% to $0.6540.
The Reserve Bank of Australia will release minutes from its most recent monetary policy meeting later on Tuesday, which may help investors determine the chance of further monetary easing.

The New Zealand dollar  rose 0.26% to $0.6055 after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand told Reuters the central bank will re-evaluate its monetary easing in about three months to determine whether ""to do more or take the foot off the pedal a little bit.""

The Australian dollar’s turnaround signals the start of a recovery that may see it rally to 70 U.S. cents by year-end, according to Insight Investment.
An early start to rebooting the economy and a rebound in commodities will support the Aussie, says Adam Kibble, investment specialist at Insight. The currency is also likely to gain against the euro as the common bloc struggles to contain the economic fallout from the virus outbreak, he added.
“Exiting the virus earlier, compared to Europe and the U.S., will be very positive for the Aussie,” said Kibble. “The ability of Europe to respond to the economic consequences of the virus is fairly limited.”
The Aussie has climbed about 17% after sliding to the lowest since 2002 in March and its recovery is closely watched as a test case for other currencies that have been battered by the pandemic. The nation aims to restart its economy by July under a three-part plan that puts it ahead of developed markets.
Australia is set to recoup about 60% of monthly gross domestic product at the final stage of the government’s plan to fully relax restrictions, according to Bloomberg Economics. In contrast, the Federal Reserve has warned that the U.S.’s recovery could stretch until the end of next year.
Still, a record slump in Australia’s employment in April serves as a warning that the Aussie’s recovery may fizzle out. The central bank predicts the economy will contract 10% from peak-to-trough this year.
The Aussie has rallied about 5% this quarter to outperform its major peers. It rose 0.4% to 0.6440 per dollar as at 7.47 p.m. in Sydney on Monday.
China Boost
The Aussie will also get a lift as China’s economy reopens and demand for commodities gains momentum, according to Kibble, whose firm oversees 681.2 billion pounds ($825 billion).
Australia’s biggest trading partner is “further down the recovery path and has started to see some degree of normalization in the economic activity,” Kibble wrote in a report. “All of this suggests that, while the current crisis is likely to have long-term repercussions, Australia is better equipped than most to deal with the economic fallout.”
The Australian government has unveiled one of the “most aggressive” policy responses among Group-of-10 peers with an A$130 billion ($83.7 billion) rescue plan, and any sell-off may be an opportunity to buy, Kibble said.
“We see them as opportunities to raise hedging levels or reduce foreign currency exposure,” he said.

51,"<span>May 18, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said she’ll continue with the institution’s bond-buying programs despite Germany’s top court questioning the legality of one of them.
“I am not at all worried, not about the program linked to the pandemic, and not about the previous program, under which the Eurosystem has been purchasing bonds since 2015,” she said in an interview with multiple European newspapers published Monday. “We remain undeterred in delivering on our price stability objective.”
Germany’s constitutional court ruled this month that the 2015 asset purchase program, which has bought 2.7 trillion euros ($3 trillion) of debt and is still running, might not be proportionate to the risk of adverse side effects and so might be illegal. It gave the ECB three months to justify the policy or the Bundesbank -- which accounts for about a quarter of purchases -- will have to drop out.
Lagarde signaled the ECB is ready to defy that prospect.
“All national central banks should fully participate in the determination and implementation of monetary policy in the euro area,” she said. “Each national central bank in the euro area is independent and cannot take instructions from governments. This is laid down in the Treaty.”
The ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program was announced in March and is scheduled to buy 750 billion euros of debt this year, with fewer restrictions than the older program. Most economists predict it will will have to be expanded -- perhaps as soon as the next policy meeting on June 4.
The president declined to be drawn on how likely that is.
“We have been very clear and we continue to be very clear -- we will not hesitate to adjust the size, duration and composition of the PEPP to the extent necessary,” she said. “There is no psychological obstacle to our action.”

Invesing.com – The euro held the bulk of its gains against the dollar on Monday as France and Germany proposed a $500 billion coronavirus relief program to support an economic recovery in the EU.
EUR/USD jumped rose 0.98% to $1.0915, just shy of its session high of $1.0921.
The funds to support the proposed stimulus programe would be raised by the European Commission through bonds.  
The move marked a major step forward toward the creation of coronavirus bond program, or coronabonds, though both France and Germany conceded that work was still needed to still needed ""to bring together all the member states.""
Several member states, including the Netherlands and Denmark, have previously expressed resistance against the coronabonds on fears that payment of the debt would be not evenly distributed.
The update comes amid investor hopes for the further European Central Bank stimulus following the central bank's recent efforts to shore up the economy.
""We've seen further effective policy easing across Europe over recent days with the ECB stepping up the pace of its PEPP bond purchases, Italy announcing it has finally agreed a €55bn package of fiscal measures and in the UK the Chancellor extending the job retention scheme,"" Nomura said.  ""And there's more to come - we continue to wait for a European recovery fund, and see both the ECB and BoE announcing more asset purchases in June."""

The bank’s foreign-exchange prime-brokerage unit, which caters to hedge funds and other institutions, has stopped offering customers new Turkish lira trades, the people said, who asked not be named as the details aren’t public. Paris-based BNP Paribas will only process trades that maintain or reduce clients’ positions, one of the people said.
Earlier this month, as the lira tumbled to a record low, Turkey’s banking regulator banned local lenders from trading the currency with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) and BNP Paribas, a decision that was reversed within days. The lenders face an investigation to determine whether they manipulated the currency, the regulator said May 10, before the trading restriction was lifted.
Murray Parker, a spokesman for BNP Paribas in London, declined to comment. Edwina Frawley-Gangahar, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, and Hana Dunn at UBS both declined to comment.
BNP Paribas is one of the biggest financial intermediaries for the lira and has a stake in Turkish lender Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS. Its decision to retreat from the Turkish currency market underscores how fragile relations between investors and authorities have become amid the latest market rout, which authorities blamed speculators abroad for orchestrating.
It also shows how difficult it has become for foreigners to trade the lira.
In a bid to stand in the way of short sellers, the banking regulator has choked off foreign investors’ access to liquidity. But the approach has only exacerbated capital outflows, bifurcated the market and widened bid-ask spreads, giving way to erratic price swings.
Highlighting the lack of liquidity in the lira market, the overnight implied yield on the currency -- the cost that foreign investors bare to fund lira positions -- spiked to over 25% earlier in May. That compares with the central bank’s weighted-cost of funding of just over 8%.
BNP Paribas’ decision could also ripple across other corners of the market, forcing smaller brokerages to unwind their operations in the cross. Last week, Clearstream Banking and Euroclear Bank jointly decided to suspend Turkish lira transactions over a shared platform, while earlier this month, Turkey’s largest currency brokerages said they are no longer executing new lira trades for leveraged retail clients.
The currency fell to an all-time low of 7.2690 per dollar on May 7. It has since recovered ground, touching a session high of 6.8143 earlier on Monday.
According to the latest central bank data and Bloomberg calculations, foreign accounts on average made up 32% of all Turkish lira spot, forward and swap transactions with Turkish banks over the 30 trading days through May 5, a record low. That’s down from a high of 65% in February 2018.

54,"<span>May 18, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England would have to examine certain aspects of negative rates when it comes to protecting the financial system but it’s also not ruling them out, according to policy maker Silvana Tenreyro.
Looking at Europe’s experience with negative rates, they “have had a positive effect in the sense of having a fairly powerful transmission to real activity,” Tenreyro said Monday. “There are some considerations that are more specific to the U.K. and will need to be worked out including the effect on some financial institutions, implementation, communication and so on.”
The European Central Bank and others have already cut rates below zero. The debate about the effectiveness of such a policy has gathered pace amid market speculation the Federal Reserve and BOE may have to follow suit to ramp up their response to the pandemic.
“For now, everything is on the table for us,” she said on an online seminar hosted by the London School of Economics.
Investors are now betting the U.K. will take borrowing costs below zero in December. Before Tenreyro’s comments, they saw such a move in February.
The idea seems to be gaining traction inside the U.K. central bank, at least as a longer-term option. Tenreyro’s comments follow those of the central bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane, who said in an interview published over the weekend that negative interest rates are something officials need to be looking at.
Still, there has also been some mixed messaging. Governor Andrew Bailey said last week that while negative rates weren’t being contemplated at the moment, it’s important not to rule anything out forever.
The benchmark rate now stands at 0.1%, and taking it negative could prove difficult for banks, he said, and potentially make it difficult to influence borrowing costs across the economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are gradually returning to the currency markets following a rout in March when the spread of the new coronavirus sent most units tumbling against the dollar, a group of market data providers found.
Liquidity in the foreign exchange markets is coming back toward pre-COVID-19 levels for some of the major currencies, with most recording on average about 70% to 80% of their previous daily volumes, Mosaic Smart Data, CLS and MUFG found in a collaborative project.
Trading volumes in emerging market currencies ""are not faring as well"", however, and remain at about 45% of pre-crisis levels, while outside of market hours trading generally remains very thin, the group found.
Euro/dollar - the most traded currency pair in the $6.6 trillion a day market - has seen market liquidity return to nearly 80% of its pre-crisis level. 
Liquidity in dollar/Japanese yen was largely shielded from disruption throughout the crisis. Both units have remained appealing as safe-haven currencies during the pandemic, with money managers shifting assets from riskier markets to more stable ones.
Liquidity in euro/Swiss franc - another widely traded pair during market stress - was at 85% of pre-crisis levels, making it the most used currency pair among the G10 right now.
Within the sterling/dollar pair, analysts noticed ""an immediate and sharp spike"" in liquidity after the London fixing hours, marking a change in traders' behaviour relative to pre-COVID-19 market conditions, they said.
The yen, Australian and Hong Kong dollars, Swiss franc and South African rand have seen the biggest increases in liquidity. But traders are still avoiding the euro, sterling, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar and Mexican peso.

But ""liquidity falls off sharply outside of trading hours and it is still almost as poor as at the peak of the health crisis,"" the group said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged down on Monday as optimism about the re-opening of economies hit by the coronavirus pandemic boosted risk appetite, lifting commodity currencies such as the Norwegian krone. 
The gradual easing of lockdowns has fuelled optimism across global markets despite fresh trade tensions between the United States and China. 
""Markets are quietly risk-on overnight"", said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
The dollar index drifted 0.05% lower at 100.28. The Norwegian krone was lifted by rising oil prices, supported by output cuts and signs of a recovery in demand. 
Against the dollar, the krone  jumped 0.6% to 10.1860. Other commodity currencies also rose and gold gained more than 1% to its highest in over seven years. 
Gains in stocks also lifted other major currencies such as the Australian dollar, which was up  half a percent at $0.6446 and the euro (EUR=D3) gained 0.05% to $1.0827. 
Against the yen , the U.S. currency lost about 0.2% at 107.20 per dollar after data showed Japan slipped into recession for the first time since 2015. Policymakers are bracing for the nation's worst postwar slump. 
Investors were also looking to Purchasing Managers' Index surveys due across major economies later this week for the next insight into the outlook. 
The pound stood at 89.35 pence per euro (EURGBP=) and was under pressure at $1.2107  after a week-long deadlock over a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union and increasing focus on the possibility of negative rates.

The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, did not rule such a move, in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper published on Saturday.

The amount of cash commercial banks have parked with Switzerland’s monetary authority increased by 4 billion francs ($4.1 billion) last week to 674 billion francs, data on Monday showed. That’s the smallest nominal rise in a month.
Economists keep a close eye on the SNB’s sight deposit figures to help gauge the scope of its foreign exchange interventions to prevent the franc from strengthening too much. Liquidity operations under the SNB’s Covid-19 facility could also be contributing to the rise in sight deposits.
A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment.
Both SNB President Thomas Jordan and fellow rate setter Andrea Maechler have stressed that the SNB has increased the intensity of interventions in recent weeks.
With the global economy on course for its deepest dive since the Great Depression, pressure on the haven franc has risen considerably, Maechler told daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday.
The franc has flirted with the 1.05 per euro mark in recent sessions, prompting speculation whether the SNB, which between 2011 and 2015 capped the franc’s value at 1.20 per euro, might have drawn a line in the sand there.
Maechler denied in the interview that the 1.05 level was becoming something of an informal upper limit. The SNB takes the foreign exchange situation generally into account, she said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has seen some selling in early European trade Monday, but from lofty heights as tensions between China and the U.S. continue to simmer and Japan enters recession.
 At 2:40 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.362, down 0.1%, having earlier Monday reached a three-week high. EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0823.
White House trade advisor Peter Navarro added to the bad blood between the U.S. and China over the weekend when he suggested in an interview with ABC's “This Week” that Beijing sent ""hundreds of thousands of Chinese on aircraft to Milan, New York and around the world” to spread the virus after hiding it from the world for two months.
The Trump administration has been keen to paint China as the bad guys regarding the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus, not least against the backdrop of the November Presidential election, which is now less than six months away.
Late Friday, the U.S. moved to block chip supplies to Huawei Technologies, part of its plan to stop the Chinese telecom giant's rollout of 5G mobile broadband.
The official yuan rate, which is highly sensitive to relations between the world's two biggest economies, was on the back foot, falling to its lowest level since early April.
“We would be surprised if the PBoC didn’t allow USD/CNY to slowly but surely pave its way higher towards November,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note to clients, “given the crystal-clear risk of a re-escalation of the tariffs war and continued issues of re-booting credit growth in China.” 
At 2:40 AM ET, USD/CNY traded at 7.1128, up 0.2%.
Elsewhere, Japan's economy has fallen into recession for the first time in four and a half years.
The world's third-largest economy shrank 3.4% from January to March, the second straight quarter of decline. And the second quarter is expected to look far worse, with economists looking for the fall in gross domestic product of 22% -- the biggest decline on record.
At 0240 AM ET, USD/JPY rose 0.15% to 107.18.
Additionally, the pound remains weak, having fallen overnight to $1.2076, its lowest since late March. The uncertainty over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU has continued to weigh. Also, the Bank of England's chief economist Andrew Haldane said over the weekend that the Bank is looking again at negative interest rates after having rejected the tool earlier.
""The economy is weaker than a year ago and we are now at the effective lower bound, so in that sense it's something we'll need to look at – are looking at – with somewhat greater immediacy,"" Haldane told the Telegraph. ""How could we not be?""
At 0240 AM ET, GBP/USD was up 0.1% at 1.2109.

59,"<span>May 17, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yen’s advance versus the dollar this year has more legs, if positioning by asset managers is any guide.
While Japan’s currency hasn’t really delivered a blowout rally, it has risen every month in 2020, with its 1.5% increase making it the sole gainer among Group-of-10 exchange rates. And the slow yet steady performance seems to have emboldened real-money funds to raise their bullish bets.
The funds have boosted their net long yen positions for five straight weeks, taking them to 47,181 contracts in the period ended May 12, the highest since November 2012, according to the latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The haven currency has found appeal amid the global market turmoil spurred by the coronavirus pandemic and also benefited from expectations that the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented monetary easing and steps to boost dollar supply will weaken the greenback.
While these two catalysts are still in play, concern about a resurgence in U.S.-China tensions over the source of the virus outbreak is emerging as another trigger for investors to seek safety in the yen.
“A major risk-off factor is that this is a presidential election year, which could prompt Trump to go hard on China,” said Ko Haruki, head of the financial solutions group at CIBC World Markets in Tokyo. “While risk-off can boost both the dollar and yen, factors related to U.S.-China trade frictions tend to put a stronger upward pressure on the yen compared with the dollar.”
The dollar-yen pair is also seen weighed down by the U.S. money markets’ pricing for the possibility of the central bank cutting interest rates below zero next year. While warning of economic risks from the pandemic, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week said such a move wasn’t being considered, though he stopped short of completely ruling out negative rates as an option in the future.
“Persistent positioning to short USD/JPY by non-Japanese players suggests they are focused on U.S. dollar weakness over the longer term because few can be optimistic about the prospect of the U.S. economy,” said Haruki.
Technical indicators are signaling that risks remain skewed for the dollar-yen to test the 105 mark soon as the currency pair grinds its way lower within a shallow bear channel. It ended at 107.06 on Friday.
Investors will watch if Japan growth data due Monday -- which is likely to show that the economy has slipped into deep recession -- has any meaningful impact on the yen. Analysts see the economy shrinking at an annualized pace of 4.5% in the first three months of this year.

Investing.com – The pound and euro are set for a second-straight weekly decline against the dollar on Friday, as analysts' warn of further pain despite expectations that U.K and Eurozone economic output could improve this month.  
GBP/USD fell 0.88% to $1.2118, a more than seven-week low, while EUR/USD was up 0.12% to $1.0817.
The impact of the coronavirus will likely continue to keep a lid on the pound and euro even as U.K. and eurozone purchasing managers' index surveys – set to be released next week - will likely recover in May, UniCredit suggested.
""There are still fears of a second wave of Covid-19 infections after new cluster cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and after new infections have also emerged in South Korea and Germany,"" the bank said.
Earlier this week, the U.K. reported GDP had declined 2% in the first quarter of the year, its quarterly biggest decline since 2008. The second reading of Eurozone GDP showed growth fell by a record 3.8% in the first quarter, with analysts warning of a deeper contraction in the second quarter.

61,"<span>May 15, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- In the epic battle between the trillions of dollars of debt supply needed to finance soaring government deficits, and central banks’ bond buying, the latter is losing, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
That will lead to higher long-term borrowing costs, particularly in the U.S., the bank said, as it examined whether quantitative-easing programs can buy enough government bonds to keep yields in check.
“Greater duration supply adds to the case for higher rates and steeper curves,” wrote Avisha Thakkar, a strategist at Goldman, in a note to clients. “Central bank buying should absorb a substantial amount of upcoming issuance, though we expect increases in ‘free float’ across most markets.”
Global central banks have so far managed to keep yields close to record lows as governments raise spending to unprecedented levels to soften the damage from the coronavirus. But investors are beginning to get worried that problems are building up further down the line should stimulus be pulled back, or inflation accelerate.
New Zealand is set to be the only developed country that is likely to see a shrinking pool of debt available to investors. In the U.K., even an increase to the Bank of England’s bond-buying program next month will not be enough to offset the extra supply, according to Goldman’s analysis.
It estimates that a 10-percentage-point increase in excess bond supply would imply between 10 basis points and 20 basis points of steepening in the yield gap between five-year and 30-year U.S. Treasuries."
62,"<span>May 15, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound is back to being the pariah of the currency world as renewed Brexit risks worsen the troubles of a market still reeling from the shock of the pandemic.
Sterling fell a fifth day against the dollar on Friday after the latest negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union seemed set for a stalemate, with both sides refusing to compromise on key issues such as trade and movement of citizens. The pound is already the past month’s worst-performing Group-of-10 currency and options signal more pain ahead.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to walk away from the talks this week if enough progress wasn’t made. That raises the risk that the U.K. will end its transition period on Dec. 31 without a free-trade deal -- putting further strain on an economy that’s already facing the worst recession in three centuries.
“Brexit has reared its head again,” said Ned Rumpeltin, the European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “After hibernating since the end of last year, it looks like Brexit isn’t quite finished as a bearish factor for sterling. G-10 currencies remain highly risk-driven against the dollar, but the return of these concerns could emerge as a significant differentiator for sterling.”
Buffeted by successive elections, failed parliamentary votes and shifts in monetary policy, volatility in sterling was at one point on par with those seen in riskier, emerging-market nations. The pound is already among the most volatile among G-10 currencies, second only to Norway’s krone this year.
The pound has fallen 1.7% this week to around $1.22, on track for the worst such decline in almost two months. A close on Friday below the $1.2166 -- a level that proved to be a key chart support in recent weeks -- could set the stage for further losses, according to Rumpeltin.
Lee Hardman, a strategist at MUFG, sees the U.K. currency slipping to $1.20 or even lower in the short term. While the consensus call in a Bloomberg currency survey is for sterling to climb 3% from current levels to end the year at $1.26, this is significantly lower than the $1.33 predicted just two months ago.
“There is an increasing risk that investors view the outlook for the U.K. more negatively relative to elsewhere, thus encouraging increased speculative selling,” MUFG’s Hardman said. “The U.K. is in the unique position of having a considerable risk on the horizon in relation to the E.U. trade negotiations.”
Two-month pound-dollar risk reversals, an options gauge of positioning that cover the June 30 deadline for any extension of a Brexit transition period, continue to signal a markedly bearish outlook for the U.K. currency.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is due to give a press conference Friday on this week’s round of negotiations.
“Do I expect a significant deterioration in talks at this stage? No, as there are still the June and September rounds before the hoped October “soft” deadline,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency analyst at Nomura International Plc. “But it would help focus minds if Barnier turns up the temperature. We remain short sterling.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has given back some of its overnight gains in early European trade Friday, but remains in favor as risk aversion still dominates, amid rising Sino-U.S. tensions.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.365, down 0.1%, having earlier Friday reached a three-week high. 
EUR/USD fell 0.03% to 1.0800 ahead of a revised German GDP reading at 4 AM, while USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 107.17.
U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up these tensions in an interview with Fox Business Network on Thursday, stating he was disappointed with China's failure to contain the coronavirus, that this had cast a pall over the trade deal between the two countries. He suggested he could even cut off ties.
“It cannot be ruled out that he would pull out of the phase-one trade deal and start putting tariffs back on China,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a note to investors.
“He would risk hurting the economy even further as well as jeopardize important farmer votes in key swing states if China pulls the plug on agricultural purchases. On the other hand, he could gain politically from taking a tough stance on China.”
The yuan, which is highly sensitive to relations between the world's two biggest economies, was on the back foot and touched a one-week low of 7.1026 in onshore trade. 
At 02:45 AM ET, USD/CNY traded at 7.1003, up 0.1%, as the market struggled to take a clear lead from data that showed Chinese industrial production rebounding in April but retail sales still down 7.5% on the year.
The deteriorating relationship between these two important countries is the latest potential spanner in the works of global growth, given worries about a second wave of infections and the slow reopening of economies badly hit by the social distancing measures introduced to combat the virus.
With this in mind, it may be worth keeping an eye on the Swiss franc and its relationship with the euro, with the single currency hitting an almost five-year low against the franc of 1.0510 - near the level that many deem to be the unofficial line the Swiss National Bank defends. The euro has been bumping against support at the 1.05 level for the last month.
At 02:45 AM ET, EUR/CHF traded at 1.0516, up 0.04%.
“Recent events in Europe have led to increased tensions along many of the same stress points that have troubled the region over the last decade, and this has put renewed appreciation pressure on the traditional safe haven currency on the continent,” said Michael Cahill, an economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), reported by Bloomberg. 
Elsewhere, the British pound remained under pressure at $1.2196, down 0.25%, after touching a five-week low of $1.2161 overnight as the British government reiterated its refusal to extend the Brexit transition deadline beyond December. The third round of talks on the post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU winds up today.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar eased from a three-week high on Friday but looked set for a modest weekly gain as rising Sino-U.S. tensions and worries about a second wave of coronavirus infections rattled investors.
As hopes wavered for a quick global recovery from the pandemic, the trade-sensitive Australian dollar was poised to snap five weeks of gains with a 1% drop, its first weekly loss since early April.
The Aussie  was soft in the Asia session at $0.6462, just below the middle of the range it has kept all month.
The kiwi  crept off a Thursday three-week low of $0.5958 but was weighed by talk of negative interest rates next year. It struggled to get past 60 cents and sat at $0.5996.
The Antipodean pair, like other majors, have struggled for traction in May as investors and authorities weigh optimism about easing virus containment measures against the risk of more infections and the sheer scale of economic damage already wrought.
""The market is sort of in a wait-and-see mode at the moment, waiting to see in particular whether U.S.-China trade tensions really do escalate,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange analyst at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY).
The yen  was steady at 107.18 per dollar, but has ground lower this week as U.S. Federal Reserve officials talked down the prospect of negative rates, also buoying the greenback.
The dollar is up about half a percent on the yen this week and half a percent against a basket of currencies (=USD).
""With risk appetite stretched and price momentum easing, trading is likely to be entering a choppy period,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Friday which forecast a bearish outlook for riskier currencies in the month ahead.
""Markets now turn to slower factors that will either lead global economies out of hibernation or condemn risk markets to lose altitude."" 
RISKS REMAIN
Gradual re-opening of the world's economies has come with a dawning of how deeply the pandemic has damaged supply chains, labour markets and global demand.
Data on Friday showed China's April industrial output beating expectations but consumption was stuck in the doldrums.
An already-dismal near-term U.S. economic outlook has darkened further in the latest Reuters poll of economists, with a forecast for a 35% annualised second-quarter contraction.
And increasing tension between the United States and China is the latest potential spanner in the works of global growth.
""The three big risks remain: a second wave of coronavirus cases; collateral damage from the shutdowns resulting in a delayed or very slow recovery; and an escalation in U.S.-China tensions,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at Australian wealth manager AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital.
""On the latter, the risks will likely escalate dramatically if Trump’s approval rating collapses leading him to conclude that he has nothing to lose by trying to 'wag the dog'.""
In an interview with Fox Business Network broadcast on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was disappointed with China's failure to contain the coronavirus and suggested he could even cut ties. 
China insists it has been transparent. But the yuan, which is highly sensitive to relations between the world's two biggest economies, was on the back foot and touched a one-week low of 7.1026 in onshore trade .
Elsewhere the British pound  remained under pressure at $1.2212, after touching a five-week low of $1.2161 overnight after the British government reiterated its refusal to extend the Brexit transition deadline beyond December.

The euro also hit an almost five-year low against the Swiss franc of 1.502 francs (EURCHF=) as the crisis puts pressure on the single currency. It last held at $1.0804 (EUR=).

As Asia emerges from a lockdown, consumption and investments are set to fire up again, reviving economies that bore the earliest brunt of the pandemic. South Korean debt and Thai securities are among those primed to do well, investors say.
Developing Asian bonds are at a crossroad after capping their biggest monthly gain in almost a year, with a resurgence in trade tensions threatening to undercut a rebound in exports. From China’s suspension of Australian beef imports to a U.S. ban on investments in Chinese stocks, recent headlines are reviving concerns of the protectionism which dogged global markets for the past two years.
Asia’s “economic disruption is going to be easier to fix, getting people back to work is going to be easier,” said Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM Investments in London. “We’re quite positive on Asia just because we don’t think the world’s really realized just how much better Asia has done through this.”
Global funds are betting on developing Asian debt as the region takes aggressive steps to contain the pandemic and help their economies bounce back. Infections appear to have stabilized in China and South Korea while the number of cases in Taiwan is among the lowest in the world.
Regional bonds have fallen less than 1% this year, compared with a 5.7% decline in emerging-market debt, Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes show. Philippine securities and Chinese notes have outperformed Asian peers so far in 2020.
Policy support has been crucial. Bank Indonesia purchased bonds directly from the government, while the Reserve Bank of India snapped up debt securities in the secondary market. China’s central bank has pledged “more powerful” policies to counter the fallout.
“We remain quite constructive on EM Asian bonds and have increased our duration positions over the past several weeks,” said Prashant Singh, senior emerging-market debt portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Our preferred positions have been in markets where we still see scope for further monetary easing and where the reliance on external financing is relatively lower – like South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.”
Trade Rift
But, some portfolio managers strike a more cautious note, with concerns largely centered around U.S.-China trade ties. President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the future of the phase one agreement, saying he’s struggling with Beijing in the wake of the pandemic.
“Some level of trade renegotiations are inevitable as it is extremely unlikely that China can fulfill its pledges on buying various American goods” due to the fallout from the pandemic, said Karan Talwar, senior investment specialist for emerging-market debt at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management in Hong Kong. “As the U.S. approaches its general election, the situation could get further politicized and hence is something to pay close attention to.”
Washington has also blocked investments in Chinese stocks by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. Separately, China suspended meat imports from four Australian abattoirs this week.
“The global economic recovery could turn out to be bumpy and the time line more drawn out,” said Duncan Tan, a rates strategist at DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings Ltd. in Singapore. “Over a 12 to 24-month horizon, South Korea and Singapore bonds are likely to be more resilient due to greater fiscal flexibility and stronger external funding fundamentals.”
Haven Status
But for some money managers, Asia is a relative haven amid the volatility.
“The fiscal resources that Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore have at their disposable and generally sounder fundamentals mean that Asia is already far ahead,” said Kenneth Akintewe, head of Asian sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Given the uncertainty ahead, the importance of being allocated to a region underpinned by more robust fundamentals couldn’t be greater.”

66,"<span>May 14, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A Singapore foreign-exchange platform has won financial backing from  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). just as its trading volume more than doubled on coronavirus-driven volatility.
HSBC and Citi join  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). as investors in Spark Systems after participating in series B funding that’s raised $16.5 million over two rounds, according to Chief Executive Officer Wong Joo Seng. Citi and HSBC representatives confirmed their companies have invested in Spark. OSK Ventures International Bhd., a Kuala Lumpur-based investment firm, also joined the current round, which brought the firm’s valuation to $70.5 million, Wong said.
Wong said the amount raised will be sufficient for the next three and a half years, though more investors will participate in the current round later this year.
The timing for the fund-raising has been propitious. Currency trading skyrocketed across the globe earlier this year when panic selling in the coronavirus-induced market meltdown triggered a stampede for dollars and fueled demand for lightning-fast pricing.
“Trading started to surge into late February just as the contagion spread,” said Wong.
Singapore, already Asia’s biggest currency-trading hub, is wooing the world’s top banks to set up electronic-pricing engines in the city state to win a bigger slice of the $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market. Spark currently provides clients with prices from banks such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) that have pricing systems set up in Singapore, according to Wong.
“We are executing in Singapore on a one to two millisecond time basis,” he said, noting that executions in London or New York could take on the order of 380 milliseconds, so the time savings from the regional operation is substantial.
The start-up, which is backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, recorded an average $5.5 billion-a-day trading volume during the first quarter, up from $2.5 billion during the same period in 2019. But the slowing global economy is now starting to dampen activity in the second quarter, Wong said, with average trading volume sliding to $4.5 billion to $5 billion a day.
“If you have GDP shrinking, if you have numerous companies that are badly affected, it will affect the level of economic activity and the amount of forex being traded,” he said.
The vast majority of the firm’s trades currently involve Group-of-Ten assets, but Wong sees opportunities for the firm to boost its capabilities in emerging-market currencies such as the Korean won, Chinese yuan, Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah.
“We see Singapore as a very natural hub for corporate treasury and for emerging market currencies price discovery,” he said. “We’d like to be the center where that is being traded.”

67,"<span>May 14, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A clerical error and a data-collection quirk brought significant distortions to the latest U.S. jobless claims report, which has taken on elevated importance as the coronavirus pandemic upends the labor market.
Connecticut said Thursday afternoon that it incorrectly reported unemployment claims as a whopping 298,680, about 10 times higher than the correct number of 29,846. The error likely inflated the U.S. Department of Labor’s reported national figure of 2.98 million, which exceeded economists’ median projection by almost half a million.
The state’s figure had stood out in the report issued Thursday morning as anomalous because it was the highest in the nation, when Connecticut is one of the smallest states and posted 36,138 claims the prior week.
Nancy Steffens, a spokesperson for the state’s labor department, said in an email that it was a “data entry reporting error.” A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Labor didn’t have an immediate comment when asked how the change affects the national-level figures.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department’s continuing claims data were influenced by a staggering unadjusted 1.9 million decline in California -- the most populous state -- during the week ended May 2, or about a 40% drop from the prior week. Some 22.8 million continuing claims were reported by the federal government on a seasonally adjusted basis, well below the 25.1 million median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Economists are focused on continuing claims to provide insight into how quickly the labor market can stabilize and begin to improve as states begin opening from pandemic-related shutdowns.
In many states, a person who has already filed an initial application needs to file continued claims each week to receive funds while remaining unemployed. In California, residents file every two weeks. Other states use this method as well, but in the Golden State, surging unemployment and the biweekly cycle -- plus a much larger population -- have combined to create outsize swings from week to week.
Pairing the data on continuing claims from alternating weeks in California shows a pattern of rising claims, consistent with the state’s biweekly filing schedule.
The actual number of continuing claims in California may be closer to the number of individuals paid in the week ended May 2 -- 3.1 million -- which is the four-week rolling total shown in a May 7 release from the state government. That’s higher than the 2.9 million figure in Thursday’s Labor Department report.
California’s Employment Development Department and the U.S. Labor Department didn’t have immediate comment to requests for more details.
With volatility in state numbers such as California’s, along with seasonal-adjustment distortions and the expanded number of people who can now file, “all of that is making this harder than usual to interpret,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). “You just have to be really careful in extrapolating trends from one week to another.”
Even so, it makes sense for Americans to start coming off benefit rolls in some states. For instance, Georgia, which reopened restaurants and hair salons in recent weeks, saw a more than 76,000 person decrease in continued claims from the prior week.

The yuan’s 30-day moving average has been flat all month at around 7.077 per dollar, while volatility has plunged to the lowest since January. The central bank has repeatedly set the daily fixing stronger than expected this month, and banks have been seen buying the yuan, limiting losses past 7.1.
Chinese authorities have historically kept the nation’s financial markets steady in the run-up to the important yearly event. Once the leash is loosened, market forces suggest renewed pressure on the yuan. The global recession is undercutting demand for Chinese products, while worsening tensions with the U.S. are casting doubt on the trade deal between the two nations.
The yuan will likely experience gradual depreciation after the National People’s Congress, partly due to the weak outlook for exports, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
He said he expected the yuan to weaken to 7.2 versus the greenback by the third quarter or possibly earlier. That would be a drop of about 1.5% from the current level.

Investing.com – The dollar rose on Thursday, shaking off falling U.S. bond yields, with Wall Street betting that the dollar is unlikely to lose its clout as the world's reserve currency even if the Federal Reserve is eventually forced to cut rates below zero.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.21% to 100.46.
The dollar is unlikely to lose its dominant position as the world's reserve currency if the Fed employed negative interest rates, as central banks rely on the dollar to ensure current account and financial account transactions in times of crisis, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Talk of negative interest rates has persisted even as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently said further cuts to the central bank's benchmark rate to below zero are unlikely.
The federal fund futures market continues to price in negative U.S. interest rates early next year.
The latest uptick in the dollar comes even as Treasury yields continue to slip, as fears about a protracted road to economic recovery were exacerbated by further evidence of pain in the labor market.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims were 2.981 million for the week ended May 9, above economists' forecasts of 2.5 million.
The dollar's move higher was also supported by a fall in the pound of and euro.
EUR/USD, which accounts for about half of the value of the dollar index, fell 0.31% $1.073, even as Germany, the economic powerhouse of the EU, reported better-than-expected inflation numbers.
GBP/USD fell 0.30% to $1.2193 as sentiment on cable remains negative after data earlier this week showed the U.K. economy contracted by a record 5.8% in March as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic dealt a blow to growth.
Ongoing worries about U.K-EU trade talks have also weighed on cable as investors fret over whether the U.K. will agree to extend talks beyond the transition period with the June 30 deadline fast approaching."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may be warming to a strong dollar after years of bashing the U.S. currency's stubborn appreciation. 
""It’s a great time to have a strong dollar ... Everybody wants to be in the dollar because we kept it strong. I kept it strong,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox Business News.
The comments contrast with remarks during his presidency in which he has railed against the dollar's strength. A strong currency makes U.S. exports less competitive abroad and hurts corporations that need to convert their foreign earnings into dollars. 
(Graphic: Trump and the U.S. dollar link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbkwzrpq/Trump%20dollar.jpg)
Traders have increasingly shrugged off those comments, and the dollar has risen about 3% against a basket of its peers since the 2016 presidential election, stoked by the relative outperformance of the U.S. economy to those in Europe and Asia.
Those gains have been accelerated by recent safe-haven demand amid turbulence in financial markets due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Either ""Trump was shooting from the hip, or has realized that he cannot weaken the dollar, so he is embracing it,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading, at Tempus Inc in Washington.
Ultimately, analysts see Trump's words on the dollar having little long-term impact on the greenback.

""Trumps comments today will in no way change how I trade currency or effect my forecasts,"" Doyle said.

""It's a great time to have a strong dollar ... Everybody wants to be in the dollar because we kept it strong. I kept it strong,"" he said in an interview on Fox Business Network.
The dollar index on Thursday extended its gains, rising 0.3% to a three-week high of 100.47.
On Wednesday the head of the U.S. central bank, in a closely watched speech, offered a sobering assessment of the U.S. economy in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic that has battered global markets.
""There is a sense, growing sense I think, that the recovery may come more slowly than we would like,"" Powell said, making a direct appeal for Congress to do more to address the crisis. At the same time, he said negative interest rates are ""not something that we are considering."" 
Trump on Thursday told the television network that he ""could live both ways"" regarding the dollar's strength, but said he supported it for now. 
""From a trade standpoint, it's tougher. But from a country standpoint and an inflation standpoint - you don't have inflation, you don't have problems,"" he said. ""Right now it's good to have a strong dollar. Right now having a strong dollar is a great thing."" 

Trump previously has called on the Fed to push rates into negative territory as a way to limit dollar strength and keep U.S. exports competitive.

As the pound extends the deepest slump among developed-world currencies, a host of market indicators are converging to suggest the worst is yet to come.
Sterling slid more than 3% in the past month, with losses accelerating this week as data showed the U.K. economy may be headed for the deepest recession in three centuries amid the coronavirus crisis. Technical charts and option pricing point to more pain for the currency as money-market bets rise that the Bank of England will cut interest rates below zero next year to revive growth.
Governor Andrew Bailey said Wednesday it’s “pretty clear” investors expect more quantitative easing from the BOE, and that monetary loosening is helping the government fund the cost of economic aid amid the pandemic. Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent even hinted at the possibility of negative rates, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell pushed back against the notion.
A chart formation known as the double top is signaling more risk for the pound-dollar pair. Sterling has already breached the so-called neckline of the pattern on a closing basis, suggesting it could extend declines by another 3% to test support levels around $1.1850. The British currency dropped as much as 0.4% Thursday to $1.2181, the lowest level since April 7. Its 3.3% loss in the past one month is the biggest among advanced economies.
U.K. money markets are now pricing in negative rates for early 2021, in a similar move to U.S. fed fund futures -- also pointing to sub-zero rates around the same time. Such rate expectations may weigh harder on sterling’s prospects, with recent comments from policy makers suggesting the BOE could move faster than the Fed to ease policy.
The brewing pessimism offers little surprise to option traders. Risk reversals, a barometer of market positioning and sentiment, have been steadily trading at levels indicating a deeply bearish outlook for the U.K. currency. There are also lingering signs that Brexit trade risks aren’t priced in yet, leaving the pound facing the strongest set of headwinds among its peers.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has seen demand in early European trade Thursday, as risk aversion reigned on the back of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's sobering outlook for U.S. economic growth and his ruling out of negative interest rates.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.37, up 0.1%. EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.0807, while GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.2187.
Powell joined a list of policymakers to fend off the notion of negative U.S. rates in a webcast Wednesday. He also pledged to use the U.S. central bank's power as needed, but suggested that it might not be enough to avoid deep economic damage without more fiscal support.
The market is still priced for the Effective Fed Funds rate to dip into negative territory next year, “but his comments could stop the market from pricing an even lower Fed Funds rate,” said analysts at Danske Bank.
This additional fiscal support may prove tricky to get through Congress. Earlier this week House Democrats proposed another coronavirus relief bill, worth $3 trillion, which includes funding for state and local governments and more direct stimulus payments for Americans.  However, the Republicans have rejected the idea.
The latest weekly jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), could well illustrate the need for more support, with claims for first-time unemployment benefits expected to come in at 2.5 million. This would push the number of people claiming unemployment benefit over the 35 million level since the coronavirus virus first hit. 
This week Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts revised their peak estimate for the U.S. jobless rate to 25%, up from 15%. The April official rate came in at 14.7% last week. The job losses have hit poorer sections of the population hardest: Powell said 40% of families with income below $40,000 a year had lost a job, according to Fed analysis.
The other main currency which has gained thanks to this period of risk aversion has been the Japanese yen, and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) sees the potential for more strength ahead.
At 02:55 AM ET, USD/JPY traded 0.1% lower at 106.86.
“We now see the risk of multi-year yen appreciation,” analysts at JPMorgan said, in a research note. “We expect the yen depreciation era (a sustained period of substantial yen depreciation in real terms) started by Abenomics to end.”
The bank cited the return of deflation as a mounting concern in Japan, as well as record outflows of portfolio capital slowing as Japanese fund managers confront much lower bond yields abroad. Additionally, Japan’s trade balance may get a sustained boost from the drop in oil prices.
Elsewhere, sterling fell to a seven-week low amid growing fears that the Bank of England too will be forced to resort to negative rates. Fears of a hard Brexit at the end of the year when the current transition period ends out are also weighing in a country that now has the highest virus death toll in Europe."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held onto gains against major currencies on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dismissed speculation that policymakers will adopt negative interest rates.
The Australian dollar was under pressure before closely-watched data on the jobs market, which may help determine how much more monetary and fiscal easing is necessary to support the economy.
The focus will shift to economic data from the United States and Europe in the next two days for more clues on the depth of the downturns there, while investors will closely watch China activity gauges for signs on how long it may take to emerge from the sharp shock caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
""The dollar managed to bounce back after Powell's comments on negative rates, but now the dollar's bias is fairly neutral,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
""There could be some safe-have flows into the dollar, but everyone is facing the same economic problems caused by the coronavirus.""
The dollar traded at $1.0818 against the euro (EUR=D3) on Thursday following a 0.3% gain in the previous session.
Against the pound , the greenback was quoted at $1.2238, close to a five-week high.
The dollar bought 0.9722 Swiss franc  after gaining 0.3% on Wednesday.
The greenback was little changed at 106.91 yen .
Powell became the latest in a parade of policymakers to brush off the notion that they might push rates into negative territory, after Fed futures began pricing a small chance of sub-zero U.S. rates within the next year.
""The committee's view on negative rates really has not changed. This is not something that we are looking at,"" Powell said on Wednesday, referring to the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Powell spoke in response to a question after offering a sobering assessment of U.S. economic outlook in a closely-watched speech.
The United States and other countries are easing restrictions to allow factories and shops to open again for business, but there are significant risks of a second wave of infections and a full-fledged economic recovery is likely to remain distant until a vaccine for the coronavirus is available.
U.S. data on weekly jobless claims due later Thursday and a survey on U.S. manufacturing due Friday should offer more clues about the economic outlook. 
The Australian dollar  eased slightly to $0.6449 as traders braced for data at 0130 GMT expected to show a large increase in unemployment (Reuters poll forecast 575,000) due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would bolster expectations for further stimulus measures.
Across the Tasman Sea (NYSE:SE), the New Zealand dollar  traded at $0.5991. The kiwi tumbled by more than 1% on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand flagged the possibility of negative interest rates.
New Zealand's government is expected to present its budget later today, which will offer fiscal stimulus to offset the economic damage caused by the pandemic.
Many investors await China's release on Friday of data on industrial production, retail sales and investment to measure how quickly the world's second-largest economy is recovering from its first contraction in decades in the first quarter.
The novel coronavirus first emerged in China late last year and has since spread across the globe, paralysing economic activity.

Traders in the euro are also focused on the release of preliminary first-quarter gross domestic product data on Friday to assess the scale of the damage caused by the outbreak. 
 
"
76,"<span>May 13, 2020 01:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the human and economic damage it has wreaked on the U.S., the coronavirus crisis has reinforced the most important vestige of American power in the global economy: the supremacy of the dollar.
The U.S. moved decisively to help foreigners get dollars when markets started seizing up in March. And in contrast to a previous tendency to emphasize the negatives of a strong exchange rate, U.S. President Donald Trump has highlighted the positives of overseas demand for the greenback.
Beijing, meantime, has been noticeably silent on any criticism of the dollar’s outsize role in the world -- in contrast with the aftermath of the Lehman meltdown when its central bank governor called for the adoption of a global currency to displace the dollar’s dominance.
“The Fed has signaled the importance of keeping dollar liquidity in international markets” through moves to expand swap lines with emerging markets, said Paola Subacchi author of “The People’s Money. How China is building a global currency” and a professor at the University of Bologna. “The question of the yuan competing head to head with the dollar could have some traction about eight years ago, but it is no longer the case.”
The numbers tell the tale. The dollar is used in 88% of all currency trades, according to the latest triennial Bank for International Settlements survey. It accounts for 61% of the world’s foreign-exchange reserves, IMF data show. And the greenback has a 44% share of payments over the Swift global system, well in excess of the U.S. share of world GDP, at about one-quarter.
The Federal Reserve has made it easier for other central banks to get dollar cash by letting them swap their Treasuries holdings. The decisions stood out because some American legislators had criticized the Fed for providing dollars to foreign central banks after the global financial crisis.
While Trump on April 17 noted the damage to exporters of a strong dollar, he also extolled the value of foreign capital. “Everybody wants to invest in our country,” and “people want the safety of our country,” he said. A strong dollar is “overall very good.”
Strong Dollar
“The Fed’s activism and Trump’s flip on a strong dollar reflect U.S. anxiety in the face of the narrative that China will emerge from the pandemic as the new world leader,” said Hui Feng, a senior research fellow at Australia’s Griffith Asia Institute.
Hui, co-author of “The Rise of the People’s Bank of China (OTC:BACHY),” also highlighted how China’s rhetoric has changed from the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis -- when Chinese officials moved to boost the role of the yuan.
“I see a stark contrast,” Hui said. “Beijing has been more realistic this time.”
Even as China opens its giant bond and stock markets to overseas investors, the existence of capital controls makes some fund managers wary, acting as a brake on its ambitions to expand global use of its currency.
“China is too early in its transition to a more market-driven economy to jump to a currency leadership position,” said Kathy Walsh, a finance professor at UTS Business School in Sydney who specializes in capital-markets research.
“It is more likely that the plans to internationalize the RMB will be shelved while China navigates the rebuilding of its post-Covid economy,” she said, referring to the renminbi, the official name for China’s currency.
Yuan Use
Still, Beijing is continuing to promote international use of the yuan. A steady opening of the domestic bond market to foreign funds has successfully continued to lure overseas money even amid the coronavirus crisis -- with more than $7 billion in April, taking the total to about $326 billion.
Any moves by China to price more of its imports -- commodities especially -- in yuan could also boost the currency’s global role. Shanghai made waves by launching crude oil futures in 2018.
Meantime, the Trump administration’s liberal use of the dollar’s supreme status to enact sanctions on Iran and others could ultimately diminish the appetite for some countries to use the greenback. And not every emerging market has access to the Fed’s dollar helplines -- Turkey and China aren’t on the list.
So while the greenback remains head and shoulders above the rest, the yuan competition remains and it may not be clear for some time whether a fundamental transition is already under way. Indeed, history shows the dollar’s own march toward becoming the prime global currency took decades.
“Historical shifts in the nature of the international monetary system occur at crisis points,” said David Lubin, London-based head of emerging-market economics at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and author of “Dance of the Trillions: Developing Countries and Global Finance.”
“The right question to ask is: Is this a historical turning point sufficient to lead to a change in the rules of the international monetary order?” Lubin said.
For now at least, the answer appears to be no. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard declared as much Tuesday, saying the dollar’s dominance would stay for quite a while, with other currencies not in a position to pose a challenge.
Indeed, many emerging markets are actually strengthening their ties with the dollar as they shore up funding to get their economies through the virus crisis. Indonesia mounted a record sale of more than $4 billion of dollar bonds in April. That was part of a $47 billion slew of sovereign dollar issuance by developing nations, the biggest month on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Total dollar credit extended to borrowers outside the U.S., excluding banks, climbed to a record $12.2 trillion by last December, BIS data show. That’s about double the level a decade before. It amounted to about 14% of global GDP; the ratio back in 2009 was about 10%.
That gargantuan amount of offshore dollar debt showcases how crucial liquidity in greenbacks is, and the importance of Fed moves to ensure it. At this point, it’s hard for some observers to conceive China stepping in quite so dramatically -- even if it has signed hundreds of billions of dollars of swap agreements in yuan with counterparts around the world.
“It would be difficult to keep yuan liquidity while maintaining capital controls,” Subacchi said. “The Chinese authorities have no intention to liberalize capital movements, even if they have been fine tuning the system on the margins.”
Soft Power
China’s actions during the coronavirus crisis may also have postponed the time when the yuan might rival the dollar from the standpoint of “soft power.” By that fuzzy measure of popular acceptance and approval, China has taken some bruises with concerns about its transparency.
“China has ample hard power but a deficit in soft power,” said Stephen Jen, who runs hedge fund and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital in London. “The U.S., regardless of one’s opinion on any specific president, still commands probably the greatest hard and soft power of them all.”
The bottom line, Jen said, is that the dollar “will likely become increasingly dominant.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey could be heading for another financial crunch but its diminished importance for investors in developing economies and changes in the sector have greatly reduced the risk of contagion across emerging markets.
The lira tumbling to fresh record lows last week reignited memories of Turkey's 2018 crisis which rocked developing currencies from South Africa's rand to Russia's rouble and also impacted shares in Turkish-exposed European banks.
But even that reaction was muted compared to prior decades when contagion from one emerging market to another was taken for granted, such as during the Asian crisis or the Russia crisis.
Reverberations this time might be of even lower magnitude, because investor positioning in emerging markets overall and Turkey in particular looks dramatically different from the summer of 2018.
""Foreign investor participation in Turkish markets has collapsed over the past several years, with non-residents now holding only 6% of (Turkish government bonds), down from 29% in 2013,"" said Phoenix Kalen at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
Institute of International Finance data showed emerging markets had suffered a ""sudden stop"" in capital flows in March with a record $83.3 billion fleeing stocks and bonds amid uncertainty over the coronavirus spread and the oil price collapse. 
Turkey, more vulnerable to swings in capital flows, saw the amount of domestic assets held by foreign investors drop sharply. Domestic debt held by non-residents fell from $15.5 billion late-2019 to $8.4 billion in early May. Over the same period, equity holdings by non-resident investors fell from $32 billion to $22 billion, central bank data showed. 
""Similarly, there is much less foreign participation in Turkish currency markets due to the interventionist policies, frequent new regulations, and the sporadic funding squeezes,"" added Kalen.
Turkey has tinkered numerous times with offshore lira markets in recent years with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan frequently accusing foreign speculators of destabilizing the lira. 
In April, the regulator capped local banks' ability to conduct FX transactions with foreign entities at just 1% of equity, down from 10% previously - a move that sparked a muted markets reaction. Days later, it took this limit down to 0.5%. 
A similar offshore 2019 lira squeeze saw overnight borrowing rates soar to over 1,000%, which briefly shored up the lira.
This comes amid a long decline in overseas lira trading with average daily trading volumes in London having shrunk 28% from 2016 to $37 billion last October while the share of total FX trading slipped to 1.3% from 2.3%, Bank of England data shows.

https://reut.rs/3aa31WB
Turkey's waning weighting in bond indexes also lowers the risks for investors. In the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) GBI-EM index - a widely used emerging local bond benchmark - it has a 3.2% weighting compared to 10% in 2015.
""Turkey has been a source of concern among foreign investors for so long,"" said Manik Narain, head of EM strategy at UBS. ""There is not the same degree of hit to asset management returns, it's not the same as if Mexico or Brazil blows up.""
Unlike Turkey, many emerging markets have also seen some vulnerabilities to external flows decrease in recent years. Since the 2013 taper tantrum, current account deficits across major emerging markets have broadly receded while a crunch in debt-to-FX reserves has been focussed in smaller, riskier emerging markets. 
Meanwhile emerging markets as an asset class have also changed -- there are more countries to invest in and a far broader investor base, including local pension and insurance funds which hold on even if foreigners sell. 
""You have seen markets deepen in size, liquidity improve and we think become more sophisticated so investors are more willing to differentiate individual country risks,"" said Nachu Chockalingam at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was marginally higher in early European trade Wednesday, ahead of an eagerly-anticipated speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later in the day.
At 2:50 AM ET (0650 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.972, up 0.02%, while EUR/USD rose 0.03% to 1.0850. GBP/USD pushed 0.3% higher to 1.2297, and USD/JPY gained 0.03% to 107.16.
Powell will speak as a guest at a streaming event held by the Peterson Institute of International Economics at 9:00 AM ET (13:00 GMT),. a day after U.S. President Donald Trump again pushed the Federal Reserve to adopt negative interest rates, a subject which gained prominence last week when U.S. money market instruments started to price in a chance of the fed funds rate dropping below zero next year.


Last week saw U.S. unemployment rise by another three million, bringing the total of people claiming benefits to 33 million since the start of the coronavirus crisis, around the levels of the Great Depression. Consumer prices also dropped 0.8% in April, raising the possibility of deflation as the economy sinks deeper into recession.
This has all fueled the debate about policy responses and putting pressure on the Fed to do more.
Several members of the Federal Reserve have already expressed their skepticism this week that rates below zero would be an effective remedy for the economic damage of the pandemic.
“We should expect (Powell) to reject negative rates once again,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “However, if he opens the door in light of the deep recession and the big drop in core inflation we saw yesterday, we should expect to see a strong rally in the front-end of the U.S. curve.”
""I would advise against negative rates. Japan has done that but the perception here is that it wasn't so good,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Asset Management, told Bloomberg.
""But what's worrying is that Trump is now talking about them. Looking at past examples, the Fed has eventually done what Trump wanted quite often.""
Elsewhere, Sterling came off the three-week low it posted on Tuesday after quarterly GDP data were marginally less bad than expected. The currency remains under pressure, however, after Treasury chief Rishi Sunak unveiled what could be a hugely expensive expansion of the government's wage subsidies for furloughed workers on Tuesday.
The dollar also surged against the kiwi after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand announced a big expansion of its quantitative easing program."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive against its rivals on Wednesday as traders looked to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech amid rising speculation the United States could one day adopt negative interest rates.
Risk-sensitive currencies lacked momentum as a warning from a top U.S. health official about the dangers of reopening the economy too soon served as a reminder of the uncertainties facing an economy which has been ravaged by the novel coronavirus.
The dollar traded at 107.15 yen , having slipped from Tuesday's peak of 107.76, its highest since April 24.
The euro changed hands at $1.0848 (EUR=) after having gained about 0.4% in the previous session.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday again pushed the Federal Reserve to adopt negative interest rates, a hot topic in financial markets since last week when U.S. money market instruments started to price in a chance of negative rates.
U.S. consumer prices dropped 0.8% in April, the biggest since the Great Recession, raising the spectre of deflation as the economy sinks deeper into recession and fuelling the debate about policy responses.

Powell will be speaking on current economic issues in a webcast hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics at 9:00 a.m. (1300 GMT).
Although Fed officials have said they do not see a need to cut interest rates below zero - investors think that will become an option especially if the coronavirus outbreak leads to further deterioration in the U.S. economy.
Top U.S. infectious disease advisor Anthony Fauci on Tuesday warned Congress that a premature lifting of lockdowns could lead to additional outbreaks of the deadly coronavirus.
His comments cast a shadow on optimism in financial markets in recent weeks that the worst period of the epidemic is over and the economy can only get better.
U.S. stock prices also slid, led by high-flying technology shares, adding to the cautious mood on the economic outlook.
That put a brake on a rally in risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar.
The Australian currency  stepped back to $0.6473 from Monday's one-week high of $0.6562. 
It took an additional hit on Tuesday after China banned some Australian meat imports, though it trimmed losses later as Australia's trade minister played down the issue as a technicality.
The New Zealand dollar stood at $0.6082 , down so far in the week but inside its recent trading range ahead of a policy announcement from the country's central bank later in the day.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25% while expanding its quantitative easing programme.
The British pound stood near its lowest levels in five weeks at $1.2264 , pummelled also by continued confusion over government plans to ease lockdown measures, the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe and revived Brexit risks.

Official data published on Tuesday showed Britain's death toll from COVID-19 topped 38,000 as of early May, having overtaken Italy as the worst affected country in Europe.

Investing.com – The dollar cut gains to trade sharply lower on Tuesday as President Donald Trump stoked fresh worries about negative interest rates after calling on the central bank to do more easing.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.32% to 99.95.
Trump said the Federal Reserve should follow its counterparts and cut rates into negative territory to give the U.S. economy a much-needed boost as signs of economic damage continue to mount.


The Labor Department said on Tuesday its consumer price index fell 0.8% last month, with the year-on-year pace slowing to 0.3% from 1.5%.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, recorded consecutive month-on-month declines for only the second time in the series' 63-year history. The last time was 1982, IGN said.
Despite a string of data showing the U.S. economy is set for a long road to recovery, several Fed members are railing against the idea of negative interest rates.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that negative interest rates are not a clear remedy for the coronavirus hit to the U.S. economy. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he does not see negative rates as ""a tool that we would be using in the U.S.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to hit back against the idea of negative rates when he delivers an economic update on Wednesday at 9:00 AM ET (13:00 GMT).
Elsewhere, GBP/USD fell 0.45% to $1.2280, with cable likely set for further losses amid fresh Brexit worries as the U.K. shows little sign that it wants to extend the transition period, risking the possibility of a no-deal Brexit should trade talks with the EU fall through."
83,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) --There were only six new cases, but the resurgence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, the city in China where the pandemic began, was enough to startle market analysts.
Strategists in Europe, including at Rabobank, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA and BMO Capital Markets, cited the rise in infections in their client notes as a worrying statistic.
There’s “mounting evidence that a loosening of lockdowns risks an increase in the number of infections,” said Jane Foley and Piotr Matys, foreign-exchange strategists at Rabobank, in an emailed note.
Another case in point: South Korea, which relied on people’s willingness to get tested to curb the spread of the virus, saw an increase in infections tied to people who frequented bars. Previously, the number of new daily cases dropped to one or two, and sometimes zero.
The news out of Asia comes just in time for Anthony Fauci’s testimony during a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday. The top infectious diseases expert will warn the nation against the dangers of easing lockdowns prematurely. His call for caution is at odds with President Donald Trump’s race to reopen the country.
The reemergence of cases confirms what currency options traders have been warning for weeks, to beware the virus’s second coming. They’ve been expressing their concerns with bets the Swiss franc -- a haven asset -- will strengthen to one per euro for the first time in five years. Demand for nine-month and one-year long-dollar contracts is high.
Their anxiousness over the potential rise in cases also spurred the spread between nine- and one-month risk reversals for the Australian dollar-yen cross -- a risk barometer -- to the widest in three years, with puts over calls.
Bond investors share a similar sentiment, manifested on Tuesday when the U.K. offered a 10-year syndicated bond. It drummed up almost $100 billion in orders.
The same can’t be said for stocks. They’ve been buoyed by optimism over precedented stimulus plans by governments and central banks. Europe’s main stock gauge was up 0.2% as of 2:35 p.m. in London, MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Inc.’s index of global equities climbed 0.2% and the S&P 500 Index, which in April had its best month since 1987, was also up 0.2%.
“Stock market investors in particular have been fairly willing to look through the bad news,” said Foley. “There is a strong risk that the market has not yet fully discounted how big a demand-side shock the world could be facing.""",,,,,

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was marginally lower in early European trade Monday, consolidating after hitting a two-week high against its major peers overnight amid growing fears about a second wave of coronavirus infections.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.248, essentially flat from late Monday, after earlier climbing to 100.513, a two-week high. EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0817, after falling below $1.0800 for the first time in almost a week. GBP/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.2323, and USD/JPY dropped 0.1% to 107.55.
As countries around the world gradually ease restrictions in an effort to restart their economies, investors are becoming anxious about a second wave of infections.
The central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, reported five new cases on Monday, its first new cases since its lockdown was lifted, while South Korea, the Asian poster child on how to deal with the virus, has had to combat a new spike in cases.
In Europe, Germany's Robert Koch Institute reported that the ""reproduction rate"" - the number of people each person infected with the coronavirus goes on to infect - had risen to 1.1. Any rate above 1 means the virus is spreading exponentially. 
The greenback was also buoyed by a steepening U.S. yield curve, as Federal Reserve officials talked down the prospect of negative rates - St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Monday that negative rates stateside would be “problematic.” His counterparts from Atlanta and Chicago, Raphael Bostic and Charles Evans, were similarly dismissive.
Two more more Fed speakers are scheduled to talk late Tuesday - Philadelphia's Patrick Harker and Cleveland's Loretta Mester - and they are likely to weigh in on the issue..
One of the biggest losing currencies Tuesday was the Australian dollar, giving up its recent gains after China suspended meat imports from four Australian abattoirs, fueling concerns that escalating tensions between the two nations are damaging Australia’s most important trading relationship.
At 2:55 AM ET, AUD/USD traded 0.3% lower at 0.6470.
“We are hard pressed to see a strong case to buy the reflationary currencies just yet; on a short-term view,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.

South Korea reported 27 new cases for May 11, breaking a streak of single-digit cases as it eased social distancing measures.
The cases, stemming from a nightclub in Itaewon, led the government to postpone reopening high schools for the academic year.

“Our base case has been for a while now that the risk bounce was overdone, we just don’t think (recovery) is going to be a straight line,” he added.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.26% to 107.38, with the yen saw an overnight loss of around 1% to sit at the bottom end of a range it has kept since mid-April.
The GBP/USD pair was down 0.12% to 1.2320 even after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government released a 50-plus-page “plan to rebuild” overnight.
“Mixed start to the week for the pound - with the cautious U.K. lockdown easing announced by PM Johnson having little lasting impact on the currency after an initial rally in early Asia trading,” Viraj Patel, FX and global macro strategist at Arkera, told CNBC.
“Instead, the dollar remains supported by rising U.S. yields.”
The USD/CNY dropped 0.02% to 7.0956 after Chinese consumer inflation data fell below analyst forecasts.
The country’s consumer price index for April declined 0.9% month-on-month but rose 3.3% year-on-year. The producer price index  for April declined 3.1% year on year.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a two-week high against major peers on Tuesday, propelled by rising U.S. bond yields and increasing safe-haven demand amid growing fears about a second wave of coronavirus infections, which sent riskier currencies lower.
The biggest loser was the Australian dollar, which dropped about 0.8% to a one-week low, while the kiwi extended falls.
The euro (EUR=) fell below $1.08 for the first time in almost a week and the Japanese yen nursed an overnight loss of about 1% to sit at to 107.48 per dollar, the bottom end of a range it has kept since mid April.
The greenback was buoyed by a steepening U.S. yield curve, as Federal Reserve officials talked down the prospect of negative rates, and as the bond market braces for an immense borrowing spree from the U.S. Treasury. 
At the same time, progress on plans to re-open economies has been overshadowed by worries about fresh infections of COVID-19 as easing of restrictions in South Korea and Germany were soon met by spikes in new cases there.
""It's a little bit of yield support (for the dollar) and a general return of nerves,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow, as April's surge in riskier currencies fades away.
""Our base case has been for a while now that the risk bounce was overdone, we just don't think (recovery) is going to be a straight line.""
The dollar has closely tracked investors' risk aversion through the coronavirus crisis. However, rising longer-tenor yields as Washington prepares to borrow some $3 trillion this quarter have added some carry-trade attraction to the currency as well.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the dollar hit a two-week high of 100.440, near the top end of the range which has held it for more than a month.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rose above 0.7% for the first time in a week overnight and held at 0.7099% in Asia, while two-year yields also kicked up after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he is ""not a big fan"" of negative rates.
After punching above its 100-day moving average on Monday, the Aussie  retreated and slipped to $0.6432 on Tuesday following a report that China had suspended some meat imports from Australian abattoirs.
The unconfirmed report in The Australian newspaper, citing unnamed industry sources, was vague about the reason but comes as tension over the origin and handling of the coronavirus chill relations between Australia and its biggest trading partner.
The kiwi  slid 0.4% to $0.6047, while the euro and pound were a tad softer. The euro (EUR=) last sat at $1.0797 and the pound  slipped 0.3% $1.2300.
Besides virus headlines, markets are looking to Chinese consumer inflation data due at 0130 GMT, where an annual rise of 3.7% is expected, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

Fed officials James Bullard and Patrick Harker are due to make remarks at 1300 GMT and 1400 GMT, respectively, ahead of a highly anticipated speech from chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday.

87,"<span>May 11, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve said a facility designed to purchase eligible corporate debt from investors will launch on May 12, bringing a key part of the U.S. central bank’s emergency coronavirus lending program online following weeks of anticipation.
The so-called Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will begin purchases of eligible exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt on Tuesday, the New York Fed said Monday on its website. It was first announced in March and has played an important role in keeping financial markets relatively calm since then. Another facility designed to buy debt directly from issuers -- the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility -- will launch “in the near future,” according to the announcement.
Congress allocated $454 billion in equity to backstop the Fed loans as part of the more than $2 trillion economic relief package passed in March, and the secondary market facility is the first Fed program using funds from the stimulus law to get going. Fed officials first announced the creation of the corporate credit facilities on March 23.
Treasury Backing
The New York Fed said that the U.S. Treasury Department had made $37.5 billion of the $75 billion equity investment it will make in the special purpose vehicle established by the central bank to undertake the primary- and secondary-market credit facilities. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier on Monday he had sent the Fed money for the program.
The “preponderance of ETF holdings” will consist of those mainly exposed to U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds, with the remainder whose prime objective is exposure to U.S. high-yield corporate bonds, the New York Fed announcement said.
Other factors being considered for eligible ETFs include the composition of investment-grade and non-investment-grade rated debt, the management style and the amount of debt held in depository institutions.
Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) Agreement
The reserve bank also posted to its website the investment management agreement with BlackRock, the asset-management giant it’s retained to administer the program.
The corporate credit facilities constitute are among the nine emergency lending programs the Fed is rolling out to help cushion the blow to the U.S. economy from the pandemic and keep credit flowing. They mark a dramatic escalation of the central bank’s interventions in financial markets by stepping into corporate debt -- potentially including the purchase of some sub-investment grade securities -- for the first time since the 1950s.
More information on corporate bond purchases by the secondary and primary facilities is “forthcoming,” the New York Fed announcement said.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.49% to 100.22, from a low of 96.67.
The reopening of the economies globally helped spark risk appetite, with investors seemingly betting than the global growth has likely bottomed, sending Treasury yields higher, boosting the greenback.

The short-lived ban was one of a few protective measures adopted by the government on Thursday when the Turkish lira tumbled intraday to 7.269 versus the dollar, its weakest ever. 
The three foreign banks have now ""fulfilled their obligations in a reasonable time frame,"" said the letter seen by Reuters and confirmed by a BDDK spokesman. 
A BDDK investigation into UBS AG (S:UBSG), Citigroup Inc (N:C), and BNP Paribas (PA:BNPP) continued, the letter said. Bankers said FX trading had slowed on Monday between foreign banks and local state lenders, suggesting the ban left a chill. 
Legal actions were also launched against London-based financial institutions, a state news agency said on Thursday, and regulators were given more authority to prosecute market manipulation. 
Quotes for the value of the lira were a bit lower in local markets on Monday compared to offshore quotes, according to Refinitiv data. 
Two bankers told Reuters this was due to foreign firms slowing trading with state lenders. ""All banks are acutely cautious after the ban last week,"" said a senior banker. ""Especially foreign banks are extremely wary.""
MESSAGE SENT
The lira has tumbled about 16% so far this year due to the coronavirus pandemic that is expected to tip the economy into recession, as well as to investor concerns over Turkey's depleted FX reserves and high external obligations.
In a separate move on Monday that could slow a rise in the current account deficit, the government announced new import tariffs on dozens of goods including dish washers, freezers, jewelry, musical instruments and sanitary products.
Additional tariffs of up to 30% would be applied on the imports of the products until Sept. 30, 2020, and up to 25% after that date, according to the Official Gazette. 
When it banned lira trading at the three foreign banks last week, the BDDK said they did not meet liabilities in due time. 
""I think the message to offshore players has been sent,"" said Tim Ash, senior emerging market analyst at BlueBay Asset Management, adding that dropping the ban was positive because it ""was trying to use a sledgehammer to crack a walnut."" 

Ash said the ban risked collateral damage to both foreign institutional investors and local businesses clearing lira transactions through these banks.

LONDON (Reuters) - A rare gap has opened up between a widely tracked positioning gauge and investor surveys collated by the world's top banks in the global $6.6 trillion per day foreign exchange market.
Leveraged investors, including some hedge funds, are pushing for a weaker U.S. dollar, according to weekly futures data, while institutional investors are betting on more dollar gains, suggesting that dollar strength is unlikely to fade soon. 
With currency markets highly fragmented and spread across multiple time zones, market watchers usually rely on the weekly data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to get an idea on how investors are positioned in FX markets.
The latest data show investors held a net $9.1 billion negative bet on the dollar in the week ending May. 5, making it the eighth consecutive week of short dollar bets. But over that period, the dollar has gained nearly 6% against a basket of other currencies.
""My impression is this positioning data is not totally indicative and it has to be taken with more than a pinch of salt,"" said Francesco Pesole, a strategist at ING.
Hedge fund manager Stephen Jen of Eurizon SLJ Capital said the CFTC data accounts for a tiny slice of FX trading and is dominated by commodity-trading advisors, who are highly leveraged and short term in nature.
Wider positioning data from some of the world's biggest banks, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), RBC and Citibank, that cover a bigger set of flows, including trades on their own platforms, show investors have ramped up their long dollar bets in recent days.
1/PERFORMANCE
A negative dollar view, particularly in the second half of 2020, is premised on the argument that a broader global economic recovery would encourage investors to invest dollar liquidity in relatively higher-yielding and faster-growing economies.
That view hasn't materialised yet, with some currencies which are highly geared with the global economy trading at recent lows and roughly down 25% so far this year. Only the perceived safe-haven Japanese yen is up versus the dollar.

Stefanie Holtze-Jen, chief currency strategist at DWS Group, who is bullish on the dollar, said the focus of the policy response between the United States and Europe has been different. 
""In the former, it has been to get economic growth as quickly as possible, while Europe is prepared to forgo growth to alleviate the healthcare crisis.""

The pound was already weighed down by concern over trade talks between the U.K. and Europe and the economic fallout of the virus when Prime Minister Boris Johnson added one more reason to be uneasy.
The pound weakened as much as 1% against the dollar, the most in three weeks, after Johnson’s public address on Sunday about his government’s plan to ease the nationwide lockdown lacked clarity. The prime minister is currently speaking in the House of Commons about the plan.
It comes just as the U.K. and the European Union begin negotiations over trade issues, the most pressing of which are unlikely to be resolved, officials with knowledge of matter said about two weeks ago.
That’s adding to the anxiety investors feel over the prospects of a messy divorce, and explains why, together with the multitude of factors weighing on the pound, the increase in the currency’s one-month implied volatility in May is among the biggest in the world.
“Investors are concerned about the lack of progress in the post-Brexit talks between the U.K. and the EU and about widespread criticism that the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis was slow and, latterly, that it is vague,” said Jane Foley, senior foreign currency strategist at Rabobank.
A Cruel Month
The pound’s risks are piling up in a month that has historically proved bleak for the currency. Sterling has fallen every May over the past decade, and all but four times since 2000.
Worse still for global currencies is the preference for the greenback as the world’s safe haven currency of choice. Bloomberg’s dollar index advanced 0.4%, bouncing off its 55-day moving average.
“Lower risk sentiment, lower pound,” said Jordan Rochester, a Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura International. “It remains a global pandemic.”
The currency dropped 0.6% to $1.2339 as of 3:33 p.m. in London, and weakened 0.4% against the euro.

A spokesman for the banking regulator confirmed the ban had been reversed.
Turkey imposed the ban last week after market interventions and new anti-manipulation rules failed to stem a lira rout. Restricting foreign investors’ access to lira liquidity made it difficult for them to bet against the currency.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was largely unchanged in early European trade Monday, as investors weighed up the conflicting forces of dismal economic data and the gradual reopening of the globe’s economy.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.785, up 0.02%, while EUR/USD was essentially flat at 1.0843 and GBP/USD pushed 0.1% higher to 1.2420. USD/JPY gained 0.4% to 107.12.
In Europe, shops and hair salons can now reopen in France, the second largest economy in the euro zone, as the country is set to emerge cautiously from one of Europe's strictest lockdowns on Monday. 
Many other European countries, like Denmark, Norway, Spain, Italy and Germany, have also started or are planning to lift lockdown measures, and even the U.K., now the hardest hit country in Europe in terms of deaths, announced tentative plans to lessen social distancing measures. Sterling has risen around 0.5% since Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the measures on Sunday.
Across the pond, California, Michigan, and Ohio, three of the important states for U.S. manufacturing, have taken steps to allow factories and some businesses to resume work.
Yet the number of U.S. unemployment claims since late March soared above 30 million last week, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned overnight that the U.S. unemployment rate could already have reached 25%, not the 14.7% recorded in Friday’s official employment release for April.
There’s little in terms of important economic releases due Monday on the global agenda, but later this week we will have U.S. data on retail sales and Chinese numbers on industrial production and retail sales.
Attention this week may well turn on the EU Commission proposal on the EU Recovery Fund, with the focus being on the size and funding of the fund given the political difficulties that have surrounded the EU’s response to the Covid-19 crisis.
“We remain doubtful that much stimulus will come from a European program, as the size of the Recovery Fund that the European Commission has been mandated to put in place will remain limited,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
At the same time, European Central Bank officials talked up the possibility of more stimulus, undeterred by the recent German court ruling which questioned the legality of some of its monetary policy.
Late last week the Governor of the central bank of France, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, made clear that the ECB would likely step up monetary stimulus before long given the deteriorating outlook for inflation and the ECB’s ‘total’ commitment to its inflation mandate.
In remarks to the finance committee of the French National Assembly, he asserted that ‘in the very name of our mandate, we will be able to go further, and we will most likely have to go further’. 
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel repeated similar sentiments in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose against most of its major peers on Monday as moves by the United States and other countries to re-open their economies raised hopes for a quicker global recovery from a deep recession triggered by the coronavirus health crisis.
Sterling was little changed against the dollar and the euro after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined plans to slowly ease coronavirus lockdown restrictions.
Data on Friday showed the United States shed 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression, but traders are starting to look past such grim economic numbers as they bet on future growth.
""The bad news about the U.S. labour market was pretty much as expected, and people now assume that economic activity will restart sooner rather than later in the United States and Europe,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.
""We don't have to be so bearish on the dollar.""
While the dollar often trades as a safe-haven asset given its reserve currency status, it has recently developed some positive correlation with Wall Street as investors focus on yields.
On Friday, Wall Street indexes rallied, defying the gloom from one of the worst U.S. jobs reports in decades.
The dollar rose 0.23% to 106.90 yen  on Monday in Asia, and was steady at $1.0847 against the euro (EUR=EBS).
The U.S. currency changed hands at 0.9706 Swiss franc .
The Australian dollar , which is often traded as a proxy for risk because of its close ties to China's economy and global commodities, recovered from an early fall and rose to$0.6549.
Across the Tasman Sea (NYSE:SE), the New Zealand dollar  also rose against its U.S. counterpart to $0.6148.
California, Michigan, and Ohio, three important states for U.S. manufacturing, are taking steps to allow factories and some businesses to resume work in a boost to sentiment.
Currency futures suggest the greenback could continue to edge higher.
Speculators trimmed net short positions in the U.S. dollar to $9.148 billion in the week ended May 5 from $10.23 billion the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
Some traders say uncertainty about the virus still poses downside risks for the dollar.
Vice President Mike Pence is not in quarantine and plans to be at the White House on Monday, a spokesman said on Sunday, despite media reports that he was self-isolating after a staffer tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
However, three senior officials guiding the U.S. response to the pandemic have chosen to self-quarantine.
In the onshore market, the yuan  traded at 7.0772, little changed on the day. 
Officials in China have reported a new cluster of infections in the northeastern province of Jilin, which is another cause for concern.
The novel coronavirus first emerged in China late last year and then spread across the globe. 
The pound  was little changed at $1.2432 on Monday in Asia. Against the euro (EURGBP=D3), sterling held steady at 87.28 pence.
Johnson, in a televised address on Sunday, announced a limited easing of coronavirus restrictions that have shuttered much of the economy for weeks, including encouraging some people to return to work.
The government wants the rest of the United Kingdom to take the same approach, but there were immediate divisions, with the leaders of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland saying they were sticking with the existing ""stay-at-home"" message.

Johnson's government has faced criticism over its handling of the pandemic. At nearly 32,000, Britain's coronavirus death toll is the second highest in the world, behind the United States.

95,"<span>May 10, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- There are very few positives for India’s rupee at the moment, the plunge in crude oil prices is a major one.
Cheaper oil could translate into $40 billion of savings for India, balancing the nation’s current account, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The last time the nation posted a current-account surplus was in 2004.
As crude prices tanked, it brought relief for the world’s third-largest oil consumer. The rupee rebounded about 2% from a record low touched last month, with a Bloomberg survey of analysts forecasting that it could rise another 1% by year-end to reach 74.74.
“With so many negatives around, the rupee’s trajectory could have been much, much worse had it not been for the big slump in oil prices,” said Dushyant Padmanabhan, strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. in Singapore. It’s unlikely to be a straight path for the rupee, he said.
Bank of America’s forecasts for the current fiscal year are based on oil prices at $35.5 per barrel and about $44 billion of net imports, which is about half of the previous fiscal year. Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc sees savings of $50 billion, assuming oil prices at $33 a barrel.
Right now, that may be optimistic with the economy in the grip of a virus-induced slowdown.
The case for the rupee will rest on how quickly India recovers, with demand for fuel plummeting amid the nationwide lockdown and the oil price collapse resulting in tax revenue loss of as much as 400 billion rupees ($5.3 billion), according Care Ratings Ltd.
The government will report key data including industrial production this week, all of which will probably show a collapse in activities.
The data will sharpen the focus on another deficit figure -- the burgeoning fiscal gap as Prime Minister Narendra Modi spends to cushion the economic fallout.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). estimates the nation’s budget deficit to widen to 8% of GDP this year, compared with a budgeted 3.5%.
“The key factor driving the rupee going forward will be the government’s fiscal stance,” Goldman analysts led by Danny Suwanapruti, wrote in a note. Any “aggressive fiscal easing could also affect ratings, increase borrowing costs, lead to greater capital outflows, and be associated with a weaker INR.”

Investing.com – The dollar trimmed its losses on Friday, but experts warn the recent strength of the greenback is on borrowed time, particularly against the euro, as its interest rate advantage is slipping away amid expectations for rates to drop into negative territory next year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.17% to 98.73, after hitting a session low of $99.45.
The move of lows comes after investors digested a historic loss of U.S. jobs for the month April as the Covid-19 pandemic led to shuttered businesses across the country.
The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs last month, the worst on record, but below economists’ forecast of 22 million. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%.
But with the parts of the country lifting restriction in recent days, many were quick to suggest that worst was over in the labor market as temporary layoffs made up the bulk of layoffs.
Against the backdrop of rising hopes for an economic recovery, the euro is likely to find its footing and recoup some its losses against the greenback, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
“The Corona crisis brought significantly increased volatility to the EUR-USD exchange rate. Nevertheless, we have not changed the EUR-USD forecast,” Commerzbank said. “The higher risk premium for Europe’s currency, from which EUR-USD is suffering, should be partially reduced with the economic recovery.”
In the hunt for yield, meanwhile, investors have favored the U.S. against other countries, some of which have cut rates to below zero.
But this advantage is wearing thin, Commerzbank argues, as U.S. fed funds futures contracts are pricing in a negative fed funds rate in 2021 amid expectations for a recession.
“More importantly, the former interest rate advantage of the U.S. dollar has permanently shrunk. This does not justify a substantial overvaluation of the USD outside of times of crisis. We continue to expect EUR-USD rates around 1.14 by end-2020,” the bank added.
EUR/USD was up 0.13% to $1.0846, but was on track for weekly loss."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's peso is in increasingly treacherous waters, with twin economic and debt crises at home driving a huge gap between the official rate kept almost static by capital controls and the tumbling black market and other unofficial rates.
The currency  is at around 67 per dollar, with tight controls limiting how much Argentines can convert to foreign currency and a steep tax on any exchange. On the black market, however, dollars are trading at almost 120 pesos.
That marks the widest gap between the two rates since 2014, according to traders and Reuters data, putting major pressure on the official currency and raising the threat of a sharp potential depreciation, analysts said.
""With the current depth of recession, Argentines who want to save will take refuge in safer assets including the informal dollar,"" said Natalia Motyl, an economic analyst at policy research group Libertad y Progreso in Buenos Aires.
The gap is being exacerbated by the tough currency controls, low real interest rates and the country opening the monetary supply taps to bolster an economy already in recession for two years, which is now being hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Argentina is also suffering from high inflation, which was over 50% last year, and is teetering on the edge of default as it looks to revamp $65 billion in foreign debt before a May 22 deadline to make an outstanding interest payment.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note negative real rates and excess liquidity created by the central bank to finance a deepening fiscal deficit ""are putting increasing pressure on the peso"".
""We are increasingly concerned that the risks of a large depreciation of the official USD/ARS rate are growing,"" it said.
For a graphic on Argentine peso strains, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jbyprjxalpe/eikon.png
The central bank has also taken measures to make it harder to access dollars through legal, if unofficial channels, including the so-called ""blue-chip swap"" used by many in Argentina to gain access to greenbacks.
Officially Argentines can only buy a maximum of 200 dollars per month, with a 30% tax on all purchase of foreign currency.
The South American country's leaders says they intend to loosen currency controls, but only the once the fragile economy has stabilized.
Analysts said pressures on the peso would only get worse later in the year, as the economic impact of COVID-19 kicks in. The government is working on an assumption in its debt restructuring talks of a 6.5% contraction in 2020.
""Most likely during the second half of the year the impact will be felt even more,"" said Motyl, explaining that ""there will be more thirst for dollars due to the terror caused by the loss of the value of the peso.""
Economist Horacio Larghi at Argentine consultancy firm Invenómica said the gap to the black market value could also expand beyond the current 80% divergence.
""I am sure that if exchange controls continue to be tightened, the gap with the official rate could undoubtedly exceed 100%,"" he said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar weakened in early European trade Friday as the onslaught of grim economic numbers raised the specter of negative U.S. interest rates, undermining the yield advantage of holding dollar-denominated assets.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.775, down 0.1%, while EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0838 and GBP/USD pushed 0.2% higher to 1.2386. USD/JPY gained 0.1% to 106.41.
Thursday’s initial claims report revealed that 3.169 million Americans claimed unemployment last week, meaning more than 33 million have now filed for support since the coronavirus pandemic ripped through the economy.
This prompted the yield on the two-year Treasury to settle at a record low on Thursday, finishing the trading session at 0.129%, according to Tradeweb, down from 0.180% at Wednesday’s close. 
Investors have started to price in the chance of the Federal Reserve cutting official interest rates below zero for the first time ever, with the January fed funds futures contract reaching a peak of 100.025 on Thursday in New York -- a record high -- indicating a policy rate of negative two and a half basis points.
Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve saying that it does not view negative rates as “appropriate”, a worsening economic downturn could force the Fed’s arm to expand its crisis response.
The April employment report is due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and will capture an entire month of lockdown measures that brought large parts of the economy to a standstill.
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls plunged by 22 million last month. 
That would be 27-times the worst monthly decline during the Financial Crisis and 11-times the record drop of September 1945, the demobilization of World War II, Bloomberg reported.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira remains under pressure despite the country’s banking watchdog barred local lenders from trading lira with Citibank, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and UBS, saying the three foreign banks failed to meet their lira liabilities.
The regulator has recently limited the amount of lira Turkish banks can make available to foreign investors and banks, in an attempt to make it tougher to bet against the local currency.
Turkey faces a relatively high $170 billion in external debt costs this year and has been burning through foreign exchange reserves at a fast pace, trying to defend its currency.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Friday as investors defied a broader sense of doom around upcoming U.S. employment data and found reasons to buy riskier currencies with more governments slowly reopening their economies for business.
The greenback was undermined by a further hit to its yield attraction as U.S. money markets priced in a small chance of negative interest rates next year.
The dollar's index against a basket of six other major currencies slipped to 99.829 (=USD) from Thursday's high of 100.40.
The euro edged back to $1.0835 (EUR=) from Thursday's near two-week low of $1.07665 though it was down about 1.3% on the week.
The Australian dollar traded at $0.6505  after a gain of nearly 1.5% in the previous session.
The dollar's retreat against riskier currencies reflected a recovery in risk sentiment as global shares rallied, with Nasdaq index now wiping out its losses this year. 
On top of aggressive monetary easing around the world, hopes of economic normalisation are supporting the mood as some countries in Europe and parts of the United States ease restrictions on economic activity.
Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar bounced back to 106.295 yen , from a seven-week low of 105.985 touched on Wednesday.
The greenback was also caught off guard as U.S. short-term bond yields hit record low with markets starting to price in negative U.S. interest rates for the first time.
Although Federal Reserve officials have said that they do not see negative rates as appropriate, the price action suggested some investors see a much worse downturn that could force the Fed to become more experimental with its crisis response.
Data on Thursday showed 3.169 million initial unemployment claims for the week ended May 2, more than economists' forecast of 3 million, and bringing total claims since late March to 33.5 million, or about one in every five workers.
The unemployment data due later in the day is expected to show a historic hit to the U.S. labour market. 
Nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have plunged 22 million in April, which would blow away the record dive of 800,000 seen during the 2007-2009 recession.
The unemployment rate is seen jumping to 16% in April, which would shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.
Some traders sold dollars to take profits ahead of the data.
""Everyone knows it is going to be terrible and people are focusing on the pace of a rebound from there,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.

""But because this is an unprecedented pattern, you cannot find any historical example, and where there is no example, even artificial intelligence cannot find an answer.""

100,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- India is taking its first baby steps to tackle a growing offshore market for its currency.
Two exchanges -- India International Exchange (IFSC) Ltd. and NSE IFSC Ltd. -- will on Friday begin trading foreign-exchange settled rupee derivatives, part of a push to bring the market back home.
The launch comes amid the world’s most expansive coronavirus lockdown, which has crippled businesses and hurt trading volumes in the country’s financial markets. The timing may make it harder for the contracts to gain traction even as volumes in rupee trading overseas continue to grow.
“Volumes in an exchange typically take time to pick up,” said Abhishek Goenka, chief executive at India Forex Advisors Pvt. “The bid-ask spreads have to come down and a lot of market-making has to happen to get decent activity.”
India’s policymakers have been increasingly concerned about the growing heft of the rupee trades in venues overseas. The average daily volume for the rupee in London totaled $47 billion in April 2019, according to the Bank for International Settlements. That’s a fivefold jump from 2016, and more than the $34.5 billion of trades executed locally at the time.
NDF Market
Offering onshore rupee derivatives is similar to what Indonesia attempted in 2018, when it launched non-deliverable forward contracts settled in rupiah.
While the forex-settled rupee derivatives may take time to take off, the move will help the Reserve Bank of India get a better grip on the working of the NDF market and help investors get better quotes than the spreads they are charged offshore, India Forex’s Goenka said.
The RBI has allowed local banks to participate in the offshore currency market from June 1, which could pose another obstacle to onshore contracts from becoming popular, analysts say.
NDFs, nominally a tool for hedging, are popular with investors who want to bet on the currency without taking delivery. They’re often used in major financial centers in place of currencies that don’t trade round-the-clock.
Some central banks have blamed NDFs for causing disruptions in local markets when spreads widen overnight. In March, the spread between the one-month onshore and offshore dollar-rupee contract widened by more than one rupee, compared with a gap of less than 10 paise seen normally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It still remains wider-than-usual at about 50 paise.
India’s rupee has been among the worst-performing Asian currencies in the past month, dropping 0.2% versus the dollar.
The onshore currency market should be kept at distance from the NDFs to weaken the transmission of speculation, said Ananth Narayan, a professor of finance and former South Asia head of financial markets at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc.
“I would prefer if the bridges between the onshore and offshore were made thinner,” he said. “Entities with genuine interest should be encouraged to trade onshore by easing hedging rules.”

102,"<span>May 07, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday after traders interpreted comments from a Federal Reserve policy maker as ruling out a Fed swap line to cushion Ankara's depleted reserves.
Thursday's fall to 7.25 pushed it beyond the record low hit during a 2018 currency crisis and extended five sessions of declines as the country grappled with the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. 
At 0800 GMT the lira  stood at 7.24, down 0.5% on the day and matching the August 2018 low. It has lost some 18% this year under pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed 3,584 people in Turkey. 
Turkey's sovereign bonds extended their falls as the lira weakened, with the 2030 issue dropping 2.5 cents. 
Heading for its second recession in less than two years, Turkey has asked the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks for access to funds as its own net currency reserves have fallen to nearly $25 billion from $40 billion so far this year.
A Fed policymaker - asked on Wednesday about extending swap facilities to Turkey and others in need - said the Fed already has lines with countries that have a relationship of ""mutual trust"" with the U.S., and the highest credit standards.
A Turkish foreign exchange trader said those comments helped weaken the Turkish currency. ""We think pressure on lira will continue in the short term,"" the trader said. 
In a call with investors on Wednesday, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak defended Ankara's policies in the face of the currency sell-off, saying Turkish reserves were more than adequate, according to participants on the call.
He also said he was optimistic about sealing a deal for a swap line for foreign currency funding, though he gave few details, they said. But investors fear that Turkey could struggle to address the cash crunch.
""We already have one foot in the hole of a currency crisis,"" said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging market strategy at TD Securities. Turkey's central bank was burning through foreign exchange reserves at a faster pace than any other emerging- market central bank. 

Analysts say the drop in the central bank's reserves is largely due to its funding of state bank interventions to try to stabilise the lira. Compounding worries, Turkey faces a relatively high $170 billion in external debt costs this year.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Thursday, consolidating after gains overnight in the wake of an onslaught of dire economic data. Sterling has shown strength after the Bank of England remained on hold.
At 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.023, down 0.1%, while EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.0812. USD/JPY gained 0.2% to 106.31.
The U.S. dollar had pushed higher overnight after economic data showed that private employers laid off a record 20.2 million workers in April. 
Analysts predict another 3 million Americans claimed unemployment benefits over the past week, with this data due later Thursday.
Sterling recovered from a two-week low against the dollar after members of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee decided unanimously to keep interest rates at 0.1% and opted by a 7-to-2 margin to hold its quantitative easing program at £200 billion. 
At 3:20 AM ET, GBP/USD pushed 0.6% higher to 1.2410.
The central bank had been widely expected to keep rates on hold, but some economists had thought the MPC may tweak its bond-purchasing program - in the end two members voted for a £100 billion increase.
The publication of a briefing with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey will follow later Thursday.
Elsewhere, the Turkish lira fell to a record low earlier Thursday, as investors worried about the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, falling below the record low of 7.24 per dollar hit during the country's last major bout of currency turmoil back in August 2018.
The lira has fallen more than 16% this year, and with no Fed swap line and depleting FX reserves, it’s difficult to see upside for the currency.
At 03:20 AM ET, USD/TRY traded 0.3% higher at 7.2230, having earlier risen to 7.2520.
On the flip side, the USD/CNY pair lost 0.1% to 7.0979 after China's exports unexpectedly rose in April 3.5% from a year earlier, marking the first positive growth since December last year, customs data showed on Thursday.
Later Thursday, the Norwegian central bank meets later Thursday, and is widely expected to stay on hold today, keeping the sight deposit rate at 0.25%. 
“Relative to its most recent economic projections from 13 March, the Norges Bank has already reacted to the deteriorated outlook by cutting rates by an additional 75bp on 20 March,” said Danske Bank, in a research note.
At 03:20 AM ET, USD/NOK traded 0.6% lower at 10.2254.

The pound rallied after the Bank of England refrained from boosting its bond-buying program and held its benchmark interest rate steady.
Sterling recovered from a two-week low as the BOE kept interest rates and quantitative easing unchanged in a rare early morning policy announcement. The central bank has already slashed interest rates to a record low 0.1% and pledged to buy 200 billion pounds ($250 billion) of debt.
The spread of the coronavirus in March drove the pound down to its lowest level since 1985, but it has since recovered some ground to trade around $1.25 over the past month. Still, the outlook for the U.K. economy remains bleak, with the Office for Budget Responsibility suggesting that a 13% contraction this year is plausible.
“The pound could regain some ground given the lack of significant dovish surprises,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA. “In terms of growth and inflation forecasts -- things are looking pretty grim -- but also as expected.”
Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.2369 as of 7:07 a.m. in London, after falling as much as 0.3% before the decision.
Investors will next turn to the gilt market open at 8 a.m. London time. June gilt futures are expected to open anywhere between 137.62 and 137.83 based on moves in bund and Treasury futures. This compares with Wednesday’s closing level at 137.71.
The publication of a briefing with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey will follow two hours later.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) said prior to Thursday’s meeting that the institution had plenty of room to buy more bonds, if needed.

JOHANNESBURG/BENGALURU/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Hobbled emerging market currencies will struggle over the next three months against the stronger dollar as tensions between the United States and China over the coronavirus pandemic mount, a Reuters poll of FX strategists showed.
Just as traders were cosying up to unprecedented aggressive policy easing and some investors were a little more ready to enter risky bets in search of higher yields, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Beijing with new tariffs.
That has reminded many of the allure of safe havens and underpinned the dollar, even following a dizzying 30% run-up for Wall Street over the past several weeks after an initial fall of more than a third as the virus became a full-blown pandemic.
""This is likely to put a serious dent in the head-scratching, math-defying risk-on rally we have seen for much of the week,"" said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank in Hong Kong.
Indeed, 22 of 56 market strategists and analysts polled May 4-6 said currencies from key emerging markets - most of which export raw materials to China - are at risk of modestly weakening in next three months as safe havens remain popular. Sixteen said they would hover around current levels. 
Graphic - Outlook for emerging market currencies over the next three months: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gjnpwejdapw/Emerging%20market.PNG
Many poll respondents said there would be higher FX volatility ahead.
Most emerging market currencies have stabilized after falling to three-year lows at the end of March, one of the worst months on record, with a 3.5% loss. They are down about 6% as a whole since the start of 2020, according to an MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) index (MIEM00000CUS).
Even though the pandemic has subsided in China for now, a possible resumption of the U.S.-China trade war will nudge Beijing's authorities to keep a tight leash on its partly managed yuan currency, the poll suggested.
After weakening to a one-month low on Wednesday, the most actively traded emerging market currency is forecast at 7.05 per dollar in three months, around where it was on Wednesday, strengthening to 7.01 in six months. 
The yuan is then forecast to appreciate about 2% to 6.95 per dollar by this time next year.
But Rabobank's Every, like some other analysts, said the investor optimism that has built up in recent weeks seemed premature.
""The key thresholds to watch are 7.15, which was the high seen this year, and then 7.19, which was the high seen before the 'Phase 1 trade deal' was signed,"" he said.
""Break through the latter and we are in a dark and scary tunnel...and we don't know if the light we see ahead is a way out or just the reflection of a monster's eye."" 
The battered Indian rupee is not expected to recoup its recent losses over the coming year but is predicted to gain about 2% from 75.88 per dollar it was trading at on Wednesday.
South Africa's rand , underpinned by higher interest rates but highly volatile, will likely make modest gains this year but bring returns of almost 10%, tightening to 16.80 per dollar in 12 months from around 18.50 presently.
""Investors do sometimes use low-yield emerging market currencies as a defensive strategy, but then when risk appetite improves, they will likely go for the likes of South Africa where yields are highest in nominal terms and real terms,"" said Absa Capital currency strategist Mike Keenan in Johannesburg.
""Volatility is still high from the peaks of last month. It will only subside further if we get a bit more improvement in the COVID situation and (so long as) any kind of tensions between the U.S. and China don't flare up,"" Keenan added.
The slower spread of coronavirus in some countries had lifted risk sentiment, with New Zealand recording no new cases for a second day in a row this week and Germany, Finland and New York State planning to ease lockdown restrictions.
Many emerging market central banks like those in South Africa, Brazil and India have also been pumping out monetary stimulus to shore up liquidity in their domestic markets, although nothing close to the size of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interventions and dollar swap lines.
Coronavirus infections have either peaked or slowed down in the developed world, but an inflection point has yet to be reached in many emerging markets - a huge area of concern as health facilities aren't anywhere near as prepared or well-funded.

Indigenous leaders in Brazil, for example, asked the World Health Organization on Monday to set up an emergency fund to help protect their communities from the threat of the pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen flirted with a seven-week high against the dollar on Thursday as investors limited their exposure to riskier assets amid dire global economic data, rising trade tensions and concerns over the euro zone.
The yen rose to seven-week high of 105.985 per dollar  and last stood at 106.04. Against the euro, it traded at 114.63 (EURJPY=) yen per euro, having hit a 3 1/2-year high of 114.43 overnight.
""The yen is gaining as there are some questions over the European Central Bank's stimulus and as tensions between the United States and China increase again,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Germany's highest court on Tuesday gave the European Central Bank three months to justify purchases under its bond-buying programme, or lose the Bundesbank's participation in one of its main stimulus schemes.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday renewed his aggressive criticism of China, as the Trump administration weighs punitive actions against Beijing over its early handling of the virus outbreak.
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was closely watching to see if China is fulfilling its obligations under a Phase 1 trade deal the two countries signed in January before the coronavirus spread globally.
On the economic data front, U.S. private employers laid off a record 20.2 million workers in April in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The staggering number, while widely anticipated since 30.3 million people had filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21, underscored the colossal damage to the economy.
In Europe, euro zone business activity almost ground to a halt last month while retail sales suffered their largest decline on record in March amid government-imposed lockdowns.
In the UK, British construction suffered its sharpest decline on record, more than twice as large as the previous month, even though general construction work was not ordered by the government to stop.
The euro changed hands at $1.0799 (EUR=) after three straight days of falls so far this week, hit also by the German court decision challenging the country's participation in the European Central Bank's stimulus.
The British pound eased a tad on Thursday to $1.2324 , touching its lowest level in almost two weeks.
The risk-averse mood undermined emerging market currencies.
The Brazilian real dropped to 5.714 per dollar , just a hair above its record low touched last month after rating agency Fitch lowered the country's credit rating to negative.
Brazil's central bank slashed interest rates more than expected on Wednesday in a move aimed at shoring up the coronavirus-hit economy but one also likely to undermine the real further.

The currency has lost 4% so far this month, and 29.7% since the start of year, the worst among major emerging market currencies.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will continue to dominate currency markets for at least another three months as investors prefer the safety of the greenback in a world fraught with risks emanating from the coronavirus crisis, a Reuters poll showed.
Having brought the world economy to a near-standstill and caused the fastest rout in financial markets since the Great Depression, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to deter investors from taking risky bets until signs of recovery emerge.
But with hopes of a quick recovery fading, and the world economy bracing for a slow and potentially prolonged recovery, the dollar is likely to remain favored by investors who are for now keen on preserving their capital. 
While most major currencies were subjected to deep losses, the dollar has gained over 3.5% this year and the currency's domination - which started more than two years ago - is at minimum likely to extend for another three months.
Rabobank's head of FX strategy Jane Foley said: ""although perhaps we have gone through the initial panic phase, over the next couple of months we are going to see a lot of economic data, and this data invariably will be shockingly poor.""
""I think it's going to be a very low-risk environment from the point of view of investors and ... there will be big reluctance to move into some of the more vulnerable countries in the world.""
A majority of analysts who answered an additional question - 26 of 34 - said the dollar's dominance will at least continue into the next quarter. Seven said less than three months, while only one said it was already over. 
(Graphic: How long will the U.S. dollar's dominance last? IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/bdwvkrkmbpm/U.S.%20dollar.PNG) 
But any moves out of the dollar will be highly dependent on how the pandemic plays out. Without any dramatic shift in risk assessment, capital is likely to favor developed markets, which are considered to be low risk.
A significant majority of analysts - 25 of 40 - who answered another additional question said developed market currencies were likely to perform better against the dollar over the next three months.
Nine chose emerging currencies and the remaining six picked commodity-linked currencies.
(Graphic: What will perform better against the dollar over the next 3-months? IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/qmypmnbrdvr/FX%20poll.PNG)
However, analysts are less optimistic about the dollar's performance over the longer term as they expect the global reserve currency to give up some of its gains in a year's time.
While most major currencies are expected to rise against the greenback over the next 12 months, those expected gains, if realized, will still not cover the losses they have accumulated so far this year.
Despite its underperformance in the spot market, median forecasts have stayed remarkably stable, suggesting no real change to the euro's outlook, except for a lone voice predicting the currency to hit parity against the dollar in six months - the first such respondent in nearly three years.
The euro, the largest and most liquid among currency pairs, is forecast to make up all of the 3.5% loss it has incurred this year and gain another 2.0% to trade around $1.14 in 12 months. 
So while it is clear the dollar will remain dominant over the coming months, it is far from clear that trend will remain in place once the economic and financial disruption from the pandemic subsides.
""You have to take into consideration that over the last four or five years when the dollar was strong the U.S. dollar had quite a significant yield advantage over other major currencies and the U.S. economy was outperforming,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG.
""But we think in 12 months' time when things do normalize, normal is going to be different from what it was 12 months ago because if you look at yields in the U.S. now, they are basically on the floor as well, and that yield differential has evaporated.""

Investing.com – The pound slipped to nearly two-week lows against the greenback on Tuesday as construction activity fell to its lowest level ever as the nationwide lockdown brought activity to a halt.
The purchasing managers' index for UK construction dropped to a reading of 8.2 in April, down from 39.3 the prior month, the lowest level since the survey began in 1997.
The fall in construction adds to a string of poor economic data seen this week, with the all-important services sector also deep in contraction.
The slip in the pound comes just a day ahead of the Bank of England meeting. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold, but may tweak its bond-purchasing program and warn against the idea of a quick economic recovery.
The BoE last month unveiled a larger-than-expected £200 billion ($247 billion) quantitative-easing package, which for the ""time being, gives policymakers plenty of scope to keep expanding the balance sheet,"" ING said.
""We’d expect the Bank of England to also push back on the idea of a ‘V-shaped’ recovery this week,"" it added.
ING estimates the UK economy will experience a 10% to 15% peak-to-trough fall in output, though said it wouldn’t be surprised if the bank penciled in a sharper decline.

The euro is heading for the worst week in a month after a surprise ruling by a German court hurt confidence in the European Central Bank’s ability to manage the region’s economic recovery.
The common currency has fallen 1.5% in three days, wiping out the previous week’s gains that came after the ECB left the door open to increasing stimulus. That is now in doubt after the ruling from Germany’s constitutional court that the ECB must justify the necessity of its bond-buying program, even though Europe’s top court has ruled in favor of it.
“Two of Europe’s top courts arguing about the legality of bond-buying in the middle of a pandemic inject uncertainty into a market that doesn’t need it and does nothing to boost confidence,” Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA, wrote in a note.
The euro fell 0.3% to $1.0812 by 12:45 p.m. in London, after dropping 0.6% Tuesday. Sentiment in the options market has also turned more negative on all contracts from the next week to the coming year. The risk of the currency retesting March lows around $1.0635 is growing, according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
The European Commission said on Wednesday that the currency’s future could be in danger if the economic recovery was handled badly.

Turkish policy makers are ramping up their defense of the lira, which is edging closer to a record low despite concerted efforts to keep a lid on depreciation.
The central bank on Tuesday raised the amount of foreign-currency swaps private lenders can hold on their books, people familiar with the decision said. That could be a sign the monetary authority is preparing to increase its hard-currency buffer by borrowing more from domestic lenders, as state banks continue to intervene on the spot market to prevent the lira weakening.
The currency fell for a fifth day to 7.1213 per dollar as of 10:31 a.m. in Istanbul, extending its loss this year to 16%. Its all-time low, set in 2018, is 7.2362.
The central bank’s move comes as Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law, prepares to hold a conference call with global investors at 4 p.m. Turkish time. While the invitation didn’t specify what he would talk about, he may discuss the lira and the central bank’s dwindling reserves.
On Monday, the banking authority moved to further restrict foreign traders’ access to lira liquidity in an apparent bid to deter short selling. Some local banks were asked not to offer any liras to clients abroad, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The regulator confirmed in a statement late Tuesday that it was limiting banks’ repo transactions, deposits, loans and other placements abroad in lira to 0.5% of their equity. The measures will stand until the coronavirus outbreak ends, it said.
The shortage of liras to lend to foreign investors has periodically squeezed offshore funding rates, forcing traders betting against the currency, or hedging their exposure to Turkish assets, to exit their positions.
The lira has come under pressure amid monetary easing from the central bank. It’s lowered its main interest rate by more than 15 percentage points since July to 8.75%, taking it below the rate of inflation.
At the same time, Turkish authorities have sold dollars to slow the lira’s decline, while making it difficult for foreign investors to trade local assets. State banks sold around $500 million of foreign currency on Tuesday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
Turkey’s state banks don’t comment on interventions in the foreign-exchange market.
Floating Regime
Last week, central bank Governor Murat Uysal said Turkey isn’t defending any specific currency level and that it maintains a floating exchange-rate regime. In January, he said state banks have been carrying out transactions in line with regulatory limits and may continue to be active in the currency market.
Turkey’s gross reserves, including gold, have dropped by about $20 billion this year to $86.4 billion through April 24, the lowest level since October 2018. Net reserves -- which exclude some liabilities such as lenders’ required reserves -- are down more than $15 billion, to just over $25 billion.
When money borrowed from local lenders via swaps is stripped out from net reserves, they fall below zero, according to Bloomberg calculations.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Wednesday, with the tone cautious given the event risk, including a central bank meeting and key U.S. unemployment data, later this week.
At 2:40 AM ET (0640 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.925, up 0.2%, while EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0822. GBP/USD edged lower to 1.2432 and USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 106.39.
The euro has seen selling, falling to a one-week low of $1.0817, after Tuesday’s decision by Germany's highest court to give the European Central Bank three months to justify purchases under its bond-buying program.
“While a clear blow to the ECB and not least the European Court of Justice, for now the bond purchases will continue unaffected,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “We think the primary market concern lies in the potential limitations that this verdict may hold for the ECB in the future amid lack of eurozone fiscal cooperation.”
This comes as German factory orders slumped 15.6% in March, their biggest monthly decline since German reunification in 1990, as the coronavirus slashed domestic and foreign demand for goods from Europe's biggest economy. 
Sterling has also edged lower ahead of Thursday’s Bank of England meeting. The U.K.’s central bank has announced a wide range of measures since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, including slashing rates  to record lows and ramping up its quantitative easing program to £645 billion. 
With this in mind, new stimulus is unlikely to be unveiled Thursday, but the foreign exchange market will be keeping a wary eye on the bank’s updated macroeconomic projections and comments regarding the possibility of a further increase in the QE program down the line, particularly as incoming economic data looks so weak.
Later in the session sees the release of  ADP (NASDAQ:ADP)'s private sector employment report for April, the first full measure of a month the country spent on lockdown restrictions, ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls. This should give a flavor about the rise in U.S. unemployment during the month and whether government support measures such as the Paycheck Protection Program targeting small and medium-sized enterprises are having any positive effects on layoffs."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The yen scaled a three-year high against the euro and a seven-week peak on the dollar on Wednesday, after a court decision challenging German participation in Europe's stimulus program and worries about a bumpy global recovery spooked investors.
Germany's highest court on Tuesday gave the European Central Bank three months to justify purchases under its bond-buying programme, or lose the Bundesbank as a participant in a scheme aimed at cushioning economic blow from the coronavirus.
The news sent the euro (EUR=) to a one-week low of $1.0826 overnight and it slumped to a three-year trough of 115.09 yen (EURJPY=) in Asia, as traders fretted about both the scheme and the euro's future.
Bears were also on the ascendancy elsewhere, as risk-exposed majors dipped a tad and the safe-haven yen  cracked through resistance against the dollar to hit a seven-week high of 106.20. 
Currency and stock markets have been fickle this month, as dire economic indicators and concerns about U.S.-China tensions have held optimism about lifting COVID-19 lockdowns in check.
""The yen has been the pick of the major currencies since the crisis started, and that should continue,"" Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said in a note.
""The level of yields is biggest driver of yen strength and they'd have to go up a fair bit globally to make the yen weaken."" Long-dated U.S. yields rose overnight, as the U.S. plans a borrowing spree, but remain near historic lows. 
The yen gained almost half a percent on the Australian dollar to 68.25 yen (AUDJPY=) and is close to a three-week high. The Aussie and kiwi slipped slightly on the greenback, though held above 64 cents and 60 cents respectively. 
The Aussie  last sat at $0.6422 and the New Zealand dollar  at $0.6044. The pound  was steady at $1.2431. 
The German court decision is unlikely to completely derail Europe's stimulus program since the European Central Bank will probably be able to provide the required justification for its bond purchases.
But resulting uncertainty is only the latest strain on Europe's teetering coronavirus response.
The pandemic's heavier toll on indebted Italy and Spain, compared with Germany, has revived tension between wealthy northern and poorer southern European member states - leaving politicians divided and the ECB to do the heavy lifting.
""This will be the second time we have been in a major crisis where the ECB has been put under heavy pressure,"" St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard said on Tuesday.
""This very much is a stress test for the euro and the European project to be able to react to this crisis in an effective way,"" Bullard said in web cast remarks. ""I am just hopeful this will be a catalyst.""
Elsewhere U.S. President Donald Trump has again pressed China about the origins of the outbreak that has killed more than a quarter of a million people since it started in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Markets are awaiting a response from Beijing to his latest comments, which last week included a threat of fresh tariffs on Chinese goods.

LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange traders are increasingly turning to a new breed of algorithms that can execute transactions smoothly in volatile markets, according to a client report from JPMorgan's trading desk seen by Reuters that covered recent market conditions.
The turmoil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic resulted in market volatility surging unexpectedly and bid-ask spreads on even some of the most actively traded currencies widening to levels last seen during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis.
Clients of JPMorgan looked to so-called adaptive algorithms to give them an edge, leading to the U.S. bank's algos claiming a larger share of its electronic currency trading business, according to the report by the bank's FX electronic trading desk.
The study chimes with Reuters findings that investment banks more broadly have seen a surge in clients trading with ""algos"" since early March, with the growth eclipsing the broader increase in FX trading volumes.
JP Morgan (N:JPM) is the top dealer in electronic FX trading among financial clients, according to a survey by consultancy Greenwich Associates published this month. As such, its business can be viewed as one indicator of the growing popularity of algo trading in the broader $6.6 trillion a day FX market.
More than 60% of trades for ticket sizes of more than $10 million were executed in March via algorithms compared with less than 50% a year ago, the bank's electronic trading desk said.
""The increased challenge of targeting a specific price, an increased market impact risk, an increased client comfort in adaptive algo logic and a decrease in concerns relating to time risk are just a few contributing factors in why adaptive and scheduled orders have become more widely used than limit-based orders,"" the report said.
LIQUIDITY POOLS
Algo usage is a relatively new phenomenon in currency markets, where computer-driven trading has been far slower to catch on than in equities. Only a fraction of trading in currencies is executed via algorithms.
Even in that space, first-generation strategies such as volume-weighted and time-weighted algos were dominant, allowing investors to measure their execution performance by having as little market impact as possible.
Those strategies have ceded ground to adaptive algorithms in recent months, a new generation of sophisticated software that can change trading strategies based on changing volumes, market impact and widening bid-offer spreads.
""Some large banks have a head start in the electronic trading space because of their focus on technology and access to broader liquidity pools,"" said Satnam Sohal, a principal at Greenwich Associates.
The inroads made by these algos are, however, limited to the most liquid currencies in the world such as the euro, yen and the U.S. dollar, and restricted to the cash markets.
Some large banks like Goldman Sachs (N:GS) are planning to widen their usage in the growing FX swap markets.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Tuesday, as a senior official in the Trump administration tried to ease tensions between the U.S. and China over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
At 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.51, down 0.1%, while EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0909. GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2458 and USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 106.66.
Deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger insisted Monday the United States is not considering “punitive measures” against China over its handling of the pandemic, taking a more conciliatory stance after some of the recent hostility toward Beijing from other members of the U.S. government, including the President himself.
The aggressive stance from the U.S. administration had raised fears over the weekend of another trade war between the two most powerful economies in the world, resulting in flows into the dollar as a safe haven.
Also of note Tuesday will be movements of the euro given the ruling by the German constitutional court on the legality of the ECB’s public sector purchase program is scheduled for 4 AM ET (0800 GMT).
The German court is not expected to rule the program illegal, as the European Court of Justice has already ruled in favor, but it could impose restrictions on the Deutsche Bundesbank's participation in ECB bond-buying.
“This could undermine European Union cohesion in the face of the worst post-war economic contraction, overshadowing efforts to channel funds to weaker southern EMU members such as Italy – possibly widening these countries’ bond spreads with Germany,” said David Marsh, chairman of the independent central banking forum OMFIF, in a research note.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar is posting gains against the U.S. equivalent following the conclusion of the latest meeting of the country’s central bank.
The  Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates on hold at its record low of 0.25 per cent as Australia continues to battle with the coronavirus’ impact on its economy. While this move was largely expected, there was a minority that expected the RBA to cut interest rates once more to 0.15%.
RBA governor Philip Lowe warned that Australia is currently going through a “very difficult period”, saying that even in the central bank’s baseline scenario, unemployment is set to hit 10 per cent while productivity will also fall by that amount. The Australian government also warned that it expected GDP to contract 10% in the current quarter.
At 02:30 AM ET, AUD/USD traded at 0.6449, up 0.4%.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar handed back a sliver of recent gains to commodity currencies on Tuesday as oil prices bounced back, but hung on against the yuan as traders weighed optimism about a coronavirus recovery in China against fears about rising Sino-U.S. tensions.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars inched ahead, after recouping Monday's falls - putting the Aussie  back over 64 cents at $0.6445 and the kiwi  holding on at $0.6062.
Public holidays in Japan and China lightened trade, while caution on the global growth outlook and looming Australian and New Zealand central bank meetings capped further moves. 
The yuan  rose to 7.1190 per dollar in offshore trade, recovering from a six-week low of 7.1560 hit in the previous session, but well below the range where it spent last month.
U.S. President Donald Trump has stepped up verbal attacks on China ahead of a Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election where both he and Democratic contender Joe Biden are jostling to project a tough stance against the United States' main strategic rival.
An internal Chinese report warns that Beijing faces a rising wave of worldwide hostility in the wake of the outbreak that could tip relations with the United States into confrontation, people familiar with the paper told Reuters.
Trump has floated tariffs, or even reneging on U.S. debt obligations to China as retaliatory possibilities as he seeks to pin blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, tempering traders' optimism about progress towards economic recovery elsewhere.
""The yuan is that bellwether that everybody's going to be looking at,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp. Its softness muted gains in Asian currencies, such as Malaysia's ringgit , he said, even as oil prices bounced.
The cautious trading backdrop also pushed the yen ahead slightly to 106.53 per dollar , within striking distance of multi-month lows. 
U.S. crude rose (CLc1) about 5% and Brent (LCOc1) around 3% as production fell and countries around the globe including Italy, Finland and several U.S. states eased lockdown restrictions. 
Elsewhere, the euro was pressured by a court challenge from German academics to the European Central Bank's bond buying program.
A ruling is due later on Tuesday and while outright rejection of the German Bundesbank's participation in the asset purchases appears unlikely, anything less than a clear-cut defeat of the challenge could hit the single currency.
The euro (EUR=) last sat at $1.0914, close to a week-low hit overnight. The pound  was rangebound at $1.2461.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is due to announce its interest rate settings at 0430 GMT, with markets focused on commentary in the statement since a policy change is unlikely.

""The RBA's post-meeting statement could spark some AUD volatility if it offers further insights into the RBA's latest economic forecasts,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) FX analyst Kim Mundy.

117,"<span>May 04, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia is set to cut its benchmark interest rate by a bigger-than-usual 50 basis points on Tuesday to help cushion the economy just as the government begins relaxing restrictions put in place to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The central bank will lower the overnight policy rate to 2%, the lowest level since 2010, from 2.5%, according to 14 of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the third reduction in a row and the biggest in more than a decade. Five analysts see a 25 basis-point easing and one predicts no change.
Bank Negara Malaysia’s rate decision comes a day after almost the entire economy was allowed to reopen, easing a lockdown that has cost the country an estimated 63 billion ringgit ($14.6 billion), according to Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. Still, some states are deferring the move as new infections started to rebound over the weekend. Malaysia is set to fully lift its movement restrictions on May 12, almost two months after it was imposed.
The central bank has already unveiled a slew of measures to boost the economy, including a six-month loan moratorium and a financing guarantee program for small businesses.
Here’s what to watch out for in the statement:
Growth Estimates
The central bank last month estimated economic expansion for this year in a range of -2% to 0.5% growth, assuming the lockdown ended on April 14. A lot has happened since then. The government extended the Movement Control Order by another month and added more restrictions, including curfews, with each day costing the economy an estimated 2.4 billion ringgit.
With almost all sectors allowed to resume operations now, Trade Minister Azmin Ali expects the relaxed lockdown to spur growth and investment, as well as generate export prospects. CGS-CIMB Securities International Pte. revised this year’s growth forecast to a 4.3% contraction, from a 6% decline earlier, due to businesses reopening, according to a report on Monday.
What Bloomberg Economists Say
“Bank Negara Malaysia may cut its policy rate by 50 bps to 2.00% on Tuesday. The economic outlook has changed dramatically since BNM’s previous policy meeting on March 3. The coronavirus became pandemic, governments worldwide (including Malaysia) locked down their economies to contain the spread, and financial markets melted down in an historic fashion.”
Tamara Mast Henderson, Asean economist
More Stimulus
Malaysia’s stimulus package is the largest in Southeast Asia at 17.6% of gross domestic product, Kenanga Research said in a note. That hasn’t spared local businesses from struggling, with the agriculture and services sectors registering job losses amounting to 22% and 15% of their respective workforce, according to a Statistics Department survey in the first two weeks of the lockdown.
Muhyiddin has said his administration is working with the central bank and other agencies to prepare short- and long-term strategies to revive the economy. The Finance Ministry has also urged banks to waive additional interest on deferred payments.
The central bank could lower the statutory reserve requirement ratio again, from 2% currently, to boost liquidity and help support the banking sector, Wellian Wiranto, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., wrote in a research note.
Deflation Trend
Consumer prices declined for the first time in more than a year, dropping 0.2% in March from a year ago, on the back of falling transport costs. That’s within the central bank’s estimate for inflation to average -1.5% to 0.5% this year on lower global oil and commodity prices.
The figure marks the start of a deflation trend for 2020, according to United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY) Ltd. economists Julia Goh and Loke Siew Ting. With an expected rise in unemployment and lower spending coupled with weak demand, Malaysia could be headed to its first annual deflation since 1969, they wrote.

118,"<span>May 04, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The economy is crashing like never before, yet Hong Kong’s interest rates are expected to stay relatively elevated. That’s bad news for pretty much everyone apart from those betting on prolonged strength in the city’s currency.
Liquidity tightness in Hong Kong, partly caused by central bank moves to drain cash from the interbank market several years ago, contrasts with U.S. moves to slash borrowing costs. The resulting gap in interest rates -- near the widest since 1999 for the one-month tenor -- makes selling the greenback to buy the Hong Kong dollar a profitable trade due to the city’s currency peg.
While the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is now adding funds when it intervenes to defend the peg at the strong end, the amounts are insufficient to do much to shift the gap. The spread widened last month even as the HKMA injected $2.7 billion.
“For the interest-rate gap to narrow significantly enough, Hong Kong needs to see strong capital inflows from overseas funds,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. “But investor confidence won’t return until the pandemic is over, and that won’t happen in the near term.”
The city’s economy shrank 8.9% in the first quarter from a year earlier, a government report showed Monday. That’s the worst drop in data going back to 1974, according to the Census and Statistics Department Hong Kong. It marks the third straight quarterly contraction for the city, which experienced widespread disruptions as anti-government protests broke out in the second half of 2019.
Elevated funding costs, which underpin things like mortgages and corporate lending, may make companies and households less willing to borrow, according to Eddie Cheung, an emerging-market strategist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA. The HKMA last lowered its benchmark rate in March by 64 basis points, less than the 1 percentage-point cut deployed by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The distortions are a side effect of maintaining the currency peg. While the city has benefited from the stability the peg provides, the trade off is a loss of control over monetary policy. In the years after the global financial crisis, while Hong Kong’s economy was booming, ultra-low borrowing costs helped fuel a property bubble. Now, it faces the reverse, despite falling U.S. rates.
The one-month borrowing cost in the first quarter of 2011 -- when the economy grew at a blistering 7.6% -- never rose above 0.2%. It currently stands at 1.1%, versus about 0.3% for the U.S. equivalent.
Hong Kong dollar bears like Crescat Capital’s Kevin Smith say the currency peg is unsustainable due to the city’s diminishing role as an international banking haven. He’s holding on to his short-Hong Kong dollar positions despite the recent strength, betting it will depreciate all the way to the weak end of the band.
Questions have been raised about the durability of the peg since it was created in 1983 to stabilize confidence and outflows during uncertainty over the then-British colony’s future. The U.K. and Chinese governments agreed on the city’s return to mainland control the following year.
George Soros tried and failed to bet against the peg in 1998, while Bill Ackman’s wager on a dramatic strengthening in 2011 also proved fruitless.
The HKMA’s shrinking aggregate balance is partly responsible for the city’s tight liquidity conditions. The gauge of interbank cash supply is down 70% over the past two years, near the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Most of that money was drained by the de-facto central bank to defend the currency peg as the Hong Kong dollar was repeatedly pushed to 7.85 per greenback, the weakest it can technically trade.
The HKMA may have to boost the aggregate balance to as high as HK$150 billion ($19 billion) in the second quarter for rates to shift lower, analysts have said. The balance is currently at HK$84.7 billion, and will increase to HK$94.7 billion after May 6.
The city will ensure its money and foreign-exchange markets operate smoothly, HKMA chief Eddie Yue said a statement last month.
Another sign of tight liquidity can be found in lenders’ balance sheets. The city’s banks have far less idle cash on hand after the amount of funds on loan soared to the highest since 2002 relative to deposits. The latest data shows their loan-to-deposit ratio was at 90% in February, compared to just under 70% in 2009. Local currency savings increased just 2.5% last year, the least in more than a decade.
To be sure, borrowing costs have fallen, just not as fast as those in the U.S. The one-month interbank rate was as high as 2.7% at the end of last year.
But for now, it looks like those betting on currency strength have time on their side, something that can’t be said for the city’s businesses facing a ravaged economy.

119,"<span>May 04, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- It is only the start of May and the pound has already seen its entire April rally wiped out, just as established seasonal trends point to further declines.
The British currency could be in for a particularly unforgiving time. May has been its worst month every year since 2010 with an average decline of 2.3% against the dollar, according to analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities. That adds to headwinds for a currency already contending with the economic shock from the pandemic as well as drawn-out Brexit uncertainty.
“The negative seasonality appears to have intensified in recent years, with 2018 and 2019 posting more than 3% negative returns in sterling-dollar,” said BofA analysts including Kamal Sharma, in a client note.
“As much as April is a positive month for the pound, driven in large part by the new U.K. tax year and corporate dividend repatriation of overseas income, May is a month where dollar strength is the main driver for sterling-dollar under-performance,” Sharma added.
The pound fell as low as $1.2406 Monday, enough to wipe last month’s 1.4% advance during May’s second session. That’s after April was 2020’s only bright spot, which in itself followed sterling’s worst first quarter since 2016.
Alongside the pound, currencies such as the Australian dollar, Norway’s krone and the euro also struggle, according to BofA.
“This pattern of FX performance strongly suggests that May is a risk-off month,” Sharma wrote. “The only currencies that may prove immune to the broad-based rally in dollar are the Swiss franc and yen which could buck usual seasonal trends in an unprecedented market environment.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar surged against most major currencies on Monday amid fears that last year's U.S.-China dispute will be re-ignited, this time over the novel coronavirus. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pinned the blame for the pandemic on China, where the new coronavirus outbreak is believed to have originated.
The latest salvo came from Pompeo on Sunday, who said there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
""This morning's session is being dominated by risk-averse trading as investors weigh the negative consequences to global growth from another escalation in U.S.-China tensions,"" said Simon Harvey, currency analyst at broker Monex Europe. 
""The headlines of further tariffs and supply-chain disruptions come at a time where global growth expectations are already fragile, causing currencies such as sterling and the euro to trade on the back foot this morning despite exit measures set to be announced or implemented in their respective economies,"" Harvey said. 
The euro was last down 0.4% at $1.0932 (EUR=EBS). Sterling was also down by 0.4% to $1.2442 .
The dollar was also rising against Scandinavian currencies, which are so vulnerable to global trade risks. The Swedish crown was last down 0.6% at 9.8995 versus the dollar  and the Norwegian crown was falling by 0.8% at 10.3975 .
However, the biggest move in the currency markets was the Chinese yuan, which fell to a six-week low of 7.1555 against the dollar in the offshore market . It was last flat at 7.1380, but if falls again, the next levels to watch would be the mid-March low of 7.1651 and early-September low of 7.1975.
Analysts were debating how the United States might attack China again - with more trade tariffs or even cancelling the payments on the U.S. Treasurys that China owns - but they all agreed the dollar/yuan cross would see higher volatility. 
""A re-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions has the potential to bring an end to the relative stability in USD/CNY,"" said Lee Hardman, a forex strategist at MUFG. 
The moves extended a dour start for May, which began with Friday's bleak U.S. data and the threat of a fresh trade-war between the world's two biggest economies.
Pompeo did not provide evidence, or dispute a U.S. intelligence conclusion that the virus was not man-made. But the comments double down on Washington's pressure on China as U.S. deaths and economic damage mount.

The ultimate safe-haven currency - the Japanese yen - was the only major currency that rose against the U.S. dollar, last trading up 0.2% at 106.71 .

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has seen some buying in early European trade Monday, with the escalating war of words between U.S. and China over the origin of the coronavirus causing a flight to safety.
At 3:00 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.377, up 0.3%, while EUR/USD fell 0.4% to 1.0938. GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.2462 and USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 106.81.
The latest move from U.S. officials to pin the blame on China for the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic came from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Sunday, who stated there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, without providing any details.
This followed on from President Donald Trump’s threats Friday of fresh trade-war hostilities between the world's two biggest economies, as Washington continued to pile the pressure on Beijing.
This comes as the evidence of the economic damage caused by the outbreak mounts - China has reported its first quarterly GDP contraction since such records began, while some 30 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment in the last six weeks.
“Trump’s weapon of choice (to win over the workers again) could be China-bashing in combination with renewed isolationism,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
“The corona virus may have offered Trump a chance to ‘reveal’ that the trade deal is 100% off, and to take a renewed China aggressive stance into the election instead,” Nordea added.
 
Worries that this spat may turn into another trade war, just a few months after the first round of the trade deal between the two powers was signed ending the last damaging conflict, are hitting risk appetite.
The price of crude has also turned lower as a consequence, hitting the petrocurrencies, and the Norwegian krone in particular.
At 3:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5.7% lower at $18.66 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $26.18.
The big event of the week for Norway’s currency is Thursday’s Norges Bank meeting, but ahead of this the primary drivers of the krone remain “global prospects for the reopening of the economy, physical oil demand recovery, global asset prices and continued NOK buying by Norges Bank on behalf of the Ministry of Finance,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
The krone weakened on Friday in the absence of Norges Bank’s purchases--there was a holiday in Norway--and that has continued Monday.
At 3:00 AM ET, USD/NOK traded 1.9% higher at 10.40 and EUR/NOK gained 1.5% to 11.36."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro stabilised against the U.S. dollar on Friday, having rallied the day before to a two-week high on month-end flows and on news that the European Central Bank will make loans to banks even cheaper.
Much of Europe was closed on Friday for the International Workers' Day, as was much of Asia, but a new month brings a new set of worries to investors as coronavirus infections rise to 3.3 million globally, claiming more than 230,000 lives. 
The U.S. dollar was down slightly against the Japanese yen as well, trading at 107.07 yen , though another metric of distress in the markets - the Australian dollar - fell by 1% to 0.6447, its weakest since Tuesday .
The Canadian dollar also fell, by 0.5% to 1.4016 against the greenback .
Analysts attributed the moves to poor equity performance in the United States. 
""The late day fall in the S&P 500 diminished the market's gains for the month and turned April from the best month since October 1974 to the best month since January 1987,"" said Marshall Gittler, a forex analyst at broker BDSwiss.
""The mood was reflected in currencies as well, with CHF the top gainer and AUD and CAD leading the way lower,"" he said. 
Sterling gave up some of the gains it made the day before, trading down 0.4% against both the dollar and the euro, at $1.2550  and 87.31 pence respectively (EURGBP=D3).

The euro was last up 0.1% at $1.0969 (EUR=EBS).

The euro jumped to a two-week high versus the dollar around the time of the 4 p.m. London fix on Thursday as demand surged. Nearly $3.7 billion worth of euro futures contracts traded in the half hour preceding the fix, the highest for any comparable period since March 6.
The jump in volume followed the expiry of nearly 2.1 billion euro ($2.3 billion) worth of options at a strike price of 1.08 for the euro-dollar pair, while another 1 billion euros of similar options rolled-off the day before. The common currency had earlier weakened after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged and said it was ready to do whatever was needed to support the region’s economy.
The drop in volatility in euro from a month earlier also played a part in boosting volume Thursday. The fear surrounding the coronavirus pandemic pushed volatility higher in March, prompting investors to start rebalancing their portfolios earlier than usual. One-month implied volatility on the euro on March 19 rose to the highest since 2016.
Futures volumes in yen also surged with nearly 17,300 contracts, or $2 billion worth of contracts, traded in the half-hour ahead of the London fix. That was the most in a week and well above the average turnover during the month of April. The rise coincided with the weakening of the Japanese currency, suggesting falling demand for yen.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe indicated that the state of emergency may be extended as the country enters the Golden Week holiday period. The yen slumped against the dollar on Thursday by the most in two weeks.

Investing.com – The pound rallied against the dollar Thursday, putting it on course on to snap a three-month losing streak, but history suggests cable is in for tough month ahead.
GBP/USD rose 0.96% to $1.2584
""May is the worst month for GBP/USD with an average decline of 2.3% since 2010,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.
May, historically a risk-off month, will likely benefit the safe-haven dollar, analysts said.
The sunny end to the month for sterling comes even as sentiment has been soured by signs the U.K. is set for a protracted lockdown relative to its European peers, including Italy, which has been among the worst hit from the virus.
The U.K economy has come under pressure following government-imposed lockdown measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
“It is clear the COVID-19 crisis will lead to a sharp fall in GDP in Q2 2020, perhaps by around 12% to 16%,"" said PwC chief economist John Hawksworth.
The lockdown in the U.K. is set to be reviewed on May 7.
The uncertainty around whether the U.K and EU will be able to find common ground and agree a trading relationship before the end of Brexit transition period on Dec. 31 has also weighed on sentiment.
“There are plenty of minor technical details where we could find solutions. But on the fundamental goals each side is trying to achieve - the differences are enormous. Things cannot move without a political push. And it’s missing,"" Reuters reported, citing one diplomat following the negotiations."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was a little lower in early European trade Thursday, with traders having to balance the potential for more central bank largesse with the vivid illustrations of the damage the coronavirus outbreak has been doing to the global economy.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.523, down 0.1%, while EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0884. GBP/USD climbed 0.1% to 1.2471 and USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 106.56.
The focus has turned from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank, as the governing council has to decide on Thursday if more than 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in asset purchases and a generous lending plan are enough to keep companies and households afloat.
""Our economists expect the ECB to announce a 500 billion euro expansion to the (bond buying) program to serve as a backstop against increased fiscal issuance needs,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategist Michael Cahill in a note.
""The path for the euro in the near-term will depend on the mix of measures introduced,"" he said, with targeted credit action likely to reduce domestic risks and offer support, while a ""wait-and-see"" stance from the bank could weigh on the currency.
The ECB is meeting on a day that eurozone economies are following the U.S. in announcing the biggest quarterly drops in GDP in over a decade. France's fell 5.8% while Spain's fell 5.2% in the quarter. Figures for the euro zone as a whole are due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT).
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged on Wednesday, but expressed a willingness to do more to support the economy if this was needed.
""We will continue to use our tools to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible,"" said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
For now, he said, monetary policy is calibrated appropriately, but added that could change.
""It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" Powell said.
And more may well be needed judging from the latest economic growth figures.
U.S. gross domestic product fell 4.8% in the first quarter, the worst economic decline since 2008, exceeding economists’ forecasts for a 4% decline in output, and the second quarter is likely to be far worse.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve left the door open to more monetary easing and dampened expectations for a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The greenback was also weighed down as signs the pandemic is receding in other countries and reduced safe-haven demand for holding funds in dollars. Additionally boosting appetite for riskier currencies were positive trial results of an experimental COVID-19 treatment.
The euro held steady before a European Central Bank meeting later on Thursday where policymakers are likely to expand debt purchases to include junk bonds and take other steps to ease conditions in credit markets.
More countries are taking steps to re-open their economies as coronavirus infections slow, giving some cause for optimism.
However, it will likely take several months for U.S. consumer spending to fully recover given the massive job losses, which has discouraged any extensive dollar buying.
""The Fed has already eased a lot, but the fact that it said it would be willing to do even more has taken some gloss off the dollar,"" said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.
""I expect dollar/yen to drift lower. The euro can benefit from dollar weakness as long as euro-zone government bond spreads don't widen a lot.""
The dollar traded at 106.65 yen  in Asia on Thursday, close to a six-week low.
Against the pound , the dollar stood at $1.2461, following a 0.3% decline on Wednesday.
The greenback was little changed at 0.9748 Swiss franc .
After a two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates near zero and promised to expand emergency programmes as needed to help the battered economy.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered no sanguine words about how fast the country might return - if ever - to the near-record low unemployment and solid growth of just a few weeks ago.
Sentiment for the dollar also took a hit after data on Wednesday showed U.S. gross domestic product fell in the first quarter at the sharpest pace since the Great Recession.
Economists say the second quarter could be even worse.
The United States and other major economies forced businesses to close and kept people at home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on global growth.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was little changed at $1.0867 on Thursday. Against the pound (EURGBP=), the common currency traded 87.25 pence.
The ECB, which announces its policy decision later Thursday, is under pressure to keep government bond yields from rising after rating agency Fitch cut Italy's credit rating to one notch above junk due to the financial burden of the coronavirus outbreak.
The ECB is already printing money at a record rate to buy up ballooning state debt.
However, European Union officials have struggled to agree the details of a joint recovery fund, which shifts the burden to the ECB, analysts say.
The Australian dollar  traded at $0.6550 on Thursday, close to a seven-week high in a sign of improving risk sentiment among some investors.
The Aussie has also benefited from the country's success in containing coronavirus infections.

The New Zealand dollar  also edged to a six-week high as economic activity returns following the end of one of the world's strictest lockdowns related to the coronavirus.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has seen selling in early European trade Wednesday, as traders look to take on risk ahead of key central bank meetings. Oil prices are pushing higher and more countries are looking to reopen, adding to the positive tone.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.763, down 0.2%, while EUR/USD rose 0.3% to 1.0848. GBP/USD climbed 0.3% to 1.2462 and USD/JPY fell 0.3% to 106.55.
That said, moves have been cautious as markets look to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes its two-day meeting later Wednesday, and the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, for guidance.
The U.S. central bank is unlikely to come up with new policies after the excitement of its last meeting, but investors will be looking for clues as to its future policy path.
“Traders are expecting a significant rewrite in today’s FOMC policy statement when the Fed will, in unambiguous terms, send clear messaging that extraordinary policy settings will remain in place for as long as it takes,” Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp, wrote in a research note.
Pressure is also mounting on the European Central Bank to reopen its tool box given the region’s national governments are struggling to agree on joint fiscal action.
This follows the surprise move late Tuesday by rating agency Fitch to downgrade its investment rating on Italy’s debt to BBB-, one notch above junk, citing the country’s rising debt levels. 
The dollar has pushed lower, noted analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note, “as risk assets performed and oil edged higher; even USD/JPY edged lower but EUR/USD failed to break 1.09.”
Helping Wednesday’s tone has been the move higher in oil prices. The recent turmoil in the crude market has prompted many to cut back on risk, and any sign of a return to something approaching normalcy will help riskier currencies.
At 2:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 13% higher at $13.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.9% to $23.16.
One of these risk-sensitive currencies which has been in demand as conditions become more favorable is the Australian dollar, rising some 6% on the month and 18% from March's 17-year low.
In a world worrying about the potential impact of deflation, the country reported earlier Wednesday that headline inflation accelerated 2.2% in the first three months of the year, the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014, to climb back within the central bank’s 2%-3% target.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was on the back foot on Wednesday as the slowing spread of the coronavirus and moves to re-open economies supported the investor mood, ahead of major central bank meetings.
The risk-sensitive Australia dollar  rose 0.4% to $0.6517 to track toward a sixth straight session of gains, and the currency's best month in four years. The New Zealand dollar  rose 0.6% to $0.6093, its highest in a week. [AUD/]
But gains were capped by caution and other majors steady as markets look to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which meets on Wednesday, and the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, for guidance. 
Investors will be watching to see if the U.S. central bank gives any clues on its future policy path after it responded to the economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic by slashing rates, buying bonds and backstopping credit markets.
""There's no expectation the Fed will change policy,"" said Joe Capurso, FX analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) in February.
""The market will definitely be very keen on knowing what the (economic forecast) numbers are, or at least qualitatively how deep and how long this might go on.""
The Fed is due to issue a statement at 1800 GMT, followed by a press conference with chairman Jerome Powell at 1830 GMT.
The U.S. dollar was steady against a basket of currencies at 99.837 (=USD), and slipped a fraction against the rangebound euro, yen and pound.
The dollar sat near a six-week low against the yen at 106.70 yen  per dollar. A pound  bought $1.2441 and a euro (EUR=) $1.0835.
Cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, topped 1 million in the United States overnight but investor focus is now increasingly on plans to relax restrictions and restore a battered economy.
U.S. consumer confidence slumped to a six-year low this month, data showed overnight. Markets are bracing for quarterly GDP, published at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show a 4% contraction.
Despite the gloom, markets have almost solely focused on the positives over the past week, as seen in the performance of the Australian dollar, a risk-sensitive currency.
As Spain, France, New Zealand, Australia, Italy and Canada move cautiously toward reopening their economies, the Aussie has soared - rising some 6% on the month and 18% from March's 17-year low.
""This is quite extraordinary,"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s head of FX strategy, Ray Attrill.
""It didn't underperform the G10 pack by nearly as much in March, and does leave us a little cautious about the near-term outlook,"" he said.

The bank revised up its year-end forecast for the Aussie to $0.6750, but expects it to fall to $0.6200 at the end of the current quarter.

Investing.com - The dollar has made a timid start to the week, but with the Federal Reserve set to kick off its two-day meeting Tuesday some on Wall Street are backing the greenback to find its footing and mount a rally.
The Federal Reserve's update on the economy due Wednesday will likely lay bare the underlying economic weakness and shift investor focus to the looming recession, sparking a bid in the safe-haven dollar, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.
""The Fed will recognize deterioration in economic conditions and likely signal that rates will remain low for an extended period,"" BofA said. ""A sobering assessment of economic activity by the Fed, as well as by other global central banks this week, could well begin to shift the prevailing focus away from policy stimulus and back to the reality of global recession.""
Alongside its monetary policy statement, the Fed will release its summary of economic projections on a range of measures including growth, employment, inflation and interest rate projections.
The forecasts will likely provide key insights into how deep and dark a widely expected recession will be and also the extent to which the Fed is willing to keep its ultraloose monetary policy in action.
The two-day Fed meeting is expected to culminate with an unchanged rate decision on Wednesday and comes as economic activity continues to deteriorate with consumer confidence last month plunging to multi-year lows.
Sentiment on the dollar has swung negative in recent weeks, with investors upping their bearish bets on the greenback following the Fed's inventions in the market, including expanding access to dollars to avert a funding crisis.
Also supporting the dollar's move off its session lows, GBP/USD and EUR/USD moved off session highs to trade about 0.4% and 0.1% higher respectively, ahead of monetary policy decision from the Bank of England and European Central Bank expected in the coming days."
131,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The franc’s weakness against the euro might provide some relief to the Swiss National Bank -- just don’t count on an immediate end to its interventions.
The Swiss currency fell to its weakest in a month on Tuesday on improved market sentiment and moves by the SNB to rein in the haven asset. Policy makers appear to have staged their biggest intervention in the foreign exchange markets since 2015 last week, and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Commerzbank (OTC:CRZBY) say more may be looming.
“We certainly do not think the SNB are likely to become complacent,” said Ned Rumpeltin, the European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “The rapid acceleration of sight deposits in recent weeks is strong evidence that the SNB has tried to draw a line in the sand at 1.05 in euro-franc. They will continue to push back on any franc appreciation pressure.”
The SNB seem to have injected billions of francs into the foreign exchange market last week in data showing a jump in the amount of cash commercial banks are holding, after the coronavirus fallout drove up the haven currency. The franc has since lost about 0.9% against the euro in the past four sessions, taking the pair to 1.0612 on Tuesday -- the Swiss currency’s weakest level since March 31. Option traders see scope for more short-term franc weakness against the euro.
“The potential for continued large FX interventions by the central bank is the reason we are choosing to be neutral on the franc for now, with 1.05 the key level to watch on the downside,” Morgan Stanley strategists including Matthew Hornbach wrote in a client note.
A spokesman for the SNB declined to comment on its intervention strategy.
The haven currency has gained more than 2% against the euro since the start of the year as the coronavirus shuttered major economies and saw markets spiral into chaos. The franc’s appreciation drove it to 1.0508 on April 16, its strongest level since mid-2015 -- a likely trigger for the SNB to act in currency markets.
Sight deposit data, which are often seen as the closest proxy to SNB intervention signals, rose by 13.4 billion francs ($13.7 billion) to a record 651 billion francs in the week ending April 24. That’s the biggest weekly rise in more than five years.
While 1.05 marks the SNB’s tolerance levels it does not signal that it will sit back for now, said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). The Swiss currency is currently trading at around 1.06 per euro.
“I think the SNB is not only interested in preventing a further downmove in euro-franc, it would like it to trade at higher levels,” Frankfurt-based Nguyen said. “Back in 2017 it only stopped intervening when EUR/CHF was trading at roughly above 1.10.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has risen in early European trade, as more turmoil in the oil markets resulted in traders taking a less expansive stance with risk, heading back to the safe haven.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.263, up 0.2%, while EUR/USD fell 0.1% to 1.0815. USD/JPY was largely flat at 107.22.
Oil futures slumped after the largest U.S. oil exchange-traded fund said it would sell all its front-month crude contracts to avoid further losses as prices collapse. The renewed decline in oil prices has overshadowed optimism about the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions seen globally.
At 3 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 13% lower at $11.07 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3% to $22.37.
From Italy to New Zealand, many governments have announced the easing of restrictions, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that it was too early to relax them there, hitting sterling.
Speaking outside the prime minister’s house at No. 10, Downing Street for the first time since recovering from the virus, Johnson said ""we are now beginning to turn the tide"" on the disease, but the lockdown would not be relaxed too soon.
At 3 AM, GBP/USD traded at 1.2416, down 0.1%.
Another country worth keeping an eye on Tuesday is Sweden, with the Riksbank set to announce its latest interest rate decision at 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), and is generally expected to hold still at 0% - a view that has led the krona to strengthen against the euro in recent weeks. 
Danske Bank disagreed with this view, predicting the Swedish central bank will head back into negative rates territory, cutting its repo rate by 25 basis points to minus 0.25%. 
“Recent labour market and NIER confidence data showed that the Riksbank's February forecasts are obsolete - the world has changed drastically into one of recession and deflation,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“We have been surprised by the Riksbank's reluctance so far to signal a repo rate cut back into negative as it has pledged to do 'whatever it takes'. Now, all board members have said that zero is not a floor. Four out of six appear to be prepared to cut, making it likely that the other two will bend,” the bank added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Australian dollar tested six-week highs on Tuesday, as signs of progress in re-opening economies helped the risk-sensitive currency recoup most of the panic selling seen in March, and as the greenback nursed overnight losses.
The Aussie  has rallied more than 17% from last month's 17-year low and overnight rose through resistance around $0.6445. It drifted down to $0.6438 and was just below multi-week peaks against the euro, pound and yen. Other majors were steady. 
""The Aussie is in beast mode at the moment,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""Part of that is down to the fact that it is your best way of playing reflation...it's kind of a proxy for equity markets,"" he said. Shorts had mostly fled their positions and momentum funds had arrived to ride the wave, Weston said, as traders seemed to worry less about fundamentals and focus more on the valuation outlook.
The move comes amid a global push to re-start economies frozen by coronavirus lockdowns. 
In Australia, which has avoided the high number of deaths seen in other countries, states are beginning to relax restrictions on movement. Sydney's famous Bondi beach re-opened to surfers on Tuesday.
Italy, which has the world's second-highest number of reported coronavirus deaths, will allow factories and building sites to reopen from May 4 as it prepares to end Europe's longest lockdown.
The U.S. state of Georgia has begun letting residents dine at restaurants and watch movies at theatres as more states, from Minnesota to Mississippi, took steps to ease restrictions, even though health experts warned it may be too early.
Besides the Aussie, other majors were less exuberant. The New Zealand dollar was subdued, weighed by a particularly aggressive stance from its central bank. 
The kiwi  retraced overnight gains and fell to $0.5998 while the pound  was steady around $1.2424, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned it was too dangerous to relax a strict lockdown in Britain.
The Japanese yen  has been rangebound just above 107 yen per dollar for half of April, and held at 107.27 on Tuesday.
The slightly softer dollar has also failed to give much lift to the euro, as investors worry about the shape of a rescue package for hardest hit and heavily indebted Spain and Italy. 
""Whereas the U.S., UK, Australia, China and Japan, if needs be, can go to the printing presses, in Europe you're constrained,"" said Colin Harte, head of strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in London.
""I think there's a little bit of a risk premium that's creeping in to the euro on concerns about where do we go from here.""

The single currency (EUR=) held at $1.0832.

Invesing.com – The dollar moved off its session lows on Monday, but some have warned a sea of red could hit the greenback later this week if the Federal Reserve signals its ultra-loose monetary policy is on autopilot.
With just two days to go until the Federal Reserve unveils its rate decision and Chairman Jerome Powell delivers his press conference, ING warned that the dollar could extend losses Wednesday on reduced safe-haven demand should the central bank maintained its stance to do whatever it takes to cushion the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.
After a surge in March, the dollar has struggled to find its footing as the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures, including an intervention to ramp-up supply of dollars, has prompted traders to boost bearish bets on the dollar,
The value of the net short dollar position was $11.51 billion for the week ended April 21, compared with a net short position of $11.39 billion for the prior week. That was the net short dollar position in nearly two years, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, which gets underway tomorrow, is widely expected to culminate in an unchanged decision on interest rates. But investors are likely to scrutinise the policy statement and the Powell's press conference for insight into the Fed's thinking on monetary policy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.
Just a little over a week ago the Fed said in its beige book report that economic growth had contracted sharply and abruptly in recent weeks and waned more job cuts were expected in the coming weeks.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong dollar  is bumping against the top end of its narrow 7.75-7.85 band against the U.S. dollar and is among the best-performing currencies this year even as the city's economy struggles to contain the fallout of the coronavirus.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) spent HK$7.7 billion ($993.45 million) last week to defend the peg as the currency rose to its upper limit for the first time in more than four years.
Analysts say what's driving the currency is Chinese money chasing cheap Hong Kong-listed stocks, its favourable yields and the city government's spending plans.
WHY HAS THE HKD BECOME A FAVORED 'CARRY' TRADE? 
Traders often borrow in currencies with lower interest rates to fund purchases in higher-yielding markets, such as Hong Kong currently, creating inflows and strengthening a currency.
As part of the peg arrangement, Hong Kong's official ""base rate""  follows U.S. Federal Reserve policy. But once the Fed's main rate loses its 50 basis points lead over the 5-day average of borrowing costs between Hong Kong's banks - as it did in March - the HKMA's policy tracks the local interbank rate.
The Fed Funds  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Rate  is at 0-0.25% and Hong Kong's base rate  was 1.19% on Monday, indicating a rich yield cushion for the Hong Kong dollar.
Rates at which Hong Kong banks lend to each other are leading their U.S. equivalents by the most since 1999. They are also more prone to spikes with less cash around. Interbank cash levels, measured by the aggregate balance , are down 84% from a 2015 peak of HK$426 billion.
For a graphic on World FX rates in 2020, click https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-CURRENCIES-PERFORMANCE/0100301V041/index.html
HOW ARE STOCK MARKET FLOWS SUPPORTING THE HKD?
Hong Kong's stock market is one of Asia's largest.
Initial public offerings, such as the heavily subscribed recent listing of Akeso (HK:9926), have locked up cash and kept interest rates elevated, said Carie Li, economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank.
Chinese investors have poured cash into Hong Kong shares, many of which trade cheaper than peers on the mainland and (HSCAHPI) ""Southbound"" net purchases through the Stock Connect link reached a record $17.93 billion in March.
WHY WOULD HKD STAY STRONG WHILE ITS ECONOMY WEAKENS?
The Hong Kong government is spending record sums to prop up the economy, battered by months-long protests in 2019, and in partial lockdown now to fight the coronavirus.
It could finance some of this spending with deposits it holds with the HKMA. With limited HKD to hand, the central bank may meet this demand by selling foreign currency assets, said Chi Lo, senior economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.
The HKMA's chief executive, Eddie Yue, has acknowledged higher fiscal spending will likely increase HKD demand.
IS HONG KONG'S PEG DIFFERENT?
Lebanon's currency peg is creaking under economic pressure and Argentina's fell apart in 2002 as reserves were depleted.
But even if Hong Kong spent all the cash parked at the HKMA, it would still have enough foreign currency reserves to buy all the HKD 1.6 times over, said BNP's Lo.
Hao Zhou, analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), noted that the HKMA tends to be prudent and spent only $16 billion of its $437 billion FX reserves in 2018 and 2019 to defend the peg as the HKD weakened.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar sold off aggressively in early trade Monday, with traders turning away from the safe haven as more and more countries announce a gradual lifting of their Covid-19 restrictions.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.970, down 0.5%. GBP/USD rose 0.5% to 1.2434, while EUR/USD gained 0.2% to 1.0846. The Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars also all made headway, as did the ruble and the rand.
Over the weekend, global virus numbers continued to paint a broadly encouraging picture, with new infection numbers, deaths and hospitalization figures all moving lower, and high-profile victims such as Italy and Spain mapping out a path to reopening their economies.  
Helping the positive tone was the addition of more stimulus from the Bank of Japan earlier Monday, which opened up the possibility of unlimited Japanese government bond buying, while raising its ceilings on corporate bonds and commercial paper to 20 trillion yen. 
At 3 AM ET, USD/JPY traded 0.3% lower at 107.18.
Looking at Europe, the country hardest hit, Italy, has offered up more details on its plans to ease the nationwide lockdown from May 4. In the region’s economic powerhouse, Germany, the world's largest carmaker by sales, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), on Monday restarted work at its Wolfsburg headquarters.
In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson returns to work after his bout with the virus, and is expected to discuss plans for modifying - but not lifting - the lockdown, possibly before the May 7 deadline when the government is legally obliged to announce its next review of the rules.
Investors had flocked to the dollar in recent weeks amid continuing economic turbulence due to the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to safe-haven inflows and a dollar shortage.
“The notable recovery in global equities during the month of April so far hints at some possible significant rebalancing effects in USD,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “These should be USD negative this time round as investors rebalance hedges on USD assets towards month end.”
Investors will be keeping a wary eye on the Federal Reserve meeting scheduled to end on Wednesday and Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen was hemmed into a tight range on Monday before a Bank of Japan meeting where policymakers may consider scrapping limits on bond purchases and easing funding for companies hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Currency traders are also focused on a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending Wednesday and a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting Thursday as major central banks once again take the stage as the global economy battles against a deep depression.
The Fed has already announced a raft of measures and is expected to stay on hold this week, which is unlikely to trouble the dollar, analysts say.
The stakes are higher for the euro, because the ECB is likely to extend its debt purchases to include junk bonds, and some investors are worried this decision could widen rifts between members of the European Union.
""It will be difficult for markets to latch onto the BOJ, because it has already reached the limit of what it can do,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
""Every economy is suffering and all major central banks have already eased policy a lot, so it's difficult to differentiate from one currency to the next.""
The yen  held steady at 107.41 per dollar on Monday in Asia.
Against the euro, the yen (EURJPY=) traded at 116.29, close to its strongest level in three years against the common currency.
The yen also held steady against the Australian (AUDJPY=) and New Zealand dollars (NZDJPY=).
The BOJ is expected to leave unchanged its main policy targets of guiding short-term rates to -0.1% and keeping the 10-year bond yield around zero.
The BOJ will discuss scrapping its numerical target for government debt buying, the Nikkei newspaper reported, in a show of resolve to buy unlimited amounts of bonds.
Japan, like most major economies, has urged businesses to close and encouraged people to stay at home to curb to slow coronavirus infections, which is causing a widespread downturn.
In Europe and the United States, officials are now moving to ease some of these restrictions, but currency traders say they remain wary because threats posed by the virus have not been eliminated completely.
The dollar has risen in recent weeks due to a dollar funding crunch and safe-haven inflows, but some analysts say the greenback is likely to fall in the long term because the Fed has eased monetary policy more aggressively than other central banks.
Positioning in currency futures may give dollar bulls some reason to turn cautious.
Speculators' net bearish bets on the U.S. dollar rose to the highest in nearly two years in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was little changed at $1.0825 in Asia on Monday. Against the pound (EURGBP=), the euro traded at 87.47 pence.
The ECB is under more pressure to act after EU policymakers last week failed to reach a consensus on the details of a 1 trillion euro emergency fund.
The pound  eased slightly to $1.2367. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce plans for easing a month-old coronavirus lockdown as early as this week, the Telegraph reported.
Johnson is due back at work on Monday after recovering from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.

However, there is a lot of uncertainty about the virus testing regime in Britain and the strategy for exiting from lockdown.

Investing.com – The dollar traded in a narrow range Friday, as weaker economic data failed to trigger a meaningful move in either direction. But the greenback remained set to post a second-straight win thanks to strong gains against both the euro and sterling this week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was flat at 100.41, and traded in range of 100.25 to 100.87 in the session.
U.S. durable goods orders fell by 14.4% last month, the biggest slide since 2014, led by waning demand for big-ticket items such as cars and slump in orders for Boeing (NYSE:BA) passenger planes.
The dearth of movement in the greenback comes during a week in which the world's reserve currency racked up gains against both the pound and the euro.
GBP/USD was flat at $1.2353, but is on pace to snap a two-week winning streak. Concerns about Brexit weighed as the U.K and EU trade talks that got underway this week failed to show any sign of progress.
The U.K. ""failed to engage substantially"" on key sticking points in Brexit talks held this week, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said.
Despite the current disruptions caused by the Covid-19 crisis, the U.K. continues to insist that it will not extend the transition period beyond the end of the year.

139,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Lebanon’s currency peg, an anchor of financial and social stability for more than two decades, is crumbling and attempts to stabilize the exchange rate are adding to the chaos.
Dollar shortages culminated last month in the government’s decision to default on its debt for the first time. Now, a series of new measures imposed by the central bank have made clear that authorities are slowly breaking away from the fixed exchange rate of 1,507.5 to the dollar.
Starved of hard currency, Lebanese banks have stopped dispensing dollars to clients entirely after months of setting withdrawal limits. In its latest steps, the central bank has instructed lenders to allow withdrawals from foreign-currency accounts in Lebanese pounds only but at a “market rate” determined by banks themselves. The central bank also told money transfer companies that it would buy what they receive in dollars from abroad for pounds. It’s offering them 3,625 pounds per dollar, a huge premium over what remains its own official rate.
The goal of the central bank is to absorb dollars and channel them into a currency trading platform it wants to start with lenders and licensed exchange bureaus in the coming weeks to help determine a single daily exchange rate, according to people familiar with the matter. By making it harder for businesses and ordinary people to get hold of physical dollars, however, the measures have only accelerated the pound’s depreciation and exacerbated the uncertainty.
The Lebanese pound was trading at 3,350 on the parallel market on Thursday, with some exchange houses pricing at nearer 3,700, more than 50% weaker than the official peg that is now effectively in place only for importers of essential goods; oil, wheat and medicines.
Fearing their savings will be wiped out and hit by spiraling inflation, hundreds of Lebanese braved the restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus outbreak and resumed protests this week -- burning debris in the street and blocking roads with their cars. The central bank intervened briefly in the parallel market to try to slow the depreciation but stopped after the exchange rate continued to slump, said the people, asking to remain anonymous as the information is not public.
“They might be able to temporarily hold on to a rate for a few days, but the trend is clear -- there aren’t enough dollars in the system to support a peg, or a more loosely defined one for that matter,” said Nafez Zouk, an emerging-market strategist at Oxford Economics. “It’s just a shifting of losses and insolvency into local currency.”
Buoyed for years by inflows from Lebanon’s sizable diaspora, the peg became a burden as repeated failures to reform the economy and stamp out corruption shook confidence. Financial aid from oil-rich Gulf countries and Western allies, which pulled Lebanon back from the brink of financial crisis in decades past, has also dried up.
With foreign-currency reserves at critical levels and after a default on some $30 billion in Eurobonds last month, the government has approached the International Monetary Fund to discuss its draft plan to rescue the economy in the hope of getting aid. The blueprint includes a gradual change in the peg starting in 2021 -- when the pound would weaken to 2,607 per dollar.
Fast Unpegging
The depreciation on the unofficial market has been anything but gradual, however, with the pound weakening some 40% in the past three months alone. Food prices have gone up by 58% since mid-October, when nationwide protests erupted and eventually forced the collapse of a government.
Consumers Lebanon, an independent group that tracks food prices, has warned that inflation is only expected to accelerate and could lead to social implosion.
With almost half of Lebanon’s bank assets parked at the Banque du Liban, or BdL, as the central bank is known, the goal has been to soak up as much foreign currency as possible, restocking holdings ravaged by outflows amid the crisis. It’s challenge now is to unify multiple rates that have sown uncertainty and generated losses for businesses and consumers alike.
“Seems like BdL is trying to reduce the FX mismatches it has by turning its dollar problem into a lira problem, given that it can print its own currency,” Zouk said.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has been in demand Friday, as disappointment surrounding a trial for an antiviral drug to combat Covid-19 deflated hopes for a quick breakthrough in bringing the pandemic under control.
At 3:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.950, up 0.4%, and at levels not seen since the beginning of April. GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2324, while USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 107.68.
Doubts have emerged over the efficacy of Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Sciences’s antiviral drug remdesivir in treating the Covid-19, after the Financial Times reported overnight that it had failed its first randomized clinical trial.
Gilead has disputed the report, saying the study was “terminated early due to low enrollment,” and thus “the study results are inconclusive.” 
However, this has resulted in the dollar being sought as a safe haven as the drug was previously thought to be one of the best prospects for treating the virus. 
The euro has also weakened against the greenback as after EU leaders agreed few details about the shape of post-crisis recovery plan would be financed -  although they did sign off on a  pre-agreed €500 billion euro emergency financial package.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that the European Union's economy could shrink by as much as 15% this year as a result of the pandemic.

“With EU’s failure to reach a clear agreement (as somewhat expected), EUR/USD has moved about 1 figure lower over the past few days,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “In our view, this continues to suggest the eurozone’s lack of coherence is accumulating to a trending negative risk premium in spot.” 
Further signs of the stress the union is under could come later Friday as rating agency S&P could downgrade its investment rating on Italy to just above junk status - meaning that the cost of borrowing for this heavily indebted nation could rise as it tries to recover from being especially hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
In emerging markets, the USD/RUB is steady ahead of a widely expected rate cut from the Central Bank of Russia at its policy meeting later, while the Brazilian real remains under pressure after falling to a new all-time low against the dollar on Thursday.

Investing.com – The dollar rose on Friday morning in Asia, ending the week with its best performance since April.
The U.S. Dollar Indexthat tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies gained 0.10% to 100.638 by 11:24 AM ET (4:24 AM GMT). The release of “horrible” economic data overnight caused investors to turn to the greenback, viewed as a safe haven.
The U.S. reported 4.427 million initial jobless claims for the past week overnight, with an unprecedented 26 million people losing their jobs since late March.
Meanwhile, the Financial Times said on Thursday that Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir failed its first randomized clinical trials.
The company was testing the drug’s efficacy in treating the COVID-19 virus and have denied that the tests were a flop.
But news of the failure was enough to spook investors, who were closely watching the trial’s progress.
“I’m running with a more bearish story for the next two or three weeks,” Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer told CNBC.
“The economic data is going to be horrible. I’m betting that markets will be shocked by it, even though we know it’s coming, and that will cause risk sentiment to fall.”
The USD/JPY pair was up 0.07% to 107.66 as the Bank of Japan said earlier in the day that it could replace its government bond-purchase target to allow unlimited buying.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.13% to 0.6359 and the NZD/USD pair lost 0.22% to 0.5993 as stocks' losses decreased investors’ appetite for the Antipodean risk currencies.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.25% to 7.0831. The GBP/USD pair reversed earlier losses to gain 0.07% to 1.2351, even as Bank of England official Jan Vlieghe stated overnight, “It seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries.”  ",,,,,

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was headed for its best week since early April on Friday, as tumbling oil prices weighed on commodity currencies and division over Europe's emergency fund dragged on the euro.
The dollar stands near a two-and-a-half week high against a basket of currencies (=USD) and is 0.8% stronger for the week. It is up nearly 3% against the oil-sensitive Norwegian krone  and about 1% on the euro (EUR=).
Morning moves were modest and led by a drift lower in the Australian and New Zealand dollars as traders were unnerved by inconclusive results from a Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) antiviral drug trial and looking to headlines for further direction.
""I'm running with a more bearish story for the next two or three weeks,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer.
""The economic data is going to be horrible. I'm betting that markets will be shocked by it, even though we know it's coming, and that will cause risk sentiment to fall,"" he said. 
The Aussie and kiwi each shed about 0.2%, holding the kiwi  below 60 cents at $0.5987 and the Aussie  at $0.6356, beneath resistance around 64 cents.
Both had rallied through those levels overnight as markets shrugged off dire economic news in Europe and the United States and commodity prices forged ahead. [O/R]
The euro fell to a one-month low of $1.0756 on Thursday, and was drifting back to test that level on Friday after the European Union agreed to build a trillion euro emergency fund, but left the details for later. 
With Italy and Spain hit far harder than Germany by the crisis, old enmities have surfaced across a bloc which faces a cut to output as deep as 15% according to the European Central Bank.
""We have no idea how it will be funded and this is not the panacea to stop an impending 15% contraction in GDP,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
The euro last sat at $1.0776. The British pound  was steady at $1.2352, which is down about 1.1% for the week, and the Japanese yen  softened slightly to 107.70 per dollar.
Preliminary goods-orders data in the United States and a German business sentiment survey due later on Friday are unlikely to improve investors' mood - especially as the global recovery begins to look increasingly rocky.
""It seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries,"" Bank of England official Jan Vlieghe said overnight.

A slow, U-shaped recovery was more likely than a quick, V-shaped rebound, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking to ramp up wagers against already-battered commodity currencies, a sign that many believe a rebound in oil prices is nowhere in sight after this week's historic plunge in crude.
Though crude prices have bounced back in recent days after turning negative for the first time ever earlier this week, many investors believe a coronavirus-led slowdown in global demand is likely to persist for months, weighing on oil and depressing the currencies of commodity producing countries.
""The collapse in oil just confirms my view that the global economy is in very bad shape,"" said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management in New York. ""I don't think we are getting out of this anytime soon.""
Betting on declines in commodity currencies has paid off for fund managers in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic has sapped demand for everything from crude to industrial metals.
Among the worst hit currencies have been the Brazilian real, which is down 36% year-to-date, and the Mexican peso, which has lost 30%. The currencies of iron ore exporter Australia, dairy exporter New Zealand and crude producer Canada have all fallen between 9% and 10%.
BNP, with assets under management of $493 billion, is currently short the Australian and New Zealand dollars and is looking to increase these bets if the currencies bounce, Pojarliev said.
Axel Merk, founder and chief investment officer of Merk Investments, said his firm has been short the Norwegian krone in its quantitative fund before this week's oil collapse. The fund is maintaining its short positions in the currency, even though the krone is down 20% this year.
Merk believes Norway's central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon, as low oil prices depress inflation. Lower rates tend to weigh on a currency by making it less attractive to yield-seeking investors.
""Our valuation model is screaming cheap for the Norwegian krone ... but we believe it could get cheaper,"" Merk said.
Millennium Global Investments in London, overseeing $18 billion in assets, has recently placed bets on a decline in the Canadian dollar and is maintaining a short position on the Australian dollar, said Richard Benson, the firm's co-chief investment officer.
""When the oil price is half of what is sustainable to maintain an economy, it has a negative economic impact,"" Benson said.
Westpac Institutional Bank is bearish on the Canadian dollar and recommends that investors buy the greenback against the Canadian currency below C$1.40, targeting C$1.50 or higher on a three- to six-month horizon. The U.S. dollar on Thursday was last at C$1.4066.
""The historic energy market collapse and relatively modest fiscal support compared to G10 peers are likely to consign (Canada's) economy to an extended period of underperformance,"" said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac.
BofA Securities also believes commodity currencies - including Norway's krone - have further declines ahead.
""The chaotic turn in the oil markets indicates likely downward macro pressure that will do more damage in the commodity space, putting pressure on commodity currencies,"" the bank said in a recent report. ""The only certainty is uncertainty during the COVID-19 crisis.""
Other banks are recommending relative value trades that pit various commodity currencies against one another.
Société Générale, for example, suggested using options to bet the Australian dollar will outperform the Canadian dollar, due to Australia's comparatively healthier fiscal position, the bank's analysts wrote.

Investing.com – The euro slashed its early-day gains against the dollar on Thursday, after EU leaders failed to agreed on a coronavirus recovery package as bloc members at are odds over how to finance it.
EUR/USD fell 0.43% to $1.0776 after hitting a high of $1.0845 intraday.
The economic bloc of 27, however, did back a short-term $540 billion plan to support businesses and economies from the immediate fallout from the coronavirus.
But experts say a bigger, bolder stimulus plan is needed to offset the damage from the pandemic.  
Ahead of the meeting, the European Commission floated a 2-trillion-euro plan, but member states disagree on how they should share the burden.
France, Italy and Spain are pushing for the stimulus to be funded by the sale of EU debt, or so-called coronabonds, but Germany and the Netherlands have rejected the idea over worries they could be left to foot the bill 
ECB President Christine Largarde said the euro-area economy could shrink by as much as 15% this year, and urged EU leaders to roll out stimulus.
The ECB followed the Federal Reserve's lead and said it would accept high-yield, or junk bonds, as collateral for banks to access ultra-cheap loans. But unlike the Fed, the ECB does not have the option to apply a haircut to the debt to offset against changes in value, which opens the central bank up to the risk of losses.    
""The one item that might pose an issue to the ECB is the high risk profile of BB fallen angels and the fact that, unlike repo operations, no haircut protects the Eurosystem from potential losses,"" UBS said."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has slipped slightly in Europe Thursday in rangebound trading, but the focus may turn on to the euro with the European Union set to discuss the coronavirus outbreak.
 At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.477, down 0.1%, while GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2352 and EUR/USD at 1.0821, largely flat.. USD/JPY rose 0.1% to 107.81.
The euro will be in focus Thursday ahead of a EU council meeting to discuss the bloc's response to the economic turmoil caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.
Nothing concrete is expected to emerge Thursday, given a senior EU official was noted saying that EU council president Charles Michel will not attempt to reach a deal today. This follows the heated disagreement between the group’s finance ministers on the touchy subject of a joint debt measure, often called coronabonds, to pay for the economic refinancing of the bloc.
This uncertainty can’t be good for the single currency. 
The European Central Bank moved late Wednesday to ease some of the pressure on the Italian debt markets by agreeing to exempt bonds that are downgraded to junk from its normal requirement that bonds used for collateral should have an investment grade rating.
“The move from the ECB is well-timed if we do not see an EU deal today on corona bonds/recovery fund. Hence, the negative market impact of no new deal today is set to be smaller than feared,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
The spreads between benchmark German bonds and Italian debt, in particular, have been widening amid concerns that Italy will struggle to afford the cost of rebuilding its economy at the same time as servicing its hefty debt pile. 
Italy defaulting on its debt would create enormous tensions within the European Union project, threatening the very existence of the single currency.
Italy is up for review by rating agency S&P on Friday, and although a one notch downgrade from its current BBB rating would still keep it in the investment grade camp, it would be only just.
“The risk of Italy being downgraded to junk later this year together with a rising number of 'fallen-angel' Eurozone corporate bonds that lost their investment grade rating, were probably the main reasons why the ECB changed the collateral rules last night,” added Danske Bank.
The PMI data for the European Union are due for release later Thursday.
“It will be an ugly reading but the expectations components could be interesting for any signs that governments' fiscal measures are alleviating some of the pressure,” said Danske.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against the currencies of oil producers on Thursday as a rebound in crude prices from an unprecedented collapse only partially calmed markets unnerved by the massive coronavirus-led drop in global demand.
The euro held steady against the greenback and the pound ahead a of meeting of European Union officials on the bloc's response to the economic turmoil caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.
It may take EU countries until the summer or even longer to agree on how exactly to finance aid to help economies recover as major disagreements persist, a bloc official said on Wednesday.
Analysts say sentiment is still supportive of the U.S. currency because the coronavirus outbreak is driving a global depression, which will encourage investors to opt for the safety of holding their funds in dollars.
""The dollar is a bit of a phoenix-type character; it seems to keep coming back,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney.
""I'm still of the view that the dollar rally is on borrowed time, but there are still signs of stress, and it's not clear that the dollar shortage has been addressed for everyone.""
The U.S. dollar edged up against the Canadian dollar  to C$1.4182 following a 0.3% decline on Wednesday.
The greenback rose slightly to 24.5120 Mexican pesos , sitting close to a two-week high.
Against the Norwegian crown , the U.S. currency held steady at 10.8012, near a one-month high reached on Wednesday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) rose 2.1% to $14.07 a barrel in Asian trading on Thursday. On Monday front-month WTI futures plunged to a historic low to around minus $40 as a glut of oil and dwindling capacity to store it sent oil prices into a tail spin.
Brent crude (LCOc1) also advanced from the its lowest level since June 1999.
These gains pale against persistent investor concerns about the collapse in demand for oil, as major economies have been brought to a virtual standstill with stay-at-home rules and severe restrictions on businesses and travel aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus.
Countries are running out of space to store the oil that they are not using, which could lead to further disruptions for commodities and other markets.
Officials from the EU will discuss the bloc's response to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus later on Thursday.
However, markets are wary because it is uncertain how far EU governments will cooperate in financing the recovery from what is sure to be a deep recession.
Ahead of the outcome of the meeting, the euro (EUR=EBS) edged lower to $1.0810. Against the pound (EURGBP=D3), the common currency was little changed at 87.72 pence.
The European Central Bank has agreed to accept junk bonds as collateral to allow banks to finance themselves at the ECB, which should be a positive factor for the euro, but investors are waiting for details on the fiscal response.
The dollar was little changed versus the yen as the pair remains stuck in a holding pattern.
The greenback last traded at 107.75 yen. 
The Australian dollar  fell 0.3% to $0.6304 as a bounce driven by Wednesday's encouraging data on retail sales quickly ran out of steam.

The decline in the Aussie weighed on the New Zealand dollar , which fell 0.25% to $0.5938.

Investing.com – The pound erased the bulk of its gains against the dollar on Wednesday as timid inflation data and worries of a deeper coronavirus hit to the U.K. economy weighed on sentiment. 
GBP/USD rose 0.1% to $1.2306, but had traded as high as $1.2387 intraday.
The UK consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 1.5% last month, from 1.7% in February, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The slowing price pressures were weighed down by clothing costs and lower energy prices in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with analysts warning of further economic pain ahead, which will likely hit the pound.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real fell on Wednesday to a fresh all-time low close to 5.40 per dollar, as expectations intensified that the central bank will cut interest rates significantly in the coming weeks to combat the coronavirus-fueled economic crisis.
The currency far underperformed its regional and emerging market peers on Wednesday, sliding more than 1% on the day to take its year-to-date depreciation to more than 25%. 
Market participants noted the steep decline at the front end of the interest rate futures curve, which indicates that around 100 basis points of interest rate cuts this year is now being priced in.
""The real is an outlier today, as the market is in 'Brazilian central bank big easing' mode,"" said one hedge fund manager in Sao Paulo. The market is thinking of big front-loaded rate cuts."" 
The real traded as weak as 5.3922 per dollar (BRBY), down 1.3% on the day. The January 2021 interest rate futures contract fell to around 2.60%  from 2.80% on Monday, the day before local markets were closed for a national holiday. 
On Friday last week, that contract was around 3.10%. 
The central bank's benchmark Selic rate is a record low 3.75% and widely expected to go lower. In a live online debate on Monday, bank president Roberto Campos Neto did not disavow that suggestion and said that lower interest rates remain part of the central bank's crisis-fighting toolkit. 

Brazil's economy is widely expected to contract sharply this year, perhaps posting its biggest crash in decades. The central bank's rate-setting committee known as 'Copom' next meets on May 5-6.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shoved aside by the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit is set to work its way into the headlines again as a June deadline for extending Britain's 11-month transition period turns currency traders' focus - and selling pressure - back to the pound.
Last week, at talks to negotiate a post-Brexit trade agreement, Britain's government reiterated its pledge to walk away from European Union without a deal if one cannot be reached by the end of the year.
And unlike in 2019 when lawmakers were able to block a no-deal Brexit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's large parliamentary majority makes this a real possibility. Yet, with focus squarely on COVID-19, the pound barely batted an eyelid.
Britain being cast adrift from its biggest trade partner is widely expected to inflict huge damage on an economy already predicted by the UK budget watchdog to post its worst recession in 300 years. 
That means sterling may be about to take centre stage again with only a little more than two months left to request an extension to the Dec. 31 deadline.
""Foreign exchange does this, we leap from one monstrous issue to another,"" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
While sterling has bounced off 35-year lows of around $1.14 hit in March, gaining nearly 8% in the past month, Juckes attributed that to corporations repatriating money before the earnings season and other unavoidable trades.
""March was about fighting the immediate fires... May will be back to fund managers making asset allocation decisions,"" Juckes predicted.
Recent moves have left the pound around 5 cents above its 2019 lows when it was being driven by the ins and outs of Brexit , but sterling risk premia never really went away.
Implied volatility on the pound against the dollar -- an options market gauge of expected price swings -- remains well above that of other major currencies. 
Graphic - Sterling most vol among G4 currencies: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/xegvbdldvqz/Pasted%20image%201587475176504.png
One-month risk reversals, a ratio of bullish to bearish bets, shows investors are being charged more for pound 'puts' than 'calls' -- options conferring the right to sell and buy sterling respectively, implying downside for the currency.
Still, three-month options encompassing June, the crunch time for determining whether or not Britain leaves with a deal, have barely budged. That suggests investors' attention has been wholly consumed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Neil Jones, head of FX sales at Mizuho reckons machine-trading algorithms, which many banks used to react to Brexit news, have simply been adjusted as the virus dominated headlines.
That may change in coming weeks, with Brexit talks scheduled for the weeks beginning April 20, May 11 and June 1. The process will be reviewed in June.
""Ultimately (the machine-trading) model is driven by discretionary decisions and you can switch on and off certain factors and forces if you don't feel it's relevant any more,"" Jones said.
DOWNGRADE
A credit rating downgrade from Fitch last month highlighted Britain's frailties --a current account deficit around 3% of GDP plus a likely explosion in national debt from increased spending to counter the downturn from measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus.
The pound's REER -- the exchange rate against trade partners' currencies and adjusted for inflation -- already carries an 11% Brexit premium, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts estimate, based on the deviation from its 20-year average.
But they said this would not be enough to compensate for ending the transition period without a trade deal given ""the disruption to trade would compound the risk of long-term damage from COVID-19"".
Graphic - REER data for Sterling: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/qzjpqrezvxm/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(1).png
Meanwhile, investors have gradually turned bearish on the currency. Last December, a long-standing sterling 'short' position flipped into a net 'long' as the election outcome promised to clear Brexit deadlock. There are still a net $3.2 billion worth of bets that the pound will go up, but that number has been falling for the last six weeks.

One-year dollar/riyal forwards rose as high as 264.3 points, their highest since November 2017, Refinitiv data showed. 
The Saudi riyal is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, so banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks.
""While we do not think the (Gulf) pegs will be broken in this cycle, it is hard to see the pressure coming off the pegs in the next few weeks,"" the Dutch bank ING said in a research note said.

Two fund managers said the larger fall may be because Saudi debt is more widely traded. One of them said Saudi bonds shed more because of ""further long-term fiscal pressure"".

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has slipped slightly in European trade Wednesday, with equity markets opening higher, but this safe haven remains in fashion as oil markets continue to show stress.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.243, down 0.1%, while GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2311 and EUR/USD gained 0.1% to 1.0866. USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 107.62.
European equity markets have opened higher Wednesday, with the German DAX up 1.1%, the CAC 40 in Paris gaining 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 up 0.9%. 
These indices have been helped by further signs of a normalization of economic activity, with the Dutch government announcing plans to ease its coronavirus containment measures, allowing primary school children to go back to school part time from May 11. 
That said, the crude oil market remains in a state of freefall, with the front month WTI contract now June but selling continuing as investors and traders desperately seek to avoid delivery given the shortage of storage space for the current glut of oil. The Brent contract has also become embroiled in the turmoil.
At 3:00 AM ET, the June Crude Oil WTI futures contract traded 7.3% lower at $10.73 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 12% to $16.98.
“The bears are certainly getting the upper hand,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told CNBC, adding it was hard to bet against the dollar in such a climate. 
The collapse in oil and expectations of an interest rate cut later this week pushed the Russian ruble to a three-week low of 77.53 against the dollar earlier.
Elsewhere, the Aussie dollar has posted strong gains following a record surge in retail sales last month, according to data released earlier Wednesday.
A preliminary estimate of Australian retail sales showed an 8.2% rise in March from February, the strongest seasonally adjusted rise ever published, supported by strong sales across supermarkets, liquor retailing and other specialized food.
""I would treat the number with caution, because, like elsewhere there has been so much panic buying of toilet paper and other things,"" said National Australia Bank FX strategist Rodrigo Catril, who expects a plunge in April figures.
At 3:00 AM ET, the AUD/USD pair gained 0.8% to 0.6333.
The Turkish lira is likely to be in focus later Wednesday, as the country’s central bank meets to decide on interest rate policy. Another cut is widely expected, which would be the eighth in less than a year, with the majority of economists expecting a reduction of 50 basis points to 9.25%.
This would indicate that the central bank is prepared to overlook the lira’s steep decline as it looks to spur credit to mitigate the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
At 3:00 AM ET, the USD/TRY pair fell 0.2% to 6.9694.

The safe-haven Japanese yen  held at 107.83 per dollar. The Australian dollar's  half-a-percent gain to $0.6354, following a record surge in retail sales last month, was an outlier and had begun to wind back by mid-session.

The recovery in U.S. crude (CLc1) lifts it out of negative territory, but at little over $11 a barrel, it is still some 80% under January's peak as cratering energy consumption due to coronavirus lockdowns creates a supply glut.
The plunge has soured appetite for risk and seems to have halted a rebound in stock markets as investors brace for a longer and slower global economic recovery.

Australia's central bank governor, Philip Lowe, said on Tuesday that the country is likely to experience its biggest contraction in output since the 1930s, and that a quick return to business as usual should not be expected.
""The fall in commodity and equity prices is a signal market participants expect the world economy to remain weak for some time, even once the lockdowns are eased,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia FX analyst Joe Capurso.

""We expect the weak world economy to bear down on the Australian dollar and for the Aussie to oscillate around $0.6000 in coming months.""

Investing.com - The pound moved off session lows against the dollar on Tuesday, but remained under pressure amid concerns about weaker inflation data and fresh worries about a no-deal Brexit ahead of trade talks between the EU and U.S. set for next week.
A top official at Britain’s foreign ministry reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stick with the existing Dec. 31 deadline to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union, Reuters reported.
GBP/USD fell 1.10% to $1.2298 after hitting a low of $1.2248.
Simon McDonald, permanent undersecretary and head of the diplomatic service at the foreign ministry, said there is ""clearly an option"" to extend the timeline for both nations to reach a deal beyond the end of the year.
""I believe the prime minister will confirm the existing timetable,"" McDonald added.
Without a trade deal, Britain risked defaulting to World Trade Organization terms of trade, which many have warned will hurt the economy.
The drop in the pound could extend on Wednesday, however, amid expectations that inflation data expected will show slowing price pressure amid the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prompted the government to shutter non-essential businesses nationwide.
""The pound could extend its losses on potentially disappointing March U.K. inflation data on Wednesday, BK Asset Management said.
""U.K. inflation data is due for release tomorrow and given the drop in shop prices, the risk is to the downside,"" said Kathy Lien, head of FX at BK."
155,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedging against swings in the Turkish currency has almost never been so expensive, eclipsing the benefit of plunging oil prices for the beleaguered lira.
Turkey is a net energy importer, and with Brent falling below $20 a barrel amid a global supply glut, the economy should benefit from slower inflation and a narrower current-account deficit. Yet the options market points to more pain for the lira as it flirts with a record low.
The cost of buying protection for the next three months is now more than 11 percentage points above the lira’s historical volatility, near the widest premium in data spanning over two decades. According to Bloomberg data, this popular gauge for valuing an option has been cheaper 99% of the time over the past three years, by far the biggest dislocation among 31 major currencies.
The scale of divergence underlines the challenges that Turkey faces. While the currency has outperformed its peers this year, that’s largely because state banks have been flooding the market with dollars to support it. Meanwhile, the central bank’s net reserves have been depleted, unnerving investors. Policy makers are now seeking currency swap lines with other central banks.
Data last week showed the central bank’s net reserves -- which strip out liabilities including local lenders’ reserve requirements -- fell to $26.3 billion in the week through April 10. Of that, $25.9 billion was borrowed through short-term swaps, the bulk of which had a maturity of one month or less, according to the latest data through the end of February.
The lira slipped as much as 0.8% to 6.9948per dollar on Tuesday, edging ever closer to the psychologically-important 7-per-dollar mark, and to its weakest level since it hit a record low in the August 2018 currency crisis.
State banks sold around $400 million on Tuesday, according to two traders with knowledge of the matter. Turkey’s state lenders don’t comment on interventions in the foreign-exchange market.
In January, central-bank governor Murat Uysal said government-owned lenders have been carrying out transactions in line with regulatory limits and may continue to be active in the currency market.

The world’s largest asset manager downgraded its view on developing-nation local debt to neutral from overweight on Monday, cautioning that declines against the dollar put the notes at greater risk.
One issue is that some monetary authorities are allowing their currencies to weaken to absorb the shock from the coronavirus pandemic and make exports more competitive, the BlackRock Investment Institute’s Mike Pyle, Scott Thiel, Ben Powell and Axel Christensen wrote in a note.
“Potential capital flight could exacerbate currency declines and force some EM central banks to reverse course and raise rates,” they said. “We see a risk of further currency declines in selected EMs that could wipe out coupon income.”
BlackRock’s more cautious stance follows a rebound in developing-nation local debt. While 23 of 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg have declined this year, some local notes have recovered in the past two weeks.
The South African rand and Brazilian real have felt the most pain, leading losses among major global currencies this year. That’s sticking to the pattern of past crises in which countries with the largest current-account deficits tend to take the biggest hits, according to BlackRock.
Still, the New York-based firm said it’s not all negative for emerging markets. BlackRock remains overweight Asian equities and credit, excluding Japan, citing the prospect of an eventual growth growth.
“China is gradually restarting its economy after stringent lockdown measures and is set to deliver a large stimulus package,” the strategists wrote. “A rebound in China’s economic activity could bode well for EM exporters of bulk commodities in particular.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has edged higher Tuesday, with investors choosing this safe haven amid the coronavirus-inspired uncertainty, especially in the oil markets.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.278, up 0.2%, while GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2414. USD/JPY down 0.2% to 107.42.
The front month May WTI crude contract saw hefty selling Monday, its penultimate trading day before expiry, plunging into negative territory for the first time since trading began as investors and traders desperately sought to avoid delivery given the shortage of storage space for the current glut of oil.
“Oil is off its lows, but a lot of companies are going to get hit and companies could start to fail,” Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors, told CNBC.
“If share prices have a pullback, the dollar could see some gains as a safe haven. The only thing that’s capping the dollar is the Federal Reserve has done more quantitative easing than anyone else.”
The euro is also in focus ahead of Thursday’s virtual meeting of the EU leaders to discuss funding of the economic recovery in the region from the damage done by the coronavirus outbreak.
At 3:05 AM ET, EUR/USD down 0.2% to 1.0841.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to come under pressure to agree to help finance the recovery through the issuance of joint debt, a subject which has provoked heated discussions in the Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers that preceded Thursday’s videoconference.
On Monday the Spanish government set out its plans to create a 1.5 trillion euro ($1.63 trillion) recovery fund financed through perpetual debt, backed by the EU budget, to aid countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Although some reports have indicated that Merkel may be ready to accept this plan, the bond markets aren’t buying it with spreads between the low risk German debt and that of the Italian and Spanish equivalents, the two countries hardest hit during this crisis, at one month highs.
“Covid-19 has proved an unpleasant reminder for the single currency of a key factor: the hesitant European crisis response and the continued lack of a risk-sharing mechanism such as automatic fiscal transfers mean the eurozone is exposed when debt sustainability in any one country is at risk,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
Also of note is the two week high for USD/CNY pair following the decision of the Chinese central bank to cut its benchmark lending rate on Monday, for the second time this year, to reduce borrowing costs for companies and prop up the coronavirus-hit economy.
Adding to downside for the yuan was news of the first new cases of coronavirus in the northwestern province of Shaanxi in nearly three weeks.
At 3:05 AM ET, the USD/CNY pair gained 0.2% to 7.0829."
158,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is on the verge of selling local dollars for the first time since 2015 as the city’s exchange rate strengthens toward the limit of its band against the the greenback.
The Hong Kong dollar touched 7.7501 per greenback on Tuesday. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority needs to sell the currency at 7.75 to defend the trading band if the rally persists. It last traded at that level in early 2016.
Appreciation in the city’s currency is a reflection of a widening gap between local borrowing costs and those in the U.S., rather than investor confidence in Hong Kong’s outlook. The interest rate spread makes the local currency more appealing to hold versus the greenback, and is the reverse of the situation that prevailed in recent years.
“The Hong Kong dollar will likely hit the strong end in coming sessions, with the advance mainly being driven by the carry trade on the wide interest rate gap,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. There’s unlikely to be any need for major HKMA intervention because of limited foreign exchange inflows into local assets such as stocks, she said.
Hong Kong has suffered a double blow of economic disruptions from widespread anti-government protests last year and the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Fitch Ratings on Monday downgraded Hong Kong’s long-term, foreign currency debt to AA- from AA, with a stable outlook. The ratings agency said the city’s real gross domestic product is expected to fall by 5% this year after a 1.2% decline in 2019.
Hong Kong effectively imports U.S. monetary policy thanks to the currency peg, even if local rates don’t always track those across the Pacific.
Interventions to buy the local dollar in 2018 and 2019 helped shrink the aggregate balance in the city -- an indicator of interbank cash supply -- by 70% to HK$54 billion. The limited cash supply has helped to amplify the volatility in Hibor. The one-month borrowing cost was recently at its highest relative to U.S. Libor since 1999.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar gave up some gains against the currencies of oil producers after U.S. crude futures pared some of their massive losses in Asia, but the historic collapse in energy demand is likely to keep safe-haven assets well supported.
U.S. crude oil futures plunged into negative pricing for the first time ever on Monday, dragged by a supply glut and sagging demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, though they managed to scrape back into positive territory early Tuesday.
""Oil is off its lows, but a lot of companies are going to get hit and companies could start to fail,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney.
""If share prices have a pullback, the dollar could see some gains as a safe haven. The only thing that's capping the dollar is the Federal Reserve has done more quantitative easing than anyone else.""
Factory closures and travel restrictions enforced to slow the pace of new infections have triggered a collapse in oil prices, which is drawing money from commodity currencies and other risk asset to the safety of dollar-denominated assets.
The U.S. dollar edged down slightly against the Canadian dollar  to C$1.4123 after hitting a two-week high on Monday.
The greenback fell 0.17% to 23.990 Mexican pesos  following a 1.3% jump on Monday.

The euro held steady as caution set in before data on German economic sentiment later Tuesday and a meeting of European Union officials on Thursday to discuss the bloc's response to the economic chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The New Zealand dollar was poised to extend gains as investors continue to cheer the country's decision to ease next week ease some of the world's strictest lockdown measures taken to stop the spread of the novel virus.

The June contract , which is more actively traded, was up 4.8% at $21.41 a barrel.
Investors have been unwinding long positions in front-month oil futures because U.S. crude storage facilities are nearly at capacity.
Energy prices are also falling because output cuts agreed last week by major oil producers have not offset a collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The dollar edged up slightly to 107.70 yen  and held steady at 0.9682 Swiss francs  as safe-haven flows continued to support the U.S. currency.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was quoted at $1.0863. Against the pound, the common currency was little changed at 87.31 pence (EURGBP=D3).
Data due later on Tuesday is expected to show German investor sentiment remained weak in April because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Members of the EU are struggling to reach consensus on how to financially support countries hardest hit but the virus, such as Italy and Spain. 
If the EU fails to reach an agreement this week, there could be more downside risks for the euro, some analysts say.
As coronavirus infections show tentative signs of peaking in some places, countries are struggling to decide how to re-open their economies for business.
The New Zealand dollar  traded at $0.6040 on Tuesday, holding onto the previous day's gains. The Australian dollar  edged up to $0.6346. 

New Zealand will next week ease some of the world's strictest lockdown measures taken to tackle the novel coronavirus pandemic, which will allow hundreds of thousands of people to return to work.

Invesing.com – The dollar was climbed against its rivals on Monday, with analysts continuing to suggest the path of direction for the greenback remains downward despite risk sentiment under pressure in the wake of slump in oil prices.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.19% to 100.02.
Over the past month, the dollar has struggled to build on its recent rally, which took the greenback to a more than three year high in mid-March, weighed down by the Federal Reserve's recent intervention  to ramp-up supply of dollars to avert a potential funding crises.
""For the US dollar, the consolidation has also come with a downward tilt – reflecting the view that the Fed will buy more bonds than other central banks, thereby increasing the supply of dollars by more than other central banks increase the supply of other currencies,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Others seem to agree, with Jefferies highlighting signs the dollar squeeze overseas may be on the wane.
""Foreign central banks holdings of Treasuries fell $161 billion from March 4 through April 8, but rose $13.7 billion this past week, the first increase since late February. This combination suggests that the dollar squeeze overseas is easing,"" Jefferies said.
Underscoring the shift in sentiment on the dollar, data showed speculators increased their net short dollar position in the last week.
The value of the net short dollar position rose to $12.59 billion in the week ended April 14, from $10.5 billion the previous week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday."

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank remains active in the currency markets to check the appreciation of the safe-haven Swiss franc, albeit less than in previous weeks as coronavirus fears give way to broader market optimism, data on Monday indicated.
Total sight deposits, which include other deposits on sight in Swiss francs, rose to 637.204 billion Swiss francs ($658.47 billion) from 634.115 billion francs in the previous week.
The 3 billion franc increase followed rises of nearly 7 billion in each of the two previous weeks and 11.6 billion francs at the end of March.
""Sight deposits show that the SNB is intervening less strongly than before,"" said Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin.
""I guess this is the result of the general slight risk-on mode. Safe havens seem to be less in demand and so there is also less demand for the franc.""
The MSCI World Index  gained 3.1% last week as stock markets recovered some of losses from the novel coronavirus outbreak and countries started to relax their lockdowns.
The level of sight deposits, money that commercial banks park with the central bank overnight, can indicate currency market interventions. The central bank declined comment on Monday.
The SNB has been particularly active during the coronavirus outbreak, selling francs and buying foreign currencies to weaken the value of the franc, which is sought by investors in times of market uncertainty.
The latest data -- which covers an average of sight deposits from Friday, April 10 to Thursday, April 16 -- did not fully reflect SNB activity at the end of last week when the franc rose to 1.0506 versus the euro (EURCHF=), its highest valuation since July 2015.
The SNB is trying to slow the appreciation of the franc, whose strength hurts Switzerland's export-orientated economy, but the central bank does have not a fixed floor for the euro exchange rate, said UBS economist Alessandro Bee.
The euro-Swiss franc exchange rate could go below 1.05 in the coming weeks, he said, which could prompt increased interventions. On Monday, the exchange rate was 1.0515 francs to the euro. (EURCHF=)
""I could imagine that 1.05 is an important threshold for the SNB and that they are willing to spend more to defend it,"" said Bee.

""This does not mean that they will defend it at all costs but they could resist a bit longer to the appreciation pressure, because the threshold is psychologically important.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar pushed higher Monday, as investors braced for more dire news on the fallout from the coronavirus.
At 2:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.058, up 0.2%, while GBP/USD fell 0.3% to 1.2464. USD/JPY climbed 0.3% to 107.86.
“We are coming into the eye of the storm,” Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone, told CNBC.
“And as the market starts to focus less on virus headlines, or at least will be less sensitive to better news, we will focus more on the lasting effects on the economy and solvency.”
The week ahead brings U.S. monthly employment figures and eurozone survey indicators, while governments around the world make tentative steps toward easing lockdowns.
One of the currencies hard hit against the greenback Monday has been the euro following a report that the European Union may need to triple the amount of aid currently proposed to tackle the coronavirus crisis.
At 2:55 AM ET, EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0856.
""The Eurogroup has now made proposals for aid worth more than 500 billion euros to finance healthcare and short-time work and to help small and medium-sized companies. That leaves at least one trillion euros. This is roughly the amount we need to be dealing with now,” the European Union’s Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said in an interview with German magazine Der Spiegel.
Given the angst that resulted from the discussions to produce the 500 billion euros worth of aid, finding the additional one trillion euros could prove tricky.
Meanwhile rising Italian borrowing costs are potentially bringing the matter to a head. 
Hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and with a debt burden of over 135% of GDP, Italy is widely seen as the eurozone state most in need of largesse from its neighbors, particularly after the region’s politicians failed to agree a sale of coronabonds, a debt instrument which would pool the credit risk of weaker countries like Italy with top-rated ones like Germany.
“While coronabonds, a bank for bad debt and more fiscal stimulus may indeed still materialize (at least, at some point), it remains clear that the EU is highly divided on all growth initiatives,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “Indeed, in our view, there is an economic/political/debt-deflation linked tail risk, which is holding down EUR/USD.”
The Financial Times reported that the European Central Bank had held talks with the European Commission about establishing a centrally-backed 'bad bank' to remove toxic loans from banks' balance sheets. It said the proposal faced stiff opposition. 
Elsewhere, the dollar edged 0.1% higher against the yuan after the People's Bank of China cut its key one-year prime rate by 20 basis points, and also advanced against the Norwegian krone and the Russian ruble as oil prices came under renewed pressure.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar found support on Monday and a rally in riskier currencies lost steam, as investors braced for more dire news on the fallout from the coronavirus and governments across the globe moved only cautiously toward an economic re-start.
Major currencies were mostly rangebound, though the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars and the oil-sensitive Canadian dollar led losses with falls of around 0.3%. 
Oil, U.S. stock futures and Asian equities were also softer as caution took hold after two weeks of looking on the bright side. 
""Hurdles facing optimists are very substantial,"" said Sean Callow, Westpac FX analyst in Sydney.
""We're three weeks into a quarter that globally looks as though it's going to be the worst in many decade. For us, while the momentum may be with risk appetite for a little bit longer, we think its very fragile and has to pull back very soon.""
The Australian dollar  sat a cent lower than a one-month high hit last week at $0.6344. The New Zealand dollar  was also on the back foot, but held at $0.6013 after stronger-than-expected first-quarter inflation.
Investors' preference for the dollar as a safe harbour also pushed euro, pound and yen a little lower. The euro (EUR=) was about 0.2% softer at $1.0858 and the pound  retreated to $1.2477. The dollar rose 0.2% to 107.77 Japanese yen .
The week ahead brings U.S. monthly employment figures, eurozone survey indicators and quarterly growth in world-trade bellwether South Korea. None are likely to be easy reading.
The week is also crucial to the COVID-19 recovery as governments around the world make tentative steps toward easing lockdowns.
In the United States, where the death toll rose to more than 40,000 on Sunday, state governors have sparred with President Donald Trump over virus testing capacity and how quickly their economies can re-open.
Investors are also closely watching an announcement due in New Zealand at 0400 GMT as to whether its tough but curve-squashing restrictions are to be loosened or extended.
Britain is not considering lifting its lockdown, a senior minister said on Sunday, while leaders in Ireland and Canada have flagged long-lasting social distancing rules.
""We are coming into the eye of the storm,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.
""And as the market starts to focus less on virus headlines, or at least will be less sensitive to better news, we will focus more on the lasting effects on the economy and solvency.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar drifted sideways in early trading in Europe on Friday, amid signs of increasing risk appetite in Europe as investors looked for the end of the coronavirus outbreak.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.17, up 0.1%, while EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0840 and GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2445. USD/JPY fell 0.2% to 107.72.
Overnight U.S. President Donald Trump laid out new guidelines for the reopening of the U.S. economy, backing down markedly from claims earlier in the week that he could dictate terms to state governors. The guidelines contained no hard dates for any reopening measures. 
Risk sentiment also received a boost from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) announcing overnight that clinical trials of its antiviral drug remdesivir showed promising results in treating the COVID-19 virus.
That said, the dollar remains in elevated territory: after all, a safe haven must remain in demand after Thursday’s latest jobless claims figures showed that over 22 million Americans had applied for unemployment benefits over the last month.
It’s against the emerging markets’ currencies that the U.S. dollar is really showing its strength, with the IMF’s prediction that the world economy would contract the most since the Great Depression pressurizing those countries which rely on external financing.
At 3:35 AM ET, USD/TRY traded at 6.9467, up 0.1%. The lira us now approaching the all time lows hit in 2018.
The lira has long suffered from a hefty current account deficit and large amounts of private foreign-currency denominated debt. Now throw in an economy that faces being shut to stop the spread of Covid-19, and it’s easy to see further losses.
The Turkish banking watchdog announced on Sunday it was capping local banks’ ability to conduct foreign exchange transactions with foreign entities, to try and curb the supply and the potential downside of the lira.
But these capital curbs could ultimately damage lenders’ willingness to meet the country’s massive financing needs, hurting the lira in the long run.


All this said, the lira isn't even close to being the worst performing emerging market currency this year - with the South African rand and the Brazilian real taking those 'plaudits'. The dollar has risen 34% against the rand and 30% against the real since Jan. 1.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday as a news report on signs of success in a COVID-19 treatment drug trial as well as early plans to re-open the U.S. economy drove fresh optimism and risk appetite.
Even the first drop in Chinese economic growth since quarterly records began in 1992 did not dent the mood as investors sought silver linings in signs of a rebound in industrial production.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars led gains, with both rising about 0.8%, while the pound and euro also rose to recoup some of the past two days' losses.
Medical news website STAT, citing a recorded discussion between doctors involved in a clinical trial, said most of 125 patients given Gilead's (O:GILD) remdesivir drug at a hospital in Chicago had recovered and been discharged.
Gilead said anecdotal reports do not provide the data needed to determine the safety or efficacy of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 and that it expects more data will be available at the end of the month.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced guidelines for a return to work in the world's biggest economy - a gradual, three-stage process dependent on robust virus testing and subject to state governors' discretion.
But the crisis has already turned some 22 million Americans out of work, and further market moves were capped by Gilead's staid response and more worries on the economic outlook.
China's economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, the first reversal since at least 1992, as the coronavirus outbreak paralysed production and spending.
Yet the decline was largely in line with expectations for a 6.5% contraction, and investors were encouraged by a less-than-expected 1.1% drop in industrial output.
""It shows the economy is gradually recovering from the very worst,"" said Nathan Chow, senior economist at DBS in Hong Kong.
""But I think in the second quarter we will see at most a stabilisation, not a rebound, because cases are still rising for most of China's trading partners, which will dampen orders going forward. Based on this first-quarter number, I would say the whole year GDP growth would be something around 2%.""

GBP/USD fell 0.52% to $1.2449, but had been as low as 1.2408 intraday.
Brexit will again be a key driver for sterling, Rabobank said. It warned of a potential slide in sterling below $1.20 in the next three months amid the economic uncertainty around whether the U.K. and EU will be able to agree on a post-Brexit deal on their future relationship.
A day earlier, the U.K and EU agreed dates for the next three rounds of negotiations, with talks set to take place by video conference in the weeks beginning April 20, May 11 and June 1. 
Others have also echoed the bearish sentiment on sterling.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said it sees EUR/GBP ending the year at 89 pence per euro, as the U.K. has not indicated it is willing to extend the deadline for trade talks.
Without a deal, Britain risks leaving the EU without a trade deal, which many believe will heap further pressure on the economy at a time when growth is expected to come under heavy pressure due to the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic.
""While my base case is that Brussels and London will come to some kind of agreement at the last minute, I do think that there will be a phase of uncertainty with higher sterling volatility before that happens,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a foreign-exchange strategist at Commerzbank, according to Bloomberg. ""It is far from clear whether the British government really will be willing to extend negotiations due to the current crisis."""

“Switzerland enters this recession with excellent credit quality, and its pandemic health situation is under control,” UBS strategists Thomas Flury and Gaetan Peroux wrote in a note to clients. “Hence its economy should do relatively well in comparison to other regions.”The economic impact of a further decline of the euro against the franc should be limited, as Swiss tourism and many export sectors are already suffering from a drop in activity.
Only at a level of 1.03 francs per euro would the economy face more serious consequences, UBS said. The currency pair currently trades at around 1.052 francs.
The Swiss National Bank said last month it sold francs more aggressively in the foreign exchange market to push back against the appreciation.
Given the likelihood of a further weakening of the euro, investors should hedge their exposure to the common currency, UBS suggested.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has been in demand in European trade Thursday, as illustrations of the severity of the collapse in global economic activity prompted a flight to safety bid.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.820, up 0.3%, while EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0888 and GBP/USD fell 0.1% to 1.2501. USD/JPY climbed 0.3% to 107.75.
Overnight the International Monetary Fund forecast that growth in Asia will stall at zero percent in 2020. 
“This is the worst growth performance in almost 60 years, including during the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 percent) and the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 percent),” Chang Yong Rhee, director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific department, said in a blog post. 
Yet Asia is still expected to do better than other regions in terms of economic activity, he added.
This follows on from very weak  retail sales figures in the U.S. as the March numbers dropped a record 8.7%, and ahead of the weekly  initial jobless claims release with another 5.1 million Americans expected to file for unemployment.
""The dollar is maintaining its momentum following U.S. data yesterday,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at Tokyo Branch of State Street.
Also of interest is the rise of Italian bond yields after the idea of 'corona bonds' failed to gain traction among EU finance ministers last week. Rising yields among the European periphery will put the euro itself under pressure.
Italy has been the hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, placing its already stretched public finances under severe stress. Its government, along with the leaders of the likes of France and Spain, had suggested the idea of  pan-European debt that would help collectively pay for recovery from the coronavirus - to no avail.
Italian 10-year yields are now back above 1.8%, said Danske Bank, in a research note,  the highest since before the ECB initiated its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.
“While Italian yields are still off the peak hit a month ago, the sell-off illustrates that member states' creditworthiness is back on the radar for investors,” said Danske Bank.

(Reuters) - Investors trimmed short positions on Asian currencies, a Reuters poll showed, as China tries to jump-start its economy that has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, and as a slew of measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve eased worries about dollar liquidity.
Investors were still bearish on all Asian currencies amid the coronavirus-driven rout, although signs emerged showing that virtual lockdowns and massive stimulus have started to help stem the spread of the outbreak and contain its devastating economic impact, the poll of 14 respondents showed.
Analysts said the trimming of bearish positions was aligned with significant central bank injections that have stabilised emerging markets, increased dollar funding and a potential peak in COVID-19 cases.
The Federal Reserve's aggressive measures to cushion the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. economy also led to some reduction in dollar demand, easing pressure on bond and currency markets in Asia.
Bearish positions on the Indonesian rupiah  fell from two weeks ago to their lowest since early March, after the central bank secured a $60 billion repo line with the Fed.
The facility helped the battered currency post its first weekly gain in four last week.
This week, Bank Indonesia opted for the stability of the rupiah - a carry trade favourite - when it kept interest rates unchanged, but cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve to boost liquidity.
Investors expect China, whose mammoth economy is revving up again and is a key trading partner for much of the region, to aggressively ramp up stimulus beyond the policy support announced on Wednesday.
Short bets on the yuan  fell to their lowest since the start of December last year.
However, a sure-footed near-term economic recovery seems unlikely at this point as first-quarter GDP data on Friday is expected to show the first quarterly contraction since at least 1992.
""Markets are willing to believe that policy support will be significantly enhanced this year,"" said Wei Liang, a macro strategist at DBS Bank, pointing to a likely increased fiscal spending despite sketchy details at this point.
Two countries that have been largely successful in their efforts to contain the virus were South Korea  and Taiwan , and while investors had raised short positions on their currencies as the outbreak took hold, they have now lowered their bets to early-to-mid-March lows.
Short bets on the Indian rupee  were also marginally trimmed just as the government extended a massive lockdown this week to early May.
The emerging market currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.

The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A flight to safety bid pushed the dollar higher against its peers on Thursday after dire retail and factory data showed the severity of the collapse in U.S. economic activity caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The dollar rose 0.2% to 99.831 against a basket of six other major currencies (=USD), turning positive on the week.
The euro dropped 0.25% to $1.0881 (EUR=), off its two-week high of $1.0980 hit in the previous session, while the dollar advanced 0.4% to 107.86 yen . 
The British pound fell 0.2% to $1.2482  after having lost nearly 1% in the previous session.
""The dollar is maintaining its momentum following U.S. data yesterday,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at Tokyo Branch of  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
""But the main player in the market now is short-term leveraged accounts, or hot money. It is not like a lot of investors are taking part in this,"" he added.
U.S. data showing retail sales fell 8.7% in March, the biggest decline since tracking began in 1992, underlined fears that damage to the economy from the virus outbreak will be deep and protracted. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Separately, a report from the Federal Reserve showed manufacturing output plummeted 6.3% last month, the biggest decrease since February 1946.
The New York Federal Reserve also reported that its Empire State manufacturing index, which tracks activity in the sector for New York State, fell to an all-time low.
The grim numbers poured cold water on recent improvements in market sentiment and hopes the outbreak may be nearing its peak with many developed countries looking to re-open their economies as soon as next month.
""Given the scale and breadth of the U.S. shutdown, our best guess is the economy contracts by around 13% peak-to-trough before we start to see a rolling process of re-opening in the United States from mid-May,"" said James Knightley, Chief international economist at ING.
""This will involve some ongoing form of social distancing meaning that a return to 'business as usual' could take many months – we don't expect the lost output to be fully recovered until mid-2022.""
The death toll from the coronavirus in the United States approached 31,000 on Wednesday as governors began cautiously preparing Americans for a post-virus life that would likely include public face coverings as the ""new normal"".
Governors of about 20 U.S. states where the pandemic has had a low impact believe they may be ready to start the process of reopening their economies by President Donald Trump's May 1 target date, but a labour union chief has warned against re-opening before making sure it is safe.
OTHER CURRENCIES
The Australian dollar fell 0.4% to $0.6293 , reversing earlier gains as traders shrugged off better-than-expected jobs data for not capturing the impact of lockdowns.
The New Zealand dollar lost 0.6% to $0.5961  after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Adrian Orr said negative interest rates were not off the table in its response to the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis.
A plunge in crude prices weighed heavily on oil producing countries' currencies.
The Canadian dollar  nursed losses at C$1.4116 per U.S. unit . The Bank of Canada has added to the suite of assets it is purchasing to cushion the blow from the pandemic. The Mexican peso fell 1.7% to 24.4030 to the dollar .
U.S. crude prices fell to an 18-year low and Brent lost more than 6% on Wednesday after the United States reported its biggest weekly inventory build on record. 

But prices bounced back early on Thursday on hopes the build may mean producers have little option but to deepen output cuts as the coronavirus pandemic ravages demand.

172,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yen’s rally this week may be a sign of things to come, with strategists in Tokyo saying the currency could climb toward 100 against the dollar in the next few months.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan Inc. says the yen stands to gain as the Federal Reserve’s massive monetary stimulus weighs on the greenback. MUFG Bank Ltd. sees the risk of a worsening coronavirus pandemic forcing Japanese funds to dump overseas assets and snap up the haven currency.
“The yen may rise to around 100 in the April-June period as the sort of monetization policies being used by the U.S. exert pressure on the dollar, and focus returns to fundamentals such as falling U.S. yields,” said Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citigroup Global.
The case for a stronger yen is also backed by its sliding options volatility and an easing of the recent global dollar crunch. That’s after the Fed boosted dollar supply, slashed interest rates to almost zero and pledged up to $2.3 trillion in loans as part of its unprecedented steps to cushion the U.S. economy from the pandemic.
The surge in greenback demand abruptly halted the yen’s rally last month, after a rapid spread of the coronavirus sent the haven currency to a more than three-year high of 101.19 per dollar. It has lost more than 5% since and was at 107.36 as of 6:38 p.m. in Tokyo on Wednesday.
Staying Home
The yen typically weakens at the start of Japan’s new fiscal year in April as investors allocate fresh funds to assets abroad. But a slump in U.S. yields and rising hedging costs for European debt are seen deterring them this time. In fact, local funds sold a net 1.1 trillion yen of overseas bonds in the week ended April 3, the most in a year. The yen is up 1% this week.
READ: Tumbling Yields Have Japan Insurers Boxed in From All Sides
There won’t likely be much outflows at least until Japan’s Golden Week holidays through May 6, said Yujiro Goto, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc. The yen may rise past 105 per dollar in the short-term, he said, without giving an exact time-frame.
The 10-year Treasury yield has plunged more than 100 basis points since the start of the year to 0.67%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is little changed so far this week after sliding 1.6% last week as investors brace for one of the most uncertain earnings seasons on record.
“It would be difficult for investors to boost risks given the extremely high uncertainty,” Goto said.
Yen Repatriation
There is a risk that investors will be forced to sell foreign assets for cash should the pandemic linger on and weaken the financial system, according to Takahiro Sekido, chief Japan strategist and head of global yen strategy at MUFG Bank.
Japan’s external assets, including securities and direct investments, exceed 1,000 trillion yen, noted Sekido, a former Bank of Japan official. Since not all of that is currency-hedged, repatriation of a large portion of it could trigger an appreciation of 10 yen, he said.
“Asset liquidation by Japanese funds will lead to enormous repatriation pressures on the yen,” Sekido said. “We can’t rule out the risk of yen surging past 100 in the run up to fall.”
Longer-Term Pain
While things may be looking up in the near term, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. says the yen is poised to weaken over the longer run as the coronavirus causes Japan’s trade balance to deteriorate.

The decline in exports is projected to more than offset the expected reduction in import costs due to the oil-price plunge, said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan.
“The case is stronger for the yen to weaken over the longer-term,” he said. “Investors withholding foreign-asset purchases for now may also buy in the long run.”

Investing.com - The euro moved off session lows against the dollar on Wednesday, amid reports Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, plans to reopen parts of its economy as soon as Monday.
""We have achieved a fragile intermediate success, but we don’t have much room for maneuver, so we must continue by concentrating fully,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, according to media reports.
EUR/USD fell 0.55% to $1.0919, but had fallen to $1.0857 at the lows of the day.
The reopening of the economy, however, will be staggered, with retailers of up to 800 square meters allowed to reopen on Monday only if they have a plan for good hygiene.
Schools in the country would begin reopening on May 4, but large public events will remain banned until at least August 31.
The announcement comes as some have flagged the risk of further downside in the euro should governments around Europe continue to delay the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
""We assume a plan will ultimately be agreed but doubts over the scale of policy support in the eurozone will persist and is a risk factor for the euro if risk-off trading conditions were to re-emerge due to lockdown reversal delays that shift current expectations on the COVID-19 hit to the global economy,"" MUFG analyst Derek Halpenny said."

 Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has pushed higher in European trade Wednesday, in a delayed reaction to chilling estimates of the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on the world economy.
 At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.093, up 0.2%, while EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0960 and GBP/USD dropped 0.4% to 1.2567. USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 107.10.
In the first World Economic Outlook report since the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic began, the International Monetary Fund estimated on Tuesday that global GDP will shrink 3% this year, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, while France predicted an 8% contraction in its GDP and the U.K. said its budget defict could blow out to over 100 billion pounds ($125 billion).
Other reports also cast doubt on the speed of any possible return to normal after the crisis ends.
The United States may need to endure the social distancing measures adopted during the coronavirus outbreak until 2022, according to researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
More than 2,200 people died in the U.S. from the outbreak on Tuesday, a record, even as the country debated how to reopen its economy. 
While the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus continues to climb, and is rapidly approaching two million globally, the conversation has turned more towards when countries can reopen their economies. 
The big question is still how to re-open economies without re-accelerating the case curve in a chaotic manner, said Nordea, in a research note.
“Over the past week authorities in e.g. Japan and Singapore have re-tightened the stance on Corona as a new case spike was seen,” said Nordea. “This is a template of what other economies could be faced with, also here in the West. Case growth may start accelerating swiftly again, if the economies are not opened very carefully.”
Elsewhere, USD/CNY climbed 0.2% to 7.0579 after China's central bank stepped up policy support for its embattled economy, cutting the one-year medium-term lending facility rate to financial institutions to 2.95%. That's a record low and down 20 basis points from 3.15% previously
The cut should pave the way for a similar reduction to the country's benchmark loan prime rate, which will be announced on the 20th, to lower financing costs for companies hit by the pandemic.

175,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus has blown Brexit out of the headlines, and for pound traders that may be a silver lining.
Sterling will strengthen to 80 pence per euro -- a level not reached since the 2016 vote to leave the European Union -- and possibly beyond, according to Standard Bank. The pandemic means that the deadline for a trade deal this year could either be pushed back, delaying a risk for the currency, or see more favorable terms given to the U.K., it said.
At the same time, the crisis is shining a light on the EU’s struggles in dealing with an issue that affects different countries within the bloc disproportionately. Its financial aid measures are still not sufficient to be worth betting on the euro, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
“The stigma of being associated with the EU –- and the euro zone in particular –- will only increase as a result of the coronavirus crisis,” wrote Standard Bank’s head of foreign-exchange strategy Steven Barrow in a note. “We’ve long had our sights on a return to 0.80 over the coming year for euro-sterling (a sterling rise of nearly 10%) but now we are starting to think that this might be a bit too conservative.”
That would mark a change of fortunes for a currency that has suffered a pronounced sell-off since the decision to leave the EU and again after the virus forced a lockdown in London, the world’s largest foreign-exchange hub. Against the dollar, sterling touched the lowest level in 35 years last month as traders sought the safety of the greenback.
The pound has recovered some ground in recent weeks, yet is still around 3% lower against the common currency this year at about 87 pence per euro.
The euro’s fortunes have worsened too, with the EU struggling to reach agreement over what kind of emergency support it should give economies worst hit by the coronavirus. While Italy and France want some sort of joint bond issuance, Germany and the Netherlands are reluctant to agree, leaving the European Central Bank to provide support.
“The economic lifeboat still isn’t big enough,” wrote Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, in reference to a 540-billion-euro deal ($592 billion) reached by EU finance ministers last week to support the region. “I’d still rather be long pound-dollar.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar nursed losses on Wednesday as investors cautiously returned to riskier currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump edged toward rolling back some restrictions put in place to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The greenback also remains under pressure following heavy measures by the Federal Reserve to boost dollar supply, however, analysts say it is too early for a full-scale retreat from safe-havens with the public health threat not yet eliminated.
""There's been a flood of money from the Fed, which is the backdrop behind market moves,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""Trump has made it clear he wants to lift restrictions, and this is what the market wants to hear, but we are nowhere near the all-clear when it comes to this virus.""
The dollar traded at 107.11 yen  in Asia on Wednesday, close to its lowest level in a month.
Against sterling , the dollar was last quoted at $1.2626, near a five-week trough.
The dollar also briefly slipped to $1.0994 per euro (EUR=EBS), the lowest in two weeks. 
Trump on Tuesday said he would speak with governors of all 50 states an authorise them to open their economies in a timely manner.
Daily fatalities in the United States from the coronavirus have fallen sharply, and states are making plans to get businesses open again.
Against the safe-haven Swiss franc , the dollar traded near a two-week low of 0.9597 in another sign of improving risk sentiment.
However, many analysts remain cautious after Trump's top infectious disease adviser said the U.S. president's target for restarting the economy by May 1 was ""overly optimistic.""
Another factor weighing on the dollar is the large amount of greenback liquidity provisions, credit backstops, and monetary easing the U.S. central bank has unleashed in the past month to contain the economic damage caused by the pandemic.
The Fed began a massive new lending programme on Tuesday, and the cumulative impact of measures it has taken so far has unleashed a flood of dollars.
The U.S. currency faces a further test later Wednesday with the release of retail sales and industrial production, which is likely to provide more evidence of the economic costs of lockdowns.
The global economy is expected to shrink by 3.0% this year in a stunning coronavirus-driven collapse, marking the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.
Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar  eased slightly to $0.6429, pulling back from a five-week high as some investors booked profits on recent gains.
Across the Tasman Sea, the New Zealand dollar  edged lower to $0.6094.

Both currencies are often traded as proxies for risk because of their close links to China's economy and the global commodities trade.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to two-week lows against a basket of currencies on Tuesday as risk sentiment returned to the market following better-than-expected economic data from China, which painted a less gloomy picture than feared following the coronavirus outbreak there. 
China's March exports fell 6.6% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast for a 14% drop, while imports fell by less than 1%, compared with a 9.5% drop predicted by economists.
""The dollar has retained a moderate softening bias amid a context of risk-on positioning and with global markets returning to full participation following the long weekends in many financial centres in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Chinese trade data for March provided bullish fodder for stock markets in Asia by showing an abatement in the rate of decline in imports and exports after the severe plunges in January and February,"" wrote analysts at Action Economics. 
Daily fatalities in the United States also fell sharply, and states began making plans to reopen their economies, leaving traders to abandon the safety net of the highly liquid dollar and turn to riskier currencies. 
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six rivals (=USD), fell 0.50% to 98.90. 
The euro (EUR=) gained 0.62% against the greenback to $1.0981. 
The Australian dollar , which is sensitive to Chinese demand because of the country's dependence on raw materials exports, rose to a more than one-month high and last traded at $0.6432, up 0.80% on the day.
The greenback slipped 0.52% against the Japanese yen  to 107.2 yen.
""The ongoing improvement in global investor risk sentiment in the near term combined with the Fed's aggressive policy response is beginning to weigh down more on the U.S. dollar,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.
The mood in the foreign exchange markets was pre-empted by leveraged funds, whose net short U.S. dollar positioning in the latest week touched its largest level since May 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. 
The value of the net short dollar position was $10.5 billion in the week ended April 7, from net shorts of $9.9 billion the previous week. Speculators have been short on the U.S. dollar for four consecutive weeks.

Invesing.com – The dollar deepened its plunge on Tuesday, amid worries the greenback has climbed too much too fast at a time when safe-haven demand appears to be dwindling as government-imposed lockdown measures are seemingly slowing the pace of infection.
The number of fund managers who consider the U.S. dollar to be overvalued rose at the fastest pace in seven-and-a-half years in April, according to Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) monthly investor survey.
About 58% of fund managers believe the dollar is overvalued, up 22% points since March, the largest monthly rise since August 2012, according to the survey.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.47% to 98.88.
The greenback has also been hampered by efforts from the Federal Reserve, which many see as weakening the dollar to support the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Federal Reserve balance sheet has jumped to a record $6.13 trillion this week, Reuters reported.
Rising hopes the U.S. economy will restart has weighed on sentiment for safe havens like the greenback, which had surged weeks earlier when many were predicting a prolonged shutdown."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday, with investors taking a cautiously optimistic view of the coronavirus pandemic's progress, and thus drifting out of the safe haven.
At 3:10 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.265, down 0.1%, while EUR/USD rose 0.2% to 1.0929 and GBP/USD rose 0.4% to 1.2557. USD/JPY fell 0.1% to 107.69.
While the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus continues to climb, and is rapidly approaching two million globally, the conversation has turned more towards when countries can reopen their economies. 
In Europe, the two hardest hit countries to date are already loosening their restrictions - Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs, while Italy will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week. In the U.S., states on the east and west coasts are getting together to coordinate gradual economic reopenings as the coronavirus crisis finally appeared to be ebbing. By contrast, France extended its lockdown to May 11, while Germany is expected to likewise later this week. France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was reported earlier as saying he expects French GDP to shrink by 8% this year.
Economic restarts ought to be dollar-negative, analysts say.
“Re-opening businesses and getting to the point of rising (global) economic activity will be what we are looking for to take EUR/USD 1-2 figures higher,” said Danske Bank, in a research note.
The release earlier Tuesday of better-than-expected Chinese trade data for March, as year-on-year exports and imports contracted less than expected, plays into this theme.
Also of interest to the foreign exchange markets was the deal agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to cut output by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June.
The price of oil had become a function of the demand destruction caused by the coronavirus outbreak - the more the global economy shut down, the more oil has fallen and the more the dollar appreciated as a safe haven.
The Russian ruble, the most actively traded of the world's 'petrocurrencies' hit its highest in nearly a month Tuesday, despite a sharp escalation in Covid-19 cases domestically.
The agreement has only resulted in a small boost to the price of oil to date, but it removes the near-term possibility of a price war, said Danske Bank.
“Now the supply outlook looks more predictable, which will leave oil prices in the hands of demand and the eventual reopening of economies,” added Danske, keeping a cautiously bullish stance on the Norwegian krone.

Though the U.S. currency had earlier drifted higher against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as the weekend's OPEC+ deal failed to soothe demand concerns, those trends had mostly reversed in mid-morning trade. 
""The U.S. dollar ticked higher in the holiday-light trade. Gains against the euro and commodity currencies provided a general boost to the greenback, which was otherwise weaker against the yen and sterling,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. 
Major oil producers agreed to the output cuts on Sunday to prop up oil markets as the pandemic severely curtailed global demand.
""Oil-exposed currencies were subdued despite OPEC's record production cuts of nearly 10 million barrels a day. The cartel hopes that the record agreement will help put a floor under oil prices. Still, the outlook remains troubled for oil markets given that the coronavirus has significantly damaged demand,"" said Manimbo. 
Financial markets remain on edge over the spread of the novel coronavirus as severe restrictions on personal movement drag the global economy into a deep recession. However, a slower flow of news in the past few days has boosted risk assets modestly, and the dollar, which serves as a safe-haven asset, has drifted modestly lower. 
The greenback has also been pressured in the last few weeks by Federal Reserve measures that have flooded the financial system with dollars to address a liquidity crunch caused in part by demand for the U.S. currency.
""The backdrop over the past week has been ""no news is good news,"" which has boosted risk assets,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. 

""We don't expect this dynamic to last much longer,"" said McCormick. ""As we leave the acute phase of the crisis, the market will have to deal with the underlying data and the uncertainty of the CV-19 exit strategies. The latter will be piecemeal and bumpy. It's a dance of fits and starts rather than a binary event of economy on/off. In turn, we expect another bump in the USD.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Commodity currencies slipped against their safe-haven rivals such as the dollar and yen on Monday as a record output cut agreed by OPEC and other oil producing nations failed to offset broader concerns about slumping global demand.
The greenback drifted higher against its Australian and New Zealand counterparts, widely seen as barometers for market risk, in a sign investors remain concerned about the consumption outlook for commodities.
Financial markets remain on edge over the spread of the novel coronavirus as severe restrictions on personal movement drag the global economy into a deep recession.
""The initial reaction suggests that the decline in oil demand is well ahead of the output cuts that were agreed,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""This is a negative for oil producers. This also encourages risk-off trading, which should support the yen.""
The dollar rose 0.63% against the Norwegian crown  to 10.25 and 0.51% to 23.45 Mexican pesos . 
Against the Canadian dollar , the U.S. currency held steady at C$1.3956. 
Trading could be somewhat subdued as financial markets in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Britain are closed for the Easter Monday holiday.
Major oil producers agreed to the output cuts on Sunday to prop up oil markets as the pandemic severely curtailed global demand.
Oil prices had gone into freefall on worries about the virus and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which was seen straining the budgets of oil producers and hammering the U.S. shale industry.
Currencies from Norway, Mexico, and Canada - all major oil producers - got a boost on Friday as the agreement to cut output began to take shape, but these gains disappeared on Monday as investors avoided risk assets.
While oil futures erased early losses to trade higher in Asia, trading in currency markets highlighted investor trepidation over the prevailing uncertainty in markets.
Other currency traders pointed to a decline in U.S. stock futures as a supportive factor for risk-off trades.
The cautious mood boosted the yen, which is often sought as a safe-haven during times of market and economic stress because of Japan's current account surplus.
The yen  rose 0.33% to 108.15 per dollar in Asia on Monday and jumped more than 0.4% against the Australian (AUDJPY=) and New Zealand currencies (NZDJPY=).
In the onshore market, the yuan  traded at 7.0424 per dollar. The coronavirus first emerged in China late last year and has dealt the world's second-largest economy a serious blow.
China is expected to release export data for March on Tuesday, which will be closely watched for signs of the pandemic's damage on the global economy.
Against the safe-haven Swiss franc , the greenback held steady at 0.9661.
The dollar traded at $1.0928 per euro (EUR=EBS), near its lowest level in more than a week.
Further declines in the dollar may be limited with speculative net short positions in the U.S. currency having risen to their highest since May 2018, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
The Australian dollar  slipped 0.17% to $0.6338, pulling back from a four-week high, while the New Zealand dollar  fell 0.21% to $0.6072 as investors shunned risky trades.
The pound  held steady at $1.2470 and last fetched 87.67 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).

Sterling retained gains made after Prime Minister Boris Johnson left hospital for treatment of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.

Invesing.com – USD/CAD moved off session lows on Thursday as the loonie followed the slump in oil prices amid ongoing worries over whether OPEC and its allies will be able to agree a production cut large enough to offset the impact to demand from the Covid-19 pandemic.
USD/CAD was flat to $1.4009, well above session lows of $1.3920.
Against reports suggesting OPEC and its allies could agree to cut production by up to 15 million barrels per day, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warned that deeper cuts are needed to offset the average demand loss of 19 million barrels per day between April to May.
""Ultimately, the size of the demand shock is simply too large for a coordinated supply cut, setting the stage for a severe rebalancing,"" the bank said.
Direction in USD/CAD was also dominated by the Federal Reserve unveiling $2.3 trillion in measures to create a support lending program aimed at cushioning the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic - a move which many see weakening the dollar. 
The move from Fed overshadowed Canada's unemployment rate, which went from 5.6% in February, near a 40-decade-plus low, to a near-decade high of 7.8% in March, RBC said, warning the labor market is set for more pain.
""Our latest forecasts assume that the unemployment rate will average 14.5% in the second quarter, double March’s 7.8% rate,"" RBC added.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was largely unchanged Thursday, with activity in the foreign exchange market subdued as investors hold fire amid abundant near term event risk.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.165, largely flat, while EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0861 and GBP/USD was flat at 1.2385. USD/JPY climbed 0.1% to 108.95.
The most important data release of the day will be the U.S. weekly jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), which has become the go-to economic indicator to capture the latest impact of the virus.
Economists are expecting that claims eased off a little from the huge 6.65 million number the week before, but will still post a rise of 5.25 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
They will join the almost 10 million Americans who have submitted claims since the end of March.
“Markets already know that the economy is being hit by extraordinary shocks,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan market research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), on CNBC. “Even if the [unemployment] number increases, it will probably surprise few people while a better reading could enhance the perception that the worst may be over and trigger a bigger market reaction.”
Also of interest will be the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies as they attempt to balance an oversupplied oil market following the slump in global demand on the back of the coronavirus outbreak.
Historically, the price of oil is inversely related to the price of the dollar, as when the greenback is strong you need less to buy a barrel of oil, However, the price of oil has also become a function of the demand destruction caused by the Covid-19 outbreak - the more the global economy has shut down, the more oil has fallen and the more the dollar has appreciated as a safe haven.
If the major oil producers can get together to agree to cut supply, potentially raising the price of crude, the dollar could be adversely impacted.
Finally, eurozone finance ministers are getting together again to try and agree the best way a regional strategy for financing crisis mitigation measures. 
Disagreements persist over whether to issue joint debt known as ‘coronabonds’ as part of a wider recovery plan.
“A move towards debt mutualization seems unlikely at this point,” said ING, in a research note. That said, the “impact on the EUR/USD should be limited as (a) expectations are not high for the coronabond anyway (b) at this point, the fiscal risk premium is not the main driver of the euro, (c) stabilizing risk appetite should ease appreciation pressure on the dollar.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Commodity currencies drew support on Thursday from hopeful signs the coronavirus pandemic may be peaking and that major oil producers may agree to cut output to stem a plunge in oil prices.
The Australian dollar fetched $0.6225 , down slightly but still near its highest level since mid-March, maintaining most of its gains since rallying from a 17-year trough of $0.5510 touched three weeks ago.
The dollar's index against six other major currencies stood flat at 100.15 (=USD) in early Thursday trade.
The index is down 0.6% so far this week as safe-haven flows to the U.S. currency eased on rising hopes much of Europe and the United States could soon see themselves out of the worst period of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""New York reported its biggest death toll while infections hit the highest level in four days in Spain and three days in Italy,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan market research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). ""All these are negative but forecasts both from governments and experts that the peak could come within days are leading markets not to focus on those details.""
New York state on Wednesday reported the most coronavirus cases in the world, overtaking Spain, according to a Reuters tally.
The market's focus is now on U.S. initial jobless claims data [USJOB=ECI] due at 1230 GMT.
The average forecasts of economists stood at 5.25 million after a total of nearly 10 million claims over the past two weeks.
""Markets already know that the economy is being hit by extraordinary shocks,"" said JPMorgan's Sasaki. ""Even if the number increases, it will probably surprise few people while a better reading could enhance the perception that the worst may be over and trigger a bigger market reaction."" 
On top of hopes of a peak in the epidemic, commodity-linked currencies, including the Aussie, got an additional boost from hopes that major oil producing countries could agree to cut output at a video conference on Thursday.
The Canadian dollar  traded at C$1.4025 per U.S. dollar, not far off this week's peak at C$1.3945. The Canadian currency has been recovering from a four-year low of C$1.4669 hit on March 20.
The Norwegian Krone also strengthened slightly, trading at 11.1205 per euro (EURNOK=), near its highest since mid-March and having gained almost 19% from a record low hit on March 19.
Media reports suggested Russia would cut its output and Algeria's energy minister said he expected a ""fruitful"" meeting though there remained tensions between the world's top three producers, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia.
""Markets are now looking to the meeting of OPEC Plus. Some people are having high expectations but getting a deal could be tricky,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of currency trade at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Tokyo.
The euro was flat at $1.0858 (EUR=), having slipped 0.35% on Wednesday, after European Union finance ministers failed in all-night talks to agree on more economic support for their coronavirus-stricken economies.
Two main sticking points were conditions for access to emergency credit lines in the euro zones's bailout fund and the notion of issuing joint debt by the bloc, so-called ""coronabonds"".
The yen was little moved at 108.94 yen per dollar , having traded in a narrowing range so far this week.

""While the dollar/yen is supported by the overall risk-on mood, there is selling from Japanese exporters above 109 yen, which will likely limit the chance of a big break above that level,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.

187,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The decade-long surge in foreign-exchange reserves among emerging markets is coming to an end, highlighting the danger posed by future currency depreciation.
China’s holdings fell by $46.1 billion in March, the most since late 2016, official data showed late Tuesday. The drawdown accounted for the lion’s share of the $105 billion that 10 emerging-market central banks, including Turkey, India and Brazil, yanked from their reserves last month to stem currency losses.
The declines underscore the clamor for dollars that rocked foreign-exchange markets around the world during March, driving the MSCI EM Currency Index to its sharpest retreat since May 2012. And with commodity prices and export earnings in the doldrums as the coronavirus crisis deepens, the outlook for many emerging-market currencies isn’t much better.
“I expect another leg of strong downward pressure on emerging currencies as the magnitude of global recession becomes clear,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior emerging-market strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB in Hong Kong. “Countries with external deficits and high external debt compared to foreign-exchange reserves are the most vulnerable.” Indonesia, India and the Philippines are most at risk in Asia, he said.
Good or Bad EM? Current-Account Marks Divide for Bond Investors
The Markit CDX Emerging Markets Index of credit default swap spreads blew out to record highs last month as traders factored in higher probability of missed payments amid the collapse in oil prices and concern China will be rocked by a slump in demand from Europe and the Americas.
Emerging markets suffered about $83 billion of outflows in March, a figure that may grow to between $500 billion and $750 billion if the exodus is anything like 2008 and 2015, according to Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp.
The prospect of a global recession may keep the U.S. dollar in demand over the next few months, raising the risk of intensifying capital flight and a further drop in reserves.
Should China’s reserves dip below the $3 trillion level, it would ring alarm bells for investors. Russia’s March international reserve assets, due to be released April 10, are forecast to have dropped by $10 billion. The Philippines is also set to publish reserves data this month.

188,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The amount of money migrant workers send to their home countries usually holds up well in a crisis. Not this time.
Waves of job losses among overseas workers and international border closures are sapping the $690 billion annual flow of global remittances at a time when many emerging economies need hard currency more than ever. Lebanon, Ukraine and the Philippines will be among the hardest hit, while Latin America could see an 18% drop in money being sent home compared with last year.
Global remittances flows have reached record highs in recent years as countries have become more closely interconnected. Apart from China and Ecuador, most of the reported Covid-19 cases come from industrialized nations that are home to the majority of the world’s migrant workers, according to Manuel Orozco, who directs the Inter-American Dialogue’s migration, remittances and development program in Washington.
The crisis could wipe out 6.7% of working hours globally in the second quarter of this year, according to the International Labor Organization. More than a billion workers are at high risk of a pay cut or losing their job, the organization said.
The shock from coronavirus “upends the wisdom about remittances being very stable” said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington. “The countries where migrant workers are temporarily based are experiencing a big crisis, and many of them are in the sectors that are being hit.”
Here’s a rundown on some of the emerging markets that will be affected the most:
Lebanon (12.5% of GDP)
Lebanon was already suffering from a drop in remittances due to a sovereign default and economic turmoil. Money sent home from the country’s diaspora used to be a key factor in keeping finances afloat. Unofficial capital controls imposed by commercial lenders have put pressure on household finances, leading to a devaluation in black-market rates for the pound.
Ukraine (11.8% of GDP)
Ukrainian workers who flocked to higher-paying jobs in the European Union in recent years rushed to get back home last month before the border was closed. The central bank said remittances could drop by as much as $3 billion this year as a result.
“If we take some remittances off the balance, then it should devalue the hrvynia,” said Vitaliy Sivach, a Kyiv-based bond trader at Investment Capital Ukraine. “The big question is how long it will last.”
The currency has fallen more than 12% this year, but lower energy prices and rising revenue from wheat exports may offset some of the damage.
Philippines (9.8% of GDP)
The Philippines deploys more than a million workers abroad every year, mostly to the Middle East. Remittances from Filipinos working overseas, which account for about one-tenth of the economy, may decline by as much as 30% this year as thousands of workers return home, Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told ABS-CBN News.
Egypt (8.8% of GDP)
Remittances and tourism are the two largest sources of foreign currency for Egypt and many Egyptians working overseas are based in countries dependent on oil exports.
The drop in repatriated money, combined with a recent slump in portfolio inflows, will erode the country’s foreign-currency reserves, according to Ehsan Khoman, head of Middle Eastern research at MUFG Bank in Dubai.
Dominican Republic (8.6% of GDP)
The Dominican Republic has one of the highest remittance rates in Latin America as a share of gross domestic product, World Bank data show. Foreign workers sent $582 million home in January, according to the central bank.
Pakistan (7.9% of GDP)
Pakistan’s central bank intervened to stop a plunge in the rupee last week as remittances dropped. Almost a third of Pakistan’s money transfers come from the U.S. and the U.K., two countries at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Mohamed Abu Basha, head of macroeconomic research at Cairo-based investment bank EFG Hermes.
“I would expect to see a bit of a slowdown for one to two quarters because of that exposure,” Abu Basha said, adding that some of the drop will be offset by lower fuel costs.
Mexico (3.1% of GDP)
Remittances to Mexico totaled $2.7 billion in February, up 10.5% year on year. Money transfers from abroad, mostly the U.S., account for a significant part of the country’s informal sector. A drop will likely hamper household incomes and further damage the country’s economic outlook.
El Salvador (20.8%), Honduras (21.4%), Guatemala (13.0%) and Nicaragua (13.1%)
In Central America, a region ravaged by gang violence, drug trafficking and poverty, remittances are a multi-billion dollar industry that have made governments less reliant on the bond market for financing. Under emergency coronavirus measures, the U.S. has implemented a rapid-fire deportation system. Unauthorized border crossings have tumbled, and initial data from this year show remittance flows have already declined.

The common currency fell against most Group-of-10 peers, while benchmark debt yields in Italy, seen as the most vulnerable economy to the pandemic, jumped to a three-week high. German bunds, a haven asset, rallied in contrast following the failure after a teleconference that lasted more than 16 hours.
“This is negative for the periphery who are suffering the most from the crisis,” said Pooja Kumra, senior European rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “These mutual decisions will be a struggle and could drag.”
Markets had been expecting a package of stimulus measures totaling around half a trillion euros, involving support from the European Stability Mechanism, the European Investment Bank and the European Commission.
The euro dropped as much as 0.6% to $1.0830, while Italian 10-year bond yields jumped 18 basis points to 1.80%, the highest level since March 19. German 10-Year yields dipped five basis points to -0.36%.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar is back in demand Wednesday, as investors sought safe havens amid disappointing news surrounding the coronavirus outbreak and the economic damage in Europe becomes apparent.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.345, up 0.4%, while EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.0857 and GBP/USD dropped 0.3% to 1.2300. USD/JPY climbed 0.1% to 108.81.
The U.S. recorded its highest single-day increase in virus deaths on Tuesday, with some 1,800 deaths. Governor Andrew Cuomo said that deaths in New York state also rose. 
This came as a disappointment as the state had previously seen two days of slowing infection rates and fewer deaths.
“Risk aversion and the U.S. dollar are going hand in hand,” Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, told CNBC.
“Improvement has been based on less-bad statistics coming out of various parts of the world...but our view is that markets are going to remain choppy - we can’t expect an uninterrupted flow of singularly good or singularly bad news,” he added.
The euro is weakening as Eurozone finance ministers struggle to reach an agreement on how to assist ailing member states hit by the coronavirus. 
The sticking point appears to be the issuance of common debt instruments to finance the coronavirus-related spending, commonly known as ‘coronabonds’, which France, Italy and Spain in particular are pushing for, while Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland are against.
However, the need for aid is becoming more apparent with every passing day.  
The Bank of France estimated Wednesday that the country’s economy contracted 6% in the first quarter due to the lockdown measures put in place to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That would be the biggest contraction on a quarterly basis since World War II.
And these measures don’t look like ending anytime soon, with the Italian press reporting that Italy may not reopen schools before September.

Later on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve releases minutes from its emergency meeting last month, which may include more commentary on the depth of the economic contraction that looms. 
""While the virus' curve is flattening, the economic effects of the corona crisis will linger for years,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency analyst Joe Capurso.
""Economies will take time to re‑open, some businesses will not re-open, and unemployment will take years to (recover).  We think that means the dollar and yen will re-strengthen.""

193,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The global financial crisis may offer proper guidance on how currency volatility will play out beyond the current market turmoil, even though the two shocks are vastly different in nature.
What seems clear is that investors may need to say goodbye for the foreseeable future to the low-volatility regime in foreign exchange, with hedging throughout 2020 likely to be costly, compared to recent experience.
Long-term bets look set to turn more expensive compared to shorter-dated ones due to the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic endgame. That pattern will be reminiscent of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, one of the most emblematic moments of the 2008 crisis.
Once again, monetary and fiscal stimulus has been unleashed in unprecedented size and power. But just as in 2008-2009, there will be fear in the market that it may not be enough to alter the longer-term outlook. Investors will be on watch for lurking credit risks and concerns over funding stresses will remain. Officials have managed to stabilize the markets -- for now -- yet the enhanced uncertainty creates unease on the outlook on conditions a year from now.
The abrupt shock in the currency volatility space last month resulted in record highs in euro gauges and has been followed by a deep sell-off. It’s been especially notable on options trades with an expiration date of one-week up to one-month. Comparing current volatility levels to past-year averages show that there is still more room for the short-term hedging premium to narrow compared to longer-dated plays.
Already, the so-called inverted volatility term structure in the major currencies -- essentially a curve that shows hedging is currently less expensive at longer tenors -- has taken a hit. That’s a sign investors are becoming less sensitive to coronavirus headlines and are shifting focus to upcoming meetings by policy makers.
Markets are more stable having priced in the immediate impact of the pandemic. They must now assess how circumstances will change when countries begin to phase out their lockdowns. The risk of a second wave of infections in autumn will probably keep implied volatility in the major currencies higher than the levels seen last year.
That helps explain bets that ranges will widen more on a yearly basis compared to a monthly one, as shown by the pound chart below.

Investing.com - The dollar has been on the back foot Tuesday, with risk sentiment boosted by further evidence that the virus has peaked in some countries in Europe, while the U.S. has also seen scattered evidence of improvement.
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.235, down 0.5%, with the loonie, Aussie and kiwi all rising over 1%. USD/JPY fell 0.3% to 108.88, while EUR/USD rose 0.6% to 1.0859. GBP/USD gained 0.7% to 1.2316 even as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved into intensive care overnight due to his worsening COVID-19 symptoms.
Spain’s daily death toll fell on Monday for the fourth day running to 637, its lowest level since March 24, while Italy reported 525 deaths on Sunday, the fewest since March 19 (although deaths ticked up again on Monday). In New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday that the state’s death rate has been ‘effectively flat for the last two days.’
The euro will be in focus later as eurozone finance ministers hold a teleconference call to discuss strategies for funding the region's policy response to the virus.  Various ideas and schemes are competing for attention, but the desire of Spain and Italy for jointly-issued and guaranteed 'coronabonds' is likely to be rejected by Germany, the Netherlands and others. 
The price of oil has become another factor impacting the strength of the dollar. 
“USD and oil have become an increasingly uneven relationship with US oil production now a key liability for USD,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. 
Looking at Thursday’s meeting of the major crude producers to discuss a reduction of supply, “we think risks are tilted towards a disappointment and expect Brent oil to stay sub-USD40/bbl. This could fuel USD/JPY moving towards 106 again near term,” Danske added.
 By extension, “we generally also find it too early for commodity currencies to see a forceful recovery, even if NOK remains an exception due to notably its fiscal support,” Danske added.
At 3:10 AM ET, USD/NOK dropped 1.4% to 10.2866, while the price of Brent rose 3.1% to $34.09 a barrel.
The dollar also gave up ground against most emerging market currencies, with the Chinese yuan rising around half a percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound edged lower against the dollar and the euro on Tuesday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.
The dollar held onto gains against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc as tentative signs that deaths due to the novel coronavirus in hot spots in the United States and Europe were starting to slow supported risk sentiment.
The yen was steady against major currencies after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled fiscal stimulus worth almost $1 trillion and agreed to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo and other parts of Japan to slow coronavirus infections.
Many investors are looking for signs of a peak in the coronavirus pandemic, but some analysts warn of volatility given the unpredictable nature of the previously unknown virus.
""The currency market has remained fairly calm, but there will be more downside for sterling if Johnson's condition worsens,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. 
""The yen will not react much to the state of the emergency, because other currencies are focused on signs that the coronavirus curve is starting to flatten out.""
The pound  traded at $1.2234 on Tuesday in Asia following a 0.3% decline on Monday. Against the euro, sterling (EURGBP=D3) slipped by 0.19% to 88.39 pence.
Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday night and had been undergoing tests after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms, including a high temperature, for more than 10 days.
Downing Street had said he was still conscious, though his condition deteriorated in the early evening.
Britain has no formal succession plan should the prime minister become incapacitated, but Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for him.
The dollar traded at $1.0798 per euro (EUR=EBS), holding onto six sessions of gains. Against the save-haven Swiss franc , the greenback traded near a two-week high of 0.9796.
Risk sentiment improved after the governors of New York and New Jersey pointed to tentative signs that the coronavirus outbreak in their states was starting to plateau.
The Australian dollar  edged up 0.5% against its U.S. counterpart, while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.35% against the greenback as investors felt more comfortable buying currencies sensitive to risk. 
The dollar fell 0.22% to 108.99 yen  on Tuesday ahead of Japan's declaration of a state of emergency.

On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to roll out an unprecedented economic stimulus, equal to 20% of economic output, as his government vowed to take ""all steps"" to battle the deepening fallout from the coronavirus.

Investing.com –  The pound made a strong start to the week against the U.S. dollar on Monday, despite an ongoing drip of dearie data, but some have warned further gains for the currency will be hard to come by due to uncertainty sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic.
GBP/USD rose 0.41% to $1.2309.
The pound has corrected from its excessively oversold levels and benefit from improved U.S. dollar liquidity, thanks to a coordinated effort from global central banks, but the currency faces pressure from ""fragile"" risk appetite due to coronavirus concerns, ING said in a note.
""We look for a range trade in the GBP/USD 1.2000-1.2500 area this week,"" ING added, while also noting that U.K. data points would continue to have a limited impact on sterling,

197,"<span>Apr 06, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As the coronavirus economic fallout accelerates around the globe, some experts say the U.S. dollar’s ups and downs are the best way to divine whether market mayhem is easing.
Wall Street pros have a huge arsenal of funny-sounding indexes like the VIX and FRA-OIS they can use to gauge how risky and stressed financial markets are. But something far more straightforward yet vital -- the U.S. currency -- looks like an ideal benchmark in this moment. A mixture of panic and actual liquidity shortages have corporations, central banks and investors around the world amassing dollars, making it like an MRI scoping beneath the surface of markets to show exactly how bad things are.
The Bank for International Settlements, an authority on the global financial system given its role as the central bank for central banks, has concluded the greenback is a key indicator for banking risk. During the worst moments of last month’s global liquidity crunch, the dollar surged as all manner of institutions rushed to obtain funding. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index advanced 10 straight days through March 23 as strains grew.
When the Federal Reserve introduced new liquidity measures to supply needed dollars, the currency lost momentum and slid. But the Bloomberg index rose again last week on Thursday and Friday after reports showed a record surge in Americans seeking jobless benefits and the U.S. unemployment rate spiked. On Monday, it’s down amid optimism coronavirus deaths might be slowing in some hotspots.
“When markets become disorderly and there’s a mad scramble for dollar financing, then the dollar is a better measure than typical safe-haven currencies” in assessing systemic stress, David Loevinger, a former China specialist at the U.S. Treasury and now an analyst at fund manager TCW Group Inc. in Los Angeles, said in an email. Even the yen and franc -- the typical refuges -- lagged the greenback last month “during the period of max market distress,” he added.
Granted, no one says the dollar is the only useful barometer. Traders are keyed into a worrisome surge in cross-currency basis swaps, a more-than-20% plunge in the S&P 500 and carnage in junk bonds to sort out whether the worst has passed. But as the world’s primary reserve currency, the dollar stands out.
Much of the globe’s business is conducted in the greenback, while commodities, including gold, are also priced in the U.S. currency. When the liquidity crunch intensified last month, stressed international investors mopped up safer dollar-denominated assets that could be used as collateral, while they sold a variety of other assets.
That sent dollar funding costs surging to record levels, and leading to that 10-day rally in the Bloomberg dollar index, the longest winning streak since 2012. The index is still up almost 7% in 2020.
‘Best Barometer’
A drop in the dollar will signal a more positive economic outlook, said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). When Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s U.S. Dollar Index falls below 96, that will suggest the troubles may have passed, he said.
The gauge, which he says is the “best barometer” to track the pandemic’s toll on markets, is just over 100 now, up from a 2020 low of 94.65 on March 9.
A weaker dollar will “lead” the shift from the current deflation consensus to stagflation, a state where the economy will reflect weak growth and higher inflation, Hartnett said.
Investors who breathed a sigh of relief after the Fed’s actions eased funding strains are now agonizing over a pending global recession.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates the U.S. could contract at an annualized rate of 34% in the second quarter. Germany expects its economy will shrink more than it did during the 2008 financial crisis, while China faces a blow to its industries as major customers in Europe and the U.S. are impaired -- all helping drive investors into the greenback.
“Since this economic and financial crisis is at its core a health crisis, economic policy measures can only ameliorate the economic and financial consequences,” Paul Meggyesi, currency strategist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., wrote in a March 27 note to clients. “Markets will bottom and the dollar will top only when there is public health resolution.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The cost of swapping euros and sterling for dollars in FX swap markets fell on Monday to the lowest in over a decade in a sign of success for central banks' operations, though some other indicators imply money market stress has not wholly dissipated.
The swap moves follow a series of policy efforts to squelch the strains in dollar funding markets, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's dollar swap lines for many foreign central banks and offer of temporary 'repo' facilities for others who lack access to such lines.
These actions reversed the surge in dollar borrowing costs overseas. Three-month euro-dollar FX swaps  touched a 12-year low of minus 65 bps, having swung two weeks back to a 2011 European crisis-era high of more than 150 bps.
Essentially that means European entities are now able to source greenbacks at a discount, rather than paying large premia. This in itself is an anomaly of sorts because a swap market premium for dollars has been a feature of the market ever since the 2008 crisis.
""Policies put in place to settle markets have created new distortions of their own,"" Natwest market strategists said in a note. ""Judging from cross-currency basis swaps, there has been a swing from an acute dollar shortage to an oversupply."" 
Swap rates versus the pound  also touched a 12-year low of minus 42 bps and dollar-yen swaps  slipped to the lowest in eight years at minus 30 bps, according to Refinitiv data.
Graphic - Dollar funding markets recover from stress: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvglxdpqd/Dollar%20funding1.PNG
More broadly, the reduction in dollar borrowing pressures in FX swaps hasn't dented greenback strength. The dollar index (=USD) rose 2.5% last week while it firmed 3% against the euro (EUR=EBS) 
What's more, there is evidence of elevated stress levels elsewhere, particularly in U.S. interbank funding markets.
For example, the cost of borrowing dollars outside the United States -- the three-month dollar LIBOR  -- is stubbornly high at 1.38%. While that was over 5% in mid-March, it is well above the 0.25% federal funds target rate . 
The still-wide spreads between the two rates suggests ""there is still a credit risk or a liquidity shortage in the market"", said Simon Harvey, at Monex Europe, a forex broker. 
Stubbornly high LIBOR rates have also spilled into interbank U.S. markets. A gauge measuring the difference between what big banks pay for longer-term financing compared to overnight funds  is stuck near 2008 highs at 131 bps. 
The spread reflects the high demand for bank loans by a variety of borrowers at a time when there is increased pressure on banks' balance sheets to cut back on risky lending, said Ilan Solot, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
Pressure on securing bank loans also is manifested in spreads between the rate on three-month commercial paper -- which U.S. companies tap for short-dated funds -- and bank lending rates are above 105 bps, compared to 24 bps at the start of 2020. 
Elevated interbank funding costs ""shows the onshore-offshore lending remains dysfunctional,"" said Marc Chandler at Bannockburn Securities in New York.
""It is this discrepancy that may help explain why the cross-currency basis swaps look so distorted now."" 
Graphic - FX swaps/forwards and currency swaps hedge trade, bond debt and portfolios: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdobbpoj/Dollar%20funding%202.PNG
BBH's Solot said another reason why offshore dollar borrowing costs have fallen relative to U.S. interbank markets is because these swap transactions were collateralized in a foreign currency, while much of the borrowing in the U.S. markets was on an unsecured basis.
""At worst, in the offshore market, you are stuck with a wrong currency as collateral but in the U.S., most of these borrowings don't have any collateral,"" he said.

The Bank for International Settlements, an umbrella group for the world's central banks, said last week there is a need to ensure dollar funds remain available to firms that are enmeshed in global supply chains and in constant need of working capital.

Emerging-market currencies beaten down by Covid-19 fallout may face a fresh round of selling with this week’s release of data expected to show a big drawdown in foreign-exchange reserves.
Mexico’s weekly data is set to come out on Monday, while Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines, China, Malaysia, South Africa and Russia are due to issue updates on Tuesday. That comes on the heels of a $9 billion slump in South Korea last month and a $6 billion decline for India since the end of February.
Central banks in emerging economies are tapping reserves to stem a decline in their currencies as the coronavirus pandemic induces a rush into the U.S. dollar as a haven. The sliding stockpiles highlight the quandary they face trying to bring stability amid capital outflows, while ensuring they have ammunition for future actions.
“I expect more weakness ahead for EM currencies as demand for dollars will remain strong,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore “We can expect to see reserves decline further as central banks continue to smooth FX moves and provide liquidity to the market.”
While most emerging-market central banks have greater reserves than they did during the Asian financial turmoil of 1998 and global financial crisis of 2008, the macro economic outlook remains uncertain. The Federal Reserve’s swap lines and a new facility through which developing nations can secure dollars using Treasury holdings will help ease some pressure.
Capital Flight
But expectations the pandemic will cause a global recession are keeping the risk of capital flight elevated in the weakest links of emerging markets. Global funds have scaled back stock investments in South Korea, Brazil and Turkey, while selling off bonds in countries such as India and Indonesia.
The Mexican peso slid to a record low on Monday amid disappointment over the government’s stimulus plans. The nation’s reserves remain near a record high as officials appear reluctant to tap them, while Brazilian and Turkish stockpiles have been sliding.
The faster-than-expected erosion in Russian reserves also clouds the picture for the ruble given oil prices remain vulnerable to the market-share war with Saudi Arabia. India’s central bank has already been using its record foreign-currency arsenal to defend the rupee.

Investing.com - The Japanese yen has seen selling Monday, with the country’s government expected to call a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), USD/JPY climbed 0.7% to 109.17. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.685, largely flat, while EUR/USD rose 0.1% to 1.0823 and GBP/USD rose 0.1% to 1.2269.
Japan has been relatively lightly hit by the spread of the coronavirus pandemic so far, registering just over 3,600 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. 
However, pressure is starting to mount on the Japanese government because the number of cases is starting to increase, with the number in Tokyo alone topping 1,000 - still low compared with the United States, countries in Europe and China, where thousands have died.
As a result, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to declare a state of emergency this week.
The pandemic has caused developed economies to virtually close down as governments attempt social distancing policies to stem the spreading of the virus.
“Coronavirus cases in Japan may not peak for another month, so the markets will think that now it’s Japan’s turn. A state of emergency is necessary, but this could be yen negative,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, on CNBC.
“The yen has been the flipside of risk appetite – falling as risk appetite improves and vice versa,” said SaxoBank, in a research note. But, with “Japan suddenly faced with mounting Covid19 problems, both as a new financial year gets underway in Japan as of April 1, the JPY crosses are an interesting subplot to the general obsession with the direction of the USD.”
The dollar continues to march higher against many emerging currencies, with the Indonesian rupiah and the Mexican peso among the worst hit. In addition to their own problems with the medical emergency, many emerging markets are desperately short of dollars to repay maturing debts, now that U.S. consumers and businesses are no longer pumping dollars out into the world economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound fell against the dollar and euro on Monday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests after showing persistent symptoms of the coronavirus.
The yen fell against the dollar and the antipodean currencies after Japanese media reported Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may declare a state of emergency as early as Tuesday to curb an alarming acceleration in coronavirus infections.
The dollar was on the back foot against the euro after data last week showed companies in the United States shed jobs at break-neck speed as the COVID-19 pandemic leads the global economy into a deep recession.
""When a head of state or government is stricken like this, it will cause concern for holders of sterling and sterling assets,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""Coronavirus cases in Japan may not peak for another month, so the markets will think that now it's Japan's turn. A state of emergency is necessary, but this could be yen negative.""
The pound  fell 0.26% to $1.2242 on Monday in Asia. Against the euro, it (EURGBP=D3) fell 0.27% to 88.39 pence.
Johnson was admitted in what Downing Street said was a ""precautionary step"" because he was showing persistent symptoms of COVID-19 10 days after testing positive for the novel coronavirus.
Also weighing on sterling is Britain's constitution - an unwieldy collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents - that offers no formal deputy or caretaker who would take over if Johnson cannot continue to lead.
The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has turned into a pandemic that has infected more than a million people, killed over 68,000 and paralysed large swathes of the global economy.
In the offshore market, China's yuan  held steady at 7.1134 per dollar after the mainland reported 39 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, all but one of them imported, up from the 30 reported a day earlier. China's mainland markets are closed Monday for a public holiday.
YEN WEAKENS
The yen  fell 0.4% to 108.93 against the dollar. It also weakened against the euro (EURJPY=EBS), the Australian dollar (AUDJPY=), and the New Zealand dollar (NZDJPY=).
Japan's prime minister will declare a state of emergency over the coronavirus as early as Tuesday, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, as the number of infections topped 1,000 in the capital, Tokyo.
Abe will likely announce his plans to declare the emergency on Monday, the paper said.
Pressure has been mounting on the government to make the move as the pace of infections - while slow versus harder-hit countries around the world - continues to accelerate.
The dollar eased slightly to $1.0814 per euro (EUR=EBS) and held steady at 0.9769 Swiss franc .
U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday expressed hope that the United States was seeing a ""leveling-off"" of the virus crisis in some of the nation's hot spots.
However, sentiment for the greenback remains fragile after a series of data last week showed U.S. job losses are soaring as draconian measures to curb the virus hurt consumer spending and factory activity.

Investing.com – The pound continued its selloff against the dollar on Friday, as the U.K. services sector suffered its worst month on record, exacerbating fears about the strength of the economy at a time when business activity has ground to a halt following a nationwide lockdown last week.
GBP/USD fell 1.15% to $1.2249 after hitting a high of $1.2411 on the day.
IHS’s Markit’s services purchasing managers’ index, which measures the change in monthly sector activity, fell to reading of 34.5, the worst ever recorded.
With restaurants, pubs and other businesses set to remain in lockdown in the coming weeks, many fear the worst is yet to come, particularly as the Covid-19 pandemic in the U.K. shows little sign of slowing.
Offering a sliver of optimism, Health Secretary Matt Hancock tentatively suggested infections in Britain could peak on April 12, Sky reported.
""I defer to the scientists on the exact predictions, I'm not going to steer you away from that. That is one perfectly possible outcome,"" Hancock reportedly said, when asked about reports that the death rate could peak on April 12."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is set to remain at depressed levels over the coming months, with analysts in a Reuters poll slashing their forecasts for the currency as the coronavirus pandemic potentially pushes Canada's economy into a deep recession. 
The loonie has plunged more than 8% since the start of the year, with much of that decline coming over the past month, as the coronavirus outbreak interrupted global economic activity and major oil producers began a price war.
Canada's economy could be hit particularly hard because it is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, and Canadians carry record debt loads.
""Forecasting is fraught with perils right now as no one really knows how long the virus-related lockdown will last,"" said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""We believe that the Canadian economy will enter a recession in the first half of this year.""
Davis sees second-quarter gross domestic product plunging at an annualized rate of 18% after an estimated 3% contraction for the economy in the first quarter.
The poll of over 30 currency analysts showed they expect the Canadian dollar to weaken only slightly to 1.42 per U.S. dollar, or 70.42 U.S. cents, in three months, from about 1.4175 on Thursday. In March's poll, the 3-month forecast was 1.32.
But the loonie is then expected to rebound, with strategists forecasting 1.37 in one year.
""We are more optimistic over the longer term for the loonie,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins.
By the summer ""the recovery should be strong enough to reduce significantly the level of uncertainty and to fuel demand for currencies such as the Canadian dollar,"" Vachon said.
Ottawa is rolling out more than C$200 billion in support for Canada's economy, including direct aid to Canadians, wage subsidies for businesses, loan programs and tax deferrals, while the Bank of Canada has slashed interest rates to nearly zero and launched a large-scale asset purchase program, quantitative easing, for the first time.
Should oil prices recover, that could also support the loonie.
""Our energy analyst is expecting a decent pick-up when we look towards year-end, with a target of 50 bucks,"" said Christian Lawrence, a senior market strategist at Rabobank. ""That is CAD positive longer term.""
Oil has recovered some ground since Monday, when it hit an 18-year low at $19.27 a barrel, on hopes that Russia and Saudi Arabia will announce a major oil production cut.

Investing.com - The dollar was in demand in early trading in Europe on Friday, as investors sought safety following the dire U.S. unemployment figures which illustrated the extent of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, rose above 100 for the first time in over a week to stand at 100.460, up 0.2% on the day and up some 0.6% on the week. EUR/USD fell 0.3% to 1.0823, while GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2367. USD/JPY climbed 0.1% to 108.02.
The outbreak of the pandemic has caused developed economies to virtually close down as governments attempt social distancing policies to stem the spreading of the virus.
Further evidence of the damage associated with these policies emerged in the United States Thursday, with an unprecedented number of workers - 6.6 million - filing jobless claims.
At the same time, the pandemic has shown few signs of abating Friday, with global cases surpassing one million, with more than 53,000 deaths, over 6,000 of which were in the U.S.
""The U.S. labor market has more or less collapsed,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency analyst Joe Capurso, in a Reuters report.
""The increase in the dollar because of the poor U.S. economic data reflects the dollar's status as a counter‑cyclical currency. It lifts when the global economy deteriorates, even if the deterioration in the global economy is the U.S.""
There’s more U.S. employment data to come at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), in the form of the official jobs report for March. However, this was from the week of March 12, before any major U.S. state had gone into lockdown, and thus is likely to only have a limited impact.
Adding to the dollar’s appeal has been the sudden rebound in the price of oil, although Thursday’s sharp gains have been sold into early Friday. Oil is priced in dollars and the U.S. is also the world's top oil and gas producer.
“The USD has once again proven to be King in times of crisis,” said analyst Andreas Steno Larsen at Nordea, in a research note, “probably as most debt is still denominated in USDs, which means that USDs are sought after when liquidity tightens globally as has been the case due to the corona lockdowns.”
However, the dollar could be hammered as soon as we approach a reopening of the economy, he warned.
“USD liquidity is sprayed at every single scarce corner of the market now. This is ultimately going to kill the USD momentum; it is just a matter of time in our opinion,” Larsen said.
The dollar “could face a hit of >15% over the coming 12-24 months if the global economy gets out of the woods in the meanwhile.”

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Central Europe's currencies could be over the worst of their pounding as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic, as Hungary's forint is seen recovering from record lows and the Czech crown gradually firming in the next year, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The poll is the first since the pandemic worsened and since investors' flight to safety pushed central Europe currencies into losses of 6-8% in March.
In the poll, only Romania's leu and Serbia's dinar - which have avoided sharp falls - were expected to depreciate over the next year. The forint, crown and Polish zloty should return back to an appreciation path, just on a weaker course.
The forint, already around record lows before the outbreak, was seen regaining 7% from Wednesday's closing levels to 340 to the euro over the next 12 months - weaker than the 12-month median forecast of 335 a month ago.
After hitting an all-time low of 369.54 on Wednesday the forint bounced back after the central bank announced a new one-week deposit tender available to banks at its 0.9% base rate, which analysts called an implicit rate hike.
The bank said the move could reduce commercial banks' stock of overnight deposits and manage liquidity in the market better.
""It is very hard to predict what is going to happen to the forint's exchange rate once the pandemic is over and the economy starts to revive,"" Gergely Suppan, senior economist at Magyar Takarek, said. ""The new deposit tender... somewhat stabilized the forint.""
""But it is hard to predict its long-term effect,"" he added.
Hungary has long had the loosest policy in the region although the other central banks are shifting heavily into easing mode to cushion the blow from the virus.
Government measures to contain the spread have limited daily life limited to essential shopping and going to work. Factories - including major car plants - have idled, shocking the region's economies and putting them on course for declines in 2020.
The Czech central bank cut its main rate by 125 basis points, to 1.00%, in March. The bank has said it was ready to defend excessive crown moves. It holds foreign reserves equal to 60% of gross domestic product.
The poll, though, sees the crown firming 7.8% to 25.50 to the euro - where it stood before the outbreak.
Similarly, the Polish zloty (EURPLN=) was seen rising again over the next 12 months, with the median forecast expecting a 5.8% gain to 4.35 to the euro, close to where it started March.
Romania's leu (EURRON=) was seen depreciating 1.7% as the government fights to contain a swelling budget deficit - which already had investors concerned before the outbreak.
""The leu has limited space to rally after the virus-related market stress fades as old structural problems remain relevant,"" Jakub Kratky, from Generali (MI:GASI) Investments CEE, said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts think the worst may already be over for the hard-hit Australian and New Zealand dollars and see them slowly regaining ground over the year ahead, a surprising mark of faith given the economic carnage caused by the coronavirus.
Analysts polled by Reuters see the Aussie at $0.6020  in one month, just under the $0.6055 level it was trading at on Friday.
That was a steep downgrade from the $0.6700 predicted in the last poll in February, reflecting the wild swings seen since then. Indeed, the market was so manic a poll could not be conducted properly in March.
The Aussie plunged from $0.6700 to a 17-year low of $0.5510 in a nine-day period in early March, as the spread of the virus sent global markets into a tailspin.
Now, the median forecast was for the Aussie to creep up to $0.6100 in three months, $0.6300 in six and $0.6600 on a one-year horizon.
Yet estimates ranged widely - from $0.5200 to $0.6800 on a three-month view - reflecting uncertainty on how long the economic impact of the pandemic might last.
Economists fear Australian output (GDP) could fall by 5% or more this quarter, from the first quarter, even though the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut rates to a record low of 0.25% and the government launched a massive stimulus package.
With much of the world also shut down, that is a wall of worry to climb for a commodity-leveraged currency such as the Aussie.
""Growing fears that prolonged shutdowns around the world will exacerbate the global economic contraction will keep AUD and NZD on the back foot in our view,"" said Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at CBA.
""We still expect AUD to fall to $0.5700, and probably lower, while NZD is heading for $0.5500, and probably lower.""
The kiwi has fared almost as badly as the Aussie in the past month, tumbling to a decade low of $0.5469  at one stage in March, before bouncing somewhat to $0.5895.
Again median forecasts suggested it was near a floor, with $0.5900 seen in one month and $0.6000 in three. Estimates ranged all the way from $0.5200 to $0.6500.
From there, analysts tipped it at $0.6100 in six months and $0.6400 on a one-year horizon.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar edged toward an almost 2% weekly rise on Friday, boosted by a surge in the oil price and as investors sought safety amid the worsening economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
The gains consolidate the dollar's strength after a topsy-turvy end to last month, which had the dollar soaring in a scramble for cash, then slumping as the U.S. Federal Reserve flooded the market with liquidity.
The largest ever daily gain in crude oil prices helped the greenback to its best day in two weeks against the euro overnight, since the United States is the world's top oil and gas producer.
It held that ground to stand at $1.0838 per euro (EUR=) on Friday - ahead 2.7% for the week. Against a basket of currencies (=USD) the dollar is up 1.8% for the week so far at 100.210, its best performance since mid-March.
Moves in Asian trade were slight since traders are bracing for bad news when monthly U.S. payrolls data is published at 1230 GMT.
The coronavirus pandemic is worsening in the United States and as lockdowns extend, weekly jobless claims already soared to a massive 6.6 million last week.
The dollar was firmer against most other major currencies, last trading at $0.6054 per Australian dollar , $0.5903 per New Zealand dollar  and $1.2376 per pound .
It bought 108.00 Japanese yen .
""The U.S. labour market has more or less collapsed,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency analyst Joe Capurso.
""The increase in the dollar because of the poor U.S. economic data reflects the dollar's status as a counter‑cyclical currency.  It lifts when the global economy deteriorates, even if the deterioration in the global economy is the U.S.""
CBA forecasts a 200,000 drop in employment, higher than the median estimate of a 100,000 drop according to a Reuters' survey of economists - though like most, they expect far worse to come as the data catches up to the damage in the real economy.
Global coronavirus cases surpassed 1 million on Thursday, with more than 52,000 deaths as the pandemic spread further in the United States and the death toll climbed in Spain and Italy, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
Japanese bank Nomura expects the world economy contracted 18% in the first quarter, on an annualised basis, and is tracking toward shrinking 4% in 2020.
The overnight 21% surge in the price of crude oil futures (LCOc1) to $29.94 gave fleeting support to commodity currencies, especially the oil-exposed Norwegian krone , which hit a three-week high, and Canadian dollar . [O/R]
Flows out of just about every asset in emerging markets in to the dollar continue, with MSCI's emerging market currency index (MIEM00000CUS) sitting not far above three-year lows touched last month. [EMRG/FRX]
""Until the virus peaks, we anticipate the selling pressure will prevail and capital outflows will continue, although the biggest wave may have occurred in March,"" said Piotr Matys, senior emerging markets FX Strategist at Rabobank in London.
""If a synchronised global recession transforms into depression, then all bets will be off.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost of raising U.S. dollar funds in the yen and euro swaps market stabilized on Thursday, with premiums favoring the other two currencies suggesting that demand for the greenback had receded from earlier in the coronavirus pandemic.
Currency spreads in yen and euro swaps, the two most liquid markets, widened sharply last month as foreign banks and companies scrambled for dollar funding. 
A slew of measures from the Federal Reserve last month to ensure there was no global dollar shortage alleviated some funding pressure.
Cross currency swaps and FX swaps allow investors to raise funds in a particular currency from other funding currencies. For example, an institution with dollar funding needs can raise euros in euro funding markets and convert the proceeds into dollar funding obligations via an FX swap.
On Thursday, euro/dollar three-month swaps widened considerably in favor of the euro to nearly 59 basis points , the highest spread since at least 2004.
The yen/dollar three-month swaps also widened in favor of the yen to nearly 19 basis points .

""With all the actions that the Fed has taken, the most recent one being the creation of a standing repo facility for foreign central banks, all this unprecedented action has created a glut of dollars now,"" said Erik Bregar, head of FX strategy at Exchange Bank of Canada in Toronto.

Investing.com - The dollar edged lower in European trading Thursday, with investors seemingly prepared to move out of the safe haven into riskier currencies ahead of key U.S. unemployment data.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.640, down 0.1%. EUR/USD fell 0.2% to 1.0939, while GBP/USD rose 0.3% to 1.2418. USD/JPY climbed 0.1% to 107.28.
The outbreak of the pandemic has caused developed economies to virtually close down as governments attempt social distancing policies to stem the spreading of the virus.
The starkest evidence of the economic damage caused came last week when weekly U.S. initial jobless claims, one of the earliest gauges of economic trends, jumped to 3.28 million, blowing past the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
This week’s numbers are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with another 3.5 million claims expected. 
Obviously these are poor numbers, but if there can be a positive slant, it may be that a large number of claims means that displaced workers are availing themselves of the backstop support provided in the stimulus bill. That would keep much-needed disposable income in the economy.
Additionally, the price of oil climbed sharply Thursday after President Donald Trump stated late Wednesday that Russia and Saudi Arabia would make a deal to end their price war within a ""few days"".
Global oil prices have fallen by roughly two-thirds this year, hitting hard the finances of the countries that depend on oil revenue for funding.
At 3:00 AM ET, USD/NOK traded 1.6% lower at 10.23.23, while USD/RUB dropped 1.4% to 77.63. Russia spent 5% of its reserves defending the ruble in the week to March 20. Data for last week are due later Thursday.
Some vulnerable emerging market currencies have come under extreme pressure recently as wide current account deficits, low credit ratings and limited foreign currency reserves heighten capital flight risks.
The South African rand hit record lows while the Turkish lira sank to a two-year low. Thursday’s more positive tone has allowed these to post small recoveries.
At 3 AM ET (0710 GMT), USD/ZAR traded 0.3% lower at 18.15 and USD/TRY was 0.5% lower at 6.6623.

211,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan is coming under pressure after it weakened past a support level that had held for the past two weeks.
The currency fell as much as 0.41% on Thursday to depreciate past 7.125 per dollar for the first time since October, before paring losses. Analysts cited demand for greenbacks and concern over the country’s export outlook as reasons for the declines.
Sentiment is turning more bearish in China as the central bank limits stimulus and the global economy falters. Against a basket of 24 trading partner currencies, the yuan fell for seven straight days through Wednesday, while the CSI 300 Index of shares trailed MSCI Inc.’s global benchmark by the most since 2015 last week.
There are signs the central bank will seek to limit further declines. The People’s Bank of China previously set its daily fixing at stronger levels than expected when the yuan neared 7.125. Chinese banks also helped the currency strengthen by selling dollars.
“The yuan trading weaker than 7.1 indicates souring sentiment and may make the PBOC less comfortable,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asia currency strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “If market forces could not guide the yuan back to near 7.1 at the market close in Asia, we may see a firmer fixing tomorrow.”
The yuan last traded down 0.1% at 7.1042.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held gains on Thursday as investors rushed to the security of the world's most liquid currency as the coronavirus pandemic caused massive disruptions to global trade.
The dollar index against a basket of major six currencies (=USD) gained 0.53% overnight as the U.S. currency advanced against most of its major peers except for the safe-haven yen.
In early Thursday trade, the euro was little changed at $1.0959 (EUR=) after 0.69% fall on Wednesday. Sterling fetched $1.2382 , having lost 0.40% on Wednesday.
The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6080 , having dropped 0.99% in the previous session.
The dollar traded at 107.15 yen  after it touched a two-week low of 106.925 on Wednesday.
Markets were spooked after U.S. President Donald Trump's dire press briefing late Tuesday, in which he warned Americans of a ""painful"" two weeks ahead in fighting the coronavirus even with strict social distancing measures.
""If America's optimistic president is warning the worst of the pandemic is yet to come, what factory in their right mind would keep the doors open and workers on the payroll?"" asked Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
""With only a few actual data points so far, the results indicate this is looking more like a depression than a garden-variety recession.""
The starkest evidence of the damage came last week when weekly U.S. initial jobless claims, one of the earliest gauges of economic trends, jumped to 3.28 million, blowing past the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
The next jobless claims data release due at 1230 GMT on Thursday is expected to show another 3.50 million applications during last week.
Economists' forecast in Reuters poll range from 1.5 million to 5.25 million.
""As we've seen yesterday, a deterioration in the U.S. economic outlook is likely to lead to strength in the yen against the U.S. dollar,"" said Shin-ichiro Kadota, senior strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The pandemic has shown few signs of abating with global cases on track to hit one million within a day or two, stretching over more than 200 countries.
Some vulnerable emerging market currencies have come under extreme pressure as wide current account deficits, low credit ratings and limited foreign currency reserves heighten capital flight risks.
The Brazilian real  and the South African rand  both hit record lows while the Turkish lira  sank to a two-year low.

213,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Good riddance to the worst first quarter in history. But that doesn’t guarantee Spring sunshine and flowers as winter ends. Eminent investors such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC co-founder Howard Marks and DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach are warning that the worst may not be over. April really could be the cruelest month for equities as a brief bear market rally peters out and the lows are tested again. Until there’s evidence that the worst of the virus contamination is under control, the economy and financial markets are at its mercy.
Fixed-income assets have a tendency to show where equities are headed during crises and yet again U.S. Treasury bond yields are pushing lower, a clear warning of a renewed flight to quality.
While central banks have swiftly enacted the playbook learnt from the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and even parsimonious governments such as Germany’s are reaching for the fiscal checkbook, the emergency aid is only reaching higher-quality assets.
Sub-investment grade companies and non-agency mortgage debt are trapped in a downward spiral. Marks pointed to mounting job losses and business defaults and said the range of negative outcomes is wider now. Gundlach said the current economy resembles a depression and that he expects many defaults, although he advocates a hardline approach with “no government bailouts whatsoever.” That might not meet with popular approval.
The critical faultline in the coronavirus-induced selloff has been the sudden strength in the dollar, as banks and investors globally liquidate assets and scramble for cash — above all, dollar cash. Until the Federal Reserve can satisfy onshore and offshore demand for the greenback, the economic effects of that will spread like wildfire. Everybody is desperate for liquidity, from the commercial property market to blue-chip  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., which had to come to the bond market recently as it couldn’t get the size of funding it wanted in commercial paper. 
With this lack of access to liquidity rising all over corporate America — especially in junk-rated companies —  assets everywhere are being used as ATMs to raise urgent funds.
Some of the Fed’s liquidity measures won’t become fully operational until April 6, such as the crucial commercial paper funding facility, where the central bank will buy directly from eligible U.S. issuers. Until that backstop measure to ease borrowing in the corporate market kicks in, there will be little respite.
We have also just passed the end of the Japanese financial year, and there has been super-strong demand from the country’s banks for dollar liquidity. It’s been running at a rate of nearly 10 times that of European Banks, which is bound to have an impact.
Until the volatility in the dollar money markets subsides there will no be peace for other asset classes and the intense pressure for liquidation will persist. The Fed is alive to the problem and has extended its dollar swaps lines to all foreign central banks (if they have an account with the New York Fed), allowing them to park U.S. Treasury bonds in return for cash.
The dollar is the world's reserve currency and the Fed is now acting as the central bank to all. Only by pumping out liquidity globally can it possibly prevent an even more almighty rush into dollars. Until it has put a lid on the money-market stress, the rest of the financial markets remain in peril.

Investing.com - The dollar traded a little higher Wednesday, helped by its status as a safe haven currency as manufacturing data out of Asia pointed to a severe economic slowdown as the region tries to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
At 03:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.430, up 0.3%. EUR/USD fell 0.4% to 1.0980, while GBP/USD dropped 0.56 to 1.2353. USD/JPY climbed 0.1% to 107.61.
Factory activity dropped sharply across most of Asia in March, according to the latest Purchasing Managers' Index surveys, with regional economic powerhouses Japan and South Korea, posting their biggest contractions in about a decade.
Limiting the greenback’s gains was the news that the U.S. Federal Reserve late Tuesday broadened the ability of dozens of foreign central banks to access dollars during the coronavirus crisis by allowing them to exchange their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for overnight dollar loans.
“The Fed clearly wants to do everything it can to ensure dollar liquidity, which puts downward pressure on the dollar,"" said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at broker IG Markets.
""But by the same token there is still this very structural push to buy dollars right now because liquidity is coming at an absolute premium with so much risk in the market.""
One of the regions hardest hit has been Central and Eastern Europe, an area trying to cope with the economic downturn while also facing political uncertainty. 
On Monday Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban received the right to rule by decree indefinitely, undermining the principles of a democracy, while in Poland the ruling party is pressing ahead with May’s presidential election despite opposition given the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:10 AM ET, EUR/HUF traded 0.4% higher at 362.44, EUR/PLN was up 0.5% at 4.5796 and EUR/CZK rose 0.5% to 27.459.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was a touch firmer on Wednesday, buoyed by its safe-haven status with the world staring at what is likely to be one of the worst economic contractions for decades as it locks down to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
It advanced against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, the euro, yen, Swiss franc and pound in Asian trade - but not much - as appetite for the safety of cash dollars was offset by aggressive liquidity measures from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The Australian dollar dipped 0.2% to $0.6123  and the New Zealand dollar dropped 0.3% to $0.5945 . The euro (EUR=) eased 0.3% to $1.1010 and the dollar rose 0.2% to 107.74 Japanese yen .
However that still left the dollar beneath overnight highs against most majors and well below multi-year peaks made last month, before the Fed's pumped more dollars into the system to calm markets.
The Fed on Tuesday broadened the ability of dozens of foreign central banks to access dollars during the coronavirus crisis by allowing them to exchange their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for overnight dollar loans.
""The whole experience is testing the maxim in the market of 'don't fight the Fed,'"" said Kyle Rodda, analyst at broker IG Markets in Melbourne.
""The Fed clearly wants to do everything it can necessary to ensure dollar liquidity, which puts downward pressure on the dollar,"" he said.
""But by the same token there is still this very structural push to buy dollars right now because liquidity is coming at an absolute premium with so much risk in the market.""
OUTLOOK GRIM
The dollar was marginally higher against emerging market currencies and steady at 7.0810 Chinese yuan . Against the pound  the dollar firmed 0.3% to $1.2381 per pound.
Against a basket of currencies (=USD) it was flat at 99.028.
Meanwhile, manufacturing data in Asia painted a bleak picture. Factory activity in Japan and South Korea posted the biggest contractions in about a decade.
The Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" corporate survey showed Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven years.
Surveys due later on Wednesday from countries including Germany and the United States are expected to do similarly little for investor confidence, while U.S. private employment data is likely to show a drop in payrolls.
The virus has now killed more than 42,000 people and infected more than 851,000 in 205 countries.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday said it now forecasts a real GDP sequential decline of 34% in the United States this quarter, on an annualized basis, compared with an earlier estimate of a 24% drop.

""In the absence of either a material improvement in global risk sentiment, or commodity prices, then together with ongoing dollar strength, we are not convinced the Australian dollar can easily maintain its foothold back above $0.60,"" National Australia Bank analysts said in a note.

216,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve has opened a temporary repurchase agreement facility for foreign central banks to support the smooth functioning of financial markets.
The program will allow participants to temporarily exchange U.S. Treasuries for dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions.
“This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market,” the Fed said in a statement Tuesday.
The dollar pared its gains after the announcement, while short-end Treasury yields held steady and U.S. stock futures remained down on the day.
The program, available April 6, is a new weapon in the Fed’s arsenal to stabilize dollar funding markets. The U.S. central bank said it “reduces the need for central banks to sell their Treasury securities outright and into illiquid markets,” helping stabilize trading in the world’s most secure and important asset.
“By allowing central banks to use their securities to raise dollars quickly and efficiently, the facility will also support local markets in U.S. dollars and bolster broader market confidence,” the Fed said. “Stabilizing foreign dollar markets, in turn, will support foreign economic conditions and thereby benefit the U.S. economy through many channels, including confidence and trade.”
The facility was authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, according to the statement.
The Fed said the term of the repos will be overnight, but can be rolled over as needed. Transactions will be conducted at a rate of 25 basis points over the interest rate on excess reserves.
Outstanding transaction totals will be made public in the Fed’s weekly balance sheet report."

Investing.com - The dollar traded marginally higher Tuesday, helped by gains against the more defensive currencies, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, on the last trading day of the month.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.597, up 0.3%. 
USD/JPY gained 0.6% to 108.50, USD/CHF rose 0.5% to 0.9629, while EUR/USD fell 0.4% to 1.1005.
“The talk is Japanese names are short of dollars (as the fiscal year comes to an end), which is likely to keep the dollar bid well into London time,” Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities, told CNBC.
That said, the yen and the Swiss franc are often seen as safe havens during troubled times, and the better-than-expected China manufacturing PMI data will have given traders hope that some economic stabilisation may be possible going forward.
Global risk stabilisation near term supports EUR/USD at 1.10-1.12 for now, said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“Looking further ahead, a range of factors (EU institutional weakness, doubt as to Fed’s reaction function 12M out and virus fears) also still make downside risks more pertinent, such that 1.07 will likely act as an anchor, the bank added.
Additionally, GBP/USD dropped 1% to 1.2292, as the Fitch downgrading of U.K.’s sovereign debt rating on Friday continued to takr its toll on sterling.
Elsewhere, the forint is lower, with EUR/HUF up 0.2% at 359.13, having hit a new all-time high on Tuesday after the Hungarian Parliament voted Monday to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule by decree during the coronavirus emergency - with no time limit. The measures establish a dictatorship in all but name in the heart of the EU, which has long prided itself on its role in fostering democracy in Europe.
This move “does have the potential to amplify the already ongoing disagreements between Hungary and the EU,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. 
“As such, these somewhat right-wing initiatives did lend support to EUR/HUF yesterday and more HUF weakness could come at a later point in time as a result,” the bank added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday as Japanese investors and companies rushed to cover a shortage of the U.S. currency before their fiscal year end, but sentiment remained fragile as the global coronavirus crisis showed no signs of abating.
China's yuan held steady in offshore trade but could be buffeted by the release of a key manufacturing survey later in the day as investors count the economic cost of the coronavirus, which first emerged in China late last year. 
The pound fell against the greenback and the euro as a sovereign ratings downgrade continued to weigh on sterling, underlining the strain on public finances from a much needed massive fiscal stimulus.
Tuesday is the last trading data for Japan's fiscal year and the end of the quarter for major investors elsewhere, which could lead to some volatile swings as big players in the currency market close their books.
However, analysts warn that an almost certain global recession due to the coronavirus will remain a dominant influence in trading and eventually favor currencies least affected by the economic downturn.
""The talk is Japanese names are short of dollars, which is likely to keep the dollar bid well into London time,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""We have to look beyond that and focus on what's going on in China's economy. Even if there is some decent data from China, I cannot be optimistic, because economic activity in many countries is grinding to a halt.""
The dollar rose 0.23% to 108.06 yen  on Tuesday in Asia.
In the offshore market, the yuan  was little changed at 7.1114 versus the dollar.
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index is expected to show activity likely remained in contraction in March, though it was set to stabilize slightly from the coronavirus-led collapse that virtually paralyzed the world's second-biggest economy.
China's currency eased on Monday after the People's Bank of China unexpectedly cut its reverse repo rate by the most in almost five years.
The euro (EUR=EBS) was little changed at $1.1031. Traders are bracing for data expected to show a rise in German unemployment as the global economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic.
Against the Swiss franc , the dollar held steady at 0.9600, following a 0.8% gain on Monday.
Sterling  fell 0.46% to $1.2367, and against the euro (EURGBP=D3), the pound fell 0.38% to 89.23 pence.
The pound remained under the gun after ratings agency Fitch cut Britain's sovereign debt rating on Friday, saying debt levels would jump as it ramped up spending to offset a near shutdown of the economy.
Traders are also awaiting the release of UK gross domestic product later on Tuesday. 
The New Zealand dollar  dipped after the country's government extended a nationwide state of emergency for another seven days to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but the kiwi quickly regained its composure to trade steady at $0.5962.
The Australian dollar  held its ground at $0.6170.
The antipodean currencies have come under heavy selling pressure over recent weeks as their close economic ties to China and the global commodities trade make them vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak.

LONDON (Reuters) - If the 2008 financial crisis is any guide, world markets - which have barely had time to recover from the dollar's 9% surge in mid-March - may be set for another damaging bout of strength in the greenback.
In the 10 days from March 9, the dollar leapt against almost every other currency as companies and banks bought it to pay their creditors, trade partners and suppliers. Money market funding rates jumped and share prices plunged as those desperate for the U.S. currency liquidated investments.
Such a spike in the dollar - the currency of choice in global commerce and investment, used in up to 90% of all FX transactions - is bad news, as it rapidly tightens financial conditions, exacerbating the very problems that policymakers are striving to prevent.
Since March 23, the surge has faded, as the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates again, injected trillions of dollars into the financial system and opened swap lines with other central banks to ease dollar strains overseas. Currency swap rates have calmed down and equities are rallying again. 
But what if this is just a pause rather than a halt to the dollar's upward path?
Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Ilan Solot, who worked at the Fed in 2008 as a currency trader, is among those expecting another bout of dollar strength.
""Policymakers understand the funding shortage problem well from the previous crisis and they have rushed to solve that, but this crisis could very well see a real economy shock,"" he said.
Central bankers have repeated the stimulus playbook of 2008, but ""this is a liquidity shock to the real economy, and we don't know how that will play out,"" Solot added.
PLAYBOOK
Like many analysts, he suggests looking at the 2008 crisis.
Through all of 2007 and well into 2008, the dollar index fell steadily as hedge funds ramped up short positions despite growing unease over U.S. subprime mortgages and the collapse of Bear Sterns. But from March to November 2008, the dollar rocketed 24% thanks to overseas demand.
And much like recently, money market rates soared.
Then Fed rate cuts and Washington's $700 billion bank bailout bill kicked in; as the money market logjam eased, the dollar retreated and troughed on Dec. 18, 2008.
The respite was brief, however. The currency took off again, and rose another 15% before peaking in March 2009. That allowed equities and emerging markets to bottom out.
The uncertainty this time is that the twin demand and supply shocks caused by the virus could last indefinitely as millions more are sickened across the world. Companies and individuals trying to stay afloat are likely to hoard cash dollars.
A move higher now would also fit with the so-called Dollar Smile theory. Put forward by former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Stephen Jen, it holds that the greenback strengthens in tough times as investors rush for safe, liquid assets. 
It then falls as U.S. growth flags, forcing Fed rate cuts - the bottom of the smile - before rising again as the U.S. economy leads the global growth rebound.
Jen, who now runs hedge fund and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital, expects the U.S. economy to stage a full recovery by the end of the year, while Europe will reclaim end-2019 GDP levels only towards the end of next year.
""We were on the left side of the dollar smile, but for much of the second half of 2020 and in 2021, I expect us to move to the right of the dollar smile,"" he added. 
And even after large rate cuts, dollar assets offer higher yields - the interest rate gap between three-month U.S. and German bills offers a 1% return on an annualized basis. 
Meanwhile, despite its retreat, the dollar is near the highest since 2002 against trade partners' currencies, reviving speculation of Treasury intervention to rein it in. But the turbulent times make that unlikely.
""The historic rally is not quite over,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said, adding that in a further equity drawdown, there could be another 3%-5% upside to the trade-weighted dollar from recent highs.
DEMAND AND SUPPLY
The coronavirus disruption also comes amid an increasingly fragile demand/supply balance in dollar markets.
For years tighter regulations have constrained U.S. banks' ability to lend dollars. But the currency's role in international transactions hasn't lessened, and that has led to a dollar funding gap - the difference between non-U.S. banks' dollar assets and their liabilities.
This imbalance may amount to $1.5 trillion a year, according to International Monetary Fund estimates.
Parts of the swap market reflect the unease - three-month dollar-yen swaps  are at an elevated 44 bps versus an average 20 bps in 2019. 
The FRA-OIS gauge of bank funding costs is at levels not seen since the financial crisis . Market players say that rather than interbank problems, its surge suggests unprecedented demand from companies that are drawing down credit lines and seeking to borrow more from banks.
Ariel Bezalel and Harry Richards, fund managers at Jupiter Asset Management, reckon the global economy is about to enter a period of persistent dollar shortages.
""There are simply not enough dollars going to the outside world at this critical juncture,"" they wrote.
Sure, the Fed's asset-buying, multi-trillion dollar cash injections and swaplines with foreign central banks will help. But it may be running to standstill.
The dollar was involved in 90% of currency transactions globally in a $6.6 trillion daily market, BofA noted, adding: ""The reality is that the Fed is incapable of equilibrating supply/demand mismatches...if there is a rush to hold U.S. dollars.""
They predict the dollar index will rise eventually to 120 from the current 102, although they gave no time frame.

Investing.com - The dollar is back in demand Monday as hopes of an early end to the shutdown which has paralysed the U.S. economy were dashed over the weekend, prompting some traders to head back to the greenback safe haven.
At 3:55 AM ET (0815 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.965, up 0.4%. EUR/USD traded at 1.1078, down 0.6%, USD/JPY flat at 107.86.
On Sunday, President Donald Trump extended restrictive social distancing guidelines to the end of April, bowing to public-health experts who presented him with even more dire projections for the expanding coronavirus pandemic.
It was a stark shift in tone by the president, who only days ago discussed reopening the country in a few weeks. 
Additionally, GBP/USD traded at 1.2350, down 0.9%. Sterling has made something of a comeback in the last week or so, helped by the injection of vast amounts of dollars by the Federal Reserve into the system to stop a funding crunch.
However, more losses look likely for the pound going forward, especially after Fitch downgraded its credit rating on the U.K. by one notch to AA- from AA on Friday. The credit agency cited the significant increase in fiscal spending as a result of the coronavirus, as well as the uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU. 
This is the first downgrade of a sovereign on the back of the coronavirus and the increase in fiscal spending. 
Another currency on the move on the back of a ratings decision is the South African rand, with USD/ZAR rising over 2% to 18.01 after Moody’s downgraded the sovereign to junk status.
South African government bonds will now be excluded from the FTSE World Government Bond Index, which will mean further capital outflows as fund managers with investment grade mandates will be forced to sell these bonds.
Finally, the sharp drop in the price of oil - Brent is down 5% Monday - continues to weigh heavily on the currencies of countries that rely heavily on the commodity for revenue. 
At 3:15 AM ET, USD/NOK traded 1.6% higher at 10.55, while USD/RUB climbed 1.6% to 80.06."

Investing.com - The U.S dollar was up on Monday as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to decrease investors’ appetite for risk.
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.35% to 98.885 by 11: 18 PM ET (4:18 AM GMT).
Ever increasing numbers of global COVID-19 cases are driving investors to seek haven in the dollar.
“After all, the dollar is a safe-haven currency,” Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told CNBC. “It’s reflecting caution, and an uncertain market where you’re seeing a lot of illiquidity.”
The USD/CNY pair clawed back from its losses earlier in the session to gain 0.01% to 7.0949.
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.42% to 0.6139 even as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is due to announce further income support for workers later today as part of a third stimulus package as the coronavirus savages the economy. The NZD/USD pair gained 0.12% to 0.6028.
The USD/JPY pair lost earlier gains and was down 0.44% to 107.41 and the GBP/USD pair gained 0.75% to 1.2363.
“Risk aversion has been more important to the direction of the dollar than traditional interest rate differentials,”  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) analysts wrote in a note.
“For the dollar to surrender some of its recent gains, investors would need to shift their preferences back to a broader basket of safe-haven assets,” they added."
223,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- In a world convulsed by market volatility, there’s one surety (for now): Hong Kong’s currency will continue outperforming the greenback.
Elevated local rates relative to the U.S. have made the city’s currency the best carry trade in Asia, and propelled it to a 0.51% gain this month -- set for its best in more than 16 years. The strength will likely be sustained as local borrowing costs are expected to stay higher than U.S. rates in the near term, while Hong Kong’s interbank liquidity pool remains small.
Even as Hong Kong cut its base interest rate twice in March, liquidity remains so tight in the city that the local dollar is edging closer to the strong end of its trading band at 7.75. Demand for the currency has been increased by local banks hoarding cash before quarter-end regulatory checks, and more than 20 days of net local stock purchases by Chinese mainland investors. In addition, a global shortage of U.S. dollars could boost the Hong Kong dollar as a proxy.
“The Hong Kong dollar may hit 7.75 in the short term,” said Carie Li, an economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. “Hong Kong rates won’t follow the U.S. borrowing costs to decline quickly even after the quarter-end because the local liquidity pool is small, and that will help maintain a wide yield differential.”
The rally follows an expansion of the gap between the Hong Kong dollar’s borrowing costs and the corresponding U.S. rates to the widest since 1999, a move that makes being long the city’s currency a lucrative strategy. The aggregate balance in the city -- an indicator of interbank cash supply -- has shrunk 70% over the past two years to HK$54 billion.
The Hong Kong dollar’s performance is a standout at a time when most currencies in the world witness a sell-off as the outbreak of the coronavirus damages confidence on global economic growth. It’s the second best-performing exchange rate in emerging markets after the Bulgarian lev over the past month.
Its strength is a far cry from most of the past two years, when it repeatedly touched the weak end of its trading band as investors sold the currency due to its ultra-low interest rates. In response, the local de-facto central bank had to sell U.S. dollars to prevent the currency from falling beyond 7.85 -- the weak end of its trading band.

224,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 11:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound’s wild fluctuations are causing more distress for businesses already struggling under an unprecedented lockdown of the U.K. economy.
Sterling slid this month to lows not seen in decades against the dollar, before rebounding in its best week since 2009. That unpredictability wipes out expectations for a more stable year after Brexit, making hedging a costly challenge for firms.
“Businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones, need currency stability to manage cash flow and finances,” said George Vessey, Western Union’s U.K. currency strategist. “With Covid-19 rupturing financial markets and substantially weakening the pound, it makes planning forward hard for companies who need clear longer-term trends but constantly face these aggressive gyrations in currency rates.”
At the start of the year, following Boris Johnson’s resounding election win, most banks were bullish on sterling, with a median forecast compiled by Bloomberg projecting $1.35 by the end of 2020. Yet as the scale of the coronavirus’ economic impact became clear, the pound fell below $1.15 to the lowest since 1985.
John Smith, the director at laser equipment provider Scitec Instruments Ltd., encourages his customers to pay him in euros or dollars. He can then use those to pay his suppliers, avoiding a conversion to sterling. Nonetheless, the company can’t avoid foreign-exchange transactions entirely, making market timing key.
“When the pound strengthened slightly on Thursday I took the chance to transfer some dollars into pounds,” said Smith, who checks exchange rates several times a day. “The problem is the number of bank accounts I have now and the increase in book-keeping work.”
Pricey Options
Businesses that want to avoid whipsawing currency quotes by hedging their exposure are now faced with exorbitant costs. Gauges of volatility against both the euro and dollar for the next 12 months have touched the highest since the financial crisis, making options betting on the currency’s direction much more pricey.
“The large Conservative majority, lower volatility and reduction in hard Brexit headlines reduced the urgency to hedge” at the start of the year, said Phil McHugh, a trader at Currencies Direct Ltd, which provides foreign-exchange payment services to corporate clients. The rocketing volatility is “making any new hedges more tricky to plan for and enter into with prices moving quickly.”
The timing could not be worse. First, British companies with supply chains and customers in severely impacted regions, such as China and Italy, faced colossal problems. Now all U.K. citizens are banned from unnecessary travel, reducing consumer spending and putting more pressure on an already beleaguered domestic economy.
Although the government has committed to supporting businesses with emergency loans, getting access to them has proved difficult so far, with many concerned it won’t be enough to stave off a wave of bankruptcies.
A weaker pound can be good news for exporters, making their products comparatively cheaper abroad. But for importers, a poor exchange-rate can cripple business models, especially when British customers are being told to stay at home.
“The fall in the pound coupled with consumer demand putting the brakes on has been a double whammy for businesses to deal with, especially importers,” said McHugh. “This crisis has exploded in severity very quickly. The fact that consumer demand is grinding to a halt is making it very difficult for businesses to look ahead and accurately pin down what their future requirements will actually be.”
Profits Exposed
It’s not just smaller companies, with less sophisticated financial operations, at risk of severe currency fluctuations. Some listed companies choose not to hedge, leading to massive swings in their performance depending on exchange rates at the time of conversion.
FTSE 250 recruitment firm Hays Plc is particularly exposed to moves in sterling’s cross with the euro. For each 0.01 pound movement in exchange rates against the shared currency, Hays’ operating profit is impacted by 1.2 million pounds ($1.4 million), according to finance director Paul Venables in a earnings call last month.
Some companies may end up gaining from sterling’s slide. The aerospace sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus, a situation exacerbated by many airlines locking in high oil prices before crude went into freefall. Yet for those who hedge from dollars into sterling, such as Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR), getting more pound for each buck could provide a much-needed boost.
“Just as the slower growth in the fleet might bite, in comes more favorable foreign-exchange,” said Sandy Morris, an aviation analyst at Jefferies in London.
Either way, it’s a minefield for those charged with managing finances for the year ahead. With the risk of the pound falling further toward parity against the dollar, the question for those reliant on a strong pound is whether to hedge their bets now or bank on a return to earlier levels once the virus threat dissipates.
“Sterling’s aggressive decline shows how unattractive the currency is compared to other safe haven and more liquid currencies,” said Western Union’s Vessey, who thinks the pound’s recent rebound may only be temporary. “Just imagine what it feels like for SME business owners, or a finance director at a corporate firm, having to make judgments around currency payments in this environment?”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar slowed its descent after a week of declines and the safe-haven yen edged ahead on Monday, as coronavirus lockdowns tightened across the world and investors braced for a prolonged period of uncertainty.
In bumpy trade the dollar ran ahead early before settling back against the pound, euro, kiwi and the Australian dollar. Sterling  was last 0.1% softer at $1.2449, the Aussie  flat at $0.6158 and the euro (EUR=) stable at $1.1132. 
""After all, the dollar is a safe-haven currency,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney. ""It's reflecting caution, and an uncertain market where you're seeing a lot of illiquidity.""

The weekend brought more bad news on the virus front. The U.S. has emerged as the latest epicenter of the outbreak, with more than 137,000 cases and 2,400 deaths.
President Donald Trump, who had talked about reopening the economy for Easter, on Sunday extended guidelines for social restrictions to April 30 and said the peak of the death rate could be two weeks away.
Australia also ratcheted up control measures, while an extension to lockdowns in Italy looms.
The halt in the dollar's slide came with a broader risk-averse mood, which lifted the Japanese yen  0.4% to 107.47 per dollar.
The moves come after the dollar has surged amid a scramble for cash and then subsided as central bank launched unprecedented liquidity measures.
Over the past two weeks the dollar has posted its biggest weekly rise since the 2008 financial crisis and then its biggest weekly drop since 2009. Yet as signs of funding stress have eased, but not abated, the dollar remains at elevated levels. 
""Risk aversion has been more important to the direction of the dollar than traditional interest rate differentials,""  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) analysts said in note.
""For the dollar to surrender some of its recent gains, investors would need to shift their preferences back to a broader basket of safe-haven assets.""
Monday's moves showed some hints of that, since dollar gains were modest and in tandem with rises in gold, bonds and the yen.
Yields at the very short end of the U.S. curve dipped into negative territory and futures for 10-year notes (TYc1) implied a 0.54% yield, some 20 basis points below Friday's close of the underlying Treasuries (US10YT=RR). Gold rose 0.5%. 

Against a basket of currencies (=USD), the dollar was steady at 98.312. It edged ahead against the Chinese yuan in offshore trade to 7.0800 per dollar .

Investing.com – The pound continued to rack up gains on Friday and remained on track to snap a two-week losing streak against the U.S. dollar, even as data showed the biggest rise in coronavirus deaths in the UK so far, threatening to keep economically-burdensome lockdown measures in place for a prolonged period.
GBP/USD surged 1.82% to $1.2424.
The death toll rose by 181 to 759, the biggest increase so far, with infections topping 14,000 nationwide. Several lawmakers in the U.K., including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have tested positive for Covid-19.
The rally in the pound was also helped by weakness in the dollar despite Congress passing its $2 trillion stimulus package on Friday, with President Donald Trump expected to sign it into law later today. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.75% to 98.60.
The weakness in the greenback has been driven by the Federal Reserve's pledge to ramp up its bond-buying program and roll out further supportive measures to ease access to dollars and alleviate funding concerns.
But as the world's reserve currency, the dollar is expected to bottom out sooner rather than later, as the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to hurl the global economy into a deep recession."
227,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Two weeks after investors dumped everything they could to hoard U.S. dollars, some are now happy to sell.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is headed for its biggest weekly loss since 2009, with the greenback sliding against 16 major peers. Traders point to a confluence of reasons, ranging from less stress in funding markets, the repatriation of funds as the quarter ends and the worsening coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.
“The easing of dollar-funding demand thanks to provisions by global central banks is adding to the dollar weakness,” said Jun Kato, chief market analyst at Shinkin Asset Management Co. “It’s dollar-based selling as investors are increasingly worried about the jump in virus infections in the U.S., raising concerns about the impact to employment, personal consumption.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Index has dropped 3.5% this week, paring back gains of more than 8% in the previous two weeks. It has slid at least 5% against currencies including the Australian dollar, the British pound and the Mexican Peso in the past 5 days.
The decline comes after the Federal Reserve expanded currency swap lines to nine more central banks, ramped up cash offered to the repurchase markets and introduced a series of 2008 crisis-era tools to unfreeze credit markets. Stress in cross-currency basis markets, a key funding channel, has eased.
Funding Markets See Glimmer of Light With Dollar Stress Easing
The three-month dollar-yen basis is now back to levels seen in early March, while the euro equivalent has swung into positive territory, meaning floating rates euros are at a premium to the dollar. In foreign-exchange swap markets, the costs to borrow dollars is back to 1.80% after it printed at more than 2.5% last week.
“It’s 100% a dollar-funding story -- the mean reversion of the dollar liquidity crunch is prompting all other FX to rally against the dollar,” said Margaret Yang, a strategist at CMC Markets Singapore Pte. “Everything is getting sold against the dollar today.”
Asia Gains
The yen surged as much as 1.2% on Friday, fueled in part by repatriation flows ahead of the nation’s fiscal year end on March 31, according to Takuya Kanda, general manager at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
Other currencies in Asia bounced off multi-year lows reached during the worst of the sell-off. The Australian dollar had dropped to the weakest since 2002 last week, while the Indonesian rupiah had approached the record low reached in the Asian financial crisis in 1998. Both rebounded, along with the Korean won.
Traders also pointed to the rising virus count in the U.S. and a jump in jobless claims to 3.28 million last week that’s sapping the greenback.
To be sure, the dollar weakness may be temporary.
As the new quarter rolls in on Wednesday, repatriation funds will slow and the safe haven bid from a worsening global pandemic may fuel a resurgence in greenback demand.
“This week was about the Fed and the U.S. economic stimulus helping markets to calm down a bit, but next week we’ll see a flow of indicators,” said Kim Yumi, a market strategist at Kiwoom Securities Co. “If the data turn out to be bad, it could drive demand for dollars again.”

Investing.com - The dollar fell further in early trading in Europe Friday, as the likely passage of a $2.2 trillion U.S. package helped soothe worries of a global recession following the coronavirus outbreak and also looked set to increase the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet substantially.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.565, rebounding a touch after sharp losses overnight. 
It is trading below the 100 level for the first time since March 18.The index is down some 4% from a week ago. If sustained by the end of U.S. trade, that would mark the biggest weekly decline since 2009.
EUR/USD traded at 1.1020, down 0.1%, while USD/JPY fell 0.6% to 108.89. The pound also hit its highest level against the dollar in 10 days, rising as far as $1.2256 overnight. It subsequently eased back to $1.2203.
The $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package is expected to be voted by the House of Representatives later Friday, and Federal Reserve Jerome Powell - while conceding the U.S. ""may well already be in a recession""  - insisted the central bank still had plenty of ammo after it ramped up its bond-buying program earlier this week.
This has raised expectations that the central bank is looking to add to its recent stimulus packages - especially after an unprecedented rise in U.S. jobless claims underscored the virus' impact on the economy.
“It is interesting that the U.S. spending package includes more money to the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which U.S. Treasury uses to inject money into the Fed’s various credit programs,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “This means the Fed’s various credit programs can be expanded significantly if needed.” 
New data for the Fed’s balance sheet shows an increase of $586 billion to $5,254 billion, a new record high, due to the Fed’s new credit and liquidity programs and increased bond purchases, Danske added. “The balance sheet is expected to rise much further in the near future for the same reasons.”
The EUR/USD pair has broken above 1.10 and in the short run it may trade in the 1.10-1.12 range, Danske said. 
“We continue to see coronavirus numbers peaking over the next few weeks, financial stress is coming down with the economic help from global fiscal policy.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar slid below the $100 mark on Friday morning in Asia after the United States was set to move forward on a $2.2 trillion relief package to deal with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, slid 0.11% to 99.435 by 09:46 PM ET (01:46 AM GMT).
Overnight, the U.S. recorded an unprecedented 3.28 million jobless claims for the past week, the highest increase ever. But hopes that the U.S. House of Representatives will also pass a $2.2 trillion stimulus package buoyed investor hopes and stock markets.
The GBP/USD pair gave up an earlier 2.8% gain as Asian markets opened, and was down 0.11% to 1.2188.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.02% to 0.6065 and the NZD/USD pair gained 0.25% to 0.5974. After driving the dollar up last week by hedging against the two currencies, investors are slowly regaining their risk appetites.
The USD/JPY pair was down 0.86% to 108.64 and the USD/CNY pair lost 0.04% to 7.0735.
Analysts at National Bank of Australia warned in a report that asset managers may need to adjust their currency hedge positions after wild swings in global share prices.
“We can well believe that we are for an extremely rocky ride in the currency markets between now and month end,” they added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar is on track for its biggest weekly fall in more than a decade on Friday as a series of stimulus steps around the world, including a $2.2 trillion U.S. package, calmed a panic over a global recession following the coronavirus outbreak.
Data showing an unprecedented rise in U.S. jobless claims underscored the virus' devastating impact on the economy, but subsequent rise in Wall Street shares raised hopes a torrent of selling in risk assets may have run its course for now.
The dollar dropped to 109.42 yen , shedding 1.44% overnight while the euro also jumped 1.40% on Thursday and last stood at $1.1025 (EUR=).
The biggest mover among major currencies was sterling, which rose 2.8% overnight before giving up part of that gain in early Asian trade. The British pound last stood at $1.2183 .
An easing in dollar funding conditions is helping to reduce demand for the dollar. 
The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3.28 million last week as strict measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic unleashed a wave of layoffs.
While that eclipsed the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982 and was up 3 million from last week, it was below investors' worst fears.
The focus stayed on an unprecedented $2.2 trillion stimulus expected to be approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday.
The dollar's index against six other major currencies (=USD) lost 1.5%, its biggest daily fall in almost four years.
So far this week it is down 2.9%. If sustained by the end of U.S. trade, that would mark the biggest weekly decline since 2009, underscoring the currency market's extreme volatility after last week racking up its biggest weekly gain since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
Highly choppy trade could continue towards the end of month, when there tend to be large flows from corporate and investors to hedge their currency exposures.
In particular, many asset managers may need to adjust their currency hedge positions after wild swings in global share prices. 
The dollar's rises until last week, in particular against the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar were primarily driven by such currency hedge adjustment, said analysts at National Bank of Australia in report.
""We can well believe that we are for an extremely rocky ride in the currency markets between now and month end,"" they said. ""Some will not yet have adjusted, and some will now find themselves under-hedged given the big equity reversal so far this week. And, some may be looking to implement changes to strategic hedge ratios at the same time. Buckle up."" 
The Australian dollar traded at $0.6068 , having gained more than 10% from its 17-year low of $0.5510 touched on Thursday last week.

The New Zealand dollar  stood at $0.5974.

Investing.com - The euro has posted gains Thursday amid talk of a new debt instrument to combat the coronavirus outbreak as the death toll rises and the economic damage becomes more stark.
At 4:10 ET (0810 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0938, up 0.5%.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.580, down 0.4%.  USD/JPY fell 0.7% to 110.44, while GBP/USD traded at 1.1950, up 0.5%.
Europe has become the fiercest battleground in the war against the Covid-19 outbreak, with well over 180,000 cases confirmed. The death toll keeps rising across the region, with Italy now registering a higher number than China, and Spain not far behind. However, the rate of new infections appears to be slowing rapidly in most countries across the continent, with the exception of the U.K., analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients.
The measures designed to combat the deadly virus has brought all the key EU economies to a standstill. The latest data show the extent of the damage, with German consumer morale hitting its lowest level since 2009 while French business confidence plunged at a record pace in March, to its lowest since 2014.
While the ECB has launched a gigantic new package of quantitative easing, it’s clear the extent to which individual countries can combat the pandemic depends on the strength of their balance sheets.
With this in mind, nine European countries late Wednesday called upon their EU counterparts to issue so-called corona bonds — a new debt instrument that would combine securities from different countries and put the firepower of German taxpayers behind the joint borrowing.
“We need to recognize the severity of the situation and the necessity for further action to buttress our economies today,” the heads of state of Italy, France, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Luxembourg said Wednesday.
“The case for such a common instrument is strong, since we are all facing a symmetric external shock, for which no country bears responsibility, but whose negative consequences are endured by all,” the nine leaders said.
These bonds would be controversial, with policymakers in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria very wary of the idea of issuing debt together with highly leveraged nations, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal.
The move came a day after Germany, Austria and the Netherlands shut down discussion of such a step at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers.
Attention now swings to a key conference call between the 27 leaders of the European Union later Thursday.
The Bank of England will also hold its regular Monetary Policy Committee meeting, but is expected to hold fire as it assesses the success of the measures it's taken so far.

The PBOC put the fixing at 7.0692 yuan per dollar, 105 basis points stronger than the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The spread is the most since Feb. 3, the first day of trading in China following a Lunar New Year break extended in response to the coronavirus. The fixing restricts the onshore yuan’s daily moves to 2% on either side of it.
Pressure on the yuan eased briefly following the central bank move. It was little changed as of 10:53 a.m. in Shanghai at 7.1082 per greenback after earlier strengthening as much as 0.28%. The yuan weakened 0.67% Wednesday, worst among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, while most others rallied following unprecedented stimulus measures in the U.S. A report said the People’s Bank of China could cut its benchmark deposit rate in the coming days.
“The stronger fixing today could be a signal that the authorities do not want the yuan to weaken too far from here,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “However, attempts to temper yuan weakness is probably more to dampen the volatility rather than to defend any particular level.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the yen and the euro on Thursday before data expected to show a surge in U.S. claims for unemployment benefits as companies lay off workers due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus.
The pound extended declines against the euro and the dollar due to worries that Britain is not prepared to deal with an increase in coronavirus cases after the flu-like illness ravaged health care systems in Italy and Spain.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars, both of which are closely liked to the global commodity trade, fell against their U.S. counterpart as traders avoided taking on excessive risk.
Investors are anxiously awaiting the passage of a $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but there are already indications that some U.S. states will need more money for medical supplies as the health care system struggles to cope.
""It could be difficult for the markets to digest weekly jobless claims,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JP Morgan Securities in Tokyo.
""Bad numbers are expected and priced in to a certain extent, but there are people who think things will get even worse. In the end this may support the dollar as investors choose to bring their money home.""
The dollar fell 0.47% to 110.69 yen  in Asia on Thursday.
Against the Swiss franc , the dollar eased slightly to 0.9752.
Sterling  fell 0.3% to $1.1837 and fell 0.6% to 92.11 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The pound's losses accelerated early in Asian trade after the British government said the total number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 9,529 on Wednesday from 8,077 the previous day.
U.S. weekly jobless claims due later on Thursday are expected to rise to around a million, which would be well above the previous peak seen during the global financial crisis.
Some analysts say jobless claims could even exceed one million as companies are expected to rapidly shed workers.
Draconian restrictions on personal movement aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus are widely expected to cause a global recession.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on U.S. television at 1100 GMT, which may provide more information about policymakers' response to the pandemic.
Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate are expected to vote on Wednesday on a $2 trillion emergency package that U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to swiftly sign the bill into law.
The euro (EUR=EBS) rose 0.2% to $1.0901 in Asia on Thursday. The common currency held on to gains against the Swiss franc (EURCHF=EBBS), trading at 1.0638.
The German lower house on Wednesday suspended the country's debt brake and approved a debt-financed supplementary budget of 156 billion euros to pay for healthcare and keep companies afloat.
Singapore's economy suffered its biggest contraction in a decade in the first quarter, data showed on Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic prompted the city-state to cut its full-year GDP forecast and plan for a deep recession.
The Singapore dollar , which already hit the lowest in more than 10 years on Monday, barely budged after the GDP data. However, the figures are likely to reinforce fears that global activity will sharply contract in the first half of the year. Singapore is one of the world's most open economies.
The Australian dollar  fell 1.3% to $0.5879, while the New Zealand dollar  declined by 1% to $0.5793.

Investing.com – The pound cut losses to resume its rally against the dollar on Wednesday as investors continued to digest the impact of U.K. government's measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
GBP/USD rose 0.96% to $1.1869, after swinging between gains and losses between $1.1640 and $1.1974.
The wild swings in the pound have been driven by expectations over the potential severity of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed about 437 in the country so far, and more than 20,000 globally.
The Covid-19 pandemic overshadowed a raft of positive data, including better-than-expected consumer inflation data.
The rally in cable was also helped by a plunge in the dollar, which has remained offered following the Federal Reserve move to expand its quantitative easing program to avert a financial crisis in markets."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Fallout from the coronavirus outbreak may finally lift the curse of the safe-haven yen for Japan but policymakers fear fiscal laxity could lead to a currency free-fall eventually, undermining efforts to cushion the economy from the pandemic.
The yen, which investors typically snap up as a safe haven in times of financial market stress, fell nearly 10% against the dollar this month, as pandemic fears spurred a stampede into the refuge of the world's most powerful currency.
For Japanese policymakers who have repeatedly fought in recent decades to tamp down the currency as its strength hurts the country's export-reliant economy, that move could be problematic against the backdrop of huge fiscal stimulus.
The Japanese government, like many others around the world, is preparing to open the spending spigots to cushion the blow from the coronavirus, inflating an already bloated public debt with spending of at least $137 billion.
Finance ministry officials say the government will be forced to issue more bonds to foot the bill. Already, Japan plans to sell 153.5 trillion yen ($1.38 trillion) of bonds in the year beginning April to help pay for rising social welfare costs.
Some officials warn the further unraveling of fiscal discipline in Japan, which has the heaviest debt burden in the industrial world, could sow the seed of a run on Japanese assets and erode the yen's value in the long-run.
""A strong yen is a problem, but now we're more worried about a weakening of the yen. If we do something wrong (in managing our finances), that could cause a yen free fall,"" said a senior finance ministry official.
""If we end up issuing huge amounts of debt, market sentiment could change abruptly. That would be problematic,"" he said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Finance ministry officials in charge of currencies declined to comment, saying they were not allowed to talk about markets. 
FISCAL HEALTH
To be sure, Japan - the world's biggest creditor - is unlikely to face the kind of sharp capital outflow suffered by some emerging economies.
But a cut to Japan's sovereign debt rating would lead to downgrades in banking sector ratings that could unleash a dangerous pull out of overseas investment, some analysts say.
Makoto Noji, chief FX and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said for now, Japan won't draw much attention as other countries are also deploying huge stimulus.
""But once the dust settles and the coronavirus is resolved, market players will shift their attention to Japan's huge public debt,"" he said. ""The size of stimulus will be enormous ... and could fuel worries about Japan's fiscal health down the road.""
Already, panicky investors are hoarding dollars, not the usually prized yen, drawing a rare voice of concern from Finance Minister Taro Aso. 
""Everyone is buying dollars. That's leading to declines in other currencies. Stocks and bond prices are both falling, which is something that has not happened before,"" Aso told parliament on Tuesday.
For now, many market participants don't see an imminent risk of a yen free-fall and say the Japanese currency, now hovering around 110 to the dollar, is comfortably above the 120 level seen as policymakers' line-in-the-sand.
Still, Japan's huge debt pile and an economy which was already struggling before the virus outbreak make it vulnerable to any abrupt sell-off in government bonds that will lift borrowing costs.
Some Japanese policymakers look warily at the example of China, which is struggling to contain capital outflows despite its enormous foreign reserves.
China burned through $1 trillion of reserves to stem a capital flight in 2015. Its foreign reserves - the world's largest - shrank $8.8 billion in February to $3.1 trillion as the yuan slid on fears over the epidemic.
Japan last intervened to put a floor on the yen in 1997-1998, spending 4.1 trillion yen ($36.8 billion) to stem a yen fall triggered by a domestic banking crisis. Its foreign reserves, the world's second largest, stood at $1.3 trillion in February.
""It doesn't make sense that markets barely move on talk of huge stimulus in a country like Japan, which is saddled with a huge public debt,"" said another finance ministry official.
""It's hard to tell when this quietness will end.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has traded lower Wednesday, as currency investors take comfort in the agreement reached over a hefty stimulus package by the U.S., and look to get into currencies perceived as more risky.
Senior Democrats and Republicans in the divided U.S. Congress said late Tuesday they had struck a preliminary deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. A vote on the relevant bill has been pencilled in for later Wednesday.
At 4:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 101.600, down 0.6% on the day and down over 2% from Monday's high. It's still up more than 2.5% for the month, however.
USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 111.52, but GBP/USD looked perky at 1.1893, up 1.2%, and AUD/USD rose 1.7% to 0.6067, gaining along with most so-called commodity currencies, amid increasing signs of an industrial revival in China that should underpin demand for Australian raw materials.
The dollar was also weaker against emerging currencies such as the rand and ruble, while central European currencies also clawed back recent losses against the euro.
The euro has also pushed higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD trading at 1.0831, up 0.4%, but its gains have been less pronounced, after the Eurogroup made only timid progress in rolling out the region's fiscal backstop, the European Stability Mechanism, at a meeting on Tuesday.
The group, which is made up of the finance ministers from the eurozone countries, dismissed the idea of joint debt instruments at the meeting. These would allow the measures needed to combat the coronavirus in the hard hit, but highly indebted, countries, like Italy and Spain, to be part financed by their richer neighbours.
While the ECB has come to the rescue by launching a gigantic new package of quantitative easing, it’s clear the extent to which individual countries can combat the pandemic depends on the strength of their balance sheets.
Germany offered up over 1 trillion euros to support its own economy earlier this week, but cash-strapped Italy has only managed a 25 billion-euro package.
This decision has seen increased pressure on the debt spreads of some of the eurozone countries against the benchmark German paper, and has weighed to a degree on the euro.
Europe has become the fiercest battleground in the war against the Covid-19 outbreak, and the news overnight from Italy was not encouraging. 
Italy’s daily number of fatal cases increased to 743 from 602 the day before, halting the recent trend of decreasing numbers of daily deaths. 
While the amount of daily new cases increased a smaller number than the day before, 3,612 versus 3,780, the total amount of critical cases has increased further (+3,393 vs +3,024), noted analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “which doesn’t bode too well for the amount of fatal cases over the coming days.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar halted its decline and gains in riskier currencies petered out on Wednesday as fresh rises in coronavirus cases kept markets on edge and the greenback funding market tight.
Foreign exchange markets were in consolidation as the prospect of a huge U.S. stimulus package bolstered Asian stock markets although gains in riskier currencies were tempered.
The safe-haven dollar, which had pulled back from recent peaks, was now steady against the euro (EUR=) at $1.0789, and fell only marginally against the yen  to 111.11 yen per dollar.
Currencies that fell the hardest last week hung on to overnight gains. The pound  was steady at $1.1759, the Australian dollar  was 0.2% weaker at $0.5941 after running as far as $0.5990 in early trade.
The U.S Federal Reserve's offer of unlimited bond-buying, on top of opening discount dollar funding lines to central banks around the globe, has supported risk sentiment for the past day along with hopes for a huge U.S. fiscal stimulus package.

But nerves and still-elevated demand for greenbacks in cash capped further gains in currencies like the Aussie, euro and pound.
""It's a nice rebound and we can probably run with it through the Asian session, but whether this mood can hold 24 hours from now, I'm not convinced,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow.
""The overall (virus) picture is still very grim and almost certainly going to get worse.""
Spain reported its sharpest increase in cases overnight. India announced a 21-day lockdown of its 1.3 billion population.
The World Health Organization said that New York could become the next epicenter of the pandemic.
Within funding markets, signs of stress remain as businesses and investors drive enormous demand for dollars to cover liabilities and as a shelter from a maelstrom that has hit nearly every asset class.
Cross-currency basis swap spreads, which reflect the cost of borrowing dollars abroad have relaxed for the euro  but remain elevated for the yen  and Australian dollar , for example.
""There's a lot of reasons to believe that we're not out of the woods yet,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""People still feel that the downside risk is far more prevalent...this is a traders' market, we're going to get levels where people look to fade this again.""
The New Zealand dollar  fell 0.5% to $0.5800, while the Korean won  handed back a small fraction of Tuesday's 3% gain.

238,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders around the world dumped the dollar in favor of risk assets as moves by U.S. leaders to support the world’s largest economy spurred relief across markets hampered by liquidity strains.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index declined 0.6%, ending a 10-day rally that took it to the strongest level on record after the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented stimulus. The index earlier fell as much as 1.5%, the most since 2016 on a closing basis. Treasuries fell and stocks around the world surged on signs U.S. leaders are close to reaching a consensus on a spending bill to boost the economy.
Norway’s krone led gains against the greenback, jumping the most on record before paring. Australia’s dollar extended a rebound from a multi-year trough and the pound rose as much as 2.2%, even after the U.K. entered a full lockdown to contain the coronavirus. An index of emerging-market currencies was on course for its biggest advance in more than three years, a positive development for borrowers with debt in the U.S. currency.
“Markets are going to start feeling the full tsunami of liquidity the Fed is providing now,” said Nathan Sheets, head of macroeconomic research at PGIM Fixed Income and former FOMC economist. “The liquidity they’ve provided from their first line of defense -- swap lines -- to other domestic measures are all about the Fed making it clear to markets that they will play the role as an international lender of last resort.”
The relief sweeping over markets is in stark contrast to last week when investors sold almost everything but the dollar amid the growing fallout from the virus. A slew of emergency measures from major central banks including Japan and Australia failed to calm markets, with the worries centered on a liquidity crunch.
Those pressures now seem to be moderating. In the latest move on Monday, the Fed said it would buy an unlimited amount of government bonds to keep borrowing costs low and expand its Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. It had earlier extended its dollar-liquidity swaps to other policy makers including those in Australia and Brazil.
Meanwhile, the spread between more liquid current bonds, known as “on-the-runs” and older so-called off-the-run securities has tightened.
Still, strains in funding markets remain, and options traders aren’t convinced that the dollar’s retreat will mark a complete turnaround in sentiment. The premium to go long the dollar over the next month versus its major peers still trades near its highest in eight years.
For Win Thin of Brown Brothers Harriman, the dollar is likely to recover as “virtually every major central bank is engaging in near unlimited quantitative easing with zero rates.”
The economic repercussions from the coronavirus crisis are piling up around the globe. Data Tuesday showed a U.S. gauge of activity at service providers and manufacturing contracted the most on record. A similar measure in the U.K. dropped to the lowest since the series began in 1998.
Weak economic data out of Europe and the U.S. are both likely to reignite haven appetite for the greenback, said Viraj Patel, foreign exchange and global macro strategist at Arkera Inc in London, who sees Tuesday’s drop as a technical correction rather than a fully-fledged sell-off.
“We are still in the eye of the storm,” he said. “You’re potentially seeing more countries in Europe going into lockdown and more states in the U.S. potentially going into lockdown, you’re going to see more demand for the dollar.”
Caution Abounds
As a result, the gains in risk and commodity currencies were small compared with their recent declines, with most still flirting with multi-year lows. The Australian dollar is still near the weakest since 2002.
While the pound gained after last week’s historically poor performance, few expect major gains are in store. Fears are still lingering about a hard Brexit at the end of the year, coupled with concerns about the U.K.’s support for self-employed workers thrown out of work by the lockdown.
Caution is particularly evident among developing Asian exchange rates. While Group-of-10 currencies rebounded strongly against the dollar, moves in emerging Asia were more restrained, led by South Korea’s won, which climbed about 1.4%.
The Fed’s policy “boost to EM assets should be more secondary,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “The yield-hunting investment should only take place when major markets started to stabilize.”

Investing.com – GBP/USD surged on Tuesday as traders shrugged off the U.K government's tougher lockdown measures, which will see swathes of the economy shut down for at least three weeks at a time when the services sector has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
GBP/USD jumped 1.83% to $1.1759.
The surge in the pound comes amid mixed U.K economy data as services activity fell short, but manufacturing topped economists forecasts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A blistering dollar rally has revived speculation that the U.S. may rein in its currency if the buck goes much higher. 
The dollar has jumped about 7% in the last 15 days, as fears over the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic have sent investors into the greenback, often seen as a haven of last resort. 
It has remained near multi-year highs despite the U.S. Federal Reserve’s efforts to ease a global shortage of dollars, including enhancing swap lines to foreign central banks to ensure a sufficient supply of the currency to financial markets. 
Though President Donald Trump has complained for years that the dollar’s strength hurts U.S. exporters by making their products less competitive abroad, he has so far held back from ordering the Treasury to intervene in foreign exchange markets and weaken the currency.
Taking that step now, while markets are in the grips of pandemic-induced volatility, would be an even trickier proposition than usual. 
Some argue, however, that the U.S. currency’s rally may have further to run. More upside could spur the U.S. to take action as it seeks to prevent a robust dollar from complicating what is expected to be a deep and difficult recession, analysts said.
WHEN WILL THE U.S. INTERVENE?
The dollar's current level of around 102 against a basket of major currencies (DXY) is unlikely to prompt an intervention, but action could become more likely if the dollar continued rising as it has done during past crises, analysts said. 
""Further dollar appreciation would be harmful to both U.S. and global growth,"" said Zach Pandl, currency analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a note on Monday. ""If the dollar were to continue rising, we would see a reasonably strong case for coordinated and targeted intervention.""
The dollar index is on pace for a surge of nearly 6% for the quarter ending March 31. In the third quarter of 2008, during the previous financial crisis, the index jumped nearly 10%.
A U.S. dollar index above 104 - a level untouched in nearly two decades - would “certainly catch the administration’s attention,” said Ben Randol, senior G10 FX Strategist at BofA Global Research. 
On Tuesday, the index was down 0.65% to 101.82.
Based on an analysis of technical chart factors, the bank's analysts said the dollar index could eventually rally to 120. The analysts did not say by when the dollar would reach that level. Such a rise, if it happened this year, would mark a jump of about 24% for 2020.
HOW CURRENCY INTERVENTION WORKS
The U.S has moved to directly influence the dollar's strength only a handful of times in the last few decades, most recently when it joined other countries in a concerted intervention to weaken the yen in 2011.
Its main tool is the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is operated by the Treasury and stood at around $94 billion last month. The Treasury could use the fund's assets to buy foreign currencies in the open market, boosting their value against the dollar. 
The Fed has traditionally matched Treasury intervention funds, thus doubling the Treasury's firepower. In principle, the Fed could also expand its balance sheet beyond that to buy foreign assets, and other countries could agree to join the United States in the intervention.
WILL INTERVENTION BE EFFECTIVE? 
Even an intervention as big as the one the U.S. can deploy pales in size next to the $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, where a currency's trajectory is influenced by multiple forces including trade flows, reserve buying and global interest rates. 
Teamwork may be essential for any moves to have a longer-lasting impact. Past interventions have been most effective when coordinated with other countries, analysts said. 

Still, weakening the greenback is unlikely to solve the problem that has vexed markets over the last several weeks, ""which is dollar liquidity and the difficulties of the Fed in getting those dollars into the stressed hands that need it,"" said Alan Ruskin, head of G10 FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has retreated Tuesday, weighed down by the latest hefty rescue package from the U.S. Federal Reserve, at least for now.
At 03:55 ET (0755 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0833, up 1%. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 102.090, down 1.1%, while USD/JPY fell 0.6% to 110.50.
The Federal Reserve on Monday announced unprecedented measures to buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, also pledging programs to finance households, small businesses and employers.
“The Fed just fired its biggest bazooka so far, effectively announcing open-ended and unlimited QE,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “The Fed is now the direct lender of last resort to not only the financial system, but also the real economy.”
Still, losses have been limited given the extent of the actions taken by the U.S. central bank. There still exists a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and with that comes the usual flight to safety and into the U.S. dollar.
“The Fed is doing its best to kill the USD, but we are not convinced that it will work (yet),” added Nordea. “Once economies open up post the Corona-crisis, the USD will get hammered, but that is still not something to discuss for the next weeks.”
One of the currencies which has benefited the most Tuesday has been sterling. This follows the news that  U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed stricter lockdown measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The GBP/USD pair was up 1% to 1.1663 by 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT) after falling to as low as 1.1448 on Monday.  
The pound has been hit recently, and the U.K. government criticized, by the notion that authorities have been slow to implement the tough conditions needed to combat the spread of the virus.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank hiked its foreign currency interventions to their highest level since the Brexit referendum in 2016, data on Monday indicated, showing the central bank's determination to counter the Swiss franc's coronavirus-driven rise.
Swiss sight deposits rose by nearly 6 billion Swiss francs last week, supporting the SNB's statement it is escalating its currency market interventions to slow the rise of the safe-haven currency.
Total sight deposits, which include other deposits on sight in Swiss francs, rose to 608.826 billion Swiss francs ($617.41 billion) from 602.992 billion francs in the previous week.
The 5.8 billion franc increase was the biggest this year and followed an increase of 4.4 billion francs a week before and 2.78 billion francs at the start of March.
The SNB said last week it was escalating its foreign currency purchases to stem the rise in the franc, which has appreciated as investors sought safe assets while stock markets have plunged during the coronavirus pandemic.
The franc has risen to its highest level against the euro (EURCHF=) in four-and-a-half years as a result, threatening Switzerland's export-reliant economy.
The central bank declined to comment on Monday, but last week said it was ""intervening more strongly in the foreign exchange market to contribute to the stabilization of
the situation"".
The rise in sight deposits showed the SNB was clearly increasing its activity, said Alessandro Bee, an economist at UBS.
""This is the strongest weekly rise since mid-2016, after the Brexit vote, and is a clear sign of intervention,"" Bee said.
Sight deposits, a proxy for the SNB's interventions, increased by 6.3 billion francs after the Brexit vote in June 2016.
The central bank had no theoretical limit on how much it could spend, but it would prefer not to spend more than 10 billion francs a week for several weeks, Bee said.
The interventions also seems to be slowing the franc's appreciation, with the SNB able to avoid cutting its -0.75% interest rate further into negative territory at its policy update last week.
""Interventions seem to be working as the Swiss franc is not passing the 1.05 barrier against the euro, and I believe the SNB will continue to defend that barrier,"" said Karsten Junius, an economist at J.Safra Sarasin.
""There is no limit for the SNB and its reaction will continue to depend on the severity and length of the coronavirus crisis.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has sold off a touch Monday, as U.S. politicians squabble about the details of the latest rescue package, but its underlying strength points to more gains going forward.
At 03:55 ET (0755 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0709, up 0.1%. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 103.265, down 0.2%. USD/JPY fell 0.6% to 110.11, while GBP/USD traded at 1.1639, largely flat. 
It continued to make gains against emerging currencies, hitting a six-month high against the yuan and a four-year high against the ruble
Investors have been liquidating positions in riskier investments to keep their money in dollars due to the uncertainty caused by the epidemic. And while major central banks have ramped up efforts to ease a global dollar funding crunch, the U.S. currency has generally remained sought after.
This demand has been hit Monday after U.S. politicians failed to agree on the terms of a funding package of more than $1 trillion, resulting in it not getting enough votes in a key Senate procedural vote late Sunday.
But this is likely to be only a temporary blip, and Danske Bank sees further gains for the greenback against the euro.
“We see EUR/USD heading lower still in the near term, as broad USD strength is set to continue to reign,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “We target the cross to hit 1.05.”
The bank pointed to ECB efforts potentially failing to contain European stress and/or Federal Reserve initiatives managing to fade dollar funding stress. But, “more broadly, it is no longer a question of whether or not the USD is a safe haven when things get bad enough – and we have no reasons to expect risk sentiment will improve markedly for the short term.”
Over the longer term, despite a blurred outlook, the bank doesn’t expect the dollar to significantly lose strength against the euro. 
“Despite extreme fiscal and monetary policy action across countries, we deem that it will be hard to find renewed confidence in the EUR given the institutional set-up in general and the German reluctance to use fiscal easing specifically. As a result, we expect EUR/USD to linger in the 1.07 area for an extended period of time,” Danske added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose against major currencies on Monday as fresh declines in global stocks and worries about tightening liquidity amid the worsening coronavirus crisis accelerated the flight to cash.
The dollar rose against sterling toward its strongest since at least 1985. The U.S. currency hit the highest in almost three years against the euro.
The U.S. currency approached an 11-year peak against the New Zealand dollar as the country prepared to enter lockdown for the next 48 hours to contain the virus. The greenback also rose toward a 17-year high against the Australian dollar.
U.S. stock futures and oil prices came under further pressure in Asian trading, which pushed the dollar higher as more people are placed under lockdown in an effort to contain the virus, traders said.
Investors are also hoping for big fiscal spending to mitigate the damage to the global economy, but uncertainty about the spread of the virus is likely to support the dollar in the future.
""We've moved from risk off to a phase where major players are competing with each other for the safety of holding dollars in cash,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, FX strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""There are still a lot of investors who need to sell riskier assets, and they want to hold their money in dollars.""
The dollar rose 0.45% against the pound  to $1.1671, approaching the strongest since at least 1985.
The dollar initially rose against the euro (EUR=EBS) to the strongest since April 2017 but then pared gains to trade little changed at $1.0707 per euro.
The greenback closed in on multi-year highs against the Australian  and New Zealand  dollars as the economic costs of self-isolation triggered the largest intraday decline ever in New Zealand shares.
Against the yen , the U.S. currency bounced between gains and losses but last traded down 0.5% at 110.27.
Investors have been liquidating positions in safe-havens and other riskier investments to keep their money in dollars due to the uncertainty caused by the epidemic.
Major central banks have ramped up efforts to ease a global dollar funding crunch, but the U.S. currency remains in demand due to the high degree of uncertainty about the unknown flu-like virus.
Investors have to pay 71 basis points (bps) over interbank rates to swap 3-month yen into dollars , cross-currency basis swap rates showed on Monday. This is less than a 139 bps premium reached on March 19, but swap rates are still above average.
The dollar has also surged against many emerging market currencies, highlighting the growing sense of risk aversion across the globe.
In Asian trading, the dollar rose to a record high against the Mexican peso  and the highest since December 2018 against the Thai baht .
So far this year the dollar is up 26% against Brazil's real , up around 11% against the Korean won  and up 19% against the Indonesian rupiah .
Uncertainty about U.S. government stimulus added to the tense mood in Asia.
Partisan battles in the U.S. Senate stopped a $1 trillion-plus coronavirus response bill from advancing on Sunday, but talks continued over Democrats' demands for more funding for medical care and state and local efforts to combat the pandemic.
The bill is Congress' third effort to blunt the economic toll of a disease that has killed at least 420 people in the United States and sickened more than 33,000.
Nearly one in three Americans was ordered to stay home on Sunday to slow the spread of the disease, while Italy banned internal travel as deaths there reached 5,476.
U.S. President Donald Trump has approved disaster deceleration requests from New York and Washington, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard warned unemployment could reach 30% unless more was done fiscally.
Global markets have been upended in recent weeks as the coronavirus spread from central China and governments responded with increasingly strict restrictions on travel and daily life, disrupting businesses and prompting consumers to stay at home and rein in spending.

The virus has now been reported in more than 100 countries and has claimed more than 13,000 lives.

Invesing.com – The pound moved off 35-year lows on Friday, though remained under pressure, even as the U.K. government proposed more stimulus measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, and imposed further restrictions to limit contagion across the country.
GBP/USD rose 1.69% to $1.1679 after falling to $1.1414, its lowest level since 1985.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, said all cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants in the UK would shut on Friday night for the foreseeable future, as efforts to contain the coronavirus spread intensify.
The announcement arrived as the U.K. detailed further measures to cushioned the economic fallout from the pandemic. U.K. businesses would have until the end of the financial year to repay value-added tax (VAT) accrued from now through June, the government said.
The government also pledged to cover 80% of the salaries of people who are unable to work amid the coronavirus-led disruptions.

251,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 08:13AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. dollar tumbled from a record high, suffering its worst fall in more than four years, after a California stay-in-place order curbed greenback buying amid fears the world’s largest economy is headed for a recession.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slipped as much as 1.8%, pushed lower by California Governor Gavin Newsom ordering all of the state’s 40 million residents to go into home isolation starting Thursday evening. That marked the most stringent U.S. effort yet to curb the spread of the coronavirus, raising the likelihood of an economic shutdown akin to those seen in Asia and Europe.
It comes on the back of repeated efforts by global policy makers to stem the previously rampant dollar’s advance, with options pricing still indicating bullish sentiment among traders for the currency. The Federal Reserve established temporary liquidity-swap lines with nine additional central banks, including Australia’s and South Korea’s, to ease the dash for dollars.
“The dollar is getting sold partly on concern that if California and some other big states follow, unemployment would rise dramatically and push the U.S. into some place between a recession and a depression,” said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR Inc. “It’s a knee-jerk reaction of people thinking ‘gee, we didn’t think the U.S. could get into this kind of trouble -- but perhaps they can’.”
The dollar gauge slumped from a record high after it rallied more than 8% over the last eight sessions. Demand for the world’s reserve currency had jumped amid a rush for cash in anticipation of a prolonged pandemic, with there being a substantial liquidity mismatch between global demand for U.S. dollars and those on offer.
The Australian dollar rose as much as 4.2% to lead Group-of-10 currency gains against the greenback, while the pound climbed 3.4% in its biggest advance since October 2008. The Bloomberg dollar gauge recovered some ground to be 0.9% lower by midday in London.
“The softer dollar tone is giving some respite to many badly beaten-up currencies,” said Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging-markets strategist at TD Securities. “It’s early days to say this is a more pronounced dollar reversal,” he said, adding that demand for the greenback remains high.
Options prices suggest the dollar could get back on track in the months ahead. Shorter and longer-term risk reversals, a barometer of market sentiment, are bullish on the greenback against most of its major peers, apart from havens the yen and Swiss franc.
“While markets have stabilized and some oversold currencies like the pound are recovering, we advise caution given that next week’s global PMIs could underwhelm the already gloomy market expectations,” said Valentin Marinov, head of G-10 currency strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in London. “The Covid-19 pandemic is not yet under control. The mad dash for dollar cash could therefore resume.”
Unemployment Concerns
The dollar weakening came as Treasuries rallied following a New York Times report that the Trump administration is asking state labor officials to hold off on releasing precise figures for unemployment until the federal government issues national totals. The report added to speculation of a sharp increase in U.S. unemployment benefits.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates such claims are poised to surge to a record 2.25 million this week, according to an analysis of preliminary reports across 30 states. That is more than triple the prior peak of 695,000 in 1982.
“The economic damage of the coronavirus is going to be potentially greater than the medical damage to the United States,” said Tony Farren, a managing director at broker-dealer Mischler Financial Group in Stamford, Connecticut."
252,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Russia bucked a global trend for interest-rate cuts amid the spread of coronavirus by keeping borrowing costs on hold amid a currency slump.
The benchmark interest rate was held at 6%, according to a statement Friday, following 175 basis points of easing in the past year. The decision was forecast by all but one of the 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Future rates moves will take into account “actual and expected inflation dynamics” relative to the central bank’s 4% target and economic developments, according to the statement. “Risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets” will also be important.
Forward-action guidance was dropped from the central bank’s statement, but Governor Elvira Nabiullina is due to hold an off-schedule news conference at 3 p.m. Moscow time. The statement also refrained from giving forecasts on oil and economic growth.
Russia’s central bank is contending with the double shock of an oil price slump and the threat of a global recession as economies across the world shut down amid the pandemic. The bank warned that an economic downturn is possible in Russia in the coming quarters and inflation could temporarily exceed the target this year.
A more-than 20% plunge in the ruble in 2020 has prompted options markets to start predicting a shift to rate hikes in the coming months.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was sold in early trade in Europe Friday, with a more optimistic mood taking a hold of the markets as central banks continue to work on getting dollar liquidity to all corners of global markets. The expansion of swap lines between the Fed and its counterparts elsewhere has meant demand for the key safe haven play has been lessened.
At 04:10 ET (0810 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0777, up 0.8%. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 102.209, down 1.4%, while USD/JPY fell 0.9% to 109.73.
Late Thursday, the Federal Reserve said it would expand the currency swap lines to nine more countries, including central banks in Singapore, South Korea, Brazil, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway and Denmark.
This comes amid reports of a ""phase 3"" package of fiscal support being prepared in the U.S. by Senate Republicans worth around $1.2 trillion.
One of the currencies which has gained the most against the dollar Friday has been the previously beleaguered pound, with GBP/USD up 2.8% to 1.1812.
The Bank of England on Thursday slashed rates and expanded its bond-buying program, saying it would increase its purchases of government and investment grade corporate bonds by 200 billion pounds ($230 billion) to 645 billion pounds.
Sterling has suffered of late, with GBP/USD falling Thursday to its lowest level since 1985, as many have seen the response by the U.K. authorities to the coronavirus outbreak as being late and insufficient. However, the central bank’s move is likely to provide funds for the chancellor to announce further measures to help cushion the blow.
The rate-setting meeting of Russia’s central bank later Friday will also be of interest. 
The ruble has been hit hard this month, weighed on by a weak oil price and the rush to dollars as a safe haven as the coronavirus has hit the global economy. With this in mind, some market participants are expecting a hike from the current rate of 6.0% to support the currency. 
However, ING said that holding rates steady, rather than hiking by 25 basis points, would be tightening enough. The bank points to the Russian central bank’s announcement Thursday of daily sales of foreign exchange on the open market, related to the sale of its 50% equity stake in Russia's largest lender Sberbank to the National Wealth Fund. 
“The central bank's increased focus on the FX market suggests the lower importance of the policy rate and inflation targeting logic at this point,” said Dmitry Dolgin, an analyst at ING, in a research note. “We take it as another confirmation of our view that CBR is not planning to increase the key rate tomorrow in the current market conditions.”
At 03:55 ET (0755 GMT), USD/RUB traded at 78.05, down 1.4%, having intervened on Thursday to keep the ruble below 80 to the dollar.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was headed for its biggest weekly gain since the 2008 crisis on Friday, as the coronavirus pandemic drives a dash for cash that is stretching the world's financial plumbing.
Even the U.S. Federal Reserve's extension of discount dollar funding - already available to six of the world's biggest central banks - to nine more overnight showed only the most tentative signs of satisfying demand for greenbacks.
In volatile trade in Asia on Friday the British pound  fell to a fresh 35-year low of $1.1414. The Aussie and kiwi oscillated in a 1.5 cent range - eventually turning positive.
The dollar rose 0.5% against the yen to a month-high of 111.30 yen . Already thin liquidity was reduced further by a Japanese public holiday, exacerbating sharp moves. 
""World markets are still very, very nervous,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer. ""People are scrambling for (cash) any way they can,"" he said.
The coronavirus pandemic and the draconian quarantine measures to slow its spread have ground global commerce nearly to a halt, driving a huge real demand for borrowed dollars so that idled businesses can cover costs.
At the same time, currency traders want dollar positions and investors need cash to cover losses in the stock market, and are liquidating everything from gold to bonds to get the dollars.
The dollar greenback has gained 4.5% against a basket of currencies (=USD) this week so far, its best since 2008.
It is also on track for its largest weekly gain on the euro in nearly a decade and its best week on most other majors since the depths of the '08 crisis. It has gained almost 30% against the Australian dollar  this year and last sat at $0.5790. 
The dollar's 20% rise against the oil-exposed Norwegian krone  over two weeks has Norway's central bank considering intervening to support its currency, a step it has not taken in more than 20 years. 
Australia's central bank chief also raised the possibility of FX market intervention on Thursday.
The scramble has already prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to allow 15 central banks around the globe to borrow dollars cheaply against their domestic currencies.
Yet stress, which is evident in cross-currency basis swaps, remains evident in the cost of borrowing dollars abroad and in the week's 4% decline in the gold price.
The premium over interbank rates that investors were paying to swap yen for one-year dollar funding  was around 72 basis points, still close to the 2016 highs hit last week. 
""Foreign borrowers with $12 trillion of dollar-denominated debt worldwide are hoarding as many dollars as they can in order to be able to service their debts,"" said Mathieu Savary, Strategist at BCA Research.

Rosengren, currently the longest-serving Fed policy maker -- he took office in July 2007, just as the global financial crisis was getting under way -- acknowledged the coronavirus had delivered a “real economic shock.”
“We’re already seeing initial claims going up, and we’re likely to see many more layoffs over the next couple of weeks as it become clear that firms won’t be able to reopen quickly,” he said. “While that is disturbing, hopefully it is short term, and to the extent that we can continue to have financial markets be resilient, the underlying U.S. economy should be just fine over time.”

Norway’s central bank said it is ready to intervene after the bottom seemed to fall out of the krone market.
“In recent days, there has been an extraordinary situation in the market for Norwegian kroner and movements in the exchange rate have been historically large,” the central bank said on Thursday. “Against this background Norges Bank is continuously considering whether there is a need to intervene in the market by purchasing Norwegian kroner.”
With a slump in the price of oil pummeling western Europe’s biggest crude exporter, and liquidity getting sucked out of small markets, Norway’s currency appeared to have no buyers.
The krone sank as much as 7% against the euro, after slumping up to 12% in the previous session. Against the dollar, it plunged 7.5%, following declines as deep as 14% on Wednesday.
The fury of the sell-off is unprecedented, according to currency strategists.
It’s “all about the oil collapse,” said Kristoffer Kjaer Lomholt, a senior analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. What we’re witnessing now is a “potentially evil fire-sale loop related to the funding of foreign assets.”
Norwegian policy makers have been fighting a crisis on two fronts, as the fallout of the coronavirus brings the domestic economy to a standstill while the oil-price crash destroys its main export.
The central bank has responded to the meltdown by delivering an emergency half-point rate cut earlier this month and pumping extra liquidity into the economy. The government, which is backed by the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, has stepped up stimulus pledges and said it’s willing to do more.
Lomholt said he sees “a case building that more NOK weakness and volatility raises financial risks instead of cushioning the negative impact from COVID-19.”
The Norwegian currency’s future “is anyone’s guess now,” said Robin Winkler, a strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). “It’s a broken market.”
Valentin Marinov, strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London, wrote that “at the moment everyone is selling everything to get their hands on USD cash. The less liquid the asset, the greater the price impact of these flows.”

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has continued to push higher Thursday, as investors look for a safe haven amid periods of wild financial market volatility and worries over tightening liquidity.
At 04:20 ET (0820 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0852, down 0.6%. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 101.930 up 0.4%, and just off its highest level since the end of 2016. USD/JPY rose 1% to 109.14, while GBP/USD traded at 1.1515, down 0.8%, and just off levels not seen since 1985.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar skidded to a 17-year low, the New Zealand dollar fell to an 11-year low, while the Norwegian kroner fell over 5% overnight as oil prices crashed.
The move by the European Central Bank to launch a 750 billion euro ($815 billion) asset-purchase program in response to the coronavirus outbreak helped the single currency initially, but even this was eventually overwhelmed by the move into the dollar.
“The chief thing we are looking at over the coming days,” said John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank Group, “besides a general turn in sentiment, is the US dollar and whether it is once again transforming into the killer dollar that is rising across the board rather than merely against the riskier currencies that are all victims of the general deleveraging.”
Of interest later Thursday will be the latest meeting from South Africa’s central bank. It is widely expected to cut rates given an economy that slumped into a recession even before the coronavirus intensified.
Of 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey, 11 predict a 50 basis-point reduction, while the balance expect the rate to be lowered by 25 basis points.
The Swiss National Bank is also set to meet Thursday but it expected to buck the trend and avoid cutting its interest rates, which are already deep in negative territory, to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll found.
At 04:20 ET (0820 GMT), USD/CHF traded at 0.9719, up 0.4%, while USD/ZAR stood at 17.38, up 1.8%.

Investing.com - The Australian dollar plummeted more than 3% against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday in Asia. 
 
The AUD/USD pair lost 3.2% to 0.5583 by 12:30 AM ET (04:30 GMT). The pair was already down before the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) dropped interest rates to 0.25% as expected, which is a record low. 
 
“The Board will not increase the cash rate target until progress is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3% target band,” said RBA Governor Philip Lowe.
 
“At some point, the virus will be contained and the Australian economy will recover. In the interim, a priority for the Reserve Bank is to support jobs, incomes and businesses, so that when the health crisis recedes, the country is well placed to recover strongly,” he added. 
Meanwhile, data showed today that Australia’s unemployment rate unexpectedly declined in February.
 
The jobless rate fell to 5.1% from 5.3%, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday, against expectations it would remain unchanged. 
 
Employment jumped 26,700 last month, compared with economists’ estimates of a 6,300 gain. The unemployment rate was aided by an edge down in participation to 66%.
 
The ABS said in the report that “there was no notable impact” from the recent bushfires or COVID-19. But it added,“the February reference period was in the first half of the month and pre-dates the notable increases in confirmed cases in Australia of COVID-19.”
 
The bureau added that “as with other major disruption to the economy, early impacts are usually most evident in the monthly hours worked.”
 
The USD/JPY pair was up 1.0% to 109.16. The Bank of Japan offered to buy 1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion) of government bonds in another unscheduled operation.
 
The EUR/USD pair slipped 0.2% to 1.0893 after the European Central Bank (ECB) announced an asset purchase program worth 750 billion euros ($820 billion) to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
 
The program will continue until central bank judges the crisis phase of the pandemic to be over, but not before the end of this year.
 
“Extraordinary times require extraordinary action. There are no limits to our commitment to the euro,” President Christine Lagarde said.
 
The U.S. dollar index was up 0.2% to 101.752.

262,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 04:12PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Financial markets spasmed, sending U.S. stocks down more than 5% and Bloomberg’s dollar index up to a record, as the economic fallout from the pandemic outpaced the massive response from governments and central banks.
The S&P 500 fell as much as 9.8%, before a late-session bounce trimmed the decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly wiped out all the gains logged since Donald Trump took office, with investors craving more government spending to offset the impact from the virus.
Bonds tumbled around the world a day after Treasuries notched biggest yield jump since 1982, and municipal bonds extended the deepest rout since 1987 as markets braced for the potential flood of spending. Oil sank 24% to an 18-year low. The dollar strengthened a seventh straight day. The pound hit its lowest level against the greenback since 1985. Dollar-funding markets remained strained, although improved from extreme levels in recent days.
Trump offered few details at a press briefing on the specifics his Treasury secretary is discussing with Congress. The Federal Reserve dusted off crisis-era programs to stabilize financial markets.
Governments have pledged or are considering massive fiscal support to offset the economic shock from the pandemic, with the Trump administration moving toward a big package, but the virus continues to spread at a pace that is forcing massive shutdowns across the globe.
“The missing fundamental ingredient for a sustainable recovery in risk appetite is some evidence that the growth of global Covid-19 infection rates is peaking,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors. “Clearly, we are not there yet.”
The planned U.S. stimulus could amount to $1.2 trillion, aiming to stave off the worst impact of a crisis that already looks set to plunge many of the world’s economies into recession. Meantime, the Federal Reserve reintroduced additional crisis-era tools to stabilize financial markets. Those responses came after stresses appeared in the short-term funding markets.
“I don’t think we’re out of the woods yet in terms of liquidity,” Mark Konyn, chief investment officer at AIA Group in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s a question of when the fiscal measures will have the most efficacy.”
These are the main moves in markets:

The pound fell to its lowest level against the dollar in over three decades as the shocks caused by the coronavirus rippled through global markets.
Investors fled from U.K. assets as the pandemic began spreading through Britain, with many fearing Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s response has fallen short compared to measures taken by other European nations. Sterling has also suffered due to heightened global demand for the greenback, with a gauge of dollar strength up for a seventh session.
“A combination of the safe haven dollar bid, the global asset sell-off and liquidation of long positions from the election are all weighing on the pound,” said Neil Jones, head of foreign-exchange sales to financial institutions at Mizuho Bank Ltd.
Sterling fell as much as 1.9% to $1.1828, surpassing even the lows it recorded in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote. It was last lower in 1985, when the world’s richest nations signed the Plaza Accord to weaken the dollar and haul the U.S. economy out of a recession.
Alongside the pound, U.K. sovereign bonds plummeted after the government announced a rescue package for businesses in an attempt to stop the coronavirus wrecking the domestic economy. The yield on 10-year U.K. bonds rose to their highest in over two months, while the FTSE 100 stock index dropped around 5%.
Banks have been wrongfooted after being bullish on sterling, with a median estimate compiled by Bloomberg forecasting the pound at $1.30 by June. Option markets indicate a less optimistic picture, with traders going from neutral on its prospects to the most bearish since the December election.

264,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s ruble tumbled the most in emerging markets on Wednesday, erasing a fifth of its value in the year so far as crude sank to $28 per barrel.
Fears of a worldwide recession and a flight to the dollar are squeezing all risky assets, but the markets of the world’s biggest energy exporter are being hit particularly hard after President Vladimir Putin plunged into an oil-price war with Saudi Arabia. Russian local currency bonds and the ruble were one of the biggest overweight calls in the asset class last year. Now the ruble’s more than 20% plunge year-to-date is the worst performance globally.
While central banks from developed nations to emerging markets have come forward with emergency rate cuts to keep cash cheap for their battered economies, Russia is seen bucking the trend. Thirty-four out of 35 economists in a Bloomberg survey expect Governor Elvira Nabiullina to end a run of six cuts and put rates on hold on Friday in a bid to avoid weakening the currency.
Market snapshot:

Ruble sinks 3.3% to 77.9900, weakest since February 2016

Nordea analysts Grigory Zhirnov and Tatiana Evdokimova see the currency trading at 75-82 against the dollar if brent stays between $20-30. If it nears the higher end of that range, Bank of Russia could intervene in the market “to limit financial stability risks,” they write


Ruble’s one-week implied vol is highest globally at 42.98%
10-year generic ruble-bond yields jump 21bps to 8.27%, the highest in almost a year
Forward-rate agreements currently predict 122bps of hikes over coming three months; they predicted cuts at the start of the month

Piotr Matys is the sole economist not predicting a cut on Friday. Nabiullina will be weighing the ruble against potential recession, making the direction of the rate decision a “very close call.” The impact of the ruble’s drop on inflation will be more muted than in 2014, said Matys, who predicts a 50 basis-point reduction.
“When central banks in both developed and emerging economies are slashing interest rates at emergency meetings perhaps we should seriously consider the possibility of a cut in Russia.”

265,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- King Dollar is creating a new headache for virus-battered economies globally, with emerging markets especially vulnerable as they try to cope with collapsing currencies and plunging demand.
Investors are fleeing emerging markets in record numbers and piling into the safe-haven greenback, with two emergency interest-rate cuts this month by the Federal Reserve doing nothing to diminish the dollar’s appeal.
With the dollar more integrated into the world economy than ever before, its gains are an added stress for businesses and governments as they brace for soaring costs on their dollar debt. The dilemma for emerging market central banks is that as they slash interest rates to support growth, they risk destabilizing their currencies as well if they cut too much.
“The surge in the dollar is another blow to emerging markets,” said Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. “The demand for the dollar has outweighed any hit to the U.S. currency from sharply lower Fed rates. EM assets will continue to struggle as investors steer clear of relatively risky assets and maintain a bias for safe havens.”
Turkey’s central bank was the latest emerging market to make an emergency rate cut. South Korea, Chile, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Pakistan already eased this week following the Fed’s action Sunday, and South Africa, Indonesia and Brazil are expected to reduce their key rates in coming days.
New research from the Bank for International Settlements shows that since the global financial crisis, unexpected dollar appreciation depresses world trade growth. A reason for this could be a tightening in financial conditions as dollar lending to emerging markets slows, according to the research paper.
Outflows from emerging markets are already at record levels, reaching $30 billion in 45 days amid the virus outbreak, according to the Institute of International Finance. All major emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg have weakened against the dollar since Jan. 20 -- the onset of Covid-19 concerns in Asia -- with the Russian ruble and Mexican peso dropping almost 20%.​
The pain is also felt in emerging Asia, where the market plunges have brought back memories of the Asian financial crisis more than two decades back. Indonesia’s rupiah is the worst performer in Asia this year, down 8.9%, South Korea’s won is trading near its weakest since 2010, and India’s rupee slumped to a record low last week.
Khoon Goh, the Singapore-based head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., sees emerging markets in Asia carefully trying to deploy rate cuts at the same time as currency management.
“They will continue to utilize their FX reserves to smooth currency volatility, but will not seek to stem the trend or defend any particular levels,” said Goh. “In the current environment when external demand is very weak, allowing some currency weakness alongside lowering interest rates is the best way to try and ease overall financial conditions.”
Both Indonesia and the Philippines are set to cut interest rates Thursday, with the latter expected to ease by a bigger-than-usual 50 basis points.
Policy Action
It’s not just emerging markets that have suffered at the hands of the dollar’s rally. The Australian currency fell to its weakest level since 2003 -- a cause for concern given it’s likely to push up import costs without any of the normal offset benefit in areas like inbound tourism and education, given the coronavirus is closing borders. Norway’s krone is down more than 16% this year, plunging to an all-time low as crude oil weakens.
Central bankers in the advanced world are coordinating to ensure dollars keep flowing around the world. The Fed on Sunday reduced rates on its dollar-swap lines with five other central banks, taking a page from the policy playbook during the global financial crisis.
“A strong dollar is typically a headwind for emerging-market currencies and even more so for countries that are reliant on offshore dollar funding and have floating exchange-rate regimes, said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd.
Here’s a look at how other emerging-market central banks outside of Asia have approached policy around the virus:
Latin America
CHILE’s central bank slashed its key interest rate by the most in more than a decade March 16 amid the threat of a recession. The benchmark S&P IPSA index posted its biggest decline in at least three decades on the same day, and the price of copper, Chile’s leading export, is at the lowest in more than three yearsBRAZIL is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday, with growing calls for a full percentage-point reduction.

After initially moving higher, the currency dropped to new lows days after the announcement while stocks triggered a circuit breaker five times since March 9MEXICO’s central bank has expanded the maximum size of their non-deliverable forward hedge program and launched an auction for $2 billion in hedges to contain the market fallout.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). predicts policy makers will likely slash at least 50 basis points in the March 26 meeting to deal with slowdown, if not moreEMEA
In SOUTH AFRICA, a combination of downside surprises on inflation, the second recession in two years and continued power cuts supported the case for a 25 basis-point reduction even before the virus outbreak. There’s growing expectation of the central bank cutting by more than that on Thursday, with derivative markets pricing in 50 basis pointsTURKEY’s central bank on Tuesday cut its one-week repo rate by 100 basis points in an emergency meeting, and announced a range of measures designed to boost the banking sector’s liquidity and bolster loan growth. The move came two days before the scheduled meeting and pushed benchmark borrowing costs into the single digits for the first time since May 2018.

Investing.com - The euro is under pressure Wednesday, as bond markets remind euro zone countries of the costs of the measures needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
At 04:10 ET (0810 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0971, down 0.2%, after falling as low as 1.0953 overnight. 
Europe has become the chief battleground against the virus, with deaths continuing to soar in Italy and Spain, and France beginning a strict lockdown. This has prompted the European Union to ban travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days in an unprecedented move to seal its external borders.
Attention is increasingly turning on how the respective governments within the euro zone will cope with funding the measures needed to combat the virus as well as supporting their battered economies.
The spreads between the yields of government debt in Germany and many of the peripheral eurozone countries have ballooned of late, a reflection of the fact that there is still no convincing mutual guarantee of sovereign debts within the currency union.. 
The spread between the yield of 10-year Germany debt and that of Greece has increased to 400 basis points from 193 bps at the start of March. Italy has gone from 129 bps a month ago to 284 bps now, Spain from 67 bps to 145 bps and Portugal from 60 bps to 167 bps.
A pointer to the seriousness of the situation is shown by German chancellor Angela Merkel saying Tuesday that Germany is willing to consider a joint EU funding program in order to mitigate the fiscal consequences of the current situation, according to Bloomberg.
Germany was not willing to consider a joint funding scheme in either 2008, during the financial crisis, or in 2012 during the sovereign debt crisis.
“We did not expect the sudden sharp plunge in the euro that sent it to an overnight low of 1.0953,” said FX Strategists at UOB Group. “While oversold, the decline is not showing signs of stabilization just yet. From here, the euro could dip below the overnight low but the next support at 1.0900 is likely out of reach.”
Elsewhere, the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 100.04, up 0.2% after further sharp gains against commodity currencies. USD/JPY fell 0.3% to 107.39, while GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.2031. 
 
"
267,"<span>Mar 18, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s currency has been in a free-fall, even defying the central bank’s intense market intervention. The decline may now gather further pace as demand for dollars climb from companies set to repatriate dividends.
With the foreign investors adopting a flight-to-quality approach, even the high real returns on Indonesian sovereign bonds won’t be enough to stop the rush to exit, according to I Made Budhi Purnama Artha, head of treasury at Maybank Indonesia in Jakarta. Bank Indonesia should pump in more dollars to prevent the rupiah from declining further and protect investor confidence, he said.
The rupiah has gone from being Asia’s best performing currency in January to the worst in the past month as a global sell-off sparked by coronavirus concerns deepened. On Tuesday, the currency weakened past 15,000 to a dollar for the first time since the emerging market rout in 2018, raising concerns even a near-record foreign exchange reserve and all-out central bank intervention may fail to ease the turmoil.
Foreign investors have pulled more than $4 billion from rupiah bonds this year, on course for the biggest quarterly outflow ever, and have dumped about $600 million of shares, contributing to the third trading halt within a week. With the risk-off sentiment guiding investors, an expected interest rate cut on Thursday may do little to reverse the sell-off.
The trajectory of rupiah will “depend on whether global financial markets will still be as volatile as this month in the future,” said Wisnu Wardana, an economist at PT Bank Danamon Indonesia. “Our base scenario for Covid-19 is it lasts in Indonesia for six months with a peak in May. Pressure on rupiah might increase especially if other countries succeed to contain the virus while Indonesia struggles.”
The rupiah fell as much as 0.3% to 15,224 to a dollar on Wednesday, extending losses this year to almost 9%. The yield on benchmark 10-year rupiah bonds was at 7.58%, near its highest level since August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A second wave of outflows from Indonesian markets may come in April and May, when foreign companies typically repatriate their dividends. But with the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting rates by 100 basis points, the high carry on Indonesian may lure bank investors and cushion the impact, Maybank’s Artha said.
Indonesian bonds are a barometer of risk appetite with foreign investors owning about 35% of the nation’s total sovereign rupiah bonds.
Here’s what market strategists and economists are saying about the outlook for rupiah:
David Sumual, economist at PT Bank Central Asia
“Bank Indonesia has to ensure sufficient liquidity between the central bank and banks, banks and banks, banks and the real sector at different costs. The intervention using forex reserves can be done because the needs of dollars for trade are declining. Aside from what the bank has been doing now, they still have bilateral swap agreements and the Chiang Mai Initiatives as a second line of defense. The virus pandemic needs a strong fiscal response. The government would also need to consider issuing a decree if it needs to exceed the legal budget deficit of 3% of GDP.”
I Made Budhi Purnama Artha, head of treasury at PT Maybank Indonesia
“During limited liquidity, demand for dollars is relatively pretty high, resulting in continued rupiah weakening. Dollar demand also triggered by the sell-offs by equity and fixed income investors. The cut in Fed fund rate will make Indonesian assets relatively attractive again and has the potential to attract bonds investors to re-enter Indonesian market. This can offset demand from fleeing equity investors and demand for dollars which tend to rise in April-June on dividend payment.”
Wisnu Wardana, economist at PT Bank Danamon Indonesia
“The most important thing is to maintain dollar supply domestically. Therefore, the policy to reduce foreign currency reserve requirement should be appreciated. Under the current circumstances, the best course of action is to guide the value of financial instrument to its fundamental level.”
Josua Pardede, economist at PT Bank Permata
“The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the rupiah and other developing country currencies is influenced by the anticipated global economic slowdown from Covid-19 after it being declared a global pandemic. In addition, the very aggressive response of the U.S. central bank also gave a negative signal to emerging market financial markets, including the Indonesian capital market.

Investing.com - The yen rose against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday in Asia after data showed Japan’s exports in February slid. 
The USD/JPY pair traded 0.5% lower to 107.15 by 12:30 AM ET (04:30 GMT). 
Data released on Wednesday showed Japan's exports slipped 1.0% from a year earlier. It was the 15th straight month of decline and the longest run since a 23-month stretch to July 1987. However, the drop was less than the 4.3% predicted by analysts.
Imports fell 14.0% during the period, the data showed. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index lost 0.3% to 99.540. Risk appetite resumed amid a rally on Wall Street after reports said the Trump administration is considering a plan that could amount to as much as $1.2 trillion in spending. 
The package could include direct payment of $1,000 or more to Americans.
“It is a big number,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters later on Capitol Hill. “This is a very big situation in this economy, we put a proposal on the table that would inject $1 trillion into the economy.”
“Americans need cash now, and the president wants to give cash now. And I mean now, in the next two weeks,” he said on Tuesday at a White House briefing alongside President Donald Trump.
The news came after the U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out financial-crisis-era measures again this week. It detailed plans to create a lending facility to support short-term commercial debt markets to avert a liquidity crisis from the impact of the coronavirus spread.
""People are very, very nervous,"" said Gunter Seeger, senior vice president in investment-grade fixed income at New York asset manager PineBridge Investments. ""Everyone's nervous about the virus, about oil prices, about their job, about everything.""
""It all stems from a shortage of US dollars,"" he said in a Reuters report.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held overnight gains against most major currencies on Wednesday, after U.S. yields jumped and as deepening fear around the coronavirus drove a scramble for greenback.
The pound and safe-haven yen made the best efforts at recovery, but only managed to recoup fractions of their losses.
The yen was last up 0.3% at 107.37 per dollar, the pound up 0.5% at $1.2108 and the euro (EUR=) was steady at $1.1000. Commodity-sensitive currencies, like the Aussie and kiwi, were trampled below $0.60 in the stampede.
All are well below where they were a week ago as investors sell just about everything for dollars and businesses seek to draw down loans and hoard cash to ride out the crisis.
""It all stems from a shortage of US dollars,"" said Gunter Seeger, senior vice president in investment-grade fixed income at New York asset manager PineBridge Investments.
Dislocation in the U.S. bond market, where the yield on government debt has gyrated wildly for the past week, illustrates the desperation for cash, he said, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve pumps huge amounts of liquidity into the system.
""People are very, very nervous,"" Seeger said. ""Everyone's nervous about the virus, about oil prices, about their job, about everything.""
Meanwhile the coronavirus only spreads, as country after country adopts draconian social restrictions and a war-footing mentality to try and contain the outbreak.
The global death toll is above 7,800, the number of cases is approaching 200,000 and the economic fallout of what is in effect a global lockdown is spiraling.
The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) jumped 34 basis points higher overnight, the largest single-day rise since 2004 - further illustrating how massive selling is testing liquidity in even the deepest and broadest markets.
The higher yield also adds yet more attraction to owning dollars, amid growing signs of tight supply - especially abroad.
Cross-currency basis swap spreads, which show the cost of borrowing dollars abroad, hit their widest in years.
Three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap spreads rose as high as 120 basis points - its widest since late 2011 - before falling back to 39 basis points.
Spreads for the Aussie and yen also widened dramatically. Risk currencies were also pounded with the mood, and nursed deep losses on Wednesday.
The Australian dollar has made its first trip under 60 cents since 2003 and last sat at $0.5998, while the kiwi was at $0.5955. The Australian dollar has lost nearly 15% against the greenback this year.
""In the context of the highly elevated levels of risk aversion and depths to which commodity prices have fallen...we said last week that both Antipodean currencies were on borrowed time above 0.60,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB."

Invesing.com – The dollar extended its gains on Tuesday, thanks to a surge against the yen as risk appetite returned amid a rally on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration rolled out new stimulus measures to combat the Covid-19 outbreak.
The pound moved off the lows against the greenback after the UK unveiled further stimulus measures to support businesses affected by the virus. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 1.77% to 99.88.
The Fed rolled out financial-crisis-era measures again this week after detailing plans to create a lending facility to support short-term commercial debt markets to avert a liquidity crisis from the impact of the coronavirus spread.

The stimulus initiatives underpinned the broader rebound on Wall Street, prompting investors to reduce bullish bets on the yen.
USD/JPY rose 1.30% to Y107.30.

 Investing.com - The U.S. dollar has been in demand Tuesday, rebounding from Monday’s losses, as other central banks look to follow the aggressive easing stance recently taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
At 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.1129, down 0.4%. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.493, up 0.4%. USD/JPY fell 0.9% to 106.82. 
Earlier Tuesday the Bank of Japan pumped more than $30 billion into markets with an 84-day dollar funding operation, while the Reserve Bank of Australia announced plans to meet on Thursday two weeks ahead of schedule, suggesting another interest rate cut is on the way.
The global spread of coronavirus has roiled markets in recent weeks, spurring a flight to haven assets, and the U.S. dollar in particular. The move by the Federal Reserve Sunday to slash interest rates to near zero prompted selling in the greenback, but tone that changed Tuesday.
One of the poor performing currencies over the last few weeks has been sterling. The Bank of England is scheduled to hold its next rate-setting meeting on March 26, but a move being made before then cannot be ruled out owing to the intensity of the coronavirus crisis.
The pound has tended to show weakness against the greenback and euro in the current environment of investor fear. A large drawdown in U.K. investments by international investors may well be responsible for this, especially as the U.K. has taken a different stance on combating the coronavirus outbreak than most of its peers.
At 04:10 AM ET, GBP/EUR was quoted at 1.0980, at the start of last week the pair was at 1.1523. GBP/USD is now quoted at $1.2208, and was at $1.32 last week.

Investing.com - Prices of the safe-haven yen fell on Tuesday in Asia as equity markets turned green after opening lower.
 
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.5% to 106.40 by 12:30 AM ET (04:30 GMT). 
 
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.2% to 0.6127. Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) March 3 meeting said the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and was ready to do so again as it became “increasingly clear” the coronavirus would cause major disruption to economic activity worldwide.
 
The central bank slashed the cash rate to 0.5% to provide support to the economy, according to the minutes, which also showed officials agreed on “the importance of monitoring the rapidly changing developments closely in subsequent weeks and maintaining contact to assess the implications” of the outbreak for the economy.
 
The RBA is set to announce further policies on Thursday this week. It is expected to cut rates to 0.25%. 
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was unchanged at 98.155 as traders await the Commerce Department to issue its report later in the day. 
 
Retail sales are expected to have risen 0.2% in February, down from a 0.3% rise in March, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
 
Meanwhile, economists are looking for February industrial production to have risen 0.4% and capacity utilization to have ticked up to 77.1%.
 
The dollar was pressured on Monday after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near zero late on Sunday and announced massive bond buying.
 
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.1% to 6.9947.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen held largely firm on Tuesday, while risk-sensitive currencies struggled to stay afloat as coordinated moves by central banks failed to quell investor trepidation over the spreading coronavirus pandemic.
Global risk assets were routed over the past several days, with turmoil engulfing many markets on worries the outbreak and draconian containment measures could trigger steep recessions in major economies.
As a result, trading in most markets including foreign exchange is driven more by loss-reduction and other position unwinding to reduce risks or make up for losses, rather than fresh bids, market players said.
""Liquidity in financial markets has evaporated,"" ANZ analysts said in a note to clients, adding that the ""bold concerted global central bank actions have not done enough to settle markets.""
The liquidity anxiety has hammered higher yielding risk-sensitive currencies, such as the Australian dollar, while those with negative yields, such as the yen, the euro and the Swiss franc, have largely escaped the markets carnage.
The dollar traded at 106.33 yen , bouncing back from Monday's low of 105.15, but still down 1.6% so far this week,
The euro last stood at $1.1167 (EUR=), little changed after wild gyrations on Monday.
The Australian dollar, with big exposure to commodities, fetched $0.6102 , down 0.3% in early trade, after having hit an 11-year low of $0.60765 on Monday.
The Canadian dollar, which has strong correlation with oil prices, sank to a four-year low of C$1.4020 per U.S dollar , as oil prices plummeted on a Saudi-instigated price war.
U.S. benchmark oil futures (CLc1) fell $3.03 to settle at $28.70 a barrel, near a 4-year low.
The British pound is also under pressure, dogged by worries about not only Britain's exit from the European Union but also its sizable current account deficit.
Sterling traded at $1.2265 , down 0.04% so far on the day, having hit a five-month low of $1.2203.
A rout on Wall Street on Monday underscored fears over the coronavirus crisis in the West as well as the Federal Reserve's emergency move to slash rates on Sunday.
But investors took the Fed action, joined by central banks in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, as insufficient given the pathogen's breakneck spread across the world which has put many nations on virtual lockdowns.
Some analysts said the hasty moves may have backfired as investors were spooked over the possible panic among policymakers.
""Central banks are pressing the gas pedal to the floor. But the car is bogged down in a quagmire that is called coronavirus, so it won't move forward,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
""Until the outbreak stops, for investors, it is time for patience,"" she said.
There is no clarity on that front, with global cases now rising to 174,100 with 6,700 deaths, prompting countries to shut borders and take increasingly drastic measures to try to reduce the severity of the outbreak.
Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies said they were committed to doing ""whatever is necessary"" to battle the coronavirus pandemic and to work together more closely to protect public health, jobs and growth.
Investors are also shunning many emerging market currencies.
MSCI emerging market currencies index (MIEM00000CUS) dropped to its lowest level since late 2018."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - When the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday, the dollar fell, since the move blew away the yield on owning dollars and with it much of their attraction.
Yet few are willing to bet on a prolonged decline. Pandemic fears are roiling markets, driving a scramble for both safety and funding in the world's reserve currency.
Analysts are already discounting the dollar's slide on Monday as modest and maybe temporary, given the scale of the Fed's emergency move. They are also drawing a distinction between the unwinding of the dollar's yield and what happens next.
""We had this very, very bold move by the Federal Reserve,"" said Paul Mackel, head of emerging markets FX research at HSBC in Hong Kong. ""(But) if you look at the reaction of markets, it's very mixed if not underwhelming. And in the currency market specifically, the dollar funding still remains quite tight.""
He said the dollar was drawing support for various reasons, from investors seeking safety from wild trading in other asset classes to businesses that want to be cash-rich in uncertain times.
""Whenever you have a big enough financial shock, the scramble for liquidity and the reserve currency in the world, which is the dollar, typically intensifies,"" Mackel said.

Despite the Fed's 100-basis-point cut and aggressive liquidity measures, the cost of borrowing dollars internationally - reflected in cross currency swaps - has kept rising.
Japanese banks on Monday were paying 10 times the average price to swap yen for one-month dollars .
The dollar has historically gained in spot markets whenever there is an offshore funding squeeze, since it is almost always against a backdrop of global uncertainty and market volatility that tends to hurt the balance sheets of non-dollar economies.
This time, the dollar's yields are also higher than those in the euro zone or Japan.
In the spot market, the euro was recently unchanged against the dollar (EUR=) on Monday and the yen  up nearly 2% as U.S. yields dived after the Fed announcement. 
But both stayed below recent peaks and the dollar surged against commodity and emerging-market currencies, adding to already massive gains as pandemic headlines flowed across screens.
The dollar has gained around 10% against the New Zealand dollar  and some 12% against the Australian dollar  this year.
Although positioning data <0#NETUSDFX=> has the value of long dollar positions tumbling with the unwinding of the euro/dollar carry trade, the market remains long dollars.
Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, said on Monday it expects the dollar to extend already big gains against the Korean won and Thai baht, and added to a bet the Singapore dollar will fall against the dollar.
Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow said as long as investors' worries about the virus remains, demand for dollars should stay strong.
""It's hard to see much upside for the Aussie, kiwi or Canadian dollar, given what's happened with commodities and energy prices in general and sensitivity to risk appetite,"" he said.

""If you're having liquidity problems on a currency like the Aussie, if there's concern there, then it's just multiplied for any emerging-market currency ... I don't think too many people have the luxury of just standing by.""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was hit hard Monday by aggressive moves from the Federal Reserve overnight to try and buttress the U.S economy, as the coronavirus disrupts global activity ever more deeply.
At 02:55 ET (0755 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.1166, up 0.6%. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.177, down 0.7%. USD/JPY fell 1.3% to 106.56, after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged but increased its asset purchases, while GBP/USD traded at 1.2329, up 0.4%. 
The global spread of coronavirus has roiled markets in recent weeks, causing volatility to spike and spurring a flight to haven assets. The U.S. dollar has been one of the main beneficiaries of this move, helped by relatively high interest rates and a growing economy. 
However, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near zero late on Sunday and announced massive bond buying, adding to the growing cavalcade of stimulus provided by central banks and governments around the world.
“This action in itself is not going to rescue the US economy from recession, but it will help to mitigate the risks from financial tensions that could make the growth and jobs outlook far, far worse,” said James Knightly, Chief International Economist at ING. 
“The supply crunch in manufacturing, the panic in the financial sector and the collapse in airline travel, hotel stays and leisure activities means we could see a quarterly contraction of the scale reached during the height of the financial crisis, especially with the prospect of some city lockdowns.""
Knighltly said ING now expects an annualized drop of U.S. 8% in GDP in the second quarter. That compares with drops of 8.4% and 4.4% in the final quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.
Helping the weak tone Monday is a research note by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), recommending selling the greenback, which was published before the Fed’s latest action.
“We expect further U.S. dollar weakness, driven by the interrelated combination of aggressive Fed stimulus and a tactical risk rebound,” they said. “The U.S. Dollar Index may reach, if not breach, the 95 level.” 
The strategists recommend buying the euro versus the dollar with a target of 1.16 and a “fairly wide stop” at 1.08 given the high market volatility. 
“Markets have moved a lot in the past couple of weeks, with the recent 20%-plus drawdown in global equities one of the most aggressive on record,” the strategists said. “Looking across asset classes, the cost-benefit of risk taking is increasingly moving in a positive direction.”
The dollar still benefited from safe haven inflows out of emerging market currencies, rising over 1% against the Mexican peso and Indonesian rupiah, over 2% against the Russian ruble, and 7.3% against the Kazakh tenge.
The dollar was broadly unchanged against the Chinese yuan at 7.00.

276,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 01:34AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Global financial markets are now in a bottoming phase, and investors should start to add risk and sell the U.S. dollar, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The tightening of financial conditions has been fast and furious, caused by a slump in stock markets and a widening of credit spreads, strategists including Matthew Hornbach in New York wrote in a report published Friday. However, support measures, mainly by central banks so far, are helping to deliver easing and stabilize the situation, they said.
“That’s not to say we’re ‘calling the bottom’ or we’ve seen the lowest prices in risk assets,” the strategists wrote. “But it is to say that we’ve entered the final phase of this severe, acute bear market. And that means we’re closer to the ‘early stage recovery’ phase than we were over the past three weeks. As such, our strategists around the world have begun suggesting the addition of risk.”
The global spread of coronavirus has roiled markets in recent weeks, causing volatility to spike and spurring a flight to haven assets, including the U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near zero late on Sunday and announced massive bond buying, adding to the growing cavalcade of stimulus provided by central banks and governments around the world.

The strategists recommend buying the euro versus the dollar with a target of 1.16 and a “fairly wide stop” at 1.08 given the high market volatility. They also advocate going long the Australian dollar versus the greenback targeting 0.68 with a stop of 0.60.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar fell on Monday in Asia after the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate to zero and launched a massive quantitative easing (QE) program in an emergency move over the weekend. 
On Sunday, the Fed shocked investors by announcing a 50 basis point rate cut. It was the second rate slash by the central bank in less than two weeks as it delivered a rare emergency rate cut at the start of the month. 
The Fed also announced a QE program that entails $700 billion worth of asset purchases.
Following the news, the U.S. dollar index fell 0.4% to 98.482.
In other news, U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday as the country recorded more than 2,000 cases and 50 deaths. 
The USD/JPY pair lost 1.0% to 106.79 as Asian markets traded in the red again. 
The Bank of Japan is expected to ease policy on Thursday to cushion the economic fallout from the coronavirus and shore up business confidence in the country. 
Meanwhile, the Japanese government is reportedly preparing a new spending package of up to 20 trillion yen ($190 billion), as it tries to fend off a recession.
The AUD/USD pair and the NZD/USD pair both fell 0.2%. 
The EUR/USD pair rose 0.2% to 1.1128 as traders await a meeting between European Union finance ministers later in the day. Reuters reported today that the ministers might agree on a coordinated economic response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the European Commission forecasting the effects of the virus could push the EU into a recession.
The USD/CNY pair slipped 0.1% to 6.9993. While not a directional driver for the yuan today, data showed China’s latest industrial production, employment and retail sales figure all came in a lot worse than expected. "

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a broad range of currencies on Monday after the U.S. Federal Reserve made another surprise interest rate cut and major central banks took steps to relieve a shortage of dollars in financial markets.
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and said it would expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in coming weeks.
Five other central banks also cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to their financial institutions facing stress in credit markets.
The moves come as policymakers respond to a brutal months-long sell-off in financial markets due to worries about the economic impact of the global spread of the coronavirus.
""It's a modest negative reaction for the U.S. dollar. The Fed moved a little sooner and a little more aggressive that some thought,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney.
""This cannot prevent the economic fallout from social distancing (used to slow the coronavirus). That will require some fiscal spending and something from the government to make sure small companies are funded.""
The dollar fell 1.5% to 106.35 yen early on Monday in Asia in reaction to the Fed's move, which was announced on Sunday evening U.S. time.
The greenback also fell 0.9% to $1.2405 per British pound .
Against the euro (EUR=EBS), the dollar slid 0.3% to $1.1153.
The dollar fell 0.3% to 0.9507 Swiss franc .
The Fed, the Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and Swiss National Bank also agreed to offer three-month credit in U.S. dollars on a regular basis and at a rate cheaper than usual.
The move was designed to bring down the price banks and companies pay to access U.S. dollars, which has surged in recent weeks as a coronavirus pandemic spooked investors.
The Fed had already cut interest rates by half a percentage point on March 3 at an emergency meeting, the first emergency cut since the financial crisis in 2008, but that move failed to stem market volatility.
The Fed's move on Sunday U.S. time was likely aimed at staving off what had the potential to be another volatile week in financial markets, analysts say.
However, U.S. stock futures plunged after the rate cut, suggesting investors remain nervous.
Later on Monday, China will release several important economic indicators that should reveal the scale of damage caused by coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese province of Hubei late last year.
The Fed was originally scheduled to announce a policy decision on Wednesday, and the BOJ holds a two-day meeting ending Thursday, and the pressure has been on central banks to do something to restore calm to financial markets.
Worries that travel restrictions and factory closures aimed at containing the coronavirus will cause a global recession have sent equities into a tailspin.
In the offshore market, the yuan edged up slightly to 7.0131 per dollar as traders awaited key Chinese economic data.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand joined the global easing race with a cut of 75 basis points to its rates, while the Reserve Bank of Australia added A$5.9 billion to the banking system through market repo operations.
The New Zealand dollar fell 0.2% to $0.6045, while the Australian dollar fell 0.38% o $0.6164."

LONDON (Reuters) - Currency pegs have come under fresh scrutiny once again following a sharp decline in oil prices. Below is a list of some countries which still control their foreign exchange rates.
NORTH AFRICA & THE MIDDLE EAST
LEBANON: The pound has been pegged at 1,507.5 to the dollar since 1997.
SAUDI ARABIA: The world's top oil exporter has a fixed exchange rate regime, with the riyal pegged at 3.75 to the U.S. dollar since 1986. Foreign exchange is predominantly earned by the government and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) provides the private sector with dollars, selling them against riyals to the domestic banks.
KUWAIT: The dinar has been pegged against an undisclosed basket of currencies, made up of its major trading and financial partners, with the central bank declaring the exchange rate daily against the U.S. dollar.
QATAR: Since 1980, the riyal has been pegged at 3.64 to the U.S. dollar with an upper limit of 3.6415 and a lower limit of 3.6385.
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: The mid-point between the official buying and selling rates for the dirham has been 3.6725 to the U.S. dollar since November 1997, with the peg being made official in 2002.
BAHRAIN: The dinar is pegged at 0.376 to the U.S. dollar.
OMAN: The country has maintained a peg of 0.3849 rial to the U.S. dollar since 1986.
MOROCCO: The dirham is pegged against a euro-U.S. dollar basket, with the latter having a weighting of 40%. In January 2018, Morocco widened the band in which the dirham trades against hard currencies to 2.5 percent either side of a reference price from the previous 0.3 percent.
ALGERIA: The country's dinar is managed against an undisclosed basket of major currencies.
SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
NIGERIA: Africa's biggest oil exporter operates a multiple exchange rate regime, which it has used to manage pressure on the currency. The official rate of 306.90 is supported by the central bank but the I&E FX Window of just under 370 is widely quoted by foreign investors and exporters.
CFA FRANC REGION: Countries in the eight-nation West African CFA franc zone (Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo) and the six-nation Central African CFA franc zone (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon) have their respective currencies pegged to the euro . Both are guaranteed by the French treasury and were pegged to the French franc before the euro. Although the two currencies are in theory separate legal tenders, they have been effectively interchangeable. The CFA franc is pegged at 655.957 to the euro.
ETHIOPIA: Africa's biggest coffee exporter has operated a carefully managed floating exchange rate regime since 1992 for its birr currency . In September, the country's central bank governor said Ethiopia should slowly liberalise its exchange rate regime but was unlikely to move to a fully floating rate within the next three years.
LATIN AMERICA
CUBA: The Caribbean island has had a dual monetary system since 1994 following the fall of the Soviet Union. The two currencies circulating in Cuba are the peso and the convertible peso, which is valued at 24 pesos. Possession of the dollar and other tradable currencies is legal in Cuba, but until recently have not been deemed legal tender for purchases.
CHINA: The People's Bank of China (PBOC) allows the yuan to trade in a 2% range around a mid-point it fixes against the dollar each day. That mid-point is based on the yuan's movement in the previous session and moves in the currencies of China's main trading partners. It has also at times used an undefined ""counter-cyclical factor"" to adjust the mid-point and contain potentially big swings in sentiment.
HONG KONG: The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar, but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85. Under the currency peg, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is obliged to intervene when the currency hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact.
SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) manages policy through exchange rate settings, rather than through interest rates as other central banks do, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band. In October, the MAS said it would ""reduce slightly"" the slope of the Singapore dollar's policy band. The width and level at which the band was centered was unchanged.
VIETNAM: The central bank allows the dong to move in a band of 3% on either side of a daily ""reference rate"", which is based on a basket of eight currencies. It does not disclose the composition of the basket.
EUROPE
DENMARK: The country's currency peg has been in place since the 1980s. Under the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) set up with the launch of the euro, Denmark agreed to keep the crown in a corridor of 2.25 percent either side of a central rate of 7.46038 crowns to the euro. In practice, it has kept it within 0.5 percent.
BULGARIA: The lev has been pegged to the euro since the launch of the common currency and, prior to that, to the German Mark. The lev is pegged at 1.95583 to the euro by the currency board, a regime that constrains its central bank's ability to set interest rates.
CIS COUNTRIES: Few of the nine members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) still control their exchange rates. However, the pressure is mounting on any currency arrangements after Russia switched to a free-float in late 2014, prompting Belarus, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to follow suit in 2015 .
Moldova and Kyrgyzstan already have a float. Uzbekistan allowed the sum to float freely in August. Neighboring Tajikistan, which has what it calls a ""regulated float"" that features some central bank interventions, allowed the somoni to weaken by 2.7% at the same time, the biggest adjustment in more than two years.
TURKMENISTAN: The manat has no official peg to the U.S. dollar and the currency regime is not transparent. However, the manat has traded at around 3.5 to the dollar following a devaluation in January 2015. Prior to that, the manat had been unchanged at 2.84 per dollar since it was unified with the unofficial rate in 2009 to try to stamp out black market trade.

Investing.com -- The dollar drifted higher against developed-market peers but gave up gains against emerging currencies in early trading in Europe on Friday, as the market digested the Federal Reserve’s pledge to inject $1.5 trillion in reserves into the financial system late on Thursday.
The Fed also announced that its already-scheduled injection of reserves through T-bill purchases would now take place along the whole Treasury yield curve, in an effort to ease budding liquidity problems in the world’s benchmark risk-free asset. Analysts described that move as the start of “QE4” – a fresh round of quantitative easing that President Donald Trump has already called for.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was essentially flat at 97.45. It was up 1.3% against the Japanese yen at 105.95 and unchanged against the safe haven Swiss franc, but down slightly against the euro and sterling.
Markets had been confused on Thursday by the European Central Bank’s reluctance to cut interest rates and by President Christine Lagarde’s inflammatory comment that “we are not there to close spreads,” a remark that caused heavy selling in Italian government bonds. The ECB subsequently walked back the comments but the German-Italian yield spread has stayed at elevated levels.By 5:30 AM ET, it was still at 247 basis points. 
“It’s worthwhile spelling this out,” said Claus Vistesen, euro zone economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Italy is in the grips of a public health and economic crisis of unprecedented proportions, and the ECB just suggested that it does not care if markets have a go at the BTP market as a result.”
Having shrugged off the stimulus measures of the ECB, Bank of England and Federal Reserve, markets are desperate for a sign that the coronavirus epidemic is peaking. There is no such sign yet, either in Europe or the U.S.
Earlier, the central banks of Norway and Sweden both announced emergency measures to support local financial markets, Norges Bank cutting its key rate by 50 basis points and the Riksbank injecting 500 billion kronor of liquidity. 
The Norwegian krone was up 0.4% against the euro after the move, while EUR/SEK fell 0.2% to 9.7181. The euro has risen 3.6% against the Swedish krona and 7.8% against the Norwegian currency this week, with most of its crosses rising as carry trades funded in euros were unwound. The Norwegian krone has been especially weak due to the collapse in oil prices. 
Further afield, there was relief for emerging currencies battered by the flight to quality earlier this week. The dollar fell 2.8% against the ruble after hitting a new four-year high overnight, while it also fell 1.8% against the Soufh African rand and 0.6% against the Turkish lira."
282,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 04:49AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging signs of a rush for dollars in the global financial system have spurred calls for the world’s central banks to use a key tool deployed during the credit crisis more than a decade ago: currency swap lines.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed more than 1% for the second time this week on Thursday, reaching a three-year high. The Japanese yen, so often a haven in times of stress, closed little changed despite the biggest stock slide on Wall Street since the 1987 crash. Emerging-market currencies including South Korea’s won and Mexico’s peso have tumbled this week, evidence that foreign investors are yanking money and scrambling into the greenback.
Gauges of dollar demand for traders have shown rapidly mounting strains. While central banks including the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan have been injecting liquidity into domestic money markets, they have yet to tap into swap lines that were set up more than a decade ago to avoid a paralyzing shortage of the world’s main reserve currency.
“Additional liquidity measures will likely be needed,” Evercore ISI analysts Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi wrote in a note Thursday, after the U.S. central bank ramped up the amount of cash it’s prepared to inject into funding markets. Further action could address the “distribution of dollars globally as companies hit by cash-flow interruptions look to draw down dollar credit lines.”
The swap lines were set up in 2007, terminated in 2010 and then revived as the euro crisis emerged later that same year. In 2013, the Fed made the arrangements with five developed-nation counterparts a standing facility. Given that they involve the provision of currency to foreign agents, the lines have faced political opposition: Some in the U.S. Congress criticized the Fed for extending dollars to foreign entities in the past.
One option is for countries outside the U.S. to draw down their foreign-exchange reserves. But that could quickly turn into a race among traders to see how much of those stockpiles officials would be willing to run down. The Fed swap lines provide the easiest solution, because they have no pre-set limit.
Yen three-month cross-currency basis swaps slumped by 15 basis points Friday, speaking to the rising cost of dollar funding.
The BOJ, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and Bank of Canada are the five with current arrangements with the Fed. During the global crisis the U.S. expanded the access to a number of others, including the central banks of Brazil and South Korea, though no emerging market currently has access.
“We need an extended version of the swap lines we saw in 2008,” Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis SA told Bloomberg Television on Monday. “The point is to get the liquidity where it is needed, and that is not rate cuts.”"

Investing.com - The Japanese yen fell against the U.S. dollar on Friday in Asia after the Bank of Japan introduced an additional stimulus. 
The USD/JPY pair lost 0.6% to 105.28 by 12:15 AM ET (04:15 GMT) as the Bank of Japan on Friday said it would buy 200 billion yen ($1.90 billion) of Japanese government bonds. The central bank also said it would inject an additional 1.5 trillion yen in two-week lending.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies slipped 0.1% to 97.377. 
In an effort to prevent potential freezes brought on by the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, the U.S. Federal Reserve offered a huge injection of liquidity to the Treasury market overnight. It is looking to provide trillions of dollars in temporary loans to the banking system in coming weeks while at the same time purchasing a broader range of government securities. 
The U.S. central bank delivered an emergency half percentage-point cut last week and some expect further moves when they meet next week.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said today it now expects the Fed to cut by 100 basis points at the meeting, down to a range of 0% to 0.25%, in “light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook”.
Meanwhile, the University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of March consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET today.
The consumer sentiment index is expected to drop to 95 from 101 in February, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The EUR/USD pair gained 0.3% to 1.1212 even after the European Central Bank (ECB) surprisingly announced that it was not cutting rates. Instead, the ECB introduced measures to support bank lending and expanded its asset purchase program by 120 billion euros ($135.28 billion).

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall on Friday as investors scrambled for the world's most liquid currency amid deepening panic about the coronavirus while the euro nursed losses after the European Central Bank disappointed by not cutting rates.
The greenback held gains against most currencies after a blowout in swap spreads showed investors are facing a shortage of dollars as equity markets plunged on fears about the economic impact of the flu-like virus.
The ECB on Thursday unveiled a stimulus package that provides loans to banks with rates as low as minus-0.75% and increases bond purchases.
The Federal Reserve moved to provide $1.5 trillion in short-term liquidity and changed the durations of Treasuries it buys, but money markets show investors expect the Fed will have to go even further to restore calm to financial markets.
Italy, which has become Europe's hot spot for coronavirus infections, has effectively put its entire country on lockdown to try to slow the virus.
Investors have so far expressed disappointment with the government response to rising infections in the United States, and traders warn there could be more disruptions in a broad range of financial markets.
""Risk off used to benefit the yen, but now we see that risk off is supporting the dollar,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
""We are in panic mode, because we don't know how far stocks will fall.""
The euro (EUR=EBS) traded at $1.1182, following a 0.72% decline on Thursday in the wake of the ECB decision. For the week the common currency was on course for a 0.9% decline.
Against the pound the dollar held steady at $1.2544 in Asia on Friday, but that followed its biggest one-day gain against sterling since July 2016. The dollar was up 3.8% against sterling this week, its best performance since October 2016.
The greenback was also strong against the Swiss franc , trading at 0.9456, headed for a 0.9% weekly gain.
The ECB rolled out yet another stimulus package on Thursday to help fight off the coronavirus pandemic but did not join its counterparts in the United States and Britain by cutting rates.
Investors, who had bet the ECB could cut rates at least 10 basis points and possibly more, were disappointed.
ECB President Christine Lagarde also aggravated a market selloff by saying it was not the central bank's job to close the spread between the borrowing costs of various members, comments which she later tried to roll back.
Authorities are rushing to introduce travel bans, extra financial liquidity and monetary easing as the rapid spread of the virus across the world slams the brakes on the global economy.The dollar rose 0.34% to 105.01 yen on Friday, but was still on course for its third weekly decline.
With signs of financial stress emerging across different markets, the New York Federal Reserve said it would make the money available in three tranches of $500 billion each and that it would start purchasing a broader range of U.S. Treasury securities.
The Fed meets next week and many analysts now expect the central bank to chop its own target policy rate, quite possibly to zero, and give markets new guidance about how it plans to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus.
Cross-currency basis swap spreads for the yen and the pound blew out on Thursday in what traders say is a sign of a dollar shortage.
Highlighting the sense of crisis, senior officials from the Group of Seven talked on Thursday and confirmed they will cooperate closely as equities tumble and corporate bond spreads widen.
The Canadian dollar eased slightly to C$1.3939 against the greenback, approaching a four-year low.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife has tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said. Trudeau is not showing any symptoms but will stay in isolation for 14 days, according to his office.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar slid in another seismic shift to price in more U.S. interest rate cuts on Thursday, as President Donald Trump sapped market confidence with a coronavirus plan light on details.
The greenback dropped as far as 1% to 103.32 yen , fell as much as 0.6% to $1.1333 against the euro (EUR=) and lost 0.6% to the safe-haven Swiss franc .
Riskier currencies were punished as the fearful mood sent the Australian dollar down 0.6% and the South Korean won skidding 1% , and losing even more ground to the rising yen.
Trump announced on Wednesday a ban on travellers from 26 European countries entering the United States for a month.
He unveiled economic steps to counter the virus but his address from the Oval Office was light on medical measures beyond assurances that ""the virus has no chance against us"".
""The market was looking for more,"" said Moh Siong Sim, currency strategist at the Bank of Singapore.
""A travel ban is part of the solution, but the more important parts are still missing. They are really the public health measures: Paid sick leave, free testing, free treatment,"" he said.
""The market is right now looking for perhaps more action from the Fed, given the disappointment from the White House.""
Indeed, futures markets reacted swiftly. They are now pricing in the U.S. Federal Reserve moving the lower end of its benchmark funding band to zero when it meets next week.
""The deflationary shock that we had assumed would trigger a U.S. entry into the zero-yield world is turning out to be a combo of trade war, oil price war and COVID-19 virus,"" J.P. Morgan's long-term strategists Jan Loeys and Shiny Kundu said in a note.
""(There are) close to even odds now of an official U.S. recession this year.""
Trump's address came with markets already in turmoil amid a string of increasingly dire news on the coronavirus.

Australia on Wednesday announced an $11.4 billion stimulus package including wage subsidies and cash payments to small businesses - though the Aussie slid further with the glum mood and growing recession fears. [AUD/]
Investors are now waiting to see how aggressively the European Central Bank acts at its meeting later on Thursday.
Traders expect a cut to the main deposit rate by 10 basis points. But it is no certainty since rates are already at a record-low -0.5% and further cuts could hurt bank margins and so squeeze lending.
A press conference is due at 1230 GMT in Frankfurt, after the monetary policy meeting. The euro steadied around $1.1296 in the meantime.
On Wednesday, the Bank of England slashed interest rates by 0.5 percentage point, though there are doubts the outsized move will be enough to fight the virus' impact.
The British pound last stood at $1.2803 , near this week's low.
""There's a sense to which currency markets are going to reward the currencies of countries that are seen to be using whatever space they've got for easier fiscal and monetary policy,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.
""(But) even if the ECB wheel out a cocktail of lower rates, stepped up QE, more long-term ... in itself, that's not going to inspire a huge amount of confidence that the eurozone economy is going to escape recession. The hope would be that we'll have something more tangible on the fiscal side sooner rather than later."""

The rupee weakened as much as 1% to 74.3387 per dollar on Thursday to near its record low of 74.4825, a level last seen in October 2018. Sovereign bonds declined.
The rupee has been Asia’s worst-performing currency this month after the seizure of Yes Bank, India’s fourth-largest private lender, by the central bank added to fears fueled by the spread of coronavirus cases in the country. The government late Wednesday suspended most visas in a bid to halt the spread of the virus as the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic.
India’s action came as U.S. President Donald Trump suspended all travel from Europe, excluding the U.K., and the WHO urged governments to step up containment efforts as the number of worldwide cases topped 124,000 and deaths exceeded 4,600. India currently has 60 confirmed cases.
Traders have been citing attempts by the Reserve Bank of India to smoothen the rupee’s slide in the past few sessions. The central bank is sitting on record forex reserves of $482 billion, thanks to its continued purchases in the currency markets over the past few years.

The ban would apply to countries in the Schengen economic and travel zone, while UK and Ireland would be exempted. Also, goods are not included in the ban.

Swings in the yen climbed to an 11-year high this week, suggesting that policy makers could have stepped in as the currency surged to the strongest since October 2016. The rapid advance may have unsettled Japanese authorities but market players think there’s little point in trying to stand in the way.
Options are pricing in a 49% chance that the currency will rally to 100 within three months. Unless it sells the yen, the Bank of Japan would be “almost powerless to stop this,” according to Pepperstone Group Ltd.
“The demand for put vol suggests traders still expect volatility to stay with us and promote the yen as our top safe haven currency,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne. “The market does not see this as over by any means and movement is the base case.”
Japan’s currency climbed to 101.19 per dollar this week, the strongest since October 2016, as a slump in oil prices added to concerns over the global fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. A Ministry of Finance official said volatility in markets isn’t desirable and it’s necessary to continue watching the moves closely.
The Bank of Japan, which conducts intervention operations on behalf of the ministry, hasn’t been in the currency market since November 2011. In October that year, the yen appreciated to a record high of 75.35.
Selling the yen may draw the attention of the U.S. Treasury Department, which has already placed Japan on its currency watch list. Intervention should be reserved only for “very exceptional circumstances with appropriate prior consultations,” the department said in the report issued in January.
“Intervention appears difficult to implement unless the forex rate has moved to an extreme level,” Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., wrote in a report Tuesday. “While the Japanese government may point to intervention as a check on highly volatile FX movements, it likely would not be an easy task to obtain agreement from the U.S. and other countries.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar resumed its descent against the safe-haven Japanese yen and the Swiss franc on Wednesday as investors worried over how much governments and central banks can do to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus epidemic.
The moves mirrored falls in U.S. equity futures and U.S. bond yields in Asian trade on Wednesday, as the spread of the virus in major economies threatens to brake business activity and curb consumer spending.
The dollar lost 0.8% to 104.67 yen , down more than a full yen from Tuesday's high of 105.915.
The dollar had fallen to as low as 101.18 on Monday. While Japan may already be in recession, its currency normally rises at times of major financial market stress because of the country's current account surplus and its net creditor status.
The Swiss franc gained 0.45% to 0.9358 franc per dollar while the euro also rose 0.5% to $1.1336 (EUR=).
The dollar had jumped on Tuesday as investors hoped global monetary policymakers will launch further stimulus plans aimed at bolstering economies hit by trade and travel disruptions.
But a lack of clarity on what Washington will do has kept many investors on guard.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will ask Congress for a payroll tax cut and other ""very major"" stimulus moves, but the details remain unclear.
""It is too early to say the market sentiment has turned positive. Yesterday's rebound in the dollar and in risk assets is a type of a rebound you often see in a downtrend,"" said Shinji Ishimaru, senior currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
""In addition to economic measures, the focus will be on how much the U.S. can contain the infections to keep the economy going. That is a very big unknown,"" he said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Tuesday 696 new cases of coronavirus, an increase of 224 from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by six to 25.
Investors are also expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by at least 0.5 percentage point at its policy review next week, in addition to its emergency rate reduction earlier this month.
It is not clear if such a move could boost investors' risk tolerance after global equities had tumbled following the Fed's surprise rate cut just over a week ago, market players said.
But that will surely diminish the dollar's yield advantage over other major currencies, which has been a main driver of the dollar's strength in the past few years.
Financial markets are also betting the European Central Bank will cut its interest rates by 0.10 percentage on Thursday. Still with interest rates at minus 0.50%, many investors think the ECB has limited room for additional cuts."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded on Tuesday afters huge losses against the yen, the euro and the Swiss franc, as investors turned hopeful that global policymakers would introduce stimulus to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The moves helped reverse Monday's gyrations, although at 104 yen per dollar the Japanese currency was not back above the 105 seen before this week.
The dollar started to rise as U.S. stock futures rose and bond yields gained, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday about economic measures in response to the virus.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also said the White House would meet with bank executives this week in a sign the U.S. government would roll out measures to cope with the virus.
Analysts said it was too early to call a bottom in the dollar, which plunged on Monday after a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia triggered the biggest daily rout in oil prices since the 1991 Gulf War.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar rose 0.2% to 95.613 (=USD). It rallied 1.9% against the yen to 104.28 , considerably higher than Monday's 101.18 low.
The yen also wobbled against major crosses, such as the euro (EURJPY=EBS) and the Australian dollar (AUDJPY=EBS), after Bank of Japan officials indicated they were ready to ramp up stimulus if necessary before a policy meeting next week.
""It seems pretty clear that owning the yen still works when bond yields are falling, volatility is spiking and risk appetite is disappearing. So today's a bad day for the yen as we reverse all those sentiments,"" said Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""However, that opens up the opportunity to get yen longs on before we exit the eye of the storm and feel its fury again.""
The euro dropped 0.4% versus the dollar to $1.1385 (EUR=EBS).
The dollar rose 1.2% to 0.9361 Swiss franc on Tuesday, then fell to 0.9299 francs after three days of heavy selling pushed it to its lowest in almost five years. Data suggest the Swiss National Bank is now intervening to weaken its currency.
Against the pound , the U.S. currency rose 0.5% to $1.3067.
Commodity-linked currencies that tumbled on Monday following the crash in oil prices recovered from record lows. The Norwegian crown added 1.6% versus the euro to 10.796 (EURNOK=D3), still off the 10.4 levels seen last week.
The Canadian dollar rose 0.3% to C$1.3658 .
The Russian rouble gained 3.6% and the Mexican peso 0.5%.
Volatility surged in FX markets in recent days, but analysts said it could get much worse depending on upcoming economic data.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government will work closely with the Bank of Japan to support the “very unstable” markets.
“Markets are making nervous movements amid uncertainty over the global economic outlook. Based on agreements made among G7 and G20 nations, the government will work closely with the BOJ and authorities of other countries to respond appropriately,” Abe said in a meeting with ruling party executives on Tuesday.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was up 1.1% to 95.885. 
Overnight, Trump said he plans to unveil “very substantial relief”, including payroll-tax cuts, amid the spreading coronavirus.
However, Traders remained on edge amid growing concerns about the economic impact of the virus and a sharp plunge in oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia threaten to begin a price war. 
On the coronavirus front, The World Health Organization (WHO) said the threat of a pandemic is “very real,” although there seems to be signs that countries including China and Singapore have largely controlled the virus spreading. 
WHO cautioned that “In many countries, it will get worse before it gets better.”
In Europe, the number of cases in Italy soared by 25% to 9,172 on Monday, while cases in Spain almost doubled. Germany reported its first two deaths.
Globally, confirmed cases surpassed 110,000, and deaths exceeded 3,800, according to the latest figures released by WHO.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean peso closed at a historic low on Monday, falling 1.82% to 841.50 to the dollar as fears over the global coronavirus outbreak and widespread protests continued to rattle the copper-rich South American nation.
The peso has been slammed by volatility linked to the impact of the worldwide spread of the virus, which initially broke out in China. Continuing protests over inequality and social injustice have also weighed on the economy and the currency.
Finance Minister Ignacio Briones told reporters the virus was a ""relevant shock"" to the Chilean economy, but that the world's top copper producer was able to respond if necessary.
""There have been volatile movements in international financial markets that have impacted us, but the government and the country of Chile have the mechanisms to respond,"" Briones said.
He warned against ""overreacting to these effects from international markets.""
Chile's central bank said in a statement it had ""instruments"" to deal with the situation and extraordinary facilities to bolster liquidity in dollars and pesos, which could be adjusted to the needs of the economy.
""The exchange intervention program is still in force and can be reactivated in the face of a resurgence of volatility of internal origin,"" the bank said.
""Monetary policy is in a clearly expansive provision and has space to react to changes in the outlook for inflation.""
Chile's economy is largely driven by exports, ranging from copper to salmon, wine and fruits and vegetables. The virus outbreak has hit Chinese demand for copper, Chile's biggest export.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank on Monday stepped into the foreign exchange market to prop up the peso after the currency plummeted to an all-time low on the back of collapsing global oil prices and fears over the economic impact of coronavirus.
Banxico, as Mexico's central bank is known, said the country's currency commission increased the size of its program of foreign exchange auctions to $30 billion from $20 billion to ""maintain an orderly operation of the exchange market.""
The commission will keep evaluating market conditions and if necessary ""take additional actions,"" Banxico said in a statement.
The peso's interbank exchange rate plunged 14% in intraday trading on Monday, but trimmed losses especially after the Banxico statement to close down 3.7%.
The bank's monetary policy board has two weeks to decide whether to lower interest rates for a sixth consecutive time - a move seen as less likely after the rout in the peso, which hit an all-time low of 22.929 per dollar on Monday.
Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut on Tuesday, the markets baked in a matching 50 basis point cut by Banxico at its next monetary policy meeting on March 26.
However, several analysts now predict a cut will not materialize, with higher-than-expected inflation fueling their doubts. Others adopted a wait-and-see approach.
Data published on Monday showed Mexican consumer prices rose 3.70% in the year through February, drifting further above the central bank's 3.0% target rate.
While the weaker peso, notching its fifth straight day of losses on Monday, could help lift Mexico's exports by making them more competitive, an ""environment of weakening global demand may blunt that effect,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.

Some analysts still see Banxico lowering rates, though few expect a 50 basis point cut.
""Banxico is likely to respond to Fed cuts by cutting its overnight rate target, but by less than the Fed,"" said Carlos Capistran, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) economist, noting that the U.S. central bank could cut another 50 basis points in March.
One reason Banxico might hold back from lowering rates in line with the Fed is fear that the peso's depreciation could fan inflation, Capistran said.
Such inflationary pressure could be politically damaging and hurt middle class voters President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador needs, said Duncan Wood, director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute in Washington.
""Imports coming into Mexico, they're going to get so much more expensive,"" he said.
Coronavirus has arrived after the Mexican economy shrank 0.1% in 2019, its first contraction in a decade.
""A much weaker peso is bad for the economy,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said. ""The sharp drop of the peso adds to already elevated macro uncertainty.""
Some of Lopez Obrador's policies, Mexico's trade relationship with the United States, and the U.S.-China trade dispute have helped drag down the economy.
The peso will rebound, he said on Monday. ""I'm optimistic because we have healthy public finances, good reserves and no deficit."""

The pound has also been supporting by growing bets the Federal Reserve will be forced to deliver big rate cuts to cushion the impact from the novel coronavirus compared to its peers like the Bank of England, which has limited room to ease.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecast that the Fed will slash interest rate by 50 basis points when policymakers gather on March 17-18 and again at their April 28-29 meeting, to a range of 0% to 0.25%, which was last seen in 2015.
But unlike the Fed, the Bank of England has less room to maneuver.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect the Bank of England will announce a base rate cut of 50 basis points in April, while UBS believes the BoE will ease by a more modest 25 bps.
Still, the overarching moves for cable could be dominated by Brexit after the UK and EU kicked off trade talks last week."

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar fell 3% against the Japanese yen and commodity-linked currencies tanked on Monday, as a 30% crash in the oil price and tumbling stock markets panicked investors and sent currency prices swinging wildly.
A gauge of volatility in the euro/dollar market - the world's most-traded currency pair - shot to its highest since April 2017 as the euro surged more than 1% to its strongest since January 2019.
Dollar-yen one-month implied volatility surged to an 11-year high at 8.8%  as the dollar slid to its weakest since 2016.
Investors are dumping dollars because of the collapse in U.S. Treasury yields. The benchmark yield is at 0.47%, after trading above 1% a few days earlier, as traders shed risky assets and head for the safety of government bond markets.

That unnerved investors already rattled by more than a weak of wild moves in markets, as they struggled to assess the economic damage caused by the coronavirus.
""Financial markets have suffered a rude awakening to notions that volatility was a thing of the past. We're now seeing the kind of market dislocation not witnessed since the 2008-09 global financial crisis,"" ING analysts said, describing the set-up as a ""perfect storm"" for currency markets.
""This all conspires to deliver an extreme flight to safety, into the likes of the JPY and the CHF,"" they wrote.
In hectic trade, the dollar fell 3% against the yen to 101.58 , its lowest in more than three years. The euro (EUR=) was last up 1% at $1.1408 after earlier touching $1.1495.
The dollar index dropped to its weakest since September 2018 before recovering somewhat to trade at 95.181, down 0.3% (=USD).
The Swiss franc added nearly 1% against the dollar  but was flat versus the euro (EURCHF=EBS).
Some of the biggest moves were in currencies linked to oil prices.
Norway's crown tumbled to record lows. The euro added nearly 5% to 10.997 (EURNOK=D3) and the dollar gained more than 3% to 9.5455 crowns . Canada's dollar dropped 1.3% to C$1.3606 . The Russian rouble  and Mexican peso  each fell as much as 6% against the dollar. 
The Australian  and New Zealand  dollars fell nearly 2%.
""It is totally wild,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX Asia at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Wealth Management in Singapore. ""This is not a train I want to be getting in front of, and how long it continues and where it goes from here is going to depend on how the situation evolves.""
Further stock decline could drive even more gains in funding currencies, she said.
So far, the yen is headed for its largest three-day gain since the 2008 financial crisis. It is up 9.4% in a dozen trading days.
The gain is bad news for exporters and has raised concerns among policymakers in Japan. A senior finance official warned that authorities were closely watching trade. 
In times of low volatility - and currency market volatility has been at or near record lows for several years - investors borrow heavily in low- or negative-yielding currencies like the euro and yen to buy higher-yielding FX elsewhere.

Sudden risk aversion and volatility send investors panicking to reverse those positions, causing wild moves in currencies.

Investing.com - The Japanese yen surged against the U.S. dollar on Monday in Asia as stock markets were in a sea of red amid plunging oil prices. 
The USD/JPY pair lost 2.4% to 102.79 by 12:01 AM ET (04:01 GMT). The yen jumped more than 3% earlier in the day and was near its highest level in three years. 
Zach Pandl, the Goldman Sachs’s co-head of global foreign exchange and emerging market strategy, told Bloomberg TV last week that the yen could rally as far as 95 if global markets stay disorderly for the next couple of months.
The worsening coronavirus outbreak and a collapse in oil prices were cited as major tailwind for the safe-haven currency today. 
Oil prices saw a whopping 30% losses earlier in the day after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, vowed to slash its prices while raise its production level significantly. 
Meanwhile, the continuing spread of the new coronavirus also prompted investors to sell riskier assets and a scramble into safe-haven assets. Global confirmed cases increased to almost 107,000 as of Sunday, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization.
Citing an unnamed senior Japanese finance ministry official, Reuters said Japan authorities sees “nervous moves” in the currency market and that officials from the Bank of Japan and the financial watchdog is scheduled to discuss financial markets. 
Asian markets traded sharply lower today, with Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 down more than 7%, while other major indices also plunging between 4 to 6%. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.8%. 
The AUD/USD pair lost 1.5% to 1.3639. The NZD/USD pair slid 1.2% to 0.6274.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A senior Japanese finance ministry official on Monday warned against investors pushing up the yen rapidly, saying that authorities would watch market moves with a greater sense of urgency amid the global spread of the coronavirus.
The spread of the epidemic has prompted heavy selling of riskier assets by investors and a scramble into assets such as the yen which are perceived to be safer havens during time of financial distress.
Japanese policymakers tend to talk down rises in the currency, fearing that sharp appreciation would hurt competitiveness of the country's goods overseas and further damage the export-led economy, which is teetering on the edge of recession.
""Nervous moves are seen"" in the currency market, the official told reporters, after the yen broke through 104 per dollar and rose as high as 103.52 per dollar.
He added that he would consider whether to hold a meeting with officials from the Bank of Japan and the financial watchdog to discuss financial markets.
The number of people infected with the coronavirus topped 107,000 across the world as the outbreak reached more countries and caused more economic disruption.
Japan last intervened in foreign exchange markets in 2011 to stem yen gains in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster triggered by large earthquakes and tsunami. Tokyo has stayed out of the market since then.
Japanese officials say they stick to an agreement of Group of Seven and Group of 20 economies that excess volatility and disorderly market moves damage the economy, a tacit agreement they interpret as allowing action against sharp market swings."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost of raising U.S. dollar funds in the Japanese and European currency swaps market has surged this week, suggesting increased demand for the greenback and heightened funding stress related to the fast-spreading coronavirus.
The cross-currency basis swap, or relative premium for swapping euro or yen LIBOR for dollar LIBOR, has widened across all maturities this week. For instance, the one-year yen cross rate had grown to nearly -50 basis points on Friday, the highest since mid-December 2017.
In the euro/dollar cross-currency market, the one-year cross rate was a little less elevated at -18 basis points on Friday, pulling back from -21 basis points hit on Monday, the widest since September 2019.
""What this is suggesting is that it is more expensive for institutions to raise dollars in their own currencies and swap them back into dollars,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
""Given the risk-off backdrop, there is more demand for dollars and that's creating more scarcity,"" he added.
The number of people infected with coronavirus across the world surpassed 100,000 on Friday as the outbreak reached more countries and the economic damage intensified, with business districts beginning to empty and stock markets tumbling.
Cross currency swaps and FX swaps allow investors to raise funds in a particular currency, such as the dollar, from other funding currencies such as the euro. For example, an institution which has dollar funding needs can raise euros in euro funding markets and convert the proceeds into dollar funding obligations via an FX swap.
To be sure, these are nowhere near the levels seen during the global financial crisis in 2008, or the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011.
Analysts said swap spreads between 30-40 basis points are a warning signal and would be problematic if they get into the 50s area.
One-year swaps widened to record levels during the post-Lehman bankruptcy period in November 2008 when spreads surged to -102 basis points. That led to the introduction of currency swap lines between central banks, partly dampening the pressure on short-term dollar financing.
Since cross-currency and FX swaps are subject to counterparty and credit risks, the pricing of these contracts is affected by perceptions of creditworthiness of the banking system, or external risks than can affect liquidity, analysts said."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble slid past 68 versus the dollar on Friday to fresh 4-month lows as investors sought safe assets amid the aggressive spread of the coronavirus and as oil prices tumbled after an OPEC pact with Russia fell apart.
Moscow refused to support deeper oil cuts to cope with the outbreak of coronavirus and OPEC responded by removing all limits on its own production, sending oil prices into a tailspin and to their lowest since July 2017.
Russian stocks plunged to 18-month lows with volatility plaguing emerging markets as the virus, which has infected more than 100,000 people globally and caused 3,400 deaths, continued to spread rapidly beyond China.
By 1720 GMT, the rouble was 1.1% weaker against the dollar at 68.37 , touching its lowest mark since January 2019 on the day. Against the euro, the rouble had lost 2% to trade at 77.35 , also a 14-month low.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1), a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 8.2% at $45.9 a barrel, and has now lost around a third of its value this year.
Analysts at BCS Global Markets said this created fiscal problems for the Russian government.
""For Russia's budget to match with the current oil price, the exchange rate must be significantly higher than the current mark,"" they said in a note.
Russia's finance minister said on Thursday Moscow would be able to cope with a drop in oil prices.
Risk sentiment swung again on Thursday, said VTB Capital analysts, as markets returned their focus to the spreading fallout of the coronavirus, with numerous announcements of new travel restrictions and event cancellations.
Russia on Thursday evening canceled its flagship annual St Petersburg International Economic Forum, which was scheduled for June, as a precaution.
Russian stock indexes were at 18-month lows, hampered by increased risk aversion.
The dollar-denominated RTS index (IRTS) was down 5.0% at 1,258.0 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index (IMOEX) was 3.5% lower at 2719.5 points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The greenback faces the same fate as many travelers returning home from China and other coronavirus hot spots.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun quarantining physical dollars that it repatriates from Asia before recirculating them in the U.S. financial system as a precautionary measure against spreading the virus, a Fed spokesperson told Reuters.
She said regional Fed banks that help manage the money supply will set aside shipments of dollars from Asia for seven to 10 days before processing and redistributing them to financial institutions. The policy, first reported by Reuters, was implemented on Feb. 21, the official said.
The outbreak originated in China and more than 100,000 people have been infected in over 85 countries, according to a Reuters tally based on statements from health ministries and government officials.
According to the CDC, it ""may be possible"" to transmit the virus through objects that have had direct contact with it, but person-to-person contact is the main means of spreading the disease. The CDC recommends U.S. residents returning from China and other high-risk countries stay home for 14 days.
The World Health Organization, however, has been much more cautious on risks posed by currency notes, advising consumers to use contactless payments whenever possible, according to several British media reports.
As the global reserve currency, U.S. dollars are the most widely distributed notes in the world with around $1.75 trillion worth of cash in circulation globally, according to the Fed. Much that is circulated overseas, particularly in Asia where the dollar is often stronger than local currencies.
It is also filthy. A 2014 study by researchers at New York University identified 3,000 types of bacteria on dollar bills due to how widely and frequently they change hands.
The U.S. central bank has not gone as far as its counterparts in China and Korea, which have ordered local currency notes to be disinfected with ultraviolet light or destroyed altogether. But Fed officials are in regular contact with the CDC and State Department regarding the spread of the virus and are prepared to add other regions to its quarantine list, the spokesperson said.
The 12 Fed banks from Richmond, Virginia to San Francisco are responsible for managing the supply of dollars and coins, accepting deposits of excess cash from banks across the world while doling out currency to institutions that request it. Some overseas banks ship their excess dollars back to the United States on commercial flights.
The reserve banks process the currency they receive, including removing damaged notes from circulation and identifying counterfeit bills. It takes between five and 60 days for the Fed to process currency, with higher value notes being processed most quickly, the San Francisco Fed says on its website.
On average, the Fed distributes $34 billion in paper notes every year, according to the San Francisco Fed.",,,,,

Investing.com -- The dollar extended its slide in early trading in Europe on Friday, as the prospect of collapsing U.S. interest rates continued to erode its appeal vis-à-vis its peers.
Relatively high nominal returns on dollar assets, whether bonds or stocks, have been the key to the dollar’s strength over the last couple of years. But with the U.S. equity market in retreat and bond yields collapsing under the expectation of further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, that argument no longer holds. The release of the U.S. labor market report later, which is expected to show a clear slowdown in hiring last month, is unlikely to change much in that regard.
By 2:50 AM ET (7:50 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies was down 0.3% at a two-month low of 96.520, on course for a decline of 1.6% for the week.
Its biggest losses were against the kiwi, which rebounded 0.5% amid tentative signs that the Chinese economy is picking itself off the floor. However, it also fell against the safe haven yen and Swiss franc.
USD/JPY fell below 106 for the first time since August during Asian trading and was down 0.2% at 105.89. Zach Pandl, the Goldman Sachs’s co-head of global foreign exchange and emerging market strategy, told Bloomberg TV that the yen could rally as far as 95 if global markets stay disorderly for the next couple of months. USD/CHF fell 0.1% to 0.9443.
The euro also hit its highest against the dollar since August, amid concerns that the European Central Bank can’t do anything to stop the differential between euro and dollar interest rates falling further. The ECB’s governing council meets next week, against a backdrop of expectations that are limited to a 10 basis-point cut in the deposit rate and some tweaking of the bank’s long-term refinancing operations.
The ECB is likely to ‘look through’ a surprisingly strong rise in German factory orders in January, which predated the scare over the coronavirus and in any case owed much to volatile elements such as aerospace.
EUR/USD rose as high as $1.1249 before retracing to $1.1234, roughly flat from late Thursday but still up nearly 1.9% this week.
The weak tone in the dollar also helped sterling to its highest level in a week, ahead of the government’s annual budget next week. Sterling has been supported by promises of big increases in public spending that would – all other things being equal – have removed the need for further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England.  Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics expect a relatively modest widening of the fiscal deficit to 2.4% of gross domestic product from 2.0% in the current fiscal year.
“We expect the Chancellor to be relatively cautious this year, in order to preserve his firepower for 2021, when the economic costs of Brexit will seriously start to mount,” said Pantheon analyst Samuel Toombes. GBP/USD was up 0.2% at $1.2974."

Zach Pandl, the firm’s co-head of global foreign exchange and emerging market strategy, told Bloomberg TV his long-term fair value estimate for the yen is 95 per dollar. It traded around 106 in early Friday trading.
“The yen has substantial further upside,” Pandl said. “It is one of the few classic safe-haven assets where you can still say it is relatively undervalued.”
That would extend a run that’s taken the Japanese currency to a six-month high against the greenback. Safe-haven assets from the yen to gold and Treasuries lured flows amid the spread of coronavirus cases as investors fret the impact on the global economy could be more severe than initially thought.
The move may take time, Pandl said, without laying out a time line for the appreciation to unfold. “I don’t think it’s going there tomorrow, but I do think it is a realistic target if we have a very disorderly period for global markets over the next couple of months.”
Any further appreciation of Japan’s currency won’t go unnoticed by the country’s central bank but it will be hard to readdress given its limitations, Pandl said.
“The Bank of Japan may step in to try to protect that at some point but there’s relatively little that they can do,” he said in the interview in New York. “Monetary policy is going to be very difficult to ease and direct intervention in the currency is a bit controversial in this environment where we’re still talking about trade policy, about currency policy with the U.S.”
The yen’s fall through 112 per dollar in recent weeks had initially flummoxed some investors as the move raised doubts on the currency’s safe-haven status. That slide quickly gave way to strength, which pushed it below 106 per dollar in Thursday’s session.
“I don’t really buy the idea that the yen’s safe-haven behavior has changed,” Pandl said. “The last few weeks it’s performed right as expected as equity markets have weakened.”"

Still, the overall job market remains solid and weather was still a bit warmer than usual last month, as well.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar nursed savage losses against the yen and euro on Friday as a plunge in U.S. yields to record lows wiped out the currency's single greatest attraction for investors - higher interest rates.
Mounting fears over the fallout from the coronavirus has driven a truly tectonic shift in expectations for U.S. rates as markets wager the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by 50 basis points for a second time this month.
The resulting collapse in Treasury yields has been the death of one of the most popular carry trades globally - borrowing at negative rates in the euro and yen to buy U.S. assets.
""Select USD pairs like EUR/USD are turning because of a dramatic and decisive shift in U.S. rate expectations and related spreads,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""The USD has lost the single most important source of its over-valuation, a strong carry advantage,"" he added, warning this could end a dollar uptrend that has lasted since mid-2018.
In particular, were the euro to close above the December peak of $1.1239, it would breach a down channel from August 2018 and signal a clear break of the bull trend.
The single currency was almost there, being up at $1.1226 (EUR=) on Friday having surged 0.9% overnight and a world away from the February trough of $1.0775. It was already up 1.9% for the week which would be the largest such gain since June 2017.
There were lots of other miserable milestones, with the dollar sinking to a six-month low on the yen at 105.96 having shed 1.2% overnight. The next bear targets were 105.72 and 104.44, lows from August and September last year.
It also sank to a two-year trough against the Swiss franc at 0.9443 francs , and was down 2% for the week so far.
The yen, euro and Swiss franc are backed by countries that run strong external surpluses, while Japan has the added advantage of being the world's largest creditor nation.
Those safe-haven attributes had grown in importance as U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) tumbled to just 0.91%, a drop of 66 basis points in just 11 sessions.
Fed fund futures were also pricing in more than 80 basis points of further easing by year end.
Yet the dollar was not down and out everywhere, as it still held safe haven status compared to emerging market currencies and those exposed to commodities.
That left it holding gains on the Canadian , Australian and New Zealand dollars , along with a raft of currencies across Asia."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are grappling with conflicting signals on emerging market currencies as they weigh easing by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks against the economic damage already wrought by the coronavirus outbreak. 
The MSCI International Emerging Market Currency Index pared a portion of its 2020 losses in recent days as the Fed, Bank of Australia and other developed-country central banks unleashed rate cuts aimed at cushioning their economies from coronavirus-fueled slowdowns. The measure is still down more than 2% on the year.
(GRAPHIC: MSCI International EM Currency Index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2903/2868/MSC1%20EM%20%20Index.png)
Emerging market bulls typically welcome lower rates in the developed world as they boost the attractiveness of developing countries’ assets and help fuel the carry trade, a strategy in which investors borrow in low-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones. 
Some are concerned that it may be too early to bet on the battered asset class, with the coronavirus outbreak threatening to weigh on growth in the United States and Europe as it accelerates outside of China.
Data from the Institute of International Finance showed that February portfolio flows to emerging markets were down nearly 90% from the previous month, at $3.4 billion, illustrating how investors soured on the boom-or-bust asset class as fears grew over the coronavirus outbreak. 
Returns on carry trade strategies, meanwhile, are down 2% since January 31 after notching a 6.1% gain in 2019, according to an index from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) measuring returns on 15 emerging market currencies. Few may be willing to jump back into the strategy if uncertainty over the coronavirus continues to shadow global growth.
""You're getting a little more carry in emerging markets … but there is so much uncertainty about the impact of the virus on growth that people won't want to be long risky currencies,"" said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management. ""It's just not a good place to be.""
The asset manager exited bets on emerging markets before the coronavirus outbreak gained momentum and is now betting on the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen to rise against other currencies.
Some of the declines in emerging market currencies have been dramatic, rivaling recent drops in the S&P 500 and other stock markets. The Brazilian real - the world's worst-performing traded currency year-to-date - has fallen more than 13% this year, with the Chilean peso and South African rand not far behind. All three nations, like many other emerging market economies, count China as one of the top destinations for their commodity exports.
""We're obviously concerned that... we're headed toward recession,"" said Emily Weis, emerging market strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) in Boston. ""Carry (trades) certainly won't be my favorite play in a risk-off environment.""
Investors in emerging market currencies may also face the risk that the central banks of developing countries will embark on their own rate cuts as they try to shield their economies from a potential global slowdown. That could weigh on their currencies by narrowing the gap in yields between assets in emerging markets and those in developed ones.
Edward Glossop, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London, said he expects central banks in much of emerging Asia to continue cutting interest rates. He anticipates additional rate reductions in Brazil, India, Mexico, Poland and South Africa.
Bank Negara Malaysia already reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.5% in March, bringing cumulative easing this year to half a percentage point.
The Reserve Bank of India earlier in the week said it, too, is ready to take appropriate action with respect to the coronavirus and analysts said one of those actions may include a rate cut."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's currency is weakening so quickly the central bank may soon be forced to set aside its free-market principles and sell dollar reserves to halt the slide.
Market volatility is rising, by some measures back to where it was when the central bank last sold foreign exchange reserves in November, and some analysts say the real's near-daily drops to new lows are now undermining confidence in the currency.
Policymakers can reasonably say the real's 14% decline this year is a natural function of falling interest rates, that all emerging currencies are under heavy pressure and the selloff is not fueling inflation expectations in Brazil.
Not that the central bank is sitting idly by. In recent weeks it sold some $6.5 billion in the currency swaps market, where hedging demand from asset managers and investors is strongest.
But these actions have failed to slow the real's plunge, far less reverse it. The real weakened past 4.66 per dollar on Thursday, bringing its depreciation this week to 4%, one of its biggest weekly falls in years. (BRBY)

The previously unthinkable level of 5.00 per dollar is now on the horizon.
""I think they need to come with a program, perhaps announce a budget like $20 to $30 billion, either swaps or dollar reserves,"" said Carlos Kawall, director at Asa Bank in Sao Paulo. ""They should announce that they are ready to do both.""
Alexandre Song, portfolio manager at Macro Capital in Sao Paulo, warned that the longer the central bank lets the depreciation continue, the more traders will test its resolve and force it into an even greater policy response.
""It is clear that the small interventions in the swaps market are not working, and the real's weakness is now becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Song said. ""It's probably now time that the central bank has to start thinking of proper intervention.""
A central bank spokesman told Reuters any intervention, whether in the derivatives or spot market, is determined by ""market conditions.""
VOLATILITY RISING
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto has said repeatedly this year that the real is a free-floating currency, implying a reluctance to forcefully determine its path or level.
He and Bruno Serra, deputy governor for monetary policy and head of the bank's foreign reserves policy, are from trading backgrounds and firm believers in letting free markets determine asset prices. University of Chicago-educated Economy Minister Paulo Guedes is renowned for his laissez-faire economic views.
With Brazilian interest rates at a record low 4.25% — and likely to go even lower as the economic outlook dims — a weak exchange rate is simply ""the new normal,"" according to Guedes.
Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida on Thursday said exchange rate policy is the sole responsibility of the central bank, adding that the Treasury and the monetary authority never take coordinated action on the real.
As reluctant as Campos Neto and his colleagues might be to tap the central bank's $360 billion stockpile of FX reserves, the market might force their hand.
Implied three-month volatility on the dollar/real exchange rate rose to 12.5% on Thursday. That is higher than November, when the central bank last sold dollar reserves, and is closing in on the 14% in August, when the central bank unleashed its first dollar-selling intervention in over a decade.

Tony Volpon, chief Brazil economist at UBS in Sao Paulo and former central bank director, said FX intervention is a limited resource that policymakers will only resort to when they feel they must.
""But the central bank doesn't want to lose control of the currency. It has to keep an eye on financial stability,"" Volpon said. ""They need to maintain an orderly FX market."""

The currency fell 0.6% to 4.6064 per dollar as traders increased bets policy makers will reduce borrowing costs following the Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut.
Brazil’s central bank said in a statement on Tuesday that it is monitoring the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on financial markets and the wider economy. Markets interpreted the statement as a signal for further rate cuts, sending swap rates and the currency lower.
Brazil’s local swap curve is pricing in chances of a 50 basis-point rate cut at the central bank’s next meeting on March 18, compared with near zero in the prior week. Traders had played down chances of further rate reductions after the central bank suggested in February the easing cycle was over, but resumed bets after the Fed’s bold move.
The real is down 12.5% this year, the worst start since 1999. It’s underperforming peers due to its diminished carry appeal, given that local rates have dropped to a record. Weak growth numbers also weighed on the currency, as well as positioning, since it’s used as a hedge for long positions in stocks and rates."

8:39 AM ET: Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) Communications stock fell 7.3% as the market reined in its expectations for the company after its quarterly earnings report. Zoom’s earnings came in at more than double consensus forecasts, while revenue was also nearly 10% ahead expectations.
Its guidance for the first quarter and full year were also higher than Wall Street’s best guesses, but the stock is prone to profit-taking after rising over 50% in barely a month since the coronavirus outbreak began.
Analysts expect it to cash in on a likely boom in remote meetings as businesses clamp down on travel plans due to the virus.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.4% after the company reiterated its capital spending plans for the next five years, and upholding its forecast of producing 1 million barrels a day from the Permian basin in Texas by 2024. 
Oil and gas stocks in general were under pressure, as doubt prevailed over the ability of OPEC to persuade Russia to sign up to an output cut of 1.5 million barrels a day.

8:47 AM ET: HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) stock fell 2.0% after the maker of printers and other office hardware rejected an improved offer from rival Xerox (NYSE:XRX).
""The Xerox offer would leave our shareholders with an investment in a combined company that is burdened with an irresponsible level of debt and which would subsequently require unrealistic, unachievable synergies that would jeopardize the entire company,"" HP chairman Chip Bergh said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell on Thursday amid expectations of the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further, after slashing them by 50 basis points this week in an emergency move to shield the economy from the effects of coronavirus.
The Fed had mentioned the epidemic 48 times in its latest Beige Book report, suggesting policymakers were highly concerned about the economic damage of the disease.
""The reports in the Beige Book are likely to have been important for the Fed's inter-meeting rate cut,"" said Olle Holmgren, chief strategist at SEB.
Money markets were pricing in another 25 bps cut from the current 1% to 1.25% range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50 bps cut by April.
As a result, the dollar remained close to the two-month low of 1.1214 it reached against the euro on Tuesday, last trading 0.4% lower at 1.1175 (EUR=EBS). The euro also benefited from traders unwinding their carry trade positions, analysts said.
(Graphic: Major currencies vs dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2884/2849/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
""Sharper euro falls could emerge quickly"" if the coronavirus spreads further in the euro zone, said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG. ""Further euro depreciation may follow despite its outperformance of late.""
Versus the safe-haven Japanese yen, the dollar's weakness was more pronounced. Dollar-yen was last down 0.7% at 106.81 , a five-month low.
Low U.S. yields and the prospect of even more monetary easing added pressure to the dollar, though data showing U.S. services activity at a one-year high had pushed it higher against the euro in Asian trading.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's victories in the Democratic primaries also helped the dollar. Biden is considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new regulations than rival Bernie Sanders.
But the coronavirus outbreak weighed more strongly on the dollar and other major currencies. Mainland China reported a rise in new infections on Thursday, deaths are mounting globally, Italy has closed its schools and California has declared a state of emergency as cases there increase.
The Canadian dollar was down 0.1% against the U.S. dollar at 1.3399 , after the Bank of Canada joined the Fed in cutting rates by 50 bps - its largest cut in 10 years - and leaving the door open to further easing. Falling oil prices also put pressure on the loonie.
The Bank of England is leaving rates unchanged for now, and sterling rose to a one-week high of $1.2931 and a three-day high versus the euro of 86.22 pence (EURGBP=D3).
Money markets, however, are pricing in a 25 bps rate cut by the BoE on March 26, incoming Governor Andrew Bailey's first policy meeting.
Traders will be watching later in the day the release of initial jobless claims and factory orders in the U.S. Both data sets are expected to be weaker."

Investing.com - The dollar remained on the back foot on Thursday, weighed down by a combination of expectations for even more monetary easing by the Federal Reserve and very low U.S. yields.
The U.S. dollar index was down 0.27% at 97.04 by 04:53 AM ET (953GMT). The index has shed most of its gains for the year over the last few days, as expectations grew that the Fed would cut rates again in order to stave off the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
The Fed delivered a 50-basis point emergency rate cut on Tuesday, with many traders expecting at least two more such moves in coming months.
Bets that the Fed could cut rates again at its upcoming meeting in March continued to pressure U.S. government bond yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was holding at 1.0% after falling to a record low on Tuesday.
The dollar hit fresh five-month lows against the yen at 106.97, while the euro was  higher against the greenback at 1.1170, not far from a two month high reached earlier in the week.
The dollar had found some support in the previous session after data showing that the U.S. economy was in good shape to face the risks from the virus, with services sector activity jumping to a one-year high in February, while private payrolls gained 183,000.
But while U.S. policy rates, which stand at a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, have more room to fall, many rates in Europe and Japan are already below zero and monetary authorities there are hesitant to lower them much further.
Meanwhile, the British pound held overnight gains after the incoming Bank of England governor said he would wait for more clarity about the virus before moving interest rates, rather than rushing to an emergency cut.
The pound was last at 1.2906 against the dollar and traded at 0.8641 against the euro.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Monetary policy easing in the United States fueled by worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus is endangering the dollar’s years-long rally and giving a boost to currencies around the world.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index (=USD) shed most of its gains for the year over the last few days, as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would ease rates to cushion the U.S. economy from the ripple effects of the a spreading coronavirus outbreak.
The Fed acted on Tuesday, delivering a 50-basis point emergency rate cut, with many traders expecting at least two more such moves in coming months.
But while U.S. policy rates, which stand at a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, have more room to fall, many rates in Europe and Japan are already below zero and monetary authorities there are hesitant to lower them much further.
Officials in those countries have discussed the prospects of using fiscal measures to boost their economies, which some believe could support their currencies, further narrowing the gap in yields that has drawn income-seeking investors to the dollar in recent years.

At the same time, the dollar has been pressured by a powerful rally in the euro fueled by risk-averse investors unwinding carry trades, a strategy that involves borrowing in a low-yielding currency to invest in a higher-yielding one.
The euro zone’s ultra-low interest rates have made the single currency a popular funding vehicle for such strategies, which have become less appealing as market volatility has grown.
Net futures bets against the euro by hedge funds and other speculative traders were at a more than three-year high, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data through the week of Feb. 25.

“Prepare for further dollar weakness,” Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to the firm’s clients.
The firm is recommending that clients bet on the British pound to rise against the U.S. currency, on the belief that the U.K. government is likely to deliver fiscal easing.
A weaker dollar would be a boon for U.S. multinationals that have already taken a hit from the coronavirus’ impact on global business conditions because it makes it less expensive to convert foreign profits into the U.S. currency.
A falling greenback could also soften the coronavirus’ impact on the economies of developing countries, making it easier for them to service their dollar-denominated debt.
The dollar index is down about 2.5% from its year high. It remains up about 10% from a low hit in early 2018.
Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at Australian FX-service provider AxiCorp, is recommending betting on the Japanese yen and euro to rise against the U.S. currency as the Fed cuts rates further.
Fed funds futures for June 2020 on Friday implied traders are pricing in an 84% chance of at least a 25 basis point rate cut at that month’s meeting.
“With the Fed cutting again and the ECB limited in scope, U.S. dollar weakens,” Innes said. ""I'm more committed to dollar short than at any time in the last tow years.”
Other investors, however, have noted that expectations that the outbreak will be less damaging to the U.S. economy than others may work in the dollar's favor.
""We have very, very strong safe-haven flows helping to stabilize the trade-weighted dollar on a global basis,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
""What we could be looking at is a multi-stage cycle here where the dollar falls a bit but eventually recovers as the spread of coronavirus continues to impact economies elsewhere,"" he said.

ISM nonmanufacturing data for February showed an uptick to 57.3, beating expectations of 54.9. This represents the highest reading for the service sector index since February 2019.

“In terms of our projections, we unfortunately over the last week have seen a shift to a more adverse scenario for the global economy,” Georgieva told reporters at a briefing Wednesday in Washington.
“It is, unfortunately, spreading undetected more than initially was thought,” Georgieva said. “The moment it became clear it is no more just about China and maybe a small number of countries in Asia surrounding China, then the outlook on what the impact could be changed.”
The IMF announced a $50 billion aid package to help fight the coronavirus.The money is available “immediately” and is for low-income and emerging market countries, according to Georgieva."

(Reuters) - Investors lowered bearish bets on the Chinese yuan as a U.S. rate cut gave Chinese bonds a yield advantage, but they built short positions in the Indonesian rupiah with the coronavirus outbreak reigniting volatility in emerging markets.
In a bid to shield the U.S. economy from the damaging effects of the epidemic, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points in a surprise out-of-cycle meeting on Tuesday - the first since the 2008 financial crisis.
Aided by a weakening dollar, short positions on the Chinese yuan stood at their lowest since early January 2019, a poll of 15 respondents found.
The yuan immediately jumped after the rate cut to its highest level since Jan. 23 and erased all losses it had clocked since the Lunar New Year holiday.
Bearish bets on the Korean won and Singapore dollar were also trimmed, with both currencies also likely to benefit from the softer greenback.
Meanwhile, in a counter-intuitive move, market participants turned bearish on the Indonesian rupiah for the first time since late October as volatility surged in the local markets.
Indonesia has among the highest real interest rates in the region and its bond market usually attracts foreign inflows owing to attractive rate differentials.
However, the outbreak of the coronavirus and resulting uncertainty due to Indonesia's reliance on China's economy - has now made carry-plays complicated.
""The carry trade is a low volatility strategy designed to pick up yield in a benign market environment. The pick-up in volatility emerging from the equity market has triggered huge draw-downs in carry trade strategies,"" analysts at ING said in a note.
""Unless one believes that policymakers with their actions so far have put a floor under risk assets and volatility drops substantially – highly unlikely in our opinion – it looks premature to be buying the dip in high yield FX.""
Meanwhile, investors increased bearish positions on the Malaysian ringgit as its central bank cut rates to a 10-year low on Tuesday. Political upheavals in Malaysia, following the implosion of a multi-ethnic coalition led by veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad, also made investors wary.
Short bets on the Thai baht also rose, after Bank of Thailand vowed to act appropriately following the Fed's cut.
The Thai central bank had cut rates a third time in six months to a record low in February just before the Fed made its surprise move.
In the same vein, investors reduced bullish stakes on the Philippine peso after the central bank reaffirmed its commitment to cutting interest rates further this year.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar , Indian rupee , Philippine peso , Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.
A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)."

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar found its footing on Wednesday as better-than-expected services and private labor data eased recession fears at a time when many are fretting about the impact of the coronavirus spread in the U.S.

Investors are betting on another rally in the euro as the Federal Reserve is seen weakening the dollar with steeper interest-rate cuts.
The euro has risen more than 3.5% in the past two weeks and a further advance by 3% seems to be in the cards, if options are any guide. Data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation over the previous month show a strong interest for trades that pay out should the euro rise to $1.15, a level unseen since January 2019.
The premium on bullish euro options expiring in six months over bearish ones, a gauge of sentiment, climbed to the highest level in more than a decade this week. That reflects expectations of narrowing rate differentials between the U.S. and the euro area, as well as the unwind of carry trades that used the euro as a funding vehicle.
Bets on swings in the currency over coming weeks suggest that investors are looking for the Fed to cut rates again at its meeting on March 18, and doubts that the European Central Bank will follow suit.
Still, for another leg in the common currency’s rally, bulls will need to overcome technical resistance at $1.1200-$1.1250. The euro touched that level on Tuesday before slipping back on Wednesday to trade around $1.1160.
That barrier has resulted in options traders buying a hefty amount of euro calls with a strike at $1.1200. A series of technical resistance levels lie nearby, namely a 14 month-old trendline, the high on Dec. 31 and the currency’s 21-month moving average.
Also key for the euro to extend its advance will be a continuation of the higher volatility environment seen lately across the currency market. Higher hedging costs make some carry trades unattractive, while a stronger euro makes the case for offshore investors to address any unhedged debt issuance they may have in the common currency.

Investing.com - The dollar recouped some losses on Wednesday after weakening across the board in the previous session when the Federal Reserve’s emergency 50 basis point rate cut failed to ease fears over the global economic fallout from the spread of the coronavirus.
The Fed’s decision to cut rates came two weeks ahead of a regularly scheduled policy meeting. The last time the Fed made a rate cut between scheduled meetings was in October 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.
But investors remained fearful that the rate cut would not be sufficient to support markets after the Fed acknowledged scale of the challenge and the limits of monetary policy to deal with a public health crisis.
""We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection, it won't fix a broken supply chain; we get that,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference.
More than 3,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus, about 3.4% of those infected and it continues to spread quickly beyond the epicentre in China.
""The question here is whether a conventional interest rate response is sufficient,"" said Sameer Goel, chief strategist, Asia macro, at Deutsche Bank in Singapore.
""It's still not clear how big the problem ultimately is, or could be, and until you know that, it's hard to know how much medicine to apply to it.""

321,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 03:39AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Cracks are starting to appear in rupee’s defenses with new coronavirus cases being reported in India.
The rupee slid as much as 0.4% to 73.6 per dollar on Wednesday to become the worst performing Asian currency. Six people in India tested positive for the virus so far. The currency had remained relatively stable earlier in the absence of new virus cases in the country.
A broad dollar weakness triggered by an unexpected rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday did little to support the rupee, even as most other emerging Asian currencies rallied on the back of that move.
The rupee may fall to as low as 75 per dollar, surpassing the record low hit in October 2018, according to ING Bank NV. India’s currency already fell to its lowest level in more than a year on Wednesday.
“I don’t see much respite from the selling pressure in the near-term,” said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Singapore. “As things are going elsewhere in the world, we can’t rule out the risk of rapid spread of the disease in India.” The dollar-rupee pair has moved to a higher trading range of 72-75, he said.
The outflow of foreign funds from the nation’s debt has also weighed on the rupee. Overseas investors dumped sovereign bonds in ten out of the past 12 days, pulling a net 127.5 billion rupees, according to Bloomberg data.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near five-month lows versus the yen on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve's emergency 50 basis point rate cut sparked more anxiety about the impact of the coronavirus and sent Treasury yields tumbling to record lows.
The greenback also traded near the lowest in almost two years against the Swiss franc, with investors flocking to traditional safe havens as rate cuts were deemed insufficient to offset risks posed by the global spread of the coronavirus.
The euro was one of the currencies to benefit most from the broad-based dollar weakness as traders bet the Fed will cut rates more than the European Central Bank.
Disappointment that a Group of Seven statement on Tuesday did not lay out a specific response to a global slowdown caused by the coronavirus has reinforced the view among some investors that policymakers have fallen behind the curve.
""The G7 and the Fed were not enough to support markets,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""This Fed rate cut is bad for dollar/yen, partly because Treasury yields are now very low. The dollar's weakness is reflected in the euro, because the Fed will likely ease more than the ECB.""
The dollar fell to 106.85 yen in Asia on Wednesday, its lowest in almost five months, and then steadied at 107.36 yen.
The greenback bought 0.9566 Swiss franc , close to its weakest level in almost two years.
The Fed surprised investors by slashing rates by 50 basis points to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25% on Tuesday, two weeks ahead of a regularly scheduled policy meeting.
Interest rate futures traders were pricing in a 55.7% probability of a further 25 basis point cut in April, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
The rate cut failed to arrest a sell-off in U.S. equities and sent benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) crashing to a record low of 0.906%, further reducing the appeal of the dollar.
The new coronavirus that emerged in China late last year has spread to more than 60 countries and claimed more than 3,000 lives. Travel restrictions and factory closures aimed at halting the spread of the virus raise the risk of a global recession.
Sentiment also took at a hit after G7 finance ministers issued a statement on Tuesday that stopped short of calling for new government spending or coordinated central bank interest rate cuts.
In the onshore market, the yuan jumped to a six-week high of 6.9288 per dollar in another sign of the U.S. currency's weak bias.
The yuan shrugged off data showing China's services sector crumbled to its weakest on record in February, but the grim numbers offer a sign of the economic impact of the spread of the flu-like virus.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar pared gains to trade at $0.6599 as the weak Chinese data took some of the shine off the Aussie, whose economy is highly dependant on trade with China.
Broad-based selling in the U.S. dollar encouraged euro bulls to aggressively buy the common currency.
The euro (EUR=EBS) last traded at $1.1158, close to a two-month high reached on Tuesday.
Against sterling, the euro (EURGBP=D3) traded at 87.07 pence, close to the highest in more than four months.
Sterling bought $1.2819, holding onto modest gains from the previous session.
Uncertainty about trade talks between Britain and the European Union is weighing on sterling, along with growing expectations for UK interest rate cuts.
Money markets are now fully pricing in a cut of 25 basis points on March 26 when the Bank of England next meets.

(Reuters) - Investors have turned their most bullish on the euro since November 2016, with the Federal Reserve's Tuesday interest rate encouraging some to price in further gains against the dollar.
The Fed cut, two weeks before its official policy meeting, means it has taken the lead in fighting potential economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus outbreak and expectations of more cuts ahead are weighing heavy on the dollar.
Those expectations are fuelling a rush into almost every other major currency, but especially those such as the euro whose central banks have little or no space for big rate cuts.
While markets now see a 90% chance the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut rates next week, it remains reluctant to rush into further policy easing
The euro is up almost 4% in the past 8 days (EUR=EBS) and one-month euro-dollar risk reversals show the implied volatility premium for euro calls over euro puts is the highest since the U.S. election in November 2016 at 0.8%.
(GRAPHIC: Risk reversals flip; euro bulls on top - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2793/2758/reversals.png)
Calls give holders the right to buy a security at a pre-agreed price while puts confer the right to sell. Euro calls traded at a 0.4% premium on Friday and carried a discount the previous week.
""The currency market reaction following the Fed (decision) shows that yield differentials have come back into their own,"" Gavin Friend, a strategist at National Australia Bank, said, referring to the narrowing U.S. yield premium compared to other currencies.
""Everything is telling you this could go further, You just can't fight this at the moment.""
The yield premium paid by 10-year U.S. government Treasuries compared to German equivalents is now at the narrowest since 2017, having tightened 50 basis points.
(GRAPHIC: U.S./German bond yield gap - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2786/2751/USDE033.png)
The moves could be exacerbated by positioning -- existing option expiries between now and March 31 reported through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) show very few options barriers above $1.1250.
So a break of that level would face less resistance from traders who would otherwise have sold euros to hedge positions.
That is possibly because traders, skeptical the euro could sustain its gains, were likely 'short' any options pricing euro upside. After all, the pair spent last year trading between $1.0879 and $1.1570, the narrowest range ever.
Still, the euro faces formidable hurdles in the medium-term, not least sluggish economic growth and falling inflation expectations. Nor will euro strength be welcomed by the ECB.
For now though, with more Fed rate cuts being priced, it should hold on to gains, options markets appear to be signaling."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Mexico's peso is seen vulnerable to further slumps with the U.S. election campaign in focus after ending the first quarter on a bad note due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak, a Reuters poll showed.
The currency is set to trade at 19.5250 per U.S. dollar in one year, close to its levels earlier this week, according to the median estimate of 12 strategists polled Feb. 28-March 3, before the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday.
The peso was 1.3% higher after the Fed took the decision aimed at protecting the world's largest economy from the impact of the epidemic, giving some relief to Latin American foreign exchange markets.
The Mexican currency slumped 5.5% in the second half of last month, along with other emerging markets hit by a flight to safe-haven assets, as the coronavirus spread outside China. The fifth case in Mexico was confirmed this week.
It may risk further losses resulting from potential spurts of protectionist rhetoric before the U.S. election on Nov. 3. Last week, President Donald Trump said he could close the U.S. southern border to control the spread of the disease.
""As the election cycle in the U.S. picks up speed and headline volatility increases, we expect USD/MXN to resume an upward (weaker) trend into late Q1 and early Q2,"" CIBC analysts wrote in a monthly report for March, before the Fed's move.
In the run-up to the presidential vote of 2016, the peso lost 7.6% from its strongest level that year until election day, battered by Trump's promise to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Mexico's poor growth and optimistic budget assumptions are also likely to weigh on the peso. ""We foresee these concerns returning to the main stage ... as credit rating agencies assess the country's fiscal stance in Q2 2020,"" CIBC said.
Brazil's real outlook (BRBY) is also beset by a disappointing economy and global headwinds from the impact of the epidemic, as reflected in its one-year median estimate that was 2.4% weaker than in February's poll.
""Positive drivers for BRL have been overwhelmed by negative pressures from stronger USD amid risk-off sentiment and from domestic growth with downside surprises in 4Q19,"" BofAML analysts wrote in a report last week.

The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency interest-rate cut, and the Group of Seven finance chiefs pledged to use all policy tools to support the global economy.
Australia cut rates to a record low and U.S. President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to “ease and cut rate big.” Malaysia reduced its benchmark interest rate while the Fed, Bank of Japan and European Central Bank all pledged to act.
Infections rose again in South Korea and Iran, where more officials were diagnosed. Businesses in the U.K., which has reported 51 cases, were warned that as many as a fifth of workers could be forced off sick if the country is hit by a widespread outbreak. Japan’s tally of cases approached the 1,000 mark, while Spain’s rose 32% to 150. The International Olympic Committee urged athletes to keep preparing for the Tokyo games amid concern the outbreak could quash that event.
U.S. stocks declined and Treasuries surged as investors worried the Fed’s emergency cut won’t be enough to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus.

WHO: Not Time to Wave a White Flag (12:15 p.m. NY)
The head of the World Health Organization said countries shouldn’t be “waving a white flag” and should pursue aggressive containment strategies, even if they have no or few cases of the novel coronavirus.
China has managed to steadily reduce the number of new cases, which dropped to the lowest number since Jan. 20, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the group’s daily briefing in Geneva Tuesday.
In some people the coronavirus can cause much more serious illness than influenza, even if it doesn’t spread as easily, Tedros said. Producers of medical gear need to boost supply 40% because each month the world will need 89 million medical masks, 76 million exam gloves and 1.6 million goggles, he said.
Iran, the center of the outbreak in the Middle East, is in need of medical equipment including ventilators, and the large increases in new cases are a reflection of how medical authorities are being more aggressive in trying to detect the virus, Tedros said. “Things tend to look worse before they get better.”
FDA on Watch for Drug Shortages From India (11:10 a.m. NY)
U.S. health regulators are watching for potential drug shortages after India restricted the export of some raw pharmaceutical ingredients, a move that has potential to disrupt the global supply chain of drugs manufactured around the world.
Earlier Tuesday, India said it would limit export of some common medicines as concerns grow over shortages of chemical ingredients. Many manufacturers in China are shut due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Though India is the source of about 20% of the world’s generic-drug supply, the country is dependent on China for about 66% of the chemical components needed to make them. India wants to ensure that there are enough supplies at home for its citizens.
Homeland Security Closes Field Office in Seattle (10:37 a.m. NY)

“The employee had been coming to work in the intervening days between the possible exposure (Feb. 22) and becoming ill (Feb. 26). In an effort to contain the threat of potential spread & out of an abundance of caution, the @USCIS Seattle Field Office was ordered closed,” Cuccinelli tweeted.

N.Y. Man in Westchester Tests Positive, Cuomo Says (9:40 a.m. NY)
A 50-year-old man who works in Manhattan and lives in the New York suburb of Westchester County has been hospitalized and tested positive for the coronavirus.
The man doesn’t have a history of foreign travel and it wasn’t immediately clear if he’d had contact with known cases in the U.S. Health authorities around the country are closely watching for coronavirus cases with unknown origins, a sign that the virus could be spreading from person-to-person.
The man lives in Westchester with his family. A school in the Bronx attended by one of his children has been closed as a precaution, Cuomo said.
There are also two families in Buffalo that are suspected of having the virus, the governor’s office said in an email.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's strength will remain in place and for longer than expected just a month ago, despite Federal Reserve interest rate cuts intended to limit the economic damage from the spreading coronavirus, a Reuters poll showed.
The survey was conducted before the Fed cut interest rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move on Tuesday, after G7 finance officials said they were ready to use all policy tools to safeguard against risks to growth.
Many analysts had expected this reduction in the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.00-1.25% to take place, only later this month at the Fed's policy meeting.
Currency analysts in the Feb. 28-March 3 poll expect the dollar to sail through the current market crisis without shedding much of its strength. The dollar is up more than 1% so far this year, even though Wall Street is down over 4%.
A little more than half the analysts who answered an additional question, 25 of 45, echoed those views and said market expectations for Fed rate cuts were unlikely to halt the dollar's strength.
A significant majority of analysts also forecast the currency would continue to dominate trading in the foreign exchange markets for at least another six months, a view held since the middle of last year.
""I think it might be a little early to assume that the dollar will sell off on Fed easing. It's likely that other central banks will react, too, and that takes us back to where we were a year ago,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""At the start of last year, when markets switched from anticipating Fed hikes in 2019 to expecting Fed cuts, markets also thought that the dollar would fall. But the dollar didn't fall, and one of the reasons for that is we saw certain other central banks getting in there more aggressively than the Fed.""
If anything, the impact from the coronavirus outbreak would be felt more by emerging-market currencies. [EMRG/POLL]
The consensus from the latest poll echoed the long-held view the dollar will eventually lose its shine over the coming year, a majority prediction that has proved incorrect over the past two years.
Thhe euro has mostly been used as a funding instrument by traders over the past few years, but analysts have noted some recent strength against the dollar.
""Its not just about what central banks do, there is also an element of positioning adjustment as well ... we've seen over the last week that there's still scope for the euro and the yen short positions to be liquidated, and that feeds through to a further move higher for those currencies,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG.
Still, despite the latest slightly better performance by the euro against the dollar, there has not been a dramatic shift in analyst expectations. If anything, there was a slight downgrade to median expectations.
The median forecast showed the euro was expected to trade at $1.14 in a year, about 2.5% higher than Tuesday's $1.11, compared with the $1.15 predicted in the past three polls.
But more than half of the respondents in the latest poll expect the euro to trade lower than where it was on Tuesday over the next six months, with that number dropping to about one-quarter of them in a year.
There were considerably more pessimistic euro calls compared with the previous month.
That is largely driven by expectations the European Central Bank will be prompted to ease policy further to fight off any damage to the economy from the coronavirus outbreak, which is likely to hit the ailing Italian economy hard.
""Markets are going to be thinking: 'Well, hold on a minute, if the Fed goes, what is the ECB going to do?' In the near term, euro/dollar may be a little bit high, but I don't think that's going to sustain. I think even by the end of the week, that would have run its course,"" said Rabobank's Foley.

LONDON (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained on the dollar on Tuesday, as investor hopes for global monetary easing were tempered by concern over how much it could do to combat the economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak.
Global stocks and oil rallied on Tuesday, and safe haven assets -- gold, the yen, and the franc -- were standouts as risk appetite grew in anticipation of stimulus from central banks.
G7 finance ministers and central bank governors were due to hold a conference on Tuesday at 1200 GMT to discuss how to deal with the outbreak and its economic fallout.
The call comes with markets already betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will lead a round of global monetary easing. [MKTS/GLOB] 
However, Reuters reported that the draft G7 statement had no fresh fiscal or monetary pledges, tempering investor optimism and encouraging a flight to safety. 
The dollar fell 0.34% to 107.95 yen  and 0.14% to 0.958 francs .
""I think there is some disappointment on the back of the Reuters report that there's unlikely to be an explicit stimulus,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at MUFG.
""That has triggered some disappointment. We are in wait and see mode. Even if we do see a powerful policy response, the impact of coronavirus will still weigh heavily on the market.""
In a statement, expected on Tuesday or Wednesday, the G7 countries will pledge to work together to mitigate damage to their economies, without giving specifics, a source with knowledge of the draft told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
That leaves investors again confronting fundamentals: The virus and the economic slowdown it is causing, and the damage looks as if it won't be confined to China-exposed assets. 
""For many investors there is the view, perhaps, that central banks can do a lot to help the symptoms of this crisis but they're not going to entirely make it go away,"" said Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
""There is going to be uncertainty about the economic impact of this virus, and given that, there will be safe haven demand."" 
The extra room to respond in the United States, where the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate is 1.5% to 1.75% compared with zero in Europe, has weighed on the dollar.
However, after the European Central Bank said it was ready to take ""targeted"" steps to fight the virus's effects, the euro fell from a five-week high on Tuesday.
The dollar index was 0.04% higher at 97.571 (=USD) and the euro was 0.15% lower at $1.112 (EUR=)
The Australian dollar  gained after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates by only 25 basis points, as anticipated. Markets had priced the possibility of a larger cut.
""Assurances of easier liquidity and fiscal support may help stabilize the sentiment in the very short term, but the risk of a higher rate of COVID-19 infections needs to be monitored closely,"" Citi EM Asia economist Johanna Chua said in a note.
""The situation remains fluid and a lot depends on how successful the G7 conference call is in keeping up with the expectations of coordinated easing.""
Euro zone consumer prices came in as expected, rising more slowly in February than in January, up 1.2% year-on-year after a 1.4% rise the previous month.
Later on Tuesday, the results of the Super Tuesday Democratic Party primaries in the United States are expected. The Bank of Canada meets to set its policy rate on Wednesday.

The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies were little changed at 97.328. 
On Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a rare statement and said that it would act “as appropriate to support the economy.”
The Bank of Japan (BoJ) followed the Fed in promising, if need be, to support markets in the face of “growing uncertainties about the outlook for economic activity due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.”
The BoJ said it “will strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets through appropriate market operations and asset purchases.”

In an emergency statement, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will “strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets.” The Bank of England followed by saying it’s working with U.K. and international authorities to “ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.”Already on Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to cutting interest rates to contain what he called the “evolving risks” to economic growth from the virus. The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a “long lasting” epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.
The prospect of central banks’ action temporarily halted the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. But the selloff resumed on Monday, with U.S. futures falling and Treasuries rallying.

There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.
“Global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. “We suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.”
With interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measure
Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.
“Central banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, “ said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
Constrained
The Bank of Japan backed up Monday’s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia’s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.
By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan’s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan’s key rate is already minus 0.1% compared to the Fed’s 1.5% to 1.75% range.
The ECB, which hasn’t so far published a statement, is also limited by a deposit rate of minus 0.5%. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signaling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.
On Monday, Vice President Luis De Guindos signaled that’s still the prevailing sentiment.
“The main front line of response has to be fiscal policy,” he said at a conference in London. “When you have a problem you can’t always look at central banks. We are not almighty.”
His colleague, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, said on BFM Business television that “we are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The coronavirus threatens to plunge China’s economy into contraction, sending shock waves around the world. Bloomberg Economics is downgrading its forecast for growth, and anticipates larger spillovers to the region and other major economies.”

Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.
For central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency.
That’s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world’s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won’t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they’re worried about infection.
But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.
“Rate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,” said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.
Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7% of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro surged to a five-week high against the dollar on Monday, as investors discounted the chances of big ECB rate cuts to counter coronavirus damage, while the greenback was pressured by the likelihood of full-blown Fed policy easing. 
Panic in global markets that saw world shares shed almost $6 trillion last week prompted U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to issue a statement late on Friday saying the Fed would ""act as appropriate"" to support the economy.
Investors took his comments as a hint that the Fed will deliver a cut when it meets from March 17-18, and as an encouragement to central banks around the world to follow suit. Futures <0#FF:> now imply a 50 basis point cut at the meeting.
Investors are also betting that other central banks will follow its example by easing policy - but some, such as the European Central Bank, are constrained from cutting rates that are already deep in negative territory.
""The Fed is among the G10 central banks with the highest interest rates so it has more room to cut rates, and that's making the dollar weaker. What's priced for the ECB is roughly 15 basis points by the end of 2020, while for the Fed it's 100 bps,"" said Ulrich Leuchtman, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
The dollar index, measured against a basket of currencies, slipped 0.3% (=USD) while against the euro the greenback was down 0.8% (EUR=EBS) to $1.1128, the lowest since Jan. 23.
Markets now see a 50-50 chance of some kind of European Central Bank easing next week and a rate cut of 10 basis points in April. A gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations fell to a new record low of just above 1% .
But ECB policymakers, including its president, Christine Lagarde, have shown reluctance to cut rates from the current minus 0.5%. 
""I would be cautious in thinking the ECB does anything other than liquidity provision,"" said Colin Harte, head of multi-asset at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also said the BOJ would take necessary steps to stabilise financial markets. The yen  rose 0.4% nonetheless to 107.78 per dollar.
Markets are expecting Australia to cut rates on Tuesday, and possibly Canada later in the week. 
The Australian dollar rose 0.6% to $0.6544  and sterling  firmed 0.5% to $1.2752. The offshore-traded Chinese yuan touched a one-month high at 6.95 to the dollar .
But the scale of the virus's spread means markets remain on edge. Chinese PMI surveys underscored the risk to world growth, showing the sharpest contraction in manufacturing activity on record. 
German PMIs appeared to show the downturn was easing but IHS Markit, the compiler of the data, said it could be a ""false dawn"" that did not fully incorporate the effects of the virus.

Investing.com -- The euro hit its highest level in a month against the dollar in early trading on Monday, while emerging market currencies rebounded sharply, as comments from central bankers hinted at coordinated action to stabilize markets that are reeling from a coronavirus-induced panic.
The Bank of Japan followed the U.S. Federal Reserve overnight in promising, if need be, to support markets in the face of “growing uncertainties about the outlook for economic activity due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.”
The BoJ said it “will strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets through appropriate market operations and asset purchases.”
On Friday, the Federal Reserve had broken a wave of panic selling by saying that it would act “as appropriate to support the economy.” Although the language of the statement didn’t differ from previous Fed policy statements, the mere release of the statement was taken as a reassurance that central banks wouldn’t let market panic push the world into recession.
“The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong,” Chairman Jerome Powell said. 
The Bank of England also issued a statement Monday saying it would take all necesssary steps to safeguard financial stability.
Earlier, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau told the BFM TV channel that the European Central Bank, too, is prepared to “do more” if needed to support the economy, but said he didn’t think that moment had arrived yet.
The release of final purchasing managers indices for February from IHS Markit and others may move that debate forward. The official Chinese PMI hit its worst ever level, according to data released on Saturday, while the Caixin PMI that covers the private sector also came in below expectations at 40.1 earlier on Monday. The People’s Bank of China said over the weekend that banks need not recognize SME loans as non-performing until June, a crucial support to the private sector.
By 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the euro was at $1.1079, up 0.4% from late Friday, having earlier hit an intraday high of 1.1085, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.2% a 97.91, its lowest in nearly a month.
Elsewhere, sterling continued to weaken, under pressure from comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the weekend threatening to walk away from trade talks with the EU by June if the EU insisted on a role for the European Court of Justice in governing the free trade agreement being negotiated by the two. By 3:05 AM ET it was down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2794, and down 0.9% against the euro at 1.1531."

Investing.com - The Chinese yuan rose against the U.S. dollar on Monday in Asia despite the release of downbeat manufacturing data. 
The USD/CNY pair lost 0.3% to 6.9687 by 11:35 PM ET (03:35 GMT). The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index came in at 40.3 for February, which was its lowest reading since the survey was launched in early 2004.
Data on Saturday showed China’s official manufacturing PMI contracted at its fastest ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis of 2008.
The People's Bank of China has set the Yuan reference rate at 6.9811 today versus Friday's fix at 7.0066.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index dropped 0.2% to 97.927.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak is fuelling investor demand for the Swiss franc, Swiss National Bank vice-chairman Fritz Zurbruegg said, with the impact on the country's economy depending on how much the virus spread.
""We assume that the increased uncertainty due to the coronavirus plays a role,"" Zurbruegg told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft when asked about the franc's recent spike against the euro.
""In such events, the franc is sought as a safe haven,"" he said in the interview, to be published on Saturday.
The virus situation can change rapidly, Zurbruegg said, with the uncertainty also causing turbulence on the equity markets. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (ssmi) lost 3.7% on Friday.
""The virus could affect the outlook for the Swiss economy. Everything depends on how wide it spreads,"" he said.
The Swiss government on Friday banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people in an effort to curb the epidemic, prompting cancellation of the Geneva car show.
It declared a ""special situation"" under the country's Epidemics Act, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Switzerland rose to 15.
Switzerland's appearance on a U.S. Treasury watchlist of potential currency manipulators would not deter the SNB from battling the rise of the franc, whose high value hurts Switzerland's export-reliant economy, he added.
""If we are accused of wanting to keep the currency weak in order to gain advantages over other countries, that is not true,"" he said, denying Switzerland was a manipulator.
""Our monetary policy course has not changed and we continue to use our instruments consistently,"" Zurbruegg said, referring to the negative interest rates and currency interventions the SNB has used to check the franc's rise.
The bank currently has the lowest interest rate in the world -- minus 0.75% -- and this level could even be cut further if necessary, he said.
""With our negative interest rate, interest rates in Switzerland remain somewhat lower than abroad. This is a crucial prerequisite for curbing the attractiveness of the Swiss franc,"" said Zurbruegg.
""If we conclude that monetary conditions need to be adjusted, we will lower the SNB key rate further.""",,,,,

Investing.com -- The dollar was higher against high-yielding currencies but lower against havens in early trade in Europe on Friday, as the week-long flight to safety in global markets continued unabated.
Overnight, the greenback had marched to another new 10-year high against the Aussie dollar and also breached 1.60 against the kiwi for the first time since October. 
However, its gains against European currencies were more limited, with the euro staying around $1.1000 and Sterling dropping only 0.2% to $1.2864. And it lost ground against traditional safe havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc.
The pound was supported by stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data for February and the fastest annual gain in house prices since August 2018, as measured by the Nationwide Building Society.
The data are consistent with other recent high-frequency indicators suggesting an uptick in the economy since December’s general election. However, the fast-deteriorating global backdrop and the new government’s defiant stance vis-à-vis the EU as it starts negotiations on a free trade deal may yet keep hopes of a near-term rate cut by the Bank of England alive.
The Bank of England’s chief economist Andrew Haldane may give further clues on the likelihood of that in a speech at 6:15 AM ET (1115 GMT).
Markets are now aggressively pricing in monetary easing from the Federal Reserve over the next few months. The Fed-sensitive 2-Year yield fell through 1% in early trading in Europe, while the 10-year yield has collapsed from 1.47% at the start of the week to a record low of 1.19% by 3 AM ET (0800 GMT).
“Markets are trying to “price-in” an event for which there is no readily known precedent. Volatility will rule until COVID-19-related risks reverse course,” said John Lonski, chief economist with Moody’s Capital Markets Research, in a note to clients.
However, he warned that “by themselves, Fed rate cuts will not remedy the COVID-19 virus. What the Fed can do is help to facilitate access to financial capital for those households, businesses and local governments that incur cash flow problems owing to the virus. The Fed will attempt to prevent a highly communicable virus from sparking a ruinous bout of financial contagion.”
Fed rate cuts would also be a significant help to emerging market countries whose currencies have depreciated fast against the dollar since the outbreak began. The worst hit continue to be those with the biggest trade links to China: the dollar rose 2% against the Indonesian rupiah in Asian trading to an eight-month high, while it also rose more than 1.6% against the Russian ruble to its highest since January 2019."

Investing.com - Prices of the Japanese yen surged on Friday in Asia as traders rushed to safe-haven assets following an increase in new coronavirus cases outside of China.
The USD/JPY pair lost 0.6% to 108.92 by 12:05 AM ET (04:05 GMT). 
U.S. stocks were in freefall this week, while Asian equities also plunged. Most major indices slumped about 3% today, bringing their weekly losses to around 10%. Global shares are now on course for the worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, down more than 10% this month’s peak after the World Health Organization said Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak has the potential to become a pandemic and is at a decisive stage.
The coronavirus, which began in China, showed signs of spreading as the number of cases in countries like Japan, South Korea, Italy, Iran and the U.S. surged. Diminishing hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could be contained in China prompted investors to panic, while pushing safe-haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen higher.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index slipped 0.1% to 98.377 as traders await the country’s latest consumer data and retail earnings that are due later in the day. 
January personal spending is expected to have risen 0.3%, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Personal income is expected to have risen 0.3% as well.
Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which exclude food and energy, are forecast to have risen 0.2% in January to an annual rate of 1.7%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is highly expected to lower its benchmark lending rate next month. 
The USD/CNY pair inched up 0.1% to 7.0114. The People's Bank of China set the Yuan reference rate at 7.0066 today versus Thursday's fix at 7.0215.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Japanese yen returned as a beacon of safety on Friday, hitting a one-month high against the dollar as deepening worries about coronavirus sent global financial markets into a tailspin.
Hopes the coronavirus outbreak could be contained in China have vanished this week as infections spread around the globe, prompting governments into action and investors to panic.
Stocks are in freefall and a rush for U.S. Treasuries has pushed yields to record lows.
Money markets are now all but certain the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark lending rate next month and the yen - heavily sold a week ago - has roared back to life.
It rose half a percent to a month-high of 109.03 per greenback on Friday, leaving the dollar heading for its worst week on the Japanese currency in more than three years .
As investors dumped China-sensitive regional currencies, the yen soared. The Australian dollar tanked 0.5% to a fresh 11-year low on the dollar, but it lost twice as much against the yen.
Against the kiwi the yen rose 1.6% (JPYNZD=).
""I'm not surprised it's reasserting itself,"" said Mayank Mishra, FX strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) in Singapore.
""The safe-haven yen tends to do well even in scenarios when the Japanese economic outlook may be at risk. Unlike the Fed, which may be cutting rates, the Bank of Japan does not have that luxury - so the downward pressure on the currency from the yield channel does not materialise.""
The Aussie last bought $0.6535 and 71.31 yen (AUDJPY=R). The kiwi hit a four-month low of $0.6247 .
SEISMIC SHIFT
While much is still unknown about the virus, measures to contain it have wreaked havoc on supply chains, the world's economy and financial markets.
In currencies, implied volatility, seen in one-month euro/dollar options, has shot up from near record lows to its highest in a year .
Fed futures pricing has shifted enormously, with investors now expecting three Fed cuts by mid year , beginning with one in March which had been rated just a 9% chance a week ago.
That had sent the euro sharply higher overnight, as investors unwind carry trades, and has offered a slight brake on the massive flight from Asian currencies. But there are few other places for money storming out of Asia to go.
""Until the virus data says otherwise, the trading strategies should probably still err (towards safety),""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Alan Ruskin said in a note. ""Buy gold, short oil,"" he said.
""Initially, the dollar weakness is expected to be only modest versus alternatives like the yen, franc and euro; and, the dollar should strengthen versus commodity FX and emerging markets' currencies."""

LONDON (Reuters) - With this week's coronavirus-driven rout having shaken awake previously slumbering euro-dollar markets, the spotlight is back on the ""short volatility"" trades that some regulators fear could trigger a blowup on world markets.
The world's most traded currency pair, comprising a quarter of global FX volumes, has become increasingly becalmed in recent years, and volatility gauges embedded in euro-dollar options tumbled in January to historic sub-4% lows from 7.3% a year earlier.
The pair's trading range last year - $1.15 to $1.09 - was the narrowest in the euro's two-decade history, to the displeasure of currency traders who can wring out more profits in volatile markets, often by selling hedging products to clients.
Their mood may have been improved by a rise in euro-dollar implied volatility to back above 6%, the highest in nearly six months.
(GRAPHIC: Currency volatility hits record lows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1701/1675/cvol.png)
But there's some trepidation too as memories stir of the 'Volmageddon' crisis of February 2018 when the short equity volatility trade imploded, sending investors scrambling to recoup losses and triggering a huge Wall Street selloff.
With regard to positioning linked to currency markets, any sharp rise in volatility would hit those who have shorted vol by selling options, as well as those who bought more risky assets, betting exchange rate swings would decline or stay stable.
""It makes us more nervous because it is indicative of a build-up of positioning,"" said a central bank official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, referring to investors buying risky financial assets.
RIPPLE EFFECT?
The worry is that the extended low-vol backdrop ups the risk of a blowout that ripples across all the sectors that benefited from FX calm.
The official said no plan of action was in place, but that central banks were monitoring the potential implications of a vol spike, adding: ""When these things unwind, they do so in a sharp manner - up the stairs and down the elevator.""
The issue is clearly on regulators' minds.
One senior FX trader who sits on a major central bank's foreign exchange committee said it was the number one topic at a recent meeting of industry and policy executives.
The Bank of England and European Central Bank declined comment. The New York Federal Reserve did not return calls and emails seeking comment.
So opaque is the currency trading world that no concrete data exists on positioning, but the dealer said ""a lot of people"" were short volatility, with the consensus view that low vol was here to stay thanks to low interest rates worldwide.
""We want volatility to increase but what we don't want is a shock. I don't think anyone wants a shock,"" the person added.
(GRAPHIC: 2019 - narrowest trading range in the euro's history, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1665/1640/tradingrange.png)
Measures of currency activity have been falling since the 2008 financial crisis, as central bank liquidity taps have gushed, inflation fallen and policies moved more or less in lockstep.
To a layman, extended currency calm may sound like a good idea. But it can tempt market makers, including hedge funds, to lever up and buy riskier, less liquid securities, a trend noted in the International Monetary Fund's financial stability report.
The issue also highlights how loosely regulated the $6.6 trillion-a-day forex market is. Unlike in equity markets, there are few ways to accurately measure positioning whether in spot currency markets or derivatives.
""We don't know, in the context of a global recession and associated market selloff, how resilient the fund industry will be,"" Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, told Reuters, warning of a ""potentially destabilizing"" situation.
""Our policy advisory is that regulators should monitor potential risk and that they should take actions preemptively in order to protect financial stability,"" he added.
The Bank of International Settlements too, writing just after Volmageddon, likened short vol strategies to ""collecting pennies in front of a steamroller"".
YEN ROUT A FORETASTE
The rush into short-vol is partly because traders, deprived of money-making opportunities, turned to selling currency options which earned them a small premium.
Such trades can yield handsome profits - for instance, shorting euro to buy equal weights of the dollar, rouble and Brazilian real would have made 11.5% in 2018/2019, Refinitiv data shows.
Essentially a short bet on euro volatility, that trade would have generated a Sharpe ratio of 2.5, versus 1.7 in 2015-2016 when vol was in the double-digits. Sharpe ratio refers to returns earned above risk-free rates after adjusting for volatility.
But if the picture turns, the impact can be gigantic.
The 2018 Volmageddon was blamed on punters betting on lower equity volatility through short positions in VIX futures, akin to buying options aimed at shorting FX vol.
Mizuho analysts reckon the 1.3% yen rout on Feb 19 this year may have stemmed from investors buying back some short dollar positions as volatility grew higher.
Traders are still relatively relaxed about the risk of a near-term volatility surge, however, especially given past such warnings have fallen flat. Relatively stable economic growth and stagnant inflation metrics mean low volatility is normal, the IMF's Adrian argued.
And finally, those who favor selling vol are confident central banks will step in to smooth out any market turmoil, with markets already betting the Fed and other central banks will cut interest rates in response to the coronavirus."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday as Treasury yields continued to plumb new lows and investors bet the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to offset the impact of a spreading coronavirus, while the euro bounced half a percent higher.
Money markets are now fully pricing in a 25 basis point cut in the Fed's rate by April and three by March next year.
Expectations for a European Central Bank rate cut have also risen: money markets are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a 10 basis point rate cut in July.
But analysts point out that with Fed rates much higher, and therefore the range for them to fall much larger, investors are dumping the dollar - reversing some of the U.S. currency's gains in the past week.
""Rate cut expectations have gained momentum and U.S. rate expectations are falling a lot more than they are in the euro zone,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
However, Nguyen said whether or not the dollar, which last week touched an almost 3-year high, would fall further depended on economic data on the coronavirus's impact on confidence and trade outside of China.
The dollar index (=USD), measured against a basket of currencies, was last down 0.4% at 98.783, its weakest since Feb. 12. 
It has lost 1.2% since last week, when its safe haven currency credentials and investors' belief that the U.S. economy was relatively sheltered from the coronavirus fallout encouraged buying of the greenback.
The euro added 0.5% to $1.0939 (EUR=EBS). Last week it had dropped below $1.07, although it still remains down 2.4% so far in 2020.
""The dollar doesn't look so safe if we are dealing with the spread of the virus in the United States,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""The are some concerns that the U.S. government is underestimating the coronavirus.""
New infections of the virus are now growing faster outside of China than within, stoking fears that the economic impact of travel curbs, supply chain disruptions, and falling demand might be far greater than previously anticipated. 
Investors have rushed for the safety of U.S. government debt. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) slumped to a record low of 1.2970% in Asia on Thursday.
The dollar dropped 0.5% to 109.93  Japanese yen per dollar.
Elsewhere the pound  rose 0.3% to $1.2942. Sterling hovered near a two-week low versus the euro, at 84.52 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The new round of talks between Britain and the EU is scheduled to start on Monday, but comments from both sides suggest their views on the scope of a fee-trade agreement differ greatly. 

The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for investor sentiment towards China, rebounded 0.5% to $0.6571 , away from 11-year lows touched this week.

The dollar fell 0.4% to 109.94 yen by 03:49 AM ET (849 GMT), extending a pullback from a 10-month high of 112.23 yen reached on Feb. 20.
The dollar was down 0.5% to 0.9716 Swiss franc, a currency that is traditionally sought as a safe haven.
The dollar fell from a three-month high versus the pound and declined versus the euro as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit record lows amid worries over whether the world's largest economy was prepared for the epidemic.
Treasuries have rallied in recent sessions, initially on the back of the broad-based flight to safety, but some analysts now believe the rally is linked to heightened expectations for central bank easing to ward off the economic fallout from the virus.
Money markets are now pricing a roughly even chance of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next month and have almost fully priced a cut by April. However, many economists question whether interest rate cuts are the most appropriate way to sustain demand in the face of the current demand shock. 
""QUICK! Central banks better cut rates quickly, so that quarantined people can finance their 100% non-existent purchases of autos and capital goods at lower rates! That'll help,"" said Nordea analyst Martin Enlund via Twitter, with heavy irony. 
The Bank of Korea, at its policy meeting earlier Thursday, left its key rate unchanged, despite South Korea being the country worst affected by the virus outside China. 
New infections of the virus are now growing at a faster rate outside of China, where it originated, stoking fears that the economic impact of travel curbs, supply chain disruptions, and falling demand might be far greater than previously anticipated.
""The dollar doesn't look so safe if we are dealing with the spread of the virus in the United States,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""The are some concerns that the U.S. government is underestimating the coronavirus.""
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Wednesday of the possibility of community spread after confirming a coronavirus infection in someone who had not travelled abroad or been exposed to a known carrier of the virus, a first for the country.
That brought the total number of cases in the U.S. to 15, according to the CDC, which is still a tiny fraction of the cases in China.
On the economic calendar, investors are looking ahead to data on U.S. durable goods orders and gross domestic product later in the day.

Investing.com - The Euro and the pound both traded higher on Thursday in Asia ahead of U.K. and EU trade talks that were set for March 2.
The EUR/USD pair and the GBP/USD pair rose 0.3% and 0.2% respectively by 1:45 AM ET (05:45 GMT).
Despite the gains today, traders are concerned that tough rhetoric from both sides recently suggests negotiations will be anything but smooth.
The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc would not agree a deal ""at any price"" and rebuffed the idea of offering the U.K. a Canada-style trade agreement.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was down 0.1% to 98.832.
Reports that the spread of the new coronavirus globally continued to gather pace were cited as headwinds for the greenback. 
The U.S. confirmed its first community transmission of the virus on Wednesday, as the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionn (CDC) said a California patient, who did not have a relevant travel history or exposure to another patient with the new coronavirus, was infected.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea unexpected kept rates unchanged even after the number of cases in South Korea rose above 1,500 today from just around 31 in a little more than a week. 
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said that for the first time the virus was spreading faster outside China, where it originated.
The USD/JPY pair lost 0.3% to 110.04 as the Japanese yen attracted some safe-haven demand.

Some 52% of goods such as food and clothing are sold in euros or dollars in the capital of Caracas, a figure that is closer to 90% in the border cities of San Cristobal and Maracaibo near Colombia, Ecoanalitica said in a report.
Dollar transactions have soared in Venezuela since Maduro relaxed price and currency controls at the end of 2018 following 15 years of socialist regulations that put the government at the center of many basic business transactions.
The use of hard currencies such as the dollar and euro, with stable exchange rates, have become commonplace in Venezuela after years of hyperinflation and recent broad U.S. sanctions meant to push Maduro from office. It has broadly boosted the availability of products, but left many unable to obtain basic items.
In the country's 10 major cities, 62% of food payments were made in hard currencies with the average purchase being made for $26, Ecoanalitica said. A monthly mininum wage together with bonus food ticket reaches a combined total of around $6.
Dollar transactions have become increasingly important in Maracaibo due to chronic blackouts that cripple point-of-sale operations. Due to long-running shortages of cash, those terminals are essential for transactions based in the local bolivar currency.
""Maracaibo is more dollarized due to the collapse of public services,"" said Ecoanalitica director Asdrubal Oliveros told reporters. ""Point of sale terminals do not work when the power fails.""
The World Food Program said this week that 59% of households do not have enough money to buy food and four out of 10 households face daily electricity interruptions.
Maduro has said that dollar transactions in Venezuela are an ""escape valve"" for the economy, although he maintains that he is ""aware of the inequalities that arise."""

345,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- When in doubt, buy volatility.
The old adage is holding strong, even as currency traders respond to shifts in sentiment in apparently conflicting ways. However else the currency market reacts, bets that there will be price swings look appealing.
That’s helped a gauge of volatility in the major currencies reach its highest level this week in nearly two months, as investors seek ways to factor in the coronavirus outbreak and growing risks of a technical recession in Italy and Japan.
It comes as new doubts over traditional correlations between market havens and risk appetite have encouraged investors to take cover through options trades. These help even when assets known for their safety, such as the yen, defy their reputations by falling during wider moves away from risk. Similarly, the dollar has recently bucked established trends in its relationship with U.S. Treasuries at times, by rising when yields on the bonds fall.
These unusual patterns might prove fleeting, but while they are occurring, it makes sense for traders to go with the rising tide of higher volatility in the currency market.
The cost of hedging the euro over a one-week period has reached its highest in four months, while buying volatility on the one-year tenor costs the most since early October. As the questions on what risk-off trading now actually looks like, volatility in dollar-yen is at multi-month highs across the curve.
Volatility Is Another Call Currency Traders May Have Got Wrong
At the same time, currency volatility gauges are beginning to track their counterpart for interest rates, in an about turn after decoupling for the better part of 2019. If that correlation holds, as long as efforts to price the next moves by the world’s major central banks remain a two-way trade, hedging the moves in the major currencies could become a costly exercise.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered from a two-week low on Wednesday as investors reduced expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal more policy easing as a deadly virus spread quickly outside China
As outbreaks started to quickly spread to the Middle East and Europe, some investors no longer saw the U.S. economy immune and started to bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates to support the U.S. economy.
But Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Tuesday as the central bank monitored the impact of the epidemic on the U.S. economy but it is still too soon to gauge if it would require a change in monetary policy.
While money markets have also increased expectations of more cuts from the Fed with interest rate futures now pricing in about 60 bps of cuts by the end of the year compared to only 40 bps a month earlier, investors were slightly more cautious.
The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, of a U.S. 2-year Treasury note auction was lesser than a similar sale, indicating hedge funds were not aggressively buying shorter-dated debt, expecting a more cautious Fed.
""The significant dovish tilt being priced in by markets from the FOMC may not materialize and that might cause the next leg of the dollar rally,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of multi-asset strategy at Mizuho Bank.
Against a basket of its rivals (=USD), the dollar edged 0.1% higher at 99.04, recovering from two-week low of 98.876 hit in the previous session.
In contrast to the Fed, the world's other major central banks such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have limited room for easing with their policy rates already at record lows.
""Markets had been under-estimating the risk of coronavirus but I think that phase is over by now,"" said Tatsuya Chiba, manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust Bank.
Chiba said the risk-off mood is likely to linger for another month or so until the market reach the extreme in the opposite direction by over-estimating the risk.
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar stood at $0.6603 , stuck near Monday's 11-year low of $0.6585.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar steadied on Wednesday after three days of declines but stayed on the defensive amid expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in the coming months to support the economy as coronavirus continues to spread around the world.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was at 98.96 by 03:30 AM ET (830GMT), having now lost 0.9% since it reached a three-year high last week.
The greenback initially rose as the virus spread, boosted by the perceived relative strength of U.S. financial assets. But with the outbreak spreading further around the world investors no longer see the U.S. economy immune and have started to bet the Fed will have to cut rates to offset the economic fallout from measures put in place to try to contain the virus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned Americans on Tuesday to prepare for a likely pandemic.
That warning contradicted claims by White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who told CNBC that “We have contained this, I won’t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight.”
Asia reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, including the first U.S. soldier to be infected and outbreaks in Italy and Iran spread to other countries.
The dollar pushed higher against the yen, to trade at 110.47, below the 10-month high set last Thursday after three straight days of losses.
The euro was holding steady at 1.0876, having regained ground since it hit near three-year low of 1.0778 on Thursday.
Treasury yields eased from record lows, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticking up to 1.352%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also up to 1.835%.
Concerns about the global economic impact of the coronavirus sent yields on safe-haven Treasuries to record lows on Tuesday.
In contrast to the Fed, the world's other major central banks such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have limited room for easing with their policy rates already at record lows.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar inched up on Wednesday in Asia, but the gains were capped as Federal health authorities warned that they expect a wider spread of the coronavirus in the state.
Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a news briefing that the agency expects a sustained transmission of the virus and called for citizens to plan for potential outbreak. 
“We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare, in the expectation that this could be bad,” Messonnier said.
Cities and towns should plan for “social distancing measures,” like dividing school classes into smaller groups of students or closing schools altogether. Meetings and conferences may have to be canceled, she said.
However, the health authorities said they are unsure about how severe the health threat could be.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar index weakened on Tuesday as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this year to relieve pressure on the economy caused by China's coronavirus outbreak.
The dollar rose last week to its highest level in years as the virus spread further around the world, with investors regarding all U.S. assets as safe havens. But the index has fallen this week as other safe havens have risen because money managers now think the Fed may be more inclined to cut rates since it has the most room to do so.
Rate cuts are inflationary, lowering the value of the dollar.
Expectations that the Fed will cut rates at least 25 basis points at its June meeting were at 78.3% on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The same tool shows a 4.1% chance that rates will be in the current 150-175 basis-point range in December, down from 28.6% a month ago.
""The potential for the economic fallout from the virus to wash up on U.S. shores has cooled the dollar’s rally to three-year peaks by knocking Treasury yields to multi-year lows and raising expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver more interest rate cuts to keep the record long expansion intact,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.
Against a basket of six other currencies the dollar slipped 0.401% to 98.939 (=USD), after reaching a three-year high of close to 100 last week.
The index fell in step with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR), which hit an all-time low, driven by safe-haven demand. That flight to safety also saw U.S. stock indexes fall, with Wall Street's three major indexes down almost 2% on Tuesday. [US/] (N)

Investing.com - The dollar eased on Tuesday following a recent run of strong gains amid heightened expectations that the anticipated hit to economic growth from the spread of the coronavirus will prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
Futures for the Fed funds rate have surged in the last few days to price in a 50-50 chance of a quarter-point rate cut as early as April. In all, they imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end.
Central banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have pledged fiscal stimulus measures, something western countries might also have to consider.
""It's been quite dramatic,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.
""We've seen not only a repricing of Fed expectations, but a bigger re-pricing because the Fed is the one that can actually do something in terms of moving the cash rate,"" he said.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester described the outbreak as a ""big risk"" on Monday.
""At this point, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects, but this new source of uncertainty is something I will be carefully monitoring,"" she said.
But Mester pushed back against the notion that the Fed would be driven to act in response to jittery financial markets.
""I just caution that you don't want to over-react to volatility in the markets if you're a monetary policymaker,"" she said.
Without too much good news on the virus, few expect the dollar to give back too much of its recent gains.
The outbreak has now affected 80,000 people globally and the death toll in Italy climbed to seven on Monday, adding to fears the virus is morphing into a pandemic that could wreak far greater economic damage than first thought.
China reported a rise in new coronavirus cases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, even though the rest of the country saw a fourth-straight day of declines.
South Korea, which has the most virus cases in Asia outside China, reported 60 new cases on Tuesday, increasing the total number of infected patients there to 893.
The euro edged up a little from recent three-year lows to reach 1.0863, while the dollar was trading at 110.52 per yen, off a 10-month high of 112.21.

The dollar initially rose as the virus spread further around the world, with investors eyeing all U.S. assets as safe-haven investments. However, money managers now think the Fed would be more likely to easy monetary policy and cut rates given that it benefits from the biggest room to do it.

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Tuesday that clusters of coronavirus cases had emerged in the country and that the government would take stronger steps to fight contagion, giving Asian investors another reason to stay cool on the yen, which has been tripped off its safe-haven status recently.
The yen last traded up 0.2% at 110.53 per dollar .
China, meanwhile, reported a rise in new coronavirus cases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, even though the rest of the country saw a fourth-straight day of declines.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro dropped back towards $1.08 on Monday and the Australian dollar tumbled to an 11-year low as the spread of the coronavirus outside China drove fears of a pandemic and sent investors to shelter in the dollar.
The safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained, but not by much - underlining how the dollar has become the currency of choice for investors because the U.S. economy is viewed as better sheltered if the virus hits global growth. 
Italy, South Korea and Iran reported sharp increases in coronavirus cases over the weekend. The World Health Organization is now worried about the growing number of cases that have no clear link to the epicentre of the outbreak in China.
""If you expect global growth to be lower on the back of this ... it still makes sense to bet on a stronger dollar,"" said Nordea analyst Morten Lund, who also cited the U.S. economy's relative strength and its higher yields.

The Swiss National Bank appears to have stepped up its interventions to prevent the franc from strengthening last week, as haven assets around the world got a fillip from rising risk aversion.
The amount of cash commercial banks hold at the central bank, known as sight deposits, rose by 2.1 billion francs ($2.1 billion) last week, the largest increase since early January, data on Monday showed.
Along with negative interest rates, interventions are part of the SNB’s toolkit to prevent an undue strengthening of the franc. Swiss officials rarely say when they’ve been in the market, and so analysts closely scrutinize the sight deposit data for clues.
“It looks like the SNB intervened,” said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Maxime Botteron. Still, activity appears to have been lower than in August, when the central bank was last suspected of launching a barrage of interventions to prevent the franc from strengthening, he said.
With the coronavirus outbreak spreading further outside China, investors have been shunning risky assets. Stocks slid on Monday and the franc was just shy of 1.06 per euro.
While markets in risk-off mode, “we’ve got to prepare for more interventions,” Botteron also said.
A spokeswoman for the central bank declined to comment on the rise in sight deposit data."

Investing.com - The safe-haven Japanese yen was little changed against the U.S. dollar on Monday in Asia despite concerns that global coronavirus spread are worsening.
An outbreak of cases outside of China has recently gained the market’s attention. Italy, South Korea and Iran posted sharp rises in infections over the weekend. South Korea, which reported 160 new cases today, now has more than 760 cases, while Italy reported more than 150 and Iran 43 cases.
Asian equities traded mostly lower today, with South Korean stocks slumping more than 3%. However, the Japanese yen, which usually moves in directions opposite to other risk assets, were not able to benefit from the worsening investor sentiment today.

Investing.com – The dollar fell sharply Friday, paced by losses against the pound and yen following data showing the key U.S. services sector unexpectedly contracted, signaling potential trouble ahead of the U.S. economy. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.57% to 99.57. But the world's reserve currency remains on track to round off the week at nearly five-months highs. 
The IHS Markit flash services sector Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to 49.4 in February, the lowest in six years, raising concerns about the health of the broader economy as services account for roughly 66% of total growth.
The weakness in manufacturing, continued, showing a weaker-than-expected reading of 50.8.
With signs of potential wobble in the U.S. economy, traders returned to the safe-heaven yen.
USD/JPY fell 0.42% to 111.64.
The pound, meanwhile, woke up from its recent slumber, rising 0.6% against the greenback amid more evidence the U.K. economy is on the mend.
U.K. manufacturing activity topped estimates in February, but services just missed economists' forecasts for a reading of 53.4, according to data from IHS Markit.
EUR/USD rose 0.68% to $1.0857 as better-than-expected eurozone composite purchasing managers' index data suggested the economic bloc has shrugged off the impact of the virus so far.
""For the time being, domestic demand has been able to counter the initial fallouts due to the coronavirus outbreak, thus removing pressure on the European Central Bank to consider easing measures to support the economy,"" UniCredit's economist Edoardo Campanella said.
USD/CAD fell 0.35% to C$1.3208, as the loonie rallied on better-than-expected Canadian retail sales data. RBC warned, however, ""economic activity should eventually rebound from temporary factors, but downside surprises are more likely at this stage in the economic cycle."""

Investing.com -- The dollar was mixed in early trade in Europe on Friday, coming off recent highs against the yen, euro and sterling but making further gains against emerging currencies.
By 3:30 AM ET (8:30 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed currencies, was down 0.2% at 99.56, having hit its highest level in nearly three years on Thursday.
However, that represents only a modest pull-back after a rise of nearly 4% in the weeks since the novel coronavirus outbreak in China started to grab headlines.
USD/JPY, which broke through 112 for the first time since April on Thursday, fell 0.4% to 111.69.
EUR/USD, which hit its lowest in three years earlier this week, rebounded sharply to $1.0820 after both the French and German flash purchasing managers indices for February came out higher than expected. AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas pointed out that the German numbers were ""less stellar under the hood"", given renewed weakness in new export orders.
The yen’s snap back has happened despite a further drop in both manufacturing and services PMI.
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management in London, warned that PMIs tend to exaggerate actual developments, given the mood swings of survey respondents.
“There is a very good possibility that surveys will reflect the business news cycle more than they reflect reality,” Donovan said in a morning podcast.
Also of note later will be U.K. public sector borrowing figures, the last to be released before the new government’s annual budget in March. The ousting of Treasury chief Sajid Javid, combined with newsflow since then, have increased expectations of a big widening in the fiscal deficit, which would argue against a further interest rate cut from the Bank of England.
The pound was up 0.2% at $1.2908
Overnight, the dollar continued to march higher against Asian currencies, a reflection of expectations that the slowdown in the Chinese economy will hit the likes of Japan, Indonesia and Thailand more than anywhere else.

“The number of cases in the rest of the world is very small compared to what we have in China, but that may not stay the same for long,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva on Thursday.
“The window of opportunity we have now may close, so we need to use the window of opportunity we have now by hammering the outbreak in any country,” he noted.
On the data front, the National Association of Realtors will report on January sales of existing residential buildings later in the day.
Existing home sales are expected to have ticked down 1.8% to an annual rate of 5.43 million last month, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Manufacturing numbers are also on their way. Traders expect the Markit’s preliminary purchasing managers’ index (PMI) to drop to 51.5. The services PMI is also expected to show a small drop, down to 53.
A host of Federal officials will speak today, including Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and Fed Governor Lael Brainard.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The yen was headed for its worst week in two-and-a-half years on Friday, as worries about the coronavirus' spread in South Korea, Japan and Beijing drove funds from Asia to the towering U.S. dollar.
Two days of heavy selling, following weak domestic data and growing fears about the virus' economic fallout, has the yen at its lowest since last April and investors questioning its worth as a safe haven. It has lost 2% on the dollar since Wednesday.
The virus has killed more than 2,200 people in mainland China and efforts to contain it have largely paralyzed the world's second biggest economy. On Friday South Korean authorities confirmed 52 new coronavirus infections, Yonhap reported, bringing its total to 156 and raising further alarm about the epidemic.
Two infected passengers from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo have died, and two passengers evacuated from the liner to Australia have now tested positive.
""New cases in (South) Korea and in Japan, (have) obviously given some people a little bit of cold feet regarding Japan and the yen as a safe haven,"" said David Bloom, global head of FX at HSBC.
""They're thinking: 'Maybe Swissy and gold are better'. So there is a little bit of scratching of heads, there's no doubt about it,"" he said, adding he was not yet prepared to abandon the idea of the yen as a safety play.
It morning trade it stood at 112.09 per dollar , mirroring weakness other currencies in Asia.
The Korean won has lost about 2% and broke past 1,200 to the dollar this week. The Australian dollar is parked by an 11-year low and, along with New Zealand's currency, has shed 1.5% for the week.
Both are down more than 5% for the year amid the exodus from export-exposed assets in favor of U.S. dollars.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is sitting pretty at a three-year peak. (=USD)
China's tightly-managed yuan is sitting just a fraction firmer than a two-and-a-half month low of 7.0547 per dollar touched in offshore trade overnight.
Meanwhile factory activity in Japan suffered its steepest contraction in seven years this month, data showed on Friday.
Should European Purchasing Managers' Index data show similar softness, another round of dollar buying may be in the offing.
""The U.S. is simply less exposed to any slowdown in global trade, and in terms of currencies it's the obvious candidate in terms of relatively limited impact from coronavirus,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow.
""If European business takes fright at coronavirus concern, that could be a fresh cause of dollar buying across the board.""

364,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 04:26PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Turkish state lenders flooded the market with dollars on Thursday to help take the edge off a deepening lira rout amid concern the country is edging closer to a military conflict with Russian-backed forces in Syria.
Government-owned lenders sold an estimated $800 million on Thursday to help stabilize the lira, according to two traders with knowledge of the matter. The transactions helped contain losses in the Turkish currency, which slipped 0.4% to a nine-month low of 6.1079 per dollar. Benchmark bond yields rose above 12% and the Borsa Istanbul 100 stock index dropped the most in the world.
The market jitters come as Turkey asked the U.S. to deploy two Patriot missile-defense batteries on its southern border to help deter future attacks by Syrian forces, according to a senior Turkish official. The Defense Ministry said two Turkish troops were killed and five wounded in an air strike in Syria’s Idlib on Thursday.
Turkey is trying to halt a Russian-backed Syrian government advance that’s threatening its efforts to establish a zone of control in the last rebel stronghold near its border. On Wednesday, the government issued its harshest warning yet to Russia, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying a military operation in Idlib is “just a matter of time.”
“This is getting dangerous,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at Bluebay Asset Management in London.
The face-off risks compounding a sell-off in Turkish assets, which are already reeling in the face of a resurgent dollar and an easing cycle that has pushed real interest rates below zero and driven the current-account balance back into a deficit. Turkey’s central bank reduced its key rate to 10.75% from 11.25% on Wednesday, the sixth straight easing move.
‘Smoke and Mirrors’
To help stem the rout, state banks have been intervening on the currency market by selling dollars. Authorities have also restricted swap transactions to make it difficult for foreign investors to bet against the lira.
“It makes people feel uncomfortable when the state owned banks seem to be in the market every day now selling FX but the lira continues to weaken,” Ash said. There’s a “general unease about the smoke and mirrors policy settings.”
The currency trimmed some its decline and was trading at 6.1047 per dollar as of 8:03 p.m. in Istanbul. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index closed the day down 3%, led lower by the nation’s largest listed lenders. The yield on the 10-year government bond jumped 37 basis points, the most since October.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The yen's status as a safe haven is coming under pressure as unease grows about the rising number of coronavirus cases in Japan, against the backdrop of a stuttering domestic economy.
Japan's currency tumbled to a nine-month low against the dollar and faced a barrage of selling against other currencies on Wednesday, in what traders and analysts say points to a flight of large portfolio investors from yen markets.
That runs counter to the long-standing assumption that Japanese funds would repatriate their money during a true global crisis, pushing the yen higher.
""You see any potential concern about the virus situation playing out in gold...and you're not seeing the same moves in the yen,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX for Asia at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Wealth Management in Singapore.
""Nearness to China and dependence on China in this current situation have not helped the yen as a risk-off,"" she said, adding that Japan's exposure to the virus outbreak and recent weak economic data had exacerbated the concerns.
The yen was quoted at 111.36 to the dollar on Thursday following Wednesday' decline of 1.3%, its biggest daily drop in five months.
Japan's currency also nursed big losses against the euro, the pound and the Australian dollar. At the same time, gold, which normally moves in concert with the yen, rose 0.6%.
Analysts were quick to pin the move to large portfolio shifts out of yen-denominated assets - most likely by Japan's giant government pension funds - amid worries about its economy and the spread of the coronavirus.
The outbreak started in China, but its spread through a cruise ship moored in Tokyo means Japan now has well over half of the known cases outside China.
There are already fears it will cast a pall over the Olympic Games in Tokyo, due to begin late in July and bring a hoped-for boost to the national economy and morale.
Should it start to spread through Japan's population, however, the fallout would almost certainly be enough to tip the world's third largest economy, which shrank unexpectedly hard last quarter, into recession.
Some 3 trillion yen ($27 billion) in net foreign bond purchases by Japanese investors in the first two weeks of February seems to underscore the lack of confidence in domestic investments.
The move lower in global interest rates has undermined the yen's attractiveness as a ""funding currency,"" or one cheap to borrow for use in buying riskier investments.
That weakens another string of the yen's safe-haven bow because the reversal of such trades in times of trouble was thought to be another factor to support its value.
""If nobody is using yen as a funder anymore, maybe there is no reason for the yen to trade as a safe haven,"" said Brent Donnelly, spot FX Trader at HSBC.
""Price action in the past year or two has raised the question,"" he said, pointing out the yen's muted response in recent months to tension on the Korean peninsula, trade-war spats and January's U.S.-Iran flashpoint in the Middle East.
""The price action overnight adds some urgency to the idea that we have crossed over into a new yen regime."""

Both dropped as much as 1% against the dollar, with Singapore’s currency falling to its lowest in almost three years. The won declined after the nation said virus cases more than doubled in one day.
“The sudden sharp spike to 82 cases in Korea -- contrary to slowing new cases in other parts of the world including China -- is a wake-up call to market complacency,” said Christopher Wong, senior FX strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. The won, along with Asian peers such as the Singapore dollar, may be some of “biggest casualties” as the economic fallout continues to worsen.
While the Singapore dollar and the won lead losses, almost every other Asian currency also tumbled given the close linkages among the economies in the region.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese yen traded near a nine-month low versus the dollar on Thursday as risk appetite improved on expectations that China will continue to take steps to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Chinese yuan held steady against the dollar in offshore trade before a widely expected cut in the country's benchmark loan prime rate later on Thursday.
The yen was initially bought as a safe-haven asset when the outbreak of the virus in the central Chinese province of Hubei roiled financial markets last month.
However, yen buying is starting to fade as growth in the number of new cases of the virus in mainland China starts to slow. Signs that Chinese officials are ready to take more drastic measures to support companies hit by the virus is another factor that has reduced demand for safe-haven investments.
""The yen's fall was so sudden that it could bounce back slightly in the very short term,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""However, sentiment is leaning away from risk-off because China will pull out all the stops to support its economy.""
The yen traded at 111.27 per dollar in Asia on Thursday, close to the lowest since May 2019.
Japan's currency tumbled 1.3% on Wednesday, its biggest daily decline since August, after triggering stop loss orders following the expiry of options that had kept the yen in a narrow range versus the dollar, according to Ishizuki.
In the offshore market, the yuan was little changed at 7.0100 per dollar as traders awaited additional policy stimulus from Chinese officials.
The People's Bank of China is expected to cut its benchmark rate on Thursday, which would follow a cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending on Monday.
China's manufacturing sector is gradually coming back on line after the outbreak of the virus led to temporary factory closures and severe travel restrictions, but many companies and households are likely to struggle due to income lost because of the illness.
China reported on Thursday a drop in new cases of the flu-like virus, and while many investors are skeptical of China's reporting methodology, the data has helped risk appetite improve in the currency market.
The Swiss franc , another safe-haven, was quoted at 0.9841 versus the dollar, close to its weakest since December.
Many traders say they remain cautious because the previously unknown virus has resulted in more than 2,000 deaths in China and spread to 24 other countries.
The euro (EUR=EBS) traded at $1.0810, close to its lowest since April 2017. The common currency managed to stabilize in Asian trading, but sentiment remains weak after disappointing economic data sent it crashing through closely-watched support levels.
The pound was quoted at $1.2924 before data later on Thursday that is forecast to show growth in British retail sales. Sterling fell 0.6% on Wednesday as market sentiment is caught between optimism about the economy and pessimism about Britain's talks with the European Union for a free trade deal.

Gains for chipmakers and banks led the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite toward records after Bloomberg News reported that China’s latest moves to aid growth include possible bailouts for hard-hit industries. The dollar climbed to a four-month high after data on housing starts and building permits exceeded analysts’ estimates. Treasuries held steady after minutes showed Federal Reserve officials viewed monetary policy as appropriate “for a time.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index reached new highs, and shares rose in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. The yen fell to a nine-month low on concern Japan’s economy may slip into a recession. Oil gained as U.S. sanctions on Russia’s largest producer and conflict in Libya put the focus on supply threats.
Investors appear relatively confident in the ability of policy makers to contain fallout from the deadly coronavirus, even after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). spooked markets earlier this week by warning of a slowdown in sales. Data released Wednesday showed the the housing market remains a bright spot for the U.S. economy amid sluggish business investment.
“Housing is an economic bellwether and seeing data like this gives investors a lot of reasons to be optimistic, at least for the U.S. market,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial.
Elsewhere, gold traded near its highest level since 2013, while palladium extended its record-breaking rally on forecasts for a widening supply deficit.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar remained near three-year highs on Wednesday, underpinned by better-than-expected economic data. The greenback had a muted reaction to the minutes of the Federal Reserve January meeting, which suggesting interest rates will likely be on hold for a time.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.23% to 99.52, touching its highest level since May 2017.
""With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time ... to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective,"" the minutes showed.
The minutes had a muted impact on the dollar, following U.S. housing and wholesale inflation data that topped economists' forecasts.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday U.S. homebuilding fell 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 1.6 million units in January. That was less than economists had expected.
The report also highlighted a sharp 9.2% rise in building permits to a rate of 1.5 million units. That was the highest in nearly 13 years, suggesting the housing market remains on solid footing, underpinned by lower mortgage rates.
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.5% last month, above economists' forecasts. In the 12 months through January, the PPI rose 2.1%.
The positive economic data helped the dollar rack up gains against the yen, which fell to eight-month lows on easing safe-haven demand amid signs the spread of the coronavirus virus is slowing.
USD/JPY surged 1.50% to Y111.51. 
The pound, meanwhile, continued to drift lower, shrugging off better-than-expected U.K. inflation data. 
GBP/USD fell 0.60% to $1.2919, while the EUR/USD was flat at $1.0795
USD/CAD slipped 0.24% to C$1.3226, with the loonie catching a bid on data showing consumer prices rose faster than expected last month.
But the rise in loonie may be short-lived as RBC said the current inflation readings were unlikely to prove ""a barrier to the Bank of Canada cutting its benchmark rate to support growth and get the economy back to its potential."""

(Reuters) - The euro's tumble below $1.08 for the first time in three years may be only the first milestone in its downward journey, with global newsflow, economic data and option market positioning all seemingly stacked against the single currency.
Euro-dollar, the world's most traded exchange rate, has weakened around 3.5% this year, the latest lurch coming on Tuesday when a dismal German investor sentiment survey and a forecast-beating U.S. manufacturing gauge highlighted the two economies' diverging fortunes.
(Graphic: U.S. economic surprises surge as euro zone flags link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2271/2239/economicsurprise.png)
Less than two months into 2020, the currency pair is showing signs it might break out of last year's $1.15/$1.09 range https://tmsnrt.rs/36KsNin which was the narrowest ever. And one-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected price swings, has spiked a whole percentage point above record lows touched last month .
(Graphic: Euro/dollar range png link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX/0H001R88KBPK/eikon.png)
Sluggish growth aside, the euro is dogged by the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the risk of U.S. trade tariffs, and finally, its low volatility - which makes it an ideal candidate for ""shorting"" against higher-yielding currencies.
Now many reckon the 17-year low of $1.0340 - reached in January 2017 - could be in sight for the currency. Whether that low is hit or not, market players are betting on more downside.
""The gutsy way to play it would be to cover your eyes and sell euro (in the spot market) but most people would play it through options,"" said Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Capital.
""At the moment it's a gift to buy euro downside options.""
Options are derivatives that allow holders to buy or sell an asset at a pre-agreed price within the stipulated time period for an upfront premium. Very simply, a 'put' confers the right to sell, while 'call' options allow holders to buy.
Gallo has a $1.03 strike price - the level where the option is exercised - noting the trade would be profitable even if the euro only dropped as low as $1.06.
Clearly, many other traders are also placing such bets.
Data from the Depositary Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) shows a spike in demand for euro 'put' options https://tmsnrt.rs/2SQT9dy over the past week. That's taken the ratio of euro put-call traded volumes to the widest since last August.
(Graphic: Euro/dollar put volumes spike over those for calls png link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX/0H001R8CHBZC/eikon.png)
And if there were around 5 billion euros worth of euro put options outstanding a week back, priced between 1.0850 and $1.0750 and expiring through March 31, that's since doubled as investors scramble to cover the risk of deeper declines.
To gauge just how dramatic the repricing has been, take a look at one-month euro-dollar risk reversals. As recently as Feb. 5, these option contracts showed an implied volatility premium for euro calls over puts at a two-year high. That's now flipped into a premium for euro puts over calls .
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said they saw the euro extending falls toward $1.0650, adding: ""Fading euro strength remains our key message.""
(Graphic: Risk reversals flip link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2286/2254/reversals.png)
The euro has paused for now, possibly benefiting from option barriers around $1.0775.
But traders say $1.0775 is the last of the big downside barriers, though lesser amounts may have been placed at half-cent intervals. In the event of fall under $1.0700, more euro downside may loom, as the break of major option levels often sends traders rushing to sell the currency in cash markets.
As for a recovery, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said the euro would need to hold at $1.076. But they added that ""near-term rallies will need to regain $1.0879 as an absolute minimum in order to alleviate immediate downside pressure."""

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar continues to gain fans Wednesday, with China’s coronavirus continuing to batter economies in Asia, Europe showing very few signs of growth while the U.S. economy exhibits a reasonably healthy glow.
At 03:05 ET (0805 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0798, after pushing as low as $1.0786 for the first time since April 2017. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.323, having earlier climbed as high as 99.382, at heights not seen for over two years. USD/JPY climbed 0.2% to 110.09, GBP/USD traded at 1.30, while USD/CNY traded around the physiologically important 7 level.
China, the world's second-largest economy, is still struggling to get its manufacturing sector back online after imposing severe travel restrictions to contain a virus that emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect China's economic growth could slow to 4.5% in the first quarter from 6% in the previous quarter, but some recently downgraded forecasts again into the 3-4% range.
At the same time, Japan’s GDP growth shrank the fastest in six years, according to data released Monday, Hong Kong is heading for its first back-to-back annual recessions on record, and Singapore will post its biggest budget deficit since at least 1997 as it tries to support its economy.
The news in Europe isn’t much better. The German ZEW sentiment index Tuesday, the first data reading post the coronavirus hit, deteriorated badly, while a leading industry lobby stated Wednesday that the German economy, the largest in the eurozone, is unlikely to see much genuine growth this year.
At the same time, on the U.S. side, the Empire state manufacturing sector survey was stronger than expected Tuesday, moving to the highest level since spring last year, before the U.S. escalated the trade war. 
This all points to more gains for the greenback ahead, particularly against the beleagured euro.
“Downside momentum in the cross thus remains intact as U.S. outperformance growth- and equity-wise dominate amid room to price out Fed cuts and positioning-wise to add USD longs, said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note, “Technically, the move opens for a possible test of 1.06 next, which would be an undershooting of our 6-12M target of 1.07.”
Of additional interest Wednesday will be the latest rate-setting meeting by the Turkish central bank. Since Governor Murat Uysal took over in July the Monetary Policy Committee has agreed five straight rate cuts, taking Turkey’s benchmark rate to 11.25%, below zero when adjusted for inflation.
The majority of analysts predict another decrease of between 25 basis points and 75 basis points, but there are some dissenters that see the key rate being kept unchanged.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall over the languishing euro and heavily sold exporter currencies on Wednesday, as investors reckoned with a deepening economic fallout from the coronavirus.

The yield curve between U.S. three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted overnight, a bearish economic signal, and German investor confidence slumped as its economy stagnates, sending the euro cheaper than $1.08 for the first time since 2017.

""The feared negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic in China on world trade have been causing a considerable decline of the Zew Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany,"" said Achim Wambach, Zew president.
The ongoing worries about the impact of the coronavirus on global growth is expected to maintain demand for the dollar against its rivals.

Investing.com - The return of risk aversion to the financial markets Tuesday has prompted more gains for the U.S. dollar, amid concerns about the extent of the damage caused by the coronavirus in China, but sterling is also showing signs of strength.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 99.073, having earlier climbed as high as 99.132, again at heights not seen for over two years. GBP/USD traded at 1.30, down just 0.1%. Additionally, the USD/CNY pair gained 0.3%, climbing to 7.0022, and back above the physiologically important 7 level.
The Australian dollar also traded lower after the Reserve Bank of Australia reiterated that low interest rates will probably be required for an extended period, flagging concerns about the coronavirus.
At 03:00 ET (0800 GMT), the AUD/USD pair fell 0.4% to 0.6683.
The number of new Covid-19 cases fell to 1,886 on Monday from 2,048 the day before. However, the World Health Organization cautioned Tuesday that ""every scenario is still on the table"" in terms of the epidemic's evolution.
Throw in tech giant Apple’s warning that it doesn’t expect to meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter; a senior Chinese official saying that the Covid-19 virus would have a “major” impact on February’s production and supply chains; and the likes of Capital Economics stating in a report that it is now all but certain that China's economy will contract in quarter-on-quarter terms in the first quarter, and it’s no surprise the dollar, which is often seen as a safe haven, is in demand.
The U.K. pound is a less likely buying candidate, but it has moved sharply higher against the beleaguered euro. 
Sterling closed last week on a high note after the resignation of Chancellor Sajid Javid, “many have taken as an indication that Boris Johnson’s team is gearing up for a more significant fiscal stimulus package set to be announced in March,” said John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank. “The prospects for an economic rebound on fiscal policy doing the heavy lifting would allow the Bank of England to maintain the policy rate unchanged for now.”
This has resulted in the euro falling back its lowest level versus the pound since the December election and since just after the Brexit vote back in 2016.

More losses are possible, with the German ZEW, at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), likely to show a sharp drop in confidence in the eurozone’s largest economy with this being the first post-coronavirus sentiment indicator. Additionally, employment data in the U.K., half an hour earlier, is likely to show the jobs market remains healthy."
381,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 12:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t write off the yen as a haven.
It’s true that Japan’s currency has failed to break out of a relatively narrow range against the dollar in recent years -- despite a trade war, tensions in the Middle East and North Korea, Brexit and now a deadly viral outbreak.
But a close examination of price moves, capital flows and Japan’s overseas investments shows that the yen still offers a safe harbor in times of trouble.
While it has climbed just 2.5% versus the greenback since the start of 2018, the yen has jumped 12% against a wider basket of its Group-of-10 peers.
Japan has maintained its status as the world’s biggest holder of foreign assets. In times of great domestic crisis, like the earthquake and tsunami of 2011, the yen can surge rather than slump as investors bring money home to rebuild.
“The dollar’s resilience is masking the yen’s appreciation in times of risk aversion,” said Tsuyoshi Ueno, a senior economist at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo. “There is no change to the yen’s low-risk nature.”
But the changing composition of Japan’s current-account surplus does mean that less money is being repatriated on a regular basis, reducing some of the upward pressure on the currency.
The nation’s trade balance has dwindled in recent years while financial investments abroad have climbed and manufacturers have set up more factories overseas. Unlike exporters, who typically buy yen to bring their earnings back to Japan, money tied up in factories and offshore investments stays put longer.
A steady stream of international acquisitions by Japanese companies has bolstered this trend.
Japanese investors hunting for higher-yielding foreign securities have also taken advantage of bouts of yen strength, capping gains. Portfolio flow data show that pension funds acquired a record amount of overseas bonds in January.
“Income from overseas investments in principle doesn’t come back to Japan,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo. Along with dollar strength, this has contributed to the yen trading in a “stale” range, leading some traders to mistakenly question its haven status, according to Ishizuki.
The yen has traded between 105 and 112 against the dollar in the past year. It fluctuated more against the euro over the same period, moving between 116 to 128.
A correlation between moves in the yen and U.S. stocks also adds weight to the view about the currency’s value as a hedge against risk. Whenever American equities begin moving wildly, the yen tends to get bought as a haven.
Leverage funds have also cut their bearish bets on the yen to around the least since October last year, according to CFTC data.
“It would be difficult to see the yen sold on risk-off,” said NLI’s Ueno. “The yen’s status as a haven currency remains structurally intact.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro fell toward a three-year low versus the dollar ahead of a highly watched German survey on Tuesday, which is expected to show a sharp slump in investor confidence and fuel growing pessimism about the outlook for Europe's largest economy.
Financial markets clung to tight ranges following a U.S. public holiday on Monday, shifting the investor focus to European news and developments in the coronavirus crisis.
Among Asian currencies, the Australian dollar slipped below the 67 U.S. cent level after minutes from the central bank's last meeting revived the prospect of policy easing while the Chinese yuan was weighed by worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus.
Sentiment for the euro has worsened dramatically this month after weak manufacturing and gross domestic product data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, suggested that the euro zone is more vulnerable to external shocks that previously thought.
""The euro is close to testing an important support level at $1.08 due to the diverging economic outlook between the euro zone and the United States,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""It looks a little oversold, so in the very short-term there could be a bounce, but the euro's fundamentals still point more to the downside.""
The euro (EUR=EBS) fell 0.12% to $1.0827 in Asia, close to its lowest since April 2017.
Since the start of February, the single currency has lost 2.4% versus the greenback as disappointing economic data raised concerns that euro zone monetary policy will have to remain accommodative for much longer.
The euro's next hurdle is the release of Germany's ZEW survey later on Tuesday, which is forecast to show economic sentiment slipped from the highest since July 2015.
Sterling also nursed losses against the dollar and the euro due to worries about economic ties between Britain and the European Union as both sides laid out conflicting views on how to proceed with trade negotiations.
The pound held steady at $1.2998 in Asia on Tuesday following a 0.3% decline in the previous session. Sterling (EURGBP=D3) was quoted at 83.33 pence per euro, nursing a 0.4% decline on Monday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost said on Monday Britain would not be threatened into following EU rules to win a free trade agreement with the bloc.

The onshore yuan was a tad lower at 6.9859 versus the dollar, unsettled by a decline in Chinese shares after Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said it will not meet sales targets because the virus epidemic has slowed production and demand in China.
China's Hubei province, considered the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, said new cases of the illness fell slightly to 1,807 on Monday from 1,933 the previous day.
Currency traders are cautiously monitoring new data on the virus given uncertainty about the actual number of cases and difficulties in estimating when the epidemic will peak.

Investing.com -- The dollar was mixed against developed-market peers in early trading on Monday after hitting a new four-month high in overnight trading.
The greenback was also a touch weaker against the Chinese yuan after the People’s Bank of China added to its already extensive stimulus measures since the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus in cutting its medium-term financing rate to a new record low.
The measures reflated Chinese asset markets still further, leaving the benchmark stock index where it was before the New Year holiday, but have done little to lift the uncertainty over the path of the Chinese economy as it struggles with the virus outbreak.
By 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the dollar against half a dozen developed-market currencies, was at 99.007, thanks largely to gains against the Japanese yen in the wake of data showing that the Japanese economy shrunk at an annual pace of 6.3% in the fourth quarter.
That number was far worse than the 3.7% drop expected and came after a hike in the country’s consumption tax in October.
""Annualization always exaggerates trends,"" said UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan on a morning briefing, noting the one-off hits from a sales tax increase in October and a subsequent typhoon.
By 3:45 AM ET, USD/JPY was at 109.86, up 0.1%. The dollar was also a touch stronger against Sterling at $1.3029, while EUR/USD edged up from last week’s lows to $1.0838.
Trading is expected to be relatively quiet on Monday, not just because of the U.S. President’s Day holiday, but also because of key business sentiment surveys later in the week. ‘Flash’ purchasing managers indices from IHS Markit are due on Friday.
Nordea analyst Martin Enlund argued in a note at the weekend that the euro may be close to its near-term lows.
“Hard data looks terrible in Germany, but maybe we shouldn’t care too much about it?” Enlund wrote, adding that the usually-reliable Ifo survey “suggests that we are close to peak negativity around German hard data.”
However, he acknowledged a risk that the euro’s decline could prompt further U.S. tariffs from President Donald Trump, an action that could stop any euro turnaround in its tracks."

Investing.com - The yen traded slightly lower on Monday in Asia after Japan reported a much deeper economic contraction than expected.
The USD/JPY pair inched up 0.1% 109.81 after the Cabinet Office reported today that Japan’s GDP in the December quarter fell an annualized 6.3%, faster than the expected 3.7% contraction.
The drop, which followed a revised 0.5% gain in July-September, was the biggest since a 7.4% decline marked in April-June 2014.
Meanwhile, the USD/CNY pair fell 0.2% to 6.9760 
On Sunday, China reported 1,933 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, down from 2,009 the previous day, and 100 new deaths, down one from 142 the previous day.
The economic impact of the epidemic is still unknown. Some analysts have estimated that China's annual growth could slow to between 4% and 5%, down from the 6% annual growth estimated by the government.
The AUD/USD pair gained 0.2% to 0.6727.
The GBP/USD pair was near flat at 1.3043. The U.K. will release a slew of data this week, including the December jobs report and the latest inflation figures.
Reports on retail sales, manufacturing and services PMI data for February are also due.
The EUR/USD pair traded 0.1% higher to 1.0838. The euro fell to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since April 2017 last Friday after Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, reported that GDP growth stagnated at the end of 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro was on the back foot on Monday, as concerns mounted about weakening economic growth in Europe at a time financial markets and policymakers fret about a new threat to the global economy from a fast spreading coronavirus in China.
The euro, which hit a 33-month low of $1.0817 on Friday, fetched $1.08385 (EUR=) in early Asian trade on Monday, flat so far on the day but down 2.3% since the start of month.
""Coronavirus is increasingly looking like a long-term issue and thus, at least for currency markets, it will be playing second fiddle,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, manager of currencies at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""In contrast, sentiment on the euro is becoming clearer, with weak economic fundamentals helping to push it down,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, manager of currencies at Societe Generale.
The German economy stagnated in the fourth quarter due to weaker private consumption and state spending, data showed on Friday, renewing fears of a recession at a time Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are preoccupied with a search for a new leader.
Europe's biggest economy posted zero growth from the previous quarter while separate data showed euro zone gross domestic product grew 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, in line with forecasts but the weakest since 2014.
Most market players expect stronger growth in the United States although data published on Friday provided a mixed picture.
U.S. core retail sales was flat last month, lagging expectations of 0.3% growth while its rise in December was revised down to 0.2% from a previously reported 0.5%.
Industrial production also shrank more than expected by 0.3%.
Still, economists have blamed one-off factors such as warm weather and output suspensions stemming from troubles at Boeing (N:BA) for the downbeat numbers.
The dollar index (=USD) stood at 99.131, near Friday's 4 1/2-month high of 99.241.
Japan's economy was also under increasing strain, with GDP figures released on Monday coming in far below economist' forecasts, hitting Tokyo shares even though reaction in the currency market was muted.
The world's third-largest economy shrank 1.6% in the three months to December, the largest drop in six years, hit by sales tax hike.
The yen stood at 109.81 yen per dollar , little moved in a tight range for more than a week.
The Australian dollar held firm as investors assessed the latest reading on coronavirus cases in China's Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The province reported 1,933 new cases, up slightly from the previous day, bringing the total so far to more than 58,000, but the number of new deaths fell to 100 from 139.
The Australian dollar fetched $0.67155 . The currency, which is used as a proxy for risk on Chinese assets because of Australia's high trade exposure to the Asian giant, has partly been supported by expectations of stimulus from Beijing.
The offshore yuan was also slightly higher at 6.9857 yuan per dollar ."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real rose more than 1% against the dollar on Friday to chalk up its biggest rise since late November after the central bank intervened in the swaps market for the second straight day following the currency's slump this week to new lows.
In late trading, the real was changing hands at 4.2940 per dollar, up 1.3% on the day. The greenback slid below 4.30 reais (BRBY) after the central bank's $1 billion sale of 20,000 foreign exchange swaps contracts.
On Thursday, the greenback was at a record high above 4.38 reais before the first central bank intervention.
(Graphic: Brazil real- daily change - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2149/2117/BRLWEEKLY.png)
The real was on course for a 0.5% rise on the week, snapping a run of six consecutive weekly declines that had brought its year-to-date losses against the dollar close to 10%.
The intervention announcement ""reaffirms expectations that the central bank would eventually try to cap the upside in dollar/real, and could bring some near-term support to the currency,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a client note.
""However, we remain structurally bearish on the real, as disappointing growth, the erosion of carry, and a widening current account limits the attractiveness of Brazil as a destination for foreign portfolio flows,"" they added.
The central bank offered relief to those market participants bullish on the real, who had seen the exchange rate go against them. But traders said it may have to come back into the market if the real is to stage a more sustained recovery.
""$2 billion in FX swaps is nothing. They were able to curb the depreciation and make the real outperform, at least today. However, the framework is still very fragile,"" said one senior trader in Sao Paulo.
""With (market-based) rates going down and growth deteriorating, the market will try to buy dollars back,"" he said.
Citing weak economic growth, unattractive yields and a widening current account deficit, Capital Economics on Friday revised their dollar/real outlook for this year to 4.50 from 4.25, one of the most bearish real forecasts among economists."
388,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 12:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's currency will fall to a new low of 4.50 per dollar this year, Capital Economics forecast on Friday, predicting slower growth, lower interest rates and worse balance of payments dynamics than the current market consensus.
One of the most gloomy outlooks to date for the real, it assumes renewed selling pressure will knock away any support the currency gets from the central bank's intervention in the swaps market this week.
The last Reuters poll published on Feb. 5 projected the real at 4.00 per dollar in 12 months time, and the latest weekly central bank 'FOCUS' survey of economists put it at 4.10 per dollar at the end of this year.
On Friday it was trading around 4.31 per dollar (BRBY).
""We see little to justify the consensus view that the real will end the year much stronger,"" Capital Economics chief emerging market economist William Jackson wrote in a note explaining the change in his year-end call to 4.50 per dollar from 4.25.
""In the short term, the real could recover much more lost ground if fears about the coronavirus ease and commodity prices rise. But we think the currency will, ultimately, weaken over the rest of the year,"" he said.
Jackson expects Brazil's economy will expand by 1.5% this year, against government, central bank and market consensus forecasts comfortably above 2.0%. Demand remains weak, even this long after the 2015-16 recession, he said.
The real fell as low as 4.38 per dollar (BRBY) this week, prompting the central bank into its first currency intervention for three months, and its first swaps market intervention for 18 months.
The real roared back to 4.30 per dollar on Friday, chalking up its biggest gain since mid-December."
389,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The slide of so many bond yields below zero may cost pension funds and other institutional investors a trillion dollars this year.
Investors could lose $864 billion on debt with negative yields over the next 12 months, according to Daniel Tenengauzer, head of markets strategy at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp. He predicts bond holders could separately shed another $176 billion in lost purchasing power through the securities, which would guarantee a loss if held to maturity.
Around the world, traders must pay to lend on $13 trillion of debt as the coronavirus and heightened economic uncertainty help to underpin demand for the safest assets. Retirement funds are particularly exposed because they have few other secure places to store their assets, but need to generate returns to support pension holders into old age.
“Across the board people are living longer after 65 and spending more money on health care,” Tenengauzer said by phone. “On the other side you have a massive amount of assets in your portfolio that you need to pay to hold.”
Negative-yielding debt has shaken up the conventional wisdom that investors should be compensated for lending to governments or companies. Investors can still earn a return if bond prices keep rising, or by taking advantage of favorable currency dynamics that effectively inflate returns.
“It’s fine if there is growth but at the moment the global economy is not growing any more so portfolio managers may be stuck with an asset they can’t sell,” he said.
Pension assets reached $44.1 trillion worldwide at the end of 2018, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Pension funds and all retirement vehicles across OECD member states held 45% of assets in bonds and bills, compared with about 55% in 2008.
Tenengauzer’s lost purchasing power calculations take into account 1% inflation and minus 0.26% yield, he said in a note. The market loss calculations assume the bonds normalize to compensate for inflation to yield about 1%, assuming a current 4.9-year average duration.
Greater Risk
The global stockpile of negative-yielding debt has dwindled since the peak of U.S.-China trade tensions in August 2019, when a third of all investment-grade bonds -- $17 trillion -- had rates below 0%. It touched a year-to-date high in late January amid tensions in the Middle East, before easing off.
The phenomenon effectively forces portfolio managers into riskier assets to deliver returns, which may be beyond their mandate and which could prove unsellable in future. The Dutch government in September criticized the European Central Bank’s latest wave of monetary easing amid fears about the fallout for its domestic pensions industry.
“The real issue is what these low returns are doing to pension funds and insurance companies,” said Chris Iggo, the chief investment officer of core investments at AXA Investment Managers. “They impact on solvency and also increase risks as it becomes more difficult to match the duration of their liabilities with their assets.”"

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remains in demand, and it’s the beleaguered euro which is taking a lot of the associated beating Friday as investors fret about low growth in the single currency region.
The dollar was also underpinned by the announcement of the New York Federal Reserve on Thursday that it will cut the volume of its open market operations slightly ahead of schedule, tightening liquidity in U.S. funding markets.
At 03:00 ET (0800 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0842, having fallen as low as 1.0828 overnight, the lowest level since April 2017. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.957, again just off heights not seen for over two years. GBP/USD traded at 1.3058, trading in relatively quiet waters. 
Thursday’s GDP figures for Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, showed that growth stagnated at the end of 2019, leaving the economy in a weakened state even before the emergence of the new coronavirus threat.
December saw the biggest drop in German industrial production since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
Adding to these weak figures, the European Commission's gloomy outlook for the European economy did nothing to help lift sentiment surrounding the euro, analysts at Danske Bank said, in a research note.
“Although the EC still sees the euro area on a 'path of steady and moderate growth' with GDP expanding by 1.2% in 2020, the report stressed that risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, not least with the coronavirus outbreak as a key new downside risk emerging,” Danske Bank said.
The Danish bank has recently lowered its euro area GDP growth forecast to 0.8% for 2020, from 0.9%.
The latest growth figures for the euro zone as a whole are scheduled for release at 5:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), and are expected to show growth of 0.1% on the quarter, 1.0% on the year. The risk is for a downside surprise, after the German release.
Contrast this state of affairs with the economic outlook in the U.S., and there’s no surprise the single currency is feeling the pinch. The latest U.S. employment numbers are strong, annual GDP growth was 2% last year, and the Federal Reserve felt confident enough about the banking sector to shrink repo operations further.
“Our baseline is now for a continued relative underperformance of European financial assets relative to USD denominated assets,” added Danske Bank. “Hence, we have revised our EUR/USD profile materially, to 1.07 on 12M, down from 1.15 previously.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds betting that the Swiss franc will climb further against the euro will soon meet their match, according to investors who are taking the other side of the trade.
The Swiss currency on Thursday climbed to a 4-1/2 year high of 1.061 francs per euro (EURCHF=EBS), fast approaching the point where its central bank will feel compelled to ensure currency strength does not harm the country's export-dependent economy, these investors argue.
A catalyst was Switzerland's inclusion last month into a U.S. Treasury watchlist for currency manipulation, which led many to bet the central bank would take a more hands-off approach to the franc.
Concerns about the euro zone economy have also contributed significantly to franc gains versus the euro, handing a 2%-plus profit to hedge funds that piled into the franc and sold the euro a month back.
But many reckon the SNB remains too concerned about franc strength pressuring inflation and exports to stop intervening altogether.
""We think the move downward (in the euro/franc exchange rate) has been overdone,"" said Van Luu, Head of Currency and Fixed Income Strategy at Russell Investments.
Luu said the Swiss National Bank would ""continue to manage the FX as it has explicitly stated its role in monetary policymaking,"" adding that the franc was the most shorted currency in its $5.6 billion FX fund.
According to some measures the franc is now at least 4% overvalued. Yet speculators' net long position on the franc versus the dollar has swelled to the biggest since late-2016 .
These positions are at risk of a shakeout if the central bank intervenes suddenly.
Against the euro, hedge funds have focused on buying the franc and selling the euro on spot markets, often magnifying their bets with leverage. Option traders said volatility on euro/franc derivatives markets was low and trading volumes very thin.
What would it take to force the SNB's hand?
Ian Gunner, portfolio manager at hedge fund Altana Wealth, said headlines about franc strength was ""the last thing the SNB wants to see.
""I'm looking for a sign that we have bottomed against the euro,"" he said, pointing to 1.05 francs as the level beyond which the SNB would have to act.
Investors interviewed for this article generally saw 1.05 francs per euro - just 1% from current levels - as the threshold.
Andreas Koenig, global head of FX at Amundi Asset Management, said the threshold had shifted from a range of 1.10-1.08 francs per euro before the watchlist was released to 1.08-1.06 francs today, a band it is close to breaching.
(GRAPHIC: CHF positions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2078/2046/CHF%20positions.png)
NOT SO STRONG
Still, the SNB may not be panicking just yet.
Despite the franc's gains versus the euro and outperformance compared to another safe-haven currency, the yen versus the dollar, its showing more broadly is less impressive even with safe-haven flows driven by China's coronavirus outbreak.
The franc is down 1% versus the dollar so far in 2020 .
And while the trade-weighed franc index has climbed, it is well off 2017 highs when the SNB called the currency 'significantly overvalued'.
(GRAPHIC: Swiss trade weighted exchange rate - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2077/2045/Swiss%20trade%20weighted%20exchange%20rate.png)
The SNB denies its interventions aim to give Switzerland a trading advantage, instead noting the impact a highly-valued franc has on inflation.
But the symbolism of appearing on the watchlist may have taken on new meaning under U.S. President Donald Trump.
""It's a new environment. These are not empty threats. They (the U.S.) will follow through,"" said Stephen Jen, hedge fund manager at Eurizon SLJ Capital, describing the political capacity of Switzerland to intervene as ""compromised"".
Recent sight deposit data, a gauge of Swiss central bank activity, indeed suggests the SNB has not been intervening significantly.
The bank is - at least verbally - sticking to its guns. Chairman Thomas Jordan said last week the SNB would still intervene if necessary.
Amundi's Koenig is positioning for ""tactical recovery"" in euro/franc.
""The market thinks the SNB cannot do anything anymore. But the SNB is not at the end of its possibilities."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese yen held onto gains against the dollar on Friday, as fresh doubts about the scale of the coronavirus outbreak supported demand for safe-haven currencies.
The Chinese yuan nursed losses as the flu-like virus, which emerged late last year in China's central Hubei province, slammed the brakes on consumer spending and manufacturing.
The euro languished at multi-year lows versus the dollar and the Swiss franc as investors grow more pessimistic about the outlook in the euro zone before the release of gross domestic product data later on Friday.
In contrast, the pound rode a wave of optimism into Asia on Friday due to hopes that a British cabinet reshuffle will lead to more expansionary fiscal policy to support growth.
Officials in Hubei stunned financial markets on Thursday by announcing a sharp increase in new infections and deaths from the coronavirus, reflecting the adoption of a new method to diagnose the illness.
Uncertainty about the real extent of the epidemic is likely to discourage investors from taking on excessive risk until there is sufficient evidence that its spread has slowed.
""There is a return of risk aversion, so yen and other safe-haven assets have risen, but reaction so far has been temporary and limited,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The change of reporting standards in China is a concern. There is a fear that China is still hiding something.""
The yen held steady at 109.81 per dollar in Asia on Friday, following a 0.25% gain the previous session.
In the onshore market, the yuan slipped 0.09% to 6.9841 per dollar, while its offshore counterpart eased slightly to 6.9860, following a 0.2% decline on Thursday.
Hubei officials on Friday reported 4,823 new cases and 116 new deaths as of Feb. 13, but investors were still reeling after the province reported 14,840 new cases and a record daily increase in deaths on Thursday, using new diagnostic methods to reclassify a backlog of cases.
China's economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.
The coronavirus was first detected in Hubei's capital Wuhan, a nerve centre in the global supply chain. It has so far claimed more than 1,300 lives in China and spread to 24 other countries.
The euro (EUR=EBS) fell 0.1% to $1.0827, the lowest since April 2017, as investors braced for the release of GDP data from Germany and the euro zone later on Friday.
The single currency (EURCHF=EBS) was quoted at 1.0618 Swiss francs, close to the lowest since August 2015. The euro (EURGBP=D3) eased slightly to 83.06 pence, close to the weakest since December.
Sentiment for the euro worsened after data earlier this weak showing a plunge in euro zone manufacturing output reinforced expectations that monetary policy will remain accommodative.
The pound was little changed at $1.3046 following a 0.64% gain on Thursday due to expectations that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's appointment of a new finance minister will lead to more fiscal spending to help Britain weather its transition away from the European Union."

China’s currency and bond markets have been devoid of traders as coronavirus cases continue to climb. That has made it tougher to gauge the outbreak’s market impact.
Daily transactions involving the yuan have on average halved since the market reopened on Feb. 3 after a week-plus holiday, compared to levels over the past year, according to data from the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. Daily turnover on cash bonds have been about one-third its 12-month average.
Some traders on the mainland haven’t yet returned to work as firms have temporarily reduced staff in an effort to help curb the coronavirus. Others are working remotely, taking advantage of billions in investment into cloud computing and other virtual infrastructure that financial firms have made in recent years.
“The fact that the FX volumes are only about half means it’s not really reflecting genuine transactions,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.. “Factories are still shut, so businesses are still trying to get things back up and running. You don’t have the normal exporting or buying activity, so that’s reflected in FX volume.”
Commercial banks and institutional investors are the biggest players in the country’s currency and bond markets. But Chinese stock trading -- which is dominated by retail investors -- has soared as people can easily place bets from smartphones or home PCs. And equities prices have erased much of their post-holiday decline.
As trading volume was low for bonds, 10-year sovereign debt had its best week in five years while investment banks cut expectations on Chinese economic growth for both this quarter and 2020. Ji Tianhe, a strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, sees more gains once more market participants return, notably leveraged bond buyers.
“I think if everyone resumed work, there would be a stronger buying trend in the bond market,” he said. “But because many leveraged traders aren’t participating, the yields haven’t gone down by as much they would if all traders had returned.”
Those who have been trading don’t believe the lack of activity itself is preventing deals from happening. Rather, the slow action is largely a result of manpower issues.
“Many financial institutions delayed the start of work last week” and are “keeping only the minimum number of staff required,” said Chen Peiqi, a trader at Bank of Jiangsu Co. “That shift system will probably continue in the next two weeks.”
Xi Vows China Will Beat Virus While Economists Slash Forecasts
The spread of 2019-nCoV, which the pathogen is officially known as, has closed businesses of all stripes and transformed city centers into ghost towns. It’s also forced the world’s largest work-from-home experiment. Traders in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu -- provinces that were among the biggest dollar buyers in the onshore currency market last year -- resumed work this week. But yuan volume has only risen modestly.
Low trading levels exaggerated the moves when markets reopened on Feb. 3, said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. That’s when the yuan saw its biggest decline in six months, weakening through the key 7 per dollar level. It recovered some afterward and has remained slightly stronger than 7 this week.
China’s central bank has moved to support the markets by injecting the financial system with liquidity. The People’s Bank of China added a net 240 billion yuan ($34 billion) of cash this month and lowered interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements. Still, the total trading volume on pledged repurchase agreements is just half of January’s high, a drop-off which hasn’t occurred following previous Lunar New Year holidays.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance said this week that local governments can sell another 848 billion yuan ($121 billion) of debt this month. That comes as just 128 billion yuan of corporate notes are expected to be sold in two weeks ending Friday, according to Bloomberg calculations. The figure is less than one-quarter what was issued in the two weeks prior to the holiday and not quite 60% of the two weeks following last year’s Chinese New Year break."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro dropped to more than two-year lows against the dollar on Thursday as concerns about a sharp rise in the number of new cases in the coronavirus outbreak in China led investors to seek out U.S. assets.
The United States is better placed to weather the economic impact of the virus than the eurozone.
The coronavirus death toll in China's Hubei province increased by a record 242 on Thursday to 1,310, with a sharp rise in confirmed cases after the adoption of new methodology for diagnosis, health officials said.
""Europe, and Germany in particular, have very strong trade linkages to Asian markets, and specifically with China,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York.

The euro (EUR=) dropped as low as $1.0835, the lowest since May 2017. It breached technical support at the October low of $1.0877 on Wednesday. That leaves the currency vulnerable to further losses, analysts said.
The single currency also fell against the safe haven Swiss franc (EURCHF=) to 1.0610 francs, its lowest level since August 2015.
The Japanese yen  gained against the dollar to 109.78 yen.
The greenback has benefited against the euro from a popular carry trade, where investors borrow in low-yielding currencies such as the euro and invest in dollars or other higher-yielding currencies.
Expectations that central banks will hold rates low, and may provide more accommodation if the coronavirus harms the global economy, is supporting risk appetite and may reduce the likelihood of a sharp selloff in stocks.
""The perspective is that rates will remain low, and that is cushioning some of the downside on the equity side,"" Issa said.
Stocks overcame earlier weakness to hit record highs on Thursday. They have set a record closing high every day this week. 

U.S. data on Thursday showed that U.S. underlying consumer prices picked up in January as households paid more for rents and clothing, supporting the Federal Reserve's contention that inflation would gradually rise toward its 2% target.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar edged higher Thursday, supported by firmer U.S. inflation data, but a rise in the pound and yen kept gains in check.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.06% to 98.98.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index rose 0.2%, in line with expectations last month, while the year-on-year CPI rose to 2.5%, topping forecasts for a 2.3% rise.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled that a faster pace of inflation would push the central bank off the sidelines. But this latest inflation report is unlikely to shift the Fed's thinking on monetary policy as its preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, remains below the 2% target.
""Today's data should not impact the Fed's on-hold policy stance,"" said High Frequency Economics.
A surge in the pound, meanwhile, kept the dollar in check on rising hopes Prime Minister Boris Johnson is eyeing fiscal stimulus after showing U.K. finance minister Sajid Javid the door.
Javid reportedly resigned after Johnson asked him to fire his closest advisers in order to keep his position, the Financial Times reported.
GBP/USD rose 0.70% to $1.3051.
EUR/USD fell 0.28% to $1.0841, and analysts are calling for a further decline as the sluggish pace of growth in the EU continues.
""The euro area remains a region of low growth, accompanied by weak inflation dynamics and our baseline is for a continued relative underperformance of European financial assets,"" Danske said.

TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-and-a-half-year low against the Swiss franc on Thursday and the yen gained as investors sought safe havens after China's Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, reported a sharp increase in the number of new cases.
Using a new method of diagnosis, the province reported on Thursday 14,840 new cases of the virus as of Feb. 12, up from 1,638 new cases on Tuesday. The number of deaths in the province rose by 242, a daily record, to 1,310.
""Taken together, it suggests fading the overnight reaction,"" said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
The initial move was to dump risky assets, however. After weakening to a three-and-a-half-week low the day before, the yen gained 0.3% against the dollar on Thursday to 109.770 yen.
The euro dipped to 1.0622 francs, below its 2016 trough of 1.0623 and its lowest level since August 2015. It last stood around 1.06235 (EURCHF=).
""When you see numbers like this, you can't help but move to risk-off trades, which means buy the yen and sell stocks,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo.
In the onshore market, the yuan slipped 0.13% to 6.9809 per dollar. The offshore yuan dropped 0.14% to 6.9830.

Investing.com -- The euro was stuck near a two-and-a-half-year low after early trading on Thursday, after a fresh surge in coronavirus cases in China added to concerns about the impact of the outbreak on an already weak eurozone economy.
By 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), EURUSD was at $1.0877, up less than 1% on the day and only just off an overnight low of $1.0865, which marked its lowest level since May 2017. GBP/USD was up 0.2% at $1.2985
Sentiment toward the euro has been badly hit by the sharpest drop in industrial production in a decade in December, which pointed to the likelihood of recession in both Germany and Italy, the biggest and third-biggest economies in the currency bloc.
Analysts at   Barclays   (LON:BARC) warned of a “synchronized decline” in output across the region, but noted that it contrasted with an improvement in sentiment surveys in January.
“As surveys point to a (sizeable) rebound in January and the extent of output disruption caused by the outbreak of nCov remains hard to gauge, the picture for manufacturing activity in Q1 remains blurry,” they wrote.
There was no noticeable impact from jobless data in France on Thursday, which showed the unemployment rate fell sharply to 8.1% in the fourth quarter, its lowest since before the financial crisis in 2008.
Overnight, Chinese authorities had revised estimates for cases of the Covid-19 disease by nearly one-third after switching to a new testing methodology. The number of recorded deaths also leaped by over 200. The Communist Party also dismissed its Hubei regional head and its city chief in Wuhan, in an effort to assuage public anger at the way it has handled the crisis so far.
“This outbreak could still go in any direction,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva on Wednesday.
Haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, ticked up after losing over 1% against the dollar since the start of the month. However, their gains were still moderate. By 3 AM ET, USD/JPY was at 109.75 yen, down 0.3%, while USD/CHF was 0.1% lower at 0.9770.
The greenback was higher against most emerging currencies, however. It hit a nine-month high against the Turkish lira and was up 0.2% against the Chinese yuan at 6.9812."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was unchanged on Thursday in Asia following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's second day of testimony on Capitol Hill. 
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was unchanged at 98.922 by 12:15 AM ET (04:15 GMT).
Sentiment for the greenback has turned positive since data last week showed the U.S. labor market is improving.
In his second day of testimony, Powell suggested that there was little reason for the Fed to cut rates as the economy remained in a good place, despite the recent coronavirus outbreak. 
The Fed chief said earlier this week that it was too early to determine the virus' impact on the global economy.
The Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, today reported 14,840 new cases, up from 1,638 new cases on Tuesday, as it began to include cases diagnosed with a new method.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement that the fund’s primary forecast is for a quick recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.
“We are still at the point of quite a lot of uncertainty,” Georgieva said, adding that the most likely of scenarios is a that of a V-shaped bounce from the interruptions. “In other words, sharp decline in economic activities in China, followed by a rapid recovery and a total impact on China relatively contained.”
Meanwhile, the AUD/USD pair lost 0.3% at 0.6714 after Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Philip Lowe said the central bank is not ""obsessed"" with getting inflation back to its 2-3% medium-term target in a hurry.
The RBA slashed rates three times last year to 0.75% to help support growth and inflation.
The NZD/USD pair lost 0.2% to 0.6447. The pair received some support the previous day after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand dropped a reference to the chance of future rate cuts in its policy review. 
The USD/JPY pair trade 0.2% lower to 109.87. "

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar continued to rack up gains against its rivals Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's second day of testimony did little to support rate-cut hopes.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.25% to 98.84.
In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Jay Powell continued to talk up the strength of the economy and suggested there was little reason for the Fed to cut rates as the economy remained in a good place.
In the run-up to Powell's testimony, investor hopes were running high that Powell would hint at a further stimulus in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The Fed chief, however, said it was too early to determine the virus' impact on the global economy.
About 31% of traders expect at least one cut in June, down from 35% a day earlier, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. 
The dollar was held back by the pound, however, as expectations for the next U.K. budget due in March to include a boost to fiscal spending, supporting economic growth eased worries about tricky U.K.-EU negotiations slated for March.
GBP/USD rose 0.15% to $1.2955 and EUR/USD fell 0.33% to $1.0878

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Another day, another record low for the Brazilian real against the dollar.
Brazil's currency fell below 4.35 reais per dollar for the first time on Wednesday, as weaker-than-expected retail sales figures earlier in the day gave renewed impetus to the selling that has picked up notable momentum in recent days (BRBY).
The latest slide marked the fourth day in a row the real has made a new low against the dollar and brought its losses since Jan. 1 to almost 8%, making it one of the worst-performing currencies in the world against the greenback.
Figures on Wednesday showed that Brazilian retail sales unexpectedly fell in December, the first decline in eight months and another sign that the wider economic recovery may be weaker than many had hoped.
""The (retail sales data) release extends the slew of disappointing data undermining the growth narrative in Brazil and BRL longs,"" Citi's emerging market strategy team led by Dirk Willer wrote in a client note on Wednesday.
""We stay on the sidelines in the BRL until more positive data firmly close to door to further (policy) easing.""
Brazil's central bank last week cut its benchmark Selic rate to a new low of 4.25% and signaled that its easing cycle was now over. But any support the real might have got from the unwinding of further easing bets in rates markets has not materialized.
Quite the opposite. An increase in speculative selling and hedging demand for dollars from domestic investors amid a stark lack of demand from overseas investors has pushed it sharply lower ever since.
Traders say the absence of central bank intervention has helped encourage the selling, although they say the central bank is justified in not acting, given that move is fairly steady, volatility remains largely contained, and inflation expectations have not been affected yet.
Still, it might require action to reverse the move, as the real's momentum is firmly downward.
""It's too early to say that the real's depreciation is due to risk deterioration, but I don't like this move,"" said one trader in Sao Paulo. ""The real is still subject to further depreciation, at least if the central bank doesn't show up."""

404,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar continued to show strength Wednesday, helped by comments from the head of the U.S. central bank that the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus in China has done little to alter the expected path of U.S. interest rates.
 At 03:10 ET (0810 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0916, just off Monday’s four-month low. GBP/USD traded at 1.2969, just 0.1% higher. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.627, up 0.1%, approaching the levels last seen in mid-October.
Overnight, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in remarks before U.S. lawmakers that the central bank is closely monitoring the fallout from the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, “which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.”
However, Powell stopped short of saying the disease had changed the central bank baseline outlook for the U.S. economy.
“The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market and inflation returning to the committee’s symmetric 2% objective,” Powell said. “As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate.”
The January 2021 Fed funds futures currently suggests the market is pricing in at least one rate cut of 25 basis points by the end of 2020, but employment growth has been a lot stronger than expected over the last couple of months and sentiment surveys have tended to surprise to the upside. 
Even if the Federal Reserve does make a quarter-point cut this year - one is fully priced in by September - a base rate of then 1.5%for fed funds would still be considerably higher than what most other developed market central banks can offer. 
The flip side of dollar strength is the weakness of the euro. 
“EUR/USD continues to be weighed down by concern about the coronavirus and its impact on the eurozone economy,” said analysts at ING in a research note. “At this point, a break below the 1.0900 mark (also, a multi-year low) seems in the cards, especially as we expect a round of grim eurozone data this week.”
The first grim data point is likely to be the December industrial production figure for the euro zone, at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), which is expected to have fallen by 1.6% month in December, an annual fall of 2.3%.
Also of note, Sweden's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as expected, after surprising the market by raising in December by 25 basis points to 0%, ending five years of negative rates.
""The minutes from the December meeting emphasised that the Riksbank could cut rates again if needed,"" said ING, ""although in reality we think the bar to either cut, or indeed hike rates anytime soon is set relatively high.""
Thus any move would have an impact of the Swedish krona. At 03:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), EUR/SEK traded at 10.5076. The krona has risen around 0.3% against the euro since the Riksbank hiked."

Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar gained almost 1% against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday in Asia after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) left interest rates unchanged as expected and said forecasts showed no chance of a cut this year.
The NZD/USD pair last traded at 0.6456 by 12:05 AM ET (04:05 GMT), up 0.9%. 
Meanwhile, the AUD/USD pair traded 0.2% higher at 0.6728 as the Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index jumped by 2.3% to 95.5 in February. In January, the index had fallen by 1.8% to 93.4. Economists had forecast a more modest 1.4% rise.
The U.S. dollar index inched up 0.1% to 98.657. Overnight, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is watching the coronavirus impact carefully, without hinting that any imminent action was needed, claiming he wanted to ""resist the temptation to speculate"" about the potential disruptions from the outbreak.
""'What will be the effects on the U.S. economy?' 'Will they be persistent?' 'Will they be material?' That’s really the question,"" Powell said.
On the data front, the U.S. Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in January fell to about 6.43 million, missing expectations of 7 million.
The EUR/USD pair was little changed at 1.0911. Industrial production figures are due out of the Eurozone later today.
The USD/CNY pair was also near flat at 6.9626. On the coronavirus front, China said the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 1,113 as of Feb. 11, with 97 additional fatalities reported. Confirmed cases of the disease in mainland China rose to 44,653."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian currencies found support on Wednesday from a slowdown in the spread of coronavirus, but a strong dollar and caution about the rising death toll kept gains in check, while the New Zealand dollar jumped after the central bank dropped its easing bias.
Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, reported the lowest number of new infections since Jan. 31 on Tuesday, with 1,068 new cases. China's senior medical advisor also said the outbreak might be over by April.
The U.S. dollar, which has soaked up safe-haven flows as worries about the coronavirus coincided with data showing the U.S. economy's strength, handed back some gains.
The Australian dollar , among the most exposed globally to China's economic fortunes owing to Australia's export profile, stood a percentage point above the decade low it hit on Monday. It was 0.2% stronger at $0.6727.
The euro (EUR=), also seen as vulnerable to an economic slowdown in China, clambered from a four-month low to trade at $1.0916. The Chinese yuan sat at 6.9677 in offshore trade, just below a week-high it hit overnight.
""Markets are looking at the rate of spread, the rate of infection and thinking that maybe it is leveling out and it could be time to move on,"" said Sean MacLean, research strategist at Pepperstone, a brokerage in Melbourne.
""But so long as it remains contained in China, and the U.S. feels isolated, the U.S. dollar continues to perform well,"" he said, which would hold back further gains in Asian currencies against the dollar.
Even if the epidemic ends soon, though, its toll is high.
More than 1,100 people have died in China, about 2% of people infected. The economy has also been upended, with factory closures hitting supply chains from car makers to tech firms.
Worries about the eventual fallout have prompted a big selldown in currencies exposed to China, from the tourism-sensitive Thai baht to the oil-export driven Norwegian krone .
Both have lost more than 4% against the dollar this year and have barely recovered. The Japanese yen , a barometer of risk sentiment by virtue of its safe-haven status, remains strong against most majors and was steady at 109.86 per dollar.
""(A) bad scenario of intensification and spreading of coronavirus could cause a global supply shock,"" said Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN).
""Behind our views is the sense that global growth momentum is not nearly strong enough for most EM currencies to brush off the risk aversion that persistent fear of the disease would bring.""
The New Zealand dollar jumped 0.7% to $0.6458 after the central bank held interest rates steady, as expected, but forecast holding rates there through the year - reducing the likelihood of future easing.
""The easing bias is gone and we're back to neutral,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer. ""It's the clearest indication that the easing cycle is probably over,"" he said, unless a deep hit from the coronavirus prompts a change of heart."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real slumped to a new low against the dollar on Tuesday for the third day in a row, with the lack of overseas demand for Brazilian assets against a backdrop of historically low interest rates showing no sign of reversing.
The real traded below 4.34 per dollar for the first time ever (BRBY), intensifying its sell-off since last week when the central bank signaled its latest rate cut could be its last.
The minutes of that policy meeting on Tuesday showed that policymakers believe the effects of the deep easing cycle since last July have yet to be felt, and that more flexible credit and capital markets mean monetary policy is now more potent.
Yet the real weakened again, with the general backdrop of record low rates, tepid foreign demand for Brazilian markets and a widening current account deficit eclipsing any support from the central bank seemingly closing the door on further easing.
Brazilian ""Clients remain puzzled by the lack of enthusiasm for the Brazilian market,""  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday.
""The Brazilian real has defied bullish consensus repeatedly in recent months ... (and) Brazilian investors have largely given up trying to fade the real's weakness,"" they said.

Investing.com – The U.S. dollar was flat Tuesday as traders weighed weaker-than-expected labor data against positive remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.09% to 98.63.

""We’ll be watching this (coronavirus impact) carefully,"" Powell told lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee.

But the Fed chief stopped short of hinting that any imminent action was needed, claiming he wanted to ""resist the temptation to speculate"" about the potential disruptions from the outbreak.

""'What will be the effects on the U.S. economy?' 'Will they be persistent?' 'Will they be material?' That’s really the question,"" Powell said.

The Fed's current wait-and-see approach has continued to attract criticism, not least from President Donald Trump who continues to call on the central bank to cut rates.

Traders are still pricing in a rate cut for the back end of the year, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
In the lead-up to Powell's testimony, traders had to contend with softer labor market.

The U.S. Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in January fell to about 6.43 million, missing expectations of 7 million.

The pound, meanwhile, continued to climb, keeping the dollar on the back foot following data showing the U.K. economy did not contract further in the fourth quarter of the year.
GBP/USD rose 0.33% to $1.2955.

EUR/USD gained 0.06% to $1.0915, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde adding to the chorus of calls for EU members to adopt more supporter fiscal measures.
More supportive fiscal measures, particularly from Germany, the powerhouse of the EU, will likely underpin growth in the economic bloc and support the single currency.
""A potential shift to a looser fiscal policy stance in Germany could ultimately turn out to be more supportive for the euro further down the line,"" MUFG said in a note.

USD/JPY added 0.03% to Y109.78 and USD/CAD slipped 0.20% to C$1.3291, with the latter getting a boost from a rebound in oil prices on hopes that Russia may consider backing OPEC+ proposals for deeper production cuts."

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest cryptocurrency asset manager said on Tuesday it was seeing efforts to shift bitcoin production to North America from China, which dominates digital coin mining.
Barry Silbert, founder of New York-based Grayscale Investments, made the observation in an online presentation to investors, without saying why the shift was occurring.
Many mainstream investors such as pension funds or asset managers have been reluctant to embrace bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), concerned at its volatility, security breaches and lack of transparent markets.
Bitcoin, heavily favored by enthusiasts and retail investors since it emerged more than a decade ago, has gained increasing interest from hedge funds and trading firms. 
Many are drawn to its potential for high returns in an era of rock-bottom interest rates.
China's bitcoin miners control around two-thirds of the crypto network's processing power, research last year estimated.
That dominance has allowed Chinese miners to produce greater numbers of coins, and has also stoked demand for mining gear produced in the country.
""What I have seen recently, probably over the past three to six months, is a real growing shift toward attempts to move a lot of that activity outside of China into specifically the U.S. and Canada,"" said Silbert.
PUZZLES EARN COINS
Bitcoin miners - typically firms that run collections of highly-powered computers hooked up to cheap, plentiful electricity - compete against others in the bitcoin network to solve complex maths puzzles and earn new coins. 
At Tuesday's bitcoin price of around $10,300, miners produce bitcoin worth around $6.7 billion every year.
The lucrative activity often takes place in cold climates or sparsely populated areas, such as Scandinavia and Quebec, because of the vast amounts of heat it produces.
Chinese firms such as Bitmain have become among the world's biggest miners and manufacturers of bitcoin mining hardware. Another maker, Canaan (O:CAN), launched an initial public offering in November, but got a lukewarm investor response.
Grayscale, which oversees around $3.1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, has been striving to attract larger investors to digital coins. 
Last month it became the first digital currency investment vehicle to attain the status of reporting company at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it said on Tuesday.

This subjects its crypto products to the same reporting standards as those traded on major exchanges.

LONDON (Reuters) - A drop in the euro/dollar exchange rate to a four-month low raises the prospect of a repricing of one of the world’s most important macro-economic metrics and a potential re-rating of the U.S. currency across the globe.
After settling into the narrowest trading range in the euro's two-decade history in 2019, the euro's latest drop in the past week raises concern about a broader decline.

The U.S. economy is outperforming its European counterpart while the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy and consequently the German economy, Europe's powerhouse, has yet to show up in data.
Citigroup's economic surprise index for Europe has slumped to a four-month low while a similar gauge for United States has jumped to a five-month high after dismal German industrial data and strong U.S. jobs figures last week.

""Last year we discovered how sensitive the German economy was to China, and I think everybody is still underestimating the impact this will have on the Chinese economy and to Europe,"" said John Marley, a senior FX consultant at the FX risk management specialist SmartCurrencyBusiness.
The world's most actively traded exchange rate (EUR=) has weakened nearly 2% in the past week to $1.09. It's less than 5% away from a 17-year low of $1.03 reached in January 2017.
Euro weakness has implications not only for European policymakers when they are debating more stimulus, but also could signal further dollar strength and lead to tighter financing conditions from China to Mexico.
The euro has been under the gun for the last year or so, thanks to a relentless drop in market volatility. The latest data have only encouraged euro bears.
(Graphic - Currency volatility hits record lows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1982/1951/ccvol.png)
Subdued price swings, at least in theory, should hurt all currencies that have low or negative interest rates, such as the euro, the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, as hedge funds typically borrow in them to invest in higher-yielding currencies such as the U.S. dollar or emerging markets.
But the euro's case is unique in its zero correlation to geopolitical events. That means a yield-seeking strategy of borrowing in euros and investing in dollars can be profitable, even through episodes of missile strikes and virus attacks.
""That negative yield and the falling volatility makes the argument of buying and holding euros a very tough one,"" said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London.
In 2019, borrowing in euros and investing in U.S. dollars would have generated a return of nearly 5%. By comparison, borrowing Swiss francs last year and buying U.S. dollars would have only yielded a return of 1.7%. Borrowing Japanese yen would have earned just 1.5%.
That has encouraged euro bears. Hedge funds have been ramping up their net short bets in recent weeks; net short positions are not far from a three-year high.
That would give plenty of food for thought to forecasters in a Reuters poll who are predicting more strength for the euro over the next 12 months.

411,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 07:34AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira slipped to an almost eight-month low against the dollar, nearing yet another key level that state banks have been defending as pressure on the currency mounts.
The lira weakened as much as 0.6% to 6.0499 per dollar in Istanbul. Last week, government-backed lenders sold more than $4 billion of foreign currency, arresting the lira’s slide and holding it stronger than the 6.05 per-dollar-mark.
Tuesday’s losses came even as authorities tightened restrictions on foreign access to the currency this week, making it more difficult for them to borrow the lira and bet against it. Government-backed lenders have sold around $500 million this week, according to three traders with knowledge of the matter.
The measures are the latest example of an increasingly interventionist approach to policymaking that investors say is keeping the currency artificially strong despite an aggressive easing cycle and growing geopolitical risks.
This week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put NATO’s second-largest army on a collision course with forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to prevent the fall of Idlib province.
Until now, the lira had largely bucked a rout spreading across emerging markets.
But five rounds of interest-rate cuts and three months of accelerating inflation have driven Turkey’s real rate below zero, which makes holding the lira unattractive for many investors.
“The Turkish authorities have kept a tight grip on the lira in recent weeks, but we don’t think that this can continue for much longer,” said Jason Tuvey, a senior emerging-market economist at Capital Economics, who expects the lira to weaken 20% to 7.5 per dollar thorough year-end.
“The longer that policy makers intervene to prop up the lira, the greater the risk of a disorderly adjustment,” he said.",,,,,

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained in demand Tuesday, boosted by its safe haven status as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread and also by signs of strength from the U.S. economy.
 At 03:00 ET (0800 GMT), EUR/USD traded at 1.0911, marginally up on the day, after falling to a four-month low on Monday. Similarly, GBP/USD traded at 1.2909, just 0.1% lower, having touched a two-month low of $1.2870 Monday. Futures on the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, stood at 98.773, up 0.1%, having climbed as high as 98.858 on Monday, its highest level since mid-October.
The death toll from the coronavirus continues to mount, claiming over 1,000 victims in mainland China and infecting over 40,000 people. 
Measures of returning workers and passenger traffic flows within China suggested the virus had ""a devastating impact on China's economy in January and February,"" said analysts at Nomura in a research note.
Anticipation of lower Chinese demand has has kept commodity-like currencies on the defensive for the last couple of weeks, with the Aussie dollar still close to a 10-year low and the Brazilian real, Russian ruble and South African rand all falling by between 3.7% and 5.6% over the last month. 
""The coronavirus hitting has money going into the U.S. dollar,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer in a Reuters report. ""You've seen a good run of economic data in the U.S., that's been another support.”
On Friday, the U.S. nonfarm payrolls for December continued to show robust employment growth, while sentiment surveys have tended to surprise to the upside.
Attention now turns to the testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to Congress, on both Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Fed has made clear its intentions to keep its powder dry regarding interest rates in the near future.
Also of interest will be the release of the U.K. gross domestic product figure for the fourth quarter of 2019, at 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT).
The U.K. economy probably narrowly avoided a contraction at the end of 2019, with the Investing.com poll forecasting no growth on the quarter, resulting in annual growth of 0.8%.
Any upside surprise could boost a weak pound, but the tricky trade negotiations with the EU are likely to leave sterling on the back foot for the foreseeable future. 
Also of interest will be a speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at 09:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The central bank is in the middle of a major strategic review, and any comments from Lagarde over whether it changes its inflation goal will be of interest. Chief economist Philip Lane and newly-appointed board member Isabel Schnabel are also due to speak in the course of the day."

The Dollar Index has gained more than 2% since the start of the year as it tracked Trump’s online re-election odds in a stronger-than-expected correlation, according to StanChart’s head of global G-10 FX research Steve Englander. But with polls and online markets suggesting that Trump isn’t a shoo-in, investors may want to hedge the risk with the dollar-yen pair, he said.
“We like USD-JPY downside as a hedge when it moves into the 109.50-110.50 range,” Englander wrote in a report Monday. “The limited upside on JPY, its low implied volatility, and the responsiveness to negative political and economic shocks make it an attractive hedge to long risk positions.”
The yen is a good hedging tool as it’s responsive to downside economic shocks while largely staying stronger than 110 per dollar since May, according to Englander. Japanese policy makers may want to avoid having an overly weak yen that could become a political issue during a U.S. election year, he said.
Markets have already started to price in uncertainty around this year’s American presidential election, particularly given Wall Street’s concerns about the chance that a progressive candidate such as Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders might win the nomination, or even the presidency.

China's central bank has moved to support the economy by cutting interest rates and flushing the market with liquidity. But with the extent of spread and its impact still unknown, investors have dumped currencies exposed to China for dollars and yen.

The euro has been plagued by fears that the spread of the coronavirus will undermine the region’s economic growth. A slew of weaker data is only making matters worse.
The shared currency touched a four-month low in early New York trading Monday, putting it on track for a a sixth straight daily decline, the longest losing streak since September. Data Monday showed Euro area investor confidence missed estimates at a time when traders are concerned Europe’s biggest economy could have contracted in the fourth quarter.
Investors are worried that the euro area economy will weaken further as the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly. Some forecasters are already lowering their estimates amid the concerns. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and RBC Capital Markets last week downgraded their forecasts on the currency.
“The euro can probably move lower, especially if some risk-off tone still exists tied to the virus,” said Brendan McKenna, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. in New York. The euro is likely to fall to 1.09 by the end of March, but is likely to rebound to 1.13 by year-end as “the effects of the virus will start to wear off” and the dollar weakens. McKenna expects European economic data will improve by year-end.
The euro fell 0.1% to 1.0919 at 12:08 p.m. in New York. It earlier dropped as much as 0.3% to 1.0909, the lowest since Oct. 2. The common currency posted its worst January since 2015, weakening 1.1%.

418,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 10:34AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey made it more difficult for foreign investors to bet against the lira by further restricting their access to liquidity, driving up offshore borrowing costs.
Local banks’ outstanding currency swaps with counterparts abroad shouldn’t exceed 10% of their equity, down from 25% previously, the banking regulator said on Sunday. The restriction drove the overnight rate to over 60% on Monday, and the lira edged stronger against the dollar after buckling past a key level last week.
At times of lira distress, authorities have used the swap market to dramatically increase the rate that foreign investors have to pay to borrow liras, making it prohibitively expensive for them to short the currency. The latest restrictions come amid an aggressive easing cycle from the central bank that has pushed domestic borrowing costs below inflation, making it unattractive to hold the local currency.
On Friday, the lira weakened past the 6-per-dollar mark, a level state banks have been defending all month by flooding the market with dollars. According to four traders with knowledge of the matter, government-backed lenders sold more than $4 billion last week, with the scale of the intervention picking up dramatically late on Friday after a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report lifted the greenback against its major peers.
Turkey first imposed limits on the swap market during the currency crisis in 2018. In the run-up to local elections in March 2019, a similar directive helped push the overnight rate past 1,000%, burning short sellers.
The lira was trading 0.3% stronger at 5.9994 per dollar as of 12:53 p.m. in Istanbul, near an eight-month low."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira slipped in volatile trade on Monday after new government limits on banks' foreign-exchange helped the currency briefly erase Friday's sharp losses before selling resumed.
Investors and traders said the whip-saw trading - after weeks in a narrow range - suggested Turkish state banks were again intervening to attempt to buffer the lira after they sold tens of billions of dollars over the past year.
The lira strengthened to as low as 5.975 against the dollar before reversing course. It was worth 6.0180 at 1200 GMT, a bit weaker than Friday's close.
It had tumbled to as far as 6.05 on Friday, its weakest level in regular trading since May, as a late-week rally in the dollar prompted a selloff across emerging markets.
The BDDK bank regulator on Sunday cut the limit for Turkish banks' forex swap, spot and forward transactions with foreign entities to 10% of their equity, from a 25% ceiling set in August 2018 during the worst of Turkey's currency crisis.
The new FX limits are one of a series of government steps taken to stabilize the currency after the 2018 crisis cut its value by 36% in two years and tipped Turkey's economy into recession.
""This reflects the desperation of Turkish officials to keep the lira artificially stable,"" said Piotr Matys, senior EM FX strategist at Rabobank. ""If it was a free-floating currency it would be much higher but it is a managed float.""
Yatirim Finansman said the BDDK move ""is another step towards avoiding potential FX rate volatility and to shore up reserves.""
The currency's one-month implied volatility spiked on Friday and Monday to its highest level since mid-January. A week earlier, it touched its lowest level since mid-2013 after a broad downward trend since May of 2019.
The overnight lira swap rate jumped to as high as 75% and touched its highest level since April of 2019, before falling back to 9.7% in London.
While economic growth rebounded in the fourth quarter of last year, official data on Monday showed that unemployment remained elevated at 13.3%, down from 13.4% a month earlier.
While a jump in industrial sector job growth could help lower unemployment, youth unemployment remained elevated at 24%.
Istanbul's main stock index (XU100) was off 0.3% with the banks sector (XBANK) down 0.5% after the BDDK separately reduced fees lenders can charge clients, squeezing a key source of income.
Turkey's dollar-denominated sovereign bonds tumbled including one issue logging its sharpest drop since October, while credit default swaps jumped.
Friday's lira weakness came after the Treasury minister said state banks had agreed to lower loan rates, suggesting more rate cuts from the central bank, and as the Turkish military girded for more confrontation in Syria's Idlib region.
""Trading volumes look significantly larger than usual which is suspicious of (state bank) interventions, and which then feeds suspicions that we might have done better recently than we perhaps should have,"" said Koon Chow, an EM macro and FX strategist at UBP."

Investing.com - The Chinese yuan pushed higher Monday on the back of stronger-than-expected local inflation data, but a solid jobs report on Friday coupled with weaker economic numbers in Europe mean the U.S. dollar is likely to stay strong in the near term.
At 05:00 ET (1000 GMT), USD/CNY traded at 6.9810, 0.26% lower, after falling as low as 6.9774 earlier Monday, while the U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was about flat at 98.66, off the highs last seen in October.
Earlier Monday, China’s producer prices gained 0.1% year-on-year, which was the first pickup since May 2019. The numbers, which followed a 0.5% drop in December, were in line with expectations.
Consumer prices also gained 5.4% year-on-year compared with an expected 4.9% rise and a 4.5% rise in December.
“The year-on-year increase has been affected not only by Spring Festival-related factors but ... by the new coronavirus as well,” said the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, with prices of pork and fresh vegetables pushing up costs.
The uptick could complicate decisions making for policymakers looking to boost a cooling economy.
“China’s policy responses have been stepped up over the past week with liquidity injections helping to allay some investors’ fears,” said Eleanor Creagh, an analyst at Saxo Bank, “However, these increased policy responses signal the authorities anxiety levels are rising, despite the state media awash with proclamations to the contrary.”
EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0952, while GBP/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2914. It was earlier down at 1.2876, its lowest since late November.
The U.S. dollar remains generally well bid, Creagh added. “With this USD strength comes an additional hit to growth as the strong USD tightens financial conditions globally, particularly in offshore funding markets. The strong dollar hinders reflationary pulses and curtails green shoots therefore cementing the path for weaker economic growth.”"

Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.2% last month, according to estimates, matching the increase seen for December. On a yearly base, CPI is projected to climb 2.5%, up from 2.3% a month earlier.
There are also U.S. retail sales figures for January, which investors will be eyeing for further signs on the strength of the American consumer.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Bank of Italy on Saturday called for European rules to handle smaller banks' crises and urged them to consider mergers to cut excessively high costs.
Speaking at the annual Assiom-Forex conference of financial markets' participants, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said European banking rules introduced after the global financial crisis made it harder to find solutions when a small lender ran into trouble.
Italy's fragmented banking system has been hit by a string of small bank failures in the wake of a deep recession. The government and healthy banks have been forced to step in, shouldering significant costs, and the central bank's supervisory activity has been called into question.
""Nowadays the traditional banking model offers low returns ... small and medium-sized banks are the most affected and struggle to strengthen their balance sheets owing to high costs and difficulties in gaining access to the capital market,"" Visco said.
Banks' thin profit margins make it difficult to find investors ready to provide fresh capital to a troubled lender, especially when it operates in unattractive areas.
Under current European rules, ""the only way forward in the event of a crisis is a piecemeal liquidation, resulting in a loss of value and in contagion risks.""
Visco defended the Bank of Italy's actions in relation to Popolare di Bari, the biggest lender in the country's underdeveloped south and the latest bank to be rescued by the state and other rivals, at the end of last year. 
""Supervision is intensive, including on the smaller banks,"" he said. Accusations the Bank of Italy had turned a blind eye on Popolare di Bari's weakness and allowed it to take over rival Tercas were ""unfounded and highly offensive"", he added.
Visco said mergers could help smaller banks build much-needed scale. Costs at smaller peers with a traditional business model run on average at 72% of their income, compared with 66% at bigger rivals, he said.
""The process of restructuring must proceed with determination ... initiatives to expand the scale of operations of small banks such as mergers or greater integration of business areas ... can prove beneficial,"" he said.

Crisis tools for all types of banks as well a single deposit insurance scheme across the euro zone are necessary steps toward the bloc's integration , Visco said, calling also for the introduction of a common risk-free debt instrument.

Capital Economics estimated capital outflows last month picked up to $30 billion from $15 billion in December, with the increase likely coming in the last third of the month as public awareness of the outbreak jumped.
That amount would still be considered modest, but outflow pressures may have escalated this week as Chinese financial markets reopened after an extended holiday and reacted to the rapidly spreading epidemic.
Some $700 billion in capitalization was wiped off mainland stock markets on Monday alone, though they clawed back a bit of ground later in the week.
Strict capital controls have helped China keep outflows under control over the past year despite the trade war with the United States and weakening economic growth at home. Rising foreign investment in Chinese stocks and bonds have also seen growth in inflows.
China's forex reserves climbed $35.2 billion in 2019, after a drop of $67.2 billion in 2018.
China burned through $1 trillion of reserves supporting the
yuan during the previous economic downturn which was marked by
rapid capital flight and a surprising yuan devaluation in 2015.
The yuan rose 0.38% against the dollar in January, but it fell 1% between Jan. 20 and Jan. 23 amid mounting worries about the impact from the outbreak that started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
The dollar rose about 1% in January against a basket of other major currencies (DXY).
China held 62.64 million fine troy ounces of gold at the end of January, unchanged from 62.64 million ounces at the end of 2019.
The value of China's gold reserves rose to $99.24 billion at the end of January, from $95.406 billion at the end of 2019."

Investing.com - The Australian dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its 2020 growth forecasts amid the outbreak of the coronavirus and the recent bushfires.
The AUD/USD pair lost 0.2% to 0.6716 by 11:59 AM ET (03:59 GMT).
In the Statement on Monetary Policy release on Friday morning, the RBA slashed the June 2020 GDP growth forecast to 1.9% from 2.6% previously, while the December forecast was trimmed to 2.7% from 2.8%. Looking further ahead, it raised both the June and December 2021 forecasts to 3.1% from 3.0%.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index was little changed at 98.340 as traders awaited a key jobs report due later in the day. 
Citing Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, Reuters reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday. The two leaders “agreed to continue extensive communication and cooperation between both sides.”
They also reaffirmed their commitment to implementing Phase 1 of the trade deal between the U.S and China, according to Deere.
Yesterday, China said it would halve tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports as part of its efforts to comply with the phase one agreement that was ratified in Washington last month.
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.2% to 6.9789. China’s trade numbers for January are due anytime, with economists expecting a drop in both exports and imports due to the timing of the Lunar New Year break this year.
In other news, the People’s Bank of China said it is closely monitoring the economic impact of the virus outbreak, but the central bank has many policy tools to offset the pressure.
Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng told a news briefing on Friday that China’s economy could be disrupted in the first quarter, but is expected to recover once the virus is brought under control.
The new virus has so far claimed 636 lives. There were 3,143 new cases confirmed on Thursday, bringing the total so far to 31,161.
The EUR/USD pair was unchanged at 1.0981 as European Central Bank Governor Christine Lagarde reinforced expectations that the central bank's ultra-loose monetary measures will remain in place at least until the year.
""Moderate growth performance is delaying the pass-through from wage increases to prices and inflation developments remain subdued,"" Largarde said. ""The euro area economy therefore continues to require support from our monetary policy.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near a two-week high versus the yen on Friday on upbeat U.S. economic data ahead of a key jobs report, while the yuan eased and financial markets remained on tenterhooks as the death toll from a new coronavirus in China jumped yet again.
Sterling traded near a six-week low against the greenback and nursed losses versus the euro, dogged by persistent worries about negotiations between Britain and the European union for a post-Brexit trade deal.
Recent upbeat U.S. economic data and China's stimulus steps gave traders some respite from heightened concerns about the new virus, though the uncertainty about the impact of the epidemic on global growth looks set to keep most investors risk-averse - at least in the short run.
""There is a perception that the U.S. economy will be less affected by the virus than China or other countries, so that is a factor for dollar strength,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""Risk-off trades could take a break because we won't know the true state of China's economy until we see data for February. There could be some big declines in the numbers for China and other Asian countries.""
The dollar traded at 109.97 yen on Friday in Asia, just below a two-week high hit earlier. For the week, the dollar was on course for a 1.5% increase versus the yen, which would be its biggest weekly gain since July 2018.
In the onshore market, the yuan fell 0.1% to 6.9796 per dollar. For the week, the onshore yuan fell 0.6% as Chinese financial markets took a battering after resuming trade on Monday following an extended Lunar New Year holiday.
In contrast, the offshore yuan was on course for a 0.3% gain this week, supported by central bank stimulus and Thursday's surprise Chinese announcement of tariff cuts on U.S. imports.
For now, the focus has shifted to the closely-watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due later on Friday, which is forecast to show job creation accelerated in January.
The mood for the dollar improved on Thursday after unemployment benefits dropped to a nine-month low and worker productivity rose.
Data earlier this week showing a rebound in U.S. manufacturing had also boosted the dollar's fortunes.
The U.S. optimism contrasts starkly with the jitters in Asia as investors count the human toll of the virus and try to measure how travel restrictions and business closures will impact activity in the world's second-largest economy.
The yen and the Swiss franc, two currencies sought as safe-havens, initially gained as the coronavirus epidemic unfolded last month, but both currencies reversed course this week.
Against the dollar, the Swiss franc traded at 0.9743, headed for its biggest weekly decline since November 2019.
Sterling found itself on the backfoot as concerns about Britain's relationship with the EU following its exit from the bloc returned.
Investors are nervous that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is taking a hard line in trade talks with the EU, which need to conclude before the end of the year to avoid a potentially disruptive break in trading relations.
The pound was little changed at $1.2938, close to the lowest since Dec. 25 and down 2% for the week.
Sterling (EURGBP=D3) traded at 84.97 pence per euro, on course for a 1.1% weekly decline.
The Australian dollar fell 0.22% to $0.6717 after the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed growth forecasts in its quarterly economic outlook due to bushfires and the coronavirus.
The Aussie was still on course for its first weekly gain in six weeks, supported by the RBA earlier in the week raising the hurdle to further rate cuts."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's real slumped on Thursday to within sight of its all-time low against the dollar, despite the central bank's signal a day earlier that its latest interest rate cut could be its last, and a broad rise in market-based interest rates.
The real's decoupling from rates suggested speculative flows were behind the currency's slide, given that the rise in rates futures was widespread and on strong volume as traders unwound bets on further monetary easing from the central bank.
The bank's rate-setting committee known as Copom on Wednesday reduced the benchmark Selic rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%, as expected, but issued surprisingly clear forward guidance that the easing cycle was now over.
The U.S. dollar slid below 4.21 reais for the first time in a week but quickly roared back to 4.2798 reais, almost touching last week's record high 4.2873 reais (BRBY), as the lack of investor inflows into Brazil weighed heavily on the real.
(Graphic: Brazil Real - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1836/1805/BRL427.png)
""For the real, a weak growth and low carry environment alongside a widening current account deficit is bearish as it limits the attractiveness of Brazil as a destination for foreign portfolio flows,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a note to clients.
""We see limited room for a meaningful relief rally from the relatively more hawkish central bank tone,"" they said.
Cleber Alessie Machado, broker at H. Commcor in Sao Paulo, said that the absence of investment inflows from abroad, against a backdrop of relatively low interest rates and yields, makes the real vulnerable to bouts of speculative attack.
""There's no flow. And no flow gives speculators the confidence to bet against the real,"" he said.
While the currency fell, rates markets rose, especially futures contracts around late 2021 and early 2022, as traders priced in a higher curve.
The January 2022 interest rate future , for example, was last up around 12 basis points at 5.02%, on record trading volume of over 620,000 contracts.
(Graphic: Brazil rate futures - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1837/1806/BRAZILRATESFUT.png)
That was more than the previous record 604,400 contracts traded on Aug. 27 last year, when the central bank intervened in the spot currency market selling dollars for the first time in over a decade.
Other market participants, however, were more optimistic on the real's prospects in the coming weeks and months, noting that the prospect of no more rate cuts should lend it some support."

430,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 09:24AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Czech central bank surprisingly raised interest rates, responding to a jump in consumer prices that’s outweighed worries about the global economic slowdown. The koruna soared to a seven-year high.
Policy makers raised the benchmark by a quarter-point to 2.25% on Thursday, the first hike since May and the ninth increase in two-and-a-half years. Governor Jiri Rusnok will comment on the decision at a news conference scheduled for 3:15 p.m.
The bank’s board wasn’t discouraged by the “unimpressive performance” of Germany’s economy, which is already spilling over into the Czech Republic, according to Vit Hradil, an analyst at Raiffeisenbank AS in Prague.
“The central bankers clearly don’t sees these risks as too significant and slight optimism about the future seemed to have prevailed,” Hradil said in a note.
The move contrasts with the monetary stimulus deployed by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. It also differs from the cautious approach seen in other central and east European nations grappling with above-target price growth.
While several central bankers had signaled Thursday’s decision may be a close call, the rate increase surprised all analysts in a Bloomberg survey who had expected no change. Money market prices had also suggested investors were betting on a prolonged period of stable rates.
The koruna gained 0.7% to 24.905 against the euro, its strongest since October 2012 and the biggest intraday advance since June 2018.
The increase followed a period during which central bankers disregarded their internal forecast suggesting higher rates as they feared more tightening could undermine the country’s key manufacturing sectors.
Earlier on Thursday, data showed industrial production unexpectedly fell in December mainly due to a decline in the key automotive industry."

Investing.com - The yuan is slightly stronger Thursday following the move by China to cut tariffs on some imported goods from the U.S., leading other currencies higher against the dollar in a broad but modest 'risk-on' move.
 At 03:05 ET (0805 GMT), USD/CNY traded at 6.9702, down 0.1%, back below the 7.0 level, while the U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies dropped 0.1% to 98.13. 
China said early Thursday it will halve tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports from Feb. 14. This comes shortly after the two countries agreed an interim trade deal, ending a long-running trade dispute. This should help improve conditions for the second phase of negotiations, which are widely seen as being more difficult.
The tariff reductions come as China struggles to mitigate the economic damage caused by a coronavirus outbreak, which has so far claimed more than 560 lives. The death toll rose another 14% on Thursday, according to Chinese authorities, continuing a very gradual slowdown in fatalities.
 Elsewhere, German factory orders unexpectedly fell 2.1% in December on weaker demand from other eurozone countries. This was the biggest drop since February, and dampened the more positive mood generated by a number of confidence surveys. It suggested that a manufacturing slump will continue to hamper overall growth in Europe's largest economy.
Despite this release, the euro gained against the dollar, with EUR/USD up 0.1% at 1.1004, after ECB President Christine Lagarde told the EU parliament that the ECB faced a much-reduced scope for policy action. Sterling was broadly flat against the greenback, with GBP/USD down 0.1% at 1.2988.
 Also in Asia, the Reserve Bank of India held rates steady earlier Thursday, as expected, with its key repo rate unchanged at 5.15% and reverse repo rate at 4.9%.
 The central bank has a tough task ahead of it as inflation levels are already high but the economy is forecast to grow 5% in the year ending in March, its weakest pace in 11 years.
 At 03:05 ET (0805 GMT), USD/INR traded at 71.207, up 0.1%.
Staying with rate decisions, the Czech central bank is also expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged, this time at 2%, for the sixth meeting in a row.
That said, this may be a close call as inflation is climbing at the fastest rate in seven years. But worries about the state of the world economy, especially given the outbreak of the coronavirus in Asia, will likely stay the central bank’s hand.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg echoed his comments and said the coronavirus outbreak will have a “significant” impact on Australia’s economy due to the nation’s deep ties with China, though it was too soon to quantify the expected hit.
“The Chinese economy today is four time bigger than it was back in 2003 and our relationship is much stronger than it was back then with tourists increasing by sevenfold and students doubling,” he told ABC Radio on Thursday. “We don’t know how severe or how sustained the virus outbreak will be.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar stood tall on Thursday, supported by firm domestic data and hopes the coronavirus' economic impact could be limited, even as the human toll continued to climb.
Another 73 people on the Chinese mainland died on Wednesday from the outbreak, the highest daily increase so far, bringing the total death toll to 563.
Infections stand at 28,018. Drugmakers and the World Health Organization played down press reports about progress toward finding treatments, which had boosted traders' confidence.
Amid the uncertainty about the virus, currency investors also turned their attention to traditional market drivers, specifically U.S. private payrolls, which posted their biggest jump in nearly four years, while a separate report showed a service sector pickup.
That helped the greenback higher and it drifted north in morning trade to a two-week high of 109.87 Japanese yen .
It sat at $1.0994 per euro, just below a one-week peak touched overnight against the common currency (EUR=), while the Australian dollar inched ahead by 0.1%.

""It's like a jack-in-the-box, with a lid that is just waiting to spring up,"" he said.
""If you've got investable capital, you want to try and get it as far away from ground zero as you possibly can, and I think that's why you're seeing relative outperformance from markets which had less exposure.""
Overnight the S&P 500 (SPX) made a fresh record closing high and the dollar hit a two-month high against a basket of its peers (DXY).
Yet plenty of caution remains elsewhere, with oil prices stabilizing but making only a cautious recovery with the size of the expected hit to demand still growing.
The virus has disrupted air travel, driven holiday cancellations, factory closures and production cuts.
""Places where the optimism isn't being felt include Thailand and Singapore, with room for easier monetary policy being explored and Korea, where it's way too real to relax,"" said Kit Juckes, an analyst at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar will climb over the coming year, recouping much of its recent decline, as the economic threat from a coronavirus outbreak in China likely fades, and some analysts don't expect the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates in 2020, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.
Since the start of the year, the loonie, which was the top-performing G10 currency in 2019, has weakened more than 2%.
It has been pressured by a shift in January to a more dovish stance from the Bank of Canada and concern the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak would weigh on the global economy, reducing demand for some commodities that Canada exports, including oil.
U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) have plunged about 24% from their January peak.
""A lot of bad news is priced in at this point on the virus front,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. ""We think that the global economy should be able to move on from this fairly soon if we can see some signs that this virus is contained.""
Chinese policymakers are readying measures to support an economy jolted by a virus outbreak that is expected to have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth, policy sources said on Tuesday.
The poll of over 40 currency analysts showed they expect the loonie to rally 1.3% to 1.31 per U.S. dollar, or 76.34 U.S. cents, in three months, from 1.3270 on Wednesday. It is then expected to strengthen to 1.30 in one year, matching the forecast in January's poll.
Last month, the Bank of Canada opened the door to an interest rate cut should a recent slowdown in domestic growth persist.
Data since then has showed the Canadian economy surprisingly grew in November and manufacturing activity expanded in January for the fifth straight month.
""We are optimistic that the worst is behind us for the economy,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics. ""Improved domestic prospects, as well as a rebound in global GDP growth, means that the Bank (of Canada) is likely to keep policy on hold this year.""
The International Monetary Fund last month projected global economic growth of 3.3% in 2020, up from an estimated 2.9% in 2019, supported by tentative signs manufacturing activity and global trade are bottoming out.
Money markets are pricing in a Bank of Canada interest rate cut by June. If expectations for a cut were to fall, that could provide support for the loonie.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - On the streets of Buenos Aires, money changers known as ""arbolitos"" or ""little trees"" are taking advantage of Argentina's capital controls to take a slice of a booming black market trade in U.S. dollars.
One of the arbolitos, Martin, 47, spends his days shouting ""cambio"" to passersby, offering dollars outside the formal banking channels that currently limit purchases of the U.S. currency to $200 per month.
The black market trade has flourished since Argentina introduced the controls in September to stem a decline in dollar reserves and stabilize the peso amid an economic downturn and debt crisis.
Argentina's boom-and-bust economy has suffered from high levels of inflation and a weakening peso for years, which has spurred savers to snap up dollars.
But the increase in the black market trade risks fuelling inflation which is already running at more than 50%, while the peso has lost close to 70% of its value against the dollar over the last two years.
""This whole business is growing more and more,"" said Martin, who has been a arbolito for 10 months and pockets around 500 pesos ($8.35) a day. Like others traders Reuters spoke to he did not want to give his full name as the trade is technically illegal.
Argentina's currency is being held artificially stable by the capital controls, which were introduced following a market crash that pushed up the cost of the country's debt.
The new Peronist government, which took over in December, is racing to restructure around $100 billion in debt payments to avoid a damaging sovereign default.
""The danger is that you get multiple dollar prices, or a parallel dollar,"" Ariel Coremberg, an economist at the University of Buenos Aires, said, referring to the black market trade. He said demand for dollars at higher rates risked fuelling inflation.
""This black market dollar can have a rapid knock-on effect on the price of all goods and services.""
Martin said the number of money changers had increased to meet demand that was around one-fifth higher than last year under the free-market government of conservative Mauricio Macri, who was defeated in the October election by center-left Alberto Fernandez.
""It's better for us now. We earn 10% more than before,"" said Martin, adding clients were a mix of Argentines and tourists.
Under Macri's government, the official and black market price of dollars had been largely in step. But since the controls came in the two rates have diverged, with the black market rate now around 30% higher - a gap not seen since the end of the last Peronist government in 2015.
A second often-cited rate, a legal workaround to access dollars known as a blue-chip swap, is even more expensive.
Macri had scrapped currency controls when he came to power in late 2015, but was forced to re-impose them in September last year after his shock defeat in a primary election caused currency market turmoil.
The primary result - and the market crash that followed - helped to push the country further towards an economic crisis and made Macri the underdog in an election that most had thought would be close.
But the controls have managed to hold the peso-dollar rate stable, even as other unofficial channels have flourished.
MONEY TABLES
The arbolitos, who say they receive between 0.5%-2% commission, take their clients to informal ""money tables"" where the currency transactions take place.
Aniuska, a 33-year-old Venezuelan working in the trade in the city, said she had seen around 70% more people buying dollars ""due to the restrictions by the government.""
""Having these restrictions, people have no choice but to come and buy,"" she said. Her group of arbolitos had grown from 3 people to 10.
""The truth is that if there are lots of us it does not suit me because there are fewer opportunities to get customers.""
The rise in demand echoes the situation under the previous Peronist government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who imposed capital controls during her 2007-2015 administration, creating a wide gap between official and black market rates.
Fernandez de Kirchner is now Vice President.
""Now it will be like it was with Cristina and that is better for us because there will be many more people who will want dollars. It suits us,"" said one 26-year-old arbolito, who said she had worked in the trade for nine years.
The arbolitos said the work was not easy and meant long hours, but with the economy facing recession and employment down there were few alternatives.
""I earn on commission, but it's practically cents,"" said one arbolito who gave his nickname as ""El Pitufo"" - the dwarf - who said he had previously worked in a leather clothing factory.
""But in the face of unemployment, doing this is the only thing left."""

BUENOS AIRES/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies are at significant risk of weakening this month as the coronavirus epidemic expands, putting pressure on policymakers to step up efforts to prevent further economic damage, a Reuters poll showed.
The about-face in fortunes comes just weeks after these currencies climbed to their strongest rates in 1-1/2 years following an initial Washington-Beijing trade agreement after nearly two years of escalating tariffs.
Forty-six of 52 market strategists and analysts polled Jan. 31-Feb. 4 said currencies from key emerging markets - most of which export raw materials to China - are at risk of weakening further in the near-term as money rushes to safe havens. [EUR/POLL]
That includes the South African rand , the Turkish lira and others as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc (EURCHF=) firm on fears the flu-like virus that has claimed over 400 lives in China could worsen.
Emerging market currencies may be prone to additional pain once it becomes clear how restrictions introduced to control the epidemic could hurt growth in the world's second largest economy, and consequently its trading partners too.
""Both safe-haven demand and shocks on commodities-linked economies from the coronavirus in China imply more significant risks to emerging markets in the short run,"" said Simon Harvey, FX Market Analyst at Monex Europe.
""While risk-off moves could trigger additional pressure on the yuan in the short term, a broader drag of the coronavirus on the currency will depend on its lagged economic impact, which is unlikely to be fully unfolded in the following weeks"".
A basket of emerging market currencies (MIEM00000CUS) has lost close to 1.5% since mid-January, when the asset class was first hit by fears about the contagion, dropping to its lowest in more than a month.
The rand, usually the whipping boy for global risk sentiment, already racked up losses last week when traders and investors flew to safer havens.
South Africa's currency has bounced back a bit since but is likely to relapse if risks worsen, with plenty of domestic economic challenges building already.
""The rand risks approaching, and exceeding, 16/$ this quarter if South Africa looks increasingly likely to see a Moody's downgrade, given that the domestic currency has already reached a low base on the back of the impact from the virus on risky assets,"" said Annabel Bishop, chief economist at Investec in Johannesburg.
South Africa is due a credit review at the end of next month. Investors will automatically sell its bonds if Moody's lowers its sovereign rating to junk.
Emerging market peer Argentina is already asking its debt-holders to accept a late but bigger repayment to avoid falling into default.
LIMITED PESSIMISM
In particular, the Chinese yuan may sink as much as 3% in February if the health crisis aggravates, potentially disrupting international markets, according to replies to a separate question in the poll.
""We remain of the view that it is too early to abandon a cautious approach towards risky EM assets as there is no sufficient evidence yet - despite various measures being implemented - that the deadly virus has been contained,"" said Piotr Matys, senior emerging markets FX strategist at Rabobank.
So far the pessimism is cushioned by the view policymakers may act with stimulus in case financial conditions worsen considerably or already sluggish world growth slows more, after top officials expressed concerns last week.
China's central bank said it will inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets via reverse repo operations on Monday and Chinese policymakers are readying other measures too, sources told Reuters.
For the time being, the U.S. Federal Reserve seems poised to stay on hold. Chair Jerome Powell said last month after the Fed's latest policy meeting that it was ""too early"" to determine the impact of the virus.

Investing.com - A degree of calm has returned to the foreign exchange market, with the robust actions of the Chinese central bank tending to reassure investors that the coronavirus outbreak will not have as severe an impact on the markets as previously feared.
At 03:00 ET (0800 GMT), USD/CNY traded at 7.0011, up just 0.1%, while the U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies was largely unchanged at 97.815.
The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak increased to 490, while confirmed cases rose to 24,324, Chinese authorities reported today. But despite these figures continuing to rise, the WHO expressed confidence that the virus spread could be contained, as it pointed out 99% of the cases are in China so far.
The People's Bank of China has already pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system this week to ensure adequate liquidity and restore confidence.
And the expectation is that the PBOC will do more, probably lowering its key lending rate - the prime rate - on Feb. 20, when it next meets, and cutting banks' reserve requirement ratios further in the coming weeks.
Staying in Asia, the Bank of Thailand earlier Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1%, a record low, and the third cut in the last five meetings.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Hungary's forint is likely to just drift off a record low over the next year while the Czech crown is seen giving up recent gains, a Reuters poll showed, as central European currencies find little traction in 2020.
Over the last year, the region's currencies have struggled to gain ground, hit by global worries over trade wars, and they look set to face headwinds in 2020 from slowing domestic economies and monetary policy staying on hold.
Wednesday's poll showed the biggest-moving currencies were likely to be the crown, which climbed to its highest levels against the euro since the end of 2012 last month, and Romania's leu.
The crown (EURCZK=) was seen easing 0.8% from its Monday close to 25.400 to the euro in the next 12 months, an unchanged forecast from a poll a month ago.
The Czech central bank has kept alive a debate on whether an interest rate hike was still needed to fight inflation pressures. However, analysts see no change when the bank meets on Thursday as crown strength has been a tightening factor.
Analysts also see a weaker economic picture.
""We don't expect the (firming) trend in the crown to be sustainable given the cyclical moderation of the economy,"" Raiffeisen financial analyst Sebastian Petric said.
""The recent release of the manufacturing PMI points to a contraction of the manufacturing sector. Also, earlier data confirm the picture of a slowdown.""
In Hungary, the forint (EURHUF=) is forecast to tread water before firming around 0.7% to 335 per euro in a year's time.
The forint hit a record low of 338.77 to the euro in January and has lost more than 1.5% so far in 2020, after losing 3% in 2019, as Hungary's central bank has maintained the region's most dovish monetary policy stance.
It got a boost on Monday after the central bank rejected all bids at a weekly euro/forint swap tender. The swaps, which allow the central bank to manage forint liquidity in the banking system, have for years been an important policy tool.
Poland's zloty (EURPLN=) was seen little moved over the next year, with the poll seeing it at 4.295 to the euro in 12 months, as risks related to Swiss franc mortgages remain, with fears the loans will be converted into the local currency on terms unfavorable to banks.
The Romanian leu (EURRON=) was forecast to lose 2.2% to 4.885 to the euro, versus 4.92 seen on a 12-month horizon in the January poll. Fiscal and political uncertainties continue to weigh on Romanian assets.

Investing.com – The Chinese yuan inched up on Wednesday in Asia even after the World Health Organization (WHO) reiterated that the new virus could be contained. 
The USD/CNY pair slipped 0.1% to 7.0045 by 12:32 AM ET (04:32 GMT). 
The coronavirus outbreak remained in focus as the mainland China death toll increased to 490, while confirmed cases rose to 24,324, Chinese authorities reported today. 
Despite the increasing death toll, the WHO expressed confidence that the virus spread could be contained, as it pointed out 99% of the cases are in China so far. 
Beijing has injected around 1.7 trillion yuan ($243 billion) into the financial system as an attempt to support its economy. More airlines and countries issued travel restrictions on China this week, while factories lie idle and shops remain closed. 
Last week, a Chinese government economist said that the country’s first-quarter economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower due to the virus outbreak, Reuters reported, citing a local magazine.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.1% to 97.860.
The greenback rose slightly overnight after data showed factory goods orders rose 1.8% in December, topping economists' forecasts for a 1.2% rise, marking the largest gain since August 2018.
The NZD/USD pair slipped 0.1% to 0.6483 after gaining overnight. New Zealand released quarterly employment numbers that showed unemployment numbers dipped to 4.0% in the fourth quarter, down from 4.1% in the previous one and beating expectations of a worsening to 4.2%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts have downgraded forecasts for the Australian and New Zealand dollars in the short term as natural disasters and the coronavirus drag on domestic growth, but they remain surprisingly upbeat on a one-year horizon.
Analysts polled by Reuters see the Aussie at $0.6700 in one month, down from $0.6900 in the January poll and near its current level of $0.6735.
Yet the majority believed the downturn would be temporary and forecast the Aussie at $0.6800 in six months and $0.7000 in one year.
The near-term downgrade reflects a tough few weeks for the currency as raging bushfires in Australia and the epidemic in China took a heavy toll on tourism and commodity prices.
As a result the Aussie, has fallen 4% so far this year and came within a whisker of its decade low at $0.6670.
Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac, noted steep losses in prices for Australia's commodity exports had lowered his estimate for the Aussie's fair value to just $0.6515.
It had got a respite this week when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held interest rates at 0.75% and lifted the bar for further cuts, saying a period of stability would be better.
""The Aussie bounce could extend slightly further toward $0.6750, however, we doubt that we will see much further strength near term,"" said Franulovich.
""Indeed, much above $0.6775/0.6800, our fair value methodology suggests the A$ would be expensive given the sharp drop in commodity prices seen so far this year.""
The New Zealand dollar was seen at $0.6500 in one month's time, down from $0.6600 previously, again reflecting the global impact of the virus.
Further out, the kiwi was seen languishing at $0.6500 in three months and $0.6529 in six, before ticking up to $0.6700 in one year.
""The Kiwi should drop into the low $0.60s near term, as the impacts of the coronavirus comes through,"" said Jarrod Kerr, chief economist at Kiwibank.
""But by the end of the year, we expect the world to have returned to the path set at the end of 2019. Risk assets should rally back and, with a rise in risk appetite, the Kiwi surges higher.""

442,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 11:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Singapore dollar weakened to a four-month low after the central bank said there’s “sufficient room” for the currency to ease if the economy weakens due to the impact of the coronavirus.
The currency, which is maintained in a band against a basket of peers, has been fluctuating near the upper end of its boundary since October, and could ease, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a statement Wednesday. The MAS maintained its policy outlook and said it will meet in April, as scheduled.
Traders across Asia have been ratcheting up bets that central banks in the region will have to ease policies as the virus outbreak saps China’s economy. Singapore, with its trade-dependent economy, may be susceptible to any prolonged impact that could freeze supply chains.
“The hit to the economy, both from tourism and supply-chain impact from China, has obviously opened the door to easing,” said Mitul Kotecha, senior EM strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. The Singapore dollar “has reacted negatively, extending its recent decline, and will likely remain under pressure as markets increasingly price in easing.”
The Singapore dollar dropped as much as 0.9% to S$1.3824 against the U.S. dollar after the announcement. It’s the worst-performing currency in Asia on Wednesday.
“There is sufficient room within the policy band to accommodate an easing of the Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER) in line with the weakening of economic conditions” due to the virus outbreak, the MAS said in its statement.
The city-state already has been planning measures to shore up businesses and consumers still feeling the effects of the U.S.-China trade war and limp global demand. The virus has added to worries about the economic outlook in Singapore, where there are 24 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
The government is forecasting the economy should expand by 0.5%-2.5% this year after 0.7% growth in 2019. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has signaled that he will deliver a supportive budget on Feb. 18.
In its last scheduled announcement, in October 2019, the MAS eased policy for the first time since 2016 and said domestic growth -- particularly from manufacturing -- remained under pressure.
The MAS guides the local dollar against a basket of other currencies, adjusting the pace of appreciation or depreciation by changing the slope, width and center of a currency band. It doesn’t disclose details of the basket, the band, or the pace of appreciation or depreciation.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held gains against the yen on Wednesday amid a broad unwinding of safe-haven positions as China's responses to the coronavirus outbreak supported investor confidence, even as deaths and new cases climbed.
The coronavirus outbreak claimed its first life in Hong Kong on Tuesday, as the mainland China death toll rose by 65 to 490 and the number of cases rose to 24,324.
Against the rising death toll, however, the World Health Organization said it remains possible to contain the virus' spread. Some 99% of cases are in China, which has responded with drastic quarantine measures and the injection of 1.7 trillion yuan ($243 billion) into the financial system.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that more stimulus is likely to follow. Those broader expectations of economic support as well as recent measures prompted investors to partly reverse the flight to safety seen over the past two weeks.
Gold tumbled, the Japanese yen had its worst session against the dollar in nearly six months and the Dow Jones stock index posted its biggest daily gain since August in overnight trade.
However, the yen, seen as a haven by virtue of Japan's position as the world's largest creditor, halted its decline by morning, suggesting investors are still cautious.
It last traded just above a 1-1/2 week low at 109.43 per dollar . The trade-exposed Australian dollar , by contrast, bounced 0.7% on Tuesday from not far above a decade low to its highest in a week. It last stood at $0.6733.
""Investors want to see some actual stabilization in cases and an improvements in recovered people before rallying again,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in note.
""As long as we don't see this in numbers, it feels like the rally should be faded.""
In offshore trade, the Chinese yuan held overnight gains and stayed on the strong side of 7-per-dollar at 6.9943. The New Zealand dollar steadied at $0.6486.
One of the reasons the virus has caused so much alarm is that much remains unknown about it, including the mortality rate and transmission routes. What is becoming increasingly clear, though, is the severity of its economic impact.
As people stay home, factories lie idle and shops shut throughout China, economists have lowered their growth outlook, with Louis Kuijs at Oxford Economics, for example, forecasting 5.4% growth in 2020, compared with 6% previously.
As that ripples through the world economy, companies are already feeling the effects and forecasters are estimating a hit of between 0.2% and 0.3% to global growth.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) said on Tuesday it will cut around 30% of its capacity over the next two months.  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) will suspend production in South Korea because of disruption to the supply of parts.
""The economic shocks to mainland China brought by the coronavirus are likely to be 2 to 3 times larger than the SARS debacle in 2003,"" said DBS economist Chris Leung, referring to a previous epidemic that cut roughly a percentage point from GDP.
""The deepening of physical interconnectivity both within and outside China ever since has increased substantially.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will be nearly 4% stronger in a year than it is now, according to a Reuters poll of market strategists, based on expectations that Britain will secure a trade deal with the European Union this year despite its tough initial stance.
On Monday sterling took a pummeling after Prime Minister Boris Johnson set tough terms for the trade talks. Some of the forecasts in the Reuters poll were gathered before Johnson's speech.
Britain left the EU on Friday and Johnson's comments on Monday have rekindled fears of a cliff-edge - whereby no trade deal is agreed - at the end of an 11-month transition period which Johnson has repeatedly said he won't ask to extend.
Foreign exchange strategists in Reuters polls have repeatedly said that leaving without a deal, and so trading on World Trade Organisation rules only, would be rough for the economy and the worst outcome for the pound .
The currency ended January on a high note after the Bank of England surprised many by leaving borrowing costs on hold but fell as much as 1.7% to $1.2984 on Monday. It was trading around $1.30 on Tuesday after better-than-expected construction data.
Median forecasts in the Jan. 31-Feb. 4 poll of 65 strategists showed the pound would be up at $1.31 in a month, $1.32 in six months and then $1.35 in a year's time.
That is still well below the $1.50 it was trading at before the June 2016 referendum, when Britons voted by 52% to 48% to leave the world's largest trading bloc.
With time short to agree even a bare-bones deal, economists in a Reuters poll last month said there was a median 20% chance of a disorderly departure at the end of the transition period, during which existing agreements apply as if Britain were still an EU member.
BREXIT BOUNCE?
Johnson's emphatic December election victory stoked hopes for a Brexit bounce to the economy and the BoE said on Jan. 30 a recent pick-up in growth had weakened the case for it to lend more monetary support.
""A bounce in UK economic growth helped by a good-sized fiscal stimulus in Q2 remains our base case,"" said James McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets.
""We still like buying sterling and the BOE's decision to pass on a cut last week (which was a surprise to us) has given the sterling trend some renewed momentum.""
In contrast to the BoE, the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank eased policy last year.
But the coronavirus outbreak spreading further beyond China's borders has raised more global growth risks and is set to keep the U.S. dollar, which has dominated most others in foreign exchange markets for around two years, firmly on its throne well into 2020. [EUR/POLL]
With the outlook for euro zone growth already lukewarm before the virus outbreak and no more policy changes expected from the ECB, little movement is expected between the pound and the common currency.
Trading around 84.9 pence on Tuesday, in one-, six- and 12-months time one euro will be worth 85.0p, the poll found.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak grabbing the world's attention and which has likely wreaked havoc on its second-largest economy is set to give safe-haven currencies another lift over the coming month, a Reuters poll of market strategists found.
The virus, which originated in China, has left authorities across the globe grappling with how to stop its rapid spread and financial markets in disarray. It was forecast to prop up safe havens like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc by 2% to 3% this month.
It is also set to keep the U.S. dollar, which has dominated most others in foreign exchange markets for around two years, on top into 2020, with half the analysts polled predicting it would last at least six months more.
That lined up with currency speculators, who increased their bets in favour of the dollar for a second week, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
""As we speak, there is no information suggesting that there has been any sort of peak in the coronavirus. The only information that we've got is that it is spreading to other countries,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""As long as the news flow is consistent with that, I think it is very likely that the dollar, the yen and Swiss franc will remain well bid and emerging markets will be out of favor.""
Analysts said the U.S. dollar index (DXY) - calculated against a basket of six currencies - and the Japanese yen were both likely to gain a maximum of around 3% if the outbreak worsened. The Swiss franc was forecast to strengthen by close to 2.0% against the euro under the same circumstances.
All three are viewed as de facto safe-haven currencies, with the yen and franc the only major currencies to have made any gains against the dollar this year.
Any increase in safe-haven buying usually comes at the expense of emerging-market assets.
After a brief run-up in for riskier risky assets at the start of the year following an initial Washington-Beijing trade deal, the tide has turned again.
A majority of analysts - 46 of 52 - who answered a separate question said emerging-market currencies were at significant risk of weakening over the next three months.
""Emerging markets benefit from low rates and easy money, but they're very vulnerable to significant economic slowdown. In the short term, they are just getting knocked from pillar to post by the virus and by sentiment,"" said Kit Juckes, head of currency strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""It is clear that the Chinese economy is going to slow, the Chinese are going to use monetary policy and will probably have a period where resource prices - industrial metals and oil prices - are going to be under some pressure. If you're in Latin America, you may think you're closer to America physically, but you are probably closer to China economically.""
But demand for safe-haven currencies was not expected to last, with most analysts predicting the dollar would lose against all major currencies over the next 12 months.
The euro (EUR=), the Japanese yen , the British pound and the Swiss franc are forecast to chip away at the dollar's strength over the coming year.
The common currency and sterling were expected to lead the pack by gaining around 4% in a year's time, followed by the yen, which was forecast to gain over 1.5% from here.
While that view has been held for nearly two years, there was a clear shift in the latest poll. Analysts who had repeatedly expected the dollar's dominance to last for six months at least were less confident.
Twenty-two of 50 said the dollar's strength was unlikely to carry on beyond the next six months. The rest said six to 12 months or more than a year.
But the dependence of the global economy on the United States and the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency means any downside is most likely to be limited.
Rabobank's Foley said ""there will be inflows from emerging markets and other risky nations into the dollar"" in the near term, but when those reverse, she does not expect big moves in the opposite direction either.
""Yes, we've penciled in some slight weakening, or moderate weakening, of the dollar in our 12-month view because of the risk of a U.S. recession. But I don't think those losses are going to be more than moderate.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - At least half a dozen Venezuelan banks have begun storing in vaults millions of dollars and euros accumulated in cash by businesses during an unexpected economic liberalization by President Nicolas Maduro, according to sources.
Some $1.8 billion worth has entered Venezuela in the last year, according to three senior banking sources, as Maduro quietly dismantles 16 years of socialist regulations to salve the economy in the face of U.S. sanctions and hyperinflation.
The cash comes mainly from remittances - often on trucks - by the millions of Venezuelans who have left in recent years, and from the OPEC member's oil and gold sales to allied nations like Turkey and Russia, sometimes by plane, the sources said.
The private banks' new custodial service began discreetly in late 2019 and has not been previously reported in full. It is further evidence of how the ruling Socialist Party is allowing financial arrangements unthinkable for Venezuelans while dollar transactions were outlawed until 2018.
The service is only offered to well-known firms with significant revenue and long-standing accounts, according to four finance industry senior executives. ""It is a service for traditional customers,"" one said.
That is meant to avoid contact with companies linked to the government, which is under a broad sanctions program by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump who views Maduro's government as an illegal dictatorship.
The sources asked for the banks not to be named for security reasons given the delicate context and crime problems.
The custodial service is not cheap.
Clients pay monthly commissions of 1 to 2 percent of the deposits - though for that they have instant access to the cash and regular security checks if they want.
In fact, the bank custodial services only manage around 10% of all hard currency in Venezuela, two of the bank executives said, meaning the rest is in improvised storage.
The government, which does not discuss how dollars and euros enter the economy, did not respond to a request for comment. Though it has stopped enforcing longstanding currency and price control regulations, many of the rules remain on the books, so the situation could change quickly should Maduro shift tack.
DETERIORATING NOTES
With dollars increasingly used in routine transactions rather than the devalued local bolivar - which only has $44 million equivalent in circulation - Venezuelan pharmacies, grocery stores and other businesses are often flush.
Euros also enter the system from government payments to contractors and weekly central bank sales.
Large supermarket chains like the custodial services because they carry out a third of their operations in foreign currency, according to two retail executives.
Transfers to same-bank clients cost 1% of the operation. ""The commission for storage of currency in bills is high because that money cannot be lent,"" said economist Leonardo Buniak.
That helped send commissions' revenue up 300 times in 2019 from the year before, according to data from bank regulator Sudeban, making them a major source of income amid decline in most other types of financing activity.
Banks do not transfer cash holdings to accounts in other countries, the sources said, because U.S. sanctions have made foreign banks nervous. That means the dollar and euro notes cannot be replaced as happens in most developing countries.
""The notes do not leave the country and will deteriorate,"" said one of the executives.
Beyond the banks, foreign currency is stored and hidden in homespun ways. Some small-time merchants keep dollars in wooden crates, moving them on fast to pay off providers and reduce the possibility of theft.
""You have to leave hard currency under a mattress because of the cost of bank services,"" said Vito Vinceslao, a representative of commerce association Consecomercio in the border state Apure where foreign currency flows spike due to the bustling cross-border trade. ""Many businesses have safe deposit boxes in homes or stores to protect them.""",,,,,

With a rising death toll, thousands ill and much of China’s economy locked down, Kuroda sounded a more anxious tone. He said China’s size and importance in global supply chains now make any risks to its economy an issue for other economies including Japan’s.
Kuroda’s heightened concern comes as private sector economists ratchet up forecasts for the virus’s disruptive potential.

""Chinese authorities have been providing a lot of support for the financial markets. There's a level of assurance that the rout would not be allowed to go on much further than necessary,"" said Christy Tan, head of markets strategy for Asia at National Australia Bank in Singapore.
Still, the number of coronavirus deaths in China continued to climb, reaching 425 as of the end of Monday, from over 20,000 cases, a mortality rate of barely 2%.
Elsewhere, the US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, pushed up 0.2% to 97.767, helped by stronger than expected manufacturing sentiment data late Monday and weakness in sterling.
“The ISM manufacturing index has surged back into positive growth territory. The Phase One trade deal between the US and China has lifted much of the gloom hanging over the sector with businesses responding positively,” said ING, in a research note.
Sterling was weak Tuesday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chief EU Negotiator Michel Barnier laid out opposing visions for the relationship between the two groups post-Brexit. 
Fears still exist that the U.K. could end the transition period at the end of this year without a trade deal.

The move contrasts with the country's overall policy of limiting imports against a backdrop of foreign currency shortages and depressed energy prices.
Serdar Berdymukhamedov, 38, the president's only son and regarded by some observers as a potential successor, became the governor of central Ahal province last year and has been tasked by his father with building a new provincial center.

Investing.com - The Australian dollar rose on Tuesday in Asia after the Reserve Bank of Australia decided to hold the official cash rate steady at 0.75% in its board meeting today. 
 
The decision was in line with expectation, as some analysts said the next rate cut is likely to occur in April. The central bank made no changes in its last two meetings. 
 
The AUD/USD pair traded 0.4% higher to 0.6715 by 1:05 AM ET (05:05 GMT). 
 
Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan recovered against the U.S. dollar today, although concerns about the widening coronavirus outbreak kept gains capped. 
 
The number of cases and deaths showed little sign of slowdown, as China reported on Tuesday that its total death toll from the virus increased to 425 and cases rose to more than 20,000.
 
""The question is how long it will take to contain the epidemic. While some people are selling risk assets, there are also lots of people who are looking for a chance for bargain-hunting,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, in a Reuters report. 
 
""If we start to see a decline in the number of new cases, then we could see an end. But at the moment, it is hard to say when that will happen.""
 
The USD/CNY pair last traded at 6.9961, down 0.3%.
 
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.1% to 108.80 as risk assets traded mostly in the green today. 
 
The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 97.660.
 
Overnight, the ISM manufacturing index for January showed an uptick to 50.9, beating expectations of 48.5. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday finalized a new rule to impose anti-subsidy duties on products from countries that it has determined undervalue their currencies against the dollar, including potentially China.
The move could provide a fresh irritant in U.S.-China trade talks just weeks after the world's two largest economies signed a Phase 1 trade agreement, and comes a day after Beijing accused Washington of spreading fear about the fast-spreading coronavirus that originated in China.
In theory, the new rule would allow the Commerce Department to impose duties on China, even though the U.S. Treasury Department recently removed its designation of China as a currency manipulator as part of the Phase 1 trade deal.
Commerce said it would generally rely on the Treasury's expertise in determining undervaluation, but the two processes could come to different conclusions since they resulted from different statutes. The draft rule was first published in May.
It said it would only impose countervailing duties on imports of specific products that both benefit from countervailable subsidies and are found by the U.S. International Trade Commission to injure U.S. industries.
The rule would not result in the application of such duties to all imports from a given country, because not all such imports injure U.S. industries, it said.
Commerce said the new rule was a measured response to longstanding, bipartisan calls to use existing laws to address unfair foreign currency practices, and was part of a broad push by the Trump administration to crack down on trade imbalances.
""The Trump Administration is doing the right thing by confronting the problem head-on,"" it said in a statement.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the new rule marked another important step intended to ""level the playing field for American businesses and workers.""
Mark Sobel, a former senior U.S. Treasury official and adviser to the London-based OMFIF economy policy think tank, said the new rule failed to address many of the concerns raised after the draft rules were published in May, and would likely be inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules.
""There is no precise way to measure currency undervaluation,"" he said, adding that Commerce had no responsibility or expertise in international monetary and currency matters. ""This is a unilateral policy which will alienate countries around the world.""
The Commerce Department said it would not normally include monetary and related credit policy in determining whether a government had acted to reduce the exchange rate of its currency to bolster its domestic industry.
In addition to China, the new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam and Switzerland.
Those countries were all on the ""monitoring list"" included in the Treasury Department's semi-annual currency report, which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.
The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation, including a finding of government action on the country's exchange rate."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Tuesday after a key U.S. manufacturing survey showed a surprise recovery, while concerns about a widening coronavirus outbreak in China kept the yuan and the Australian dollar subdued.
The dollar index (=USD) rose 0.44% on Monday, the biggest gain so far this year, and last stood at 97.802. It was boosted by a report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that U.S. factory activity unexpectedly rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders.
Against the yen, the dollar traded at 108.62 yen , after a gain of 0.3% on Monday, the biggest gain in a downtrend that started in mid-January.
The euro stood at $1.1062 (EUR=), having slipped 0.3% on Monday.
In Asia, coronavirus remained in focus as the number of cases and deaths showed little sign of slowdown.
""The question is how long it will take to contain the epidemic. While some people are selling risk assets, there are also lots of people who are looking for a chance for bargain-hunting,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
""If we start to see a decline in the number of new cases, then we could see an end. But at the moment, it is hard to say when that will happen.""
The offshore yuan traded at 7.0127 yuan per dollar , holding slightly above its one-month low of 7.0230 per dollar hit in European trade on Monday.
The Australian dollar fetched $0.6690 , within sight of its 10 1/2-year low of $0.6670 touched last October, ahead of an interest rate decision Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) due later in the day.
Although most investors expect the RBA to keep rates on hold at this month's meeting, a cut has not been completely ruled out, with markets pricing in a 100% chance of such a move by May.
Elsewhere, sterling fetched $1.2999 , having lost 1.54% on Monday on renewed worries about Britain's relations with the European Union. Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out tough terms for Brexit talks with the European Union, rekindling fears Britain would reach the end of an 11-month transition period without agreeing a trade deal.
Traders are also casting an eye on the U.S. state of Iowa, where Democrats are kicking off a process to choose a challenger to President Donald Trump.
Market players say a victory by a progressive candidate such Senator Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could hurt shares and lift safe-haven currencies as some of their policies are thought to be not in best interests of Wall Street."
454,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 04:51PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Unlike the cookies used to lure support at the Iowa caucuses, financial-market expectations for what could be a pivotal moment in the race to the White House are only half-baked.
The state is the first to choose its preference for a nominee. So the vote could push the dollar down and stir volatility in bonds if the latest polls are right that Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, will win, according to some strategists. Yet his prospects beyond that are far from certain, meaning there’s a vigorous debate among analysts about whether or not the result of Monday’s voting will ripple through asset prices.
Lauren Goodwin at New York Life Investments says two assumptions are deeply embedded in markets: one, that Donald Trump’s Democratic challenger is far from being decided; and two, that Trump will win a second term as U.S. president in November.
“It would be pretty hard to overstate how much the market expects a re-election scenario,” said Goodwin, who’s an economist and multi-asset strategist. Traders currently expect “the results in Iowa will be muddled enough that the Democratic candidate for the election is still a bit unclear.”
A poll released Sunday showed Sanders with a firm lead over his Democratic rivals -- including the moderate front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden -- heading into tonight’s Iowa caucus. Michael Bloomberg is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. He is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s currency strategists are focused on how this tug-of-war between the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic Party plays out as their strongest election-related cue on the dollar. They’re recommending a tactical short on the greenback versus the franc to brace for any election-related dips in the dollar over the coming months.
In their rationale, they cite a Jan. 24 report from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that identifies Sanders’ fiscal proposals as adding the most to U.S. budget deficits over the next decade. The study didn’t consider the potential impact from Trump’s proposals. The Congressional Budget Office projects the federal gap will widen to $1 trillion in 2020 and average $1.3 trillion over the next decade.
Moreover, traders have been adding to positions in euro-dollar options that would benefit from a weaker greenback. They now have the most negative stance on the dollar versus the euro in more than two years.
Markets are underestimating how much volatility Iowa could create,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by Praveen Korapathy reckon. They note that victory in this caucus boosts the winner’s odds of sealing the nomination by around 30 percentage points.
And the wider the gap in the economic policies of the two eventual candidates for the White House, “the greater degree of asset market volatility we would expect in response to swings in head-to-head polls,” the strategists wrote.
“While there are some kinks visible on both equity and interest rates options markets for both Iowa and Super Tuesday, there isn’t an elevated level of volatility priced in the intervening period or thereafter,” they said.
But Iowa is only the first post in this race. An online poll released Monday showed Sanders and fellow progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren in close competition with Biden in New Hampshire ahead of that Feb. 11 vote, with many still undecided.
And any market reaction to Iowa’s result is likely to be short term, in Goodwin’s view, as investors will set it in the context of the “ebb and flow of the election cycle,” and home in on the viability of the candidates’ platforms. “For most investors, it’s more productive to focus on policy changes for their portfolio positioning.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc declined on Monday, as risk sentiment improved and fears about the coronavirus eased after China took measures to cushion the economic impact of the new epidemic and pledged to do more to contain it.
China's offshore yuan dropped to a more than seven-week low against the U.S. dollar on Monday, but trimmed its losses as New York trading got under way.
After rising to multi-week highs against the dollar last week in the face of the coronavirus scare, the yen and Swiss franc took a pause from their climb as markets cheered China's efforts.
China's central bank unexpectedly lowered interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements by 10 basis points and injected 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets via reverse repo operations on Monday.
Chinese authorities also pledged to use various monetary policy tools to ensure liquidity remains reasonably ample and to support firms affected by the virus epidemic. 
The crisis has so far claimed 361 lives in China and 1 in the Philippines. 
""There was a turnaround in risk sentiment as the sell-off in stocks and the buying of safe-havens last week were a bit overdone,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus, Inc in Washington.
""But to be honest, I don't think there was any difference on the state of the virus between Friday and Monday. I guess markets like the fact that China is being pro-active in trying to contain the virus and in easing the impact on its economy,"" he added.
Chinese markets still took a beating in the first trading session after an extended Lunar New Year break. The offshore yuan dropped as low as 7.023 yuan per dollar . The dollar was last up 0.2% against the Chinese currency at 7.014 yuan. 
In afternoon trading, the dollar rose 0.3% against the yen to 108.67 , off a three-week low set on Friday.
The dollar also extended gains versus the yen after data showed the Institute for Supply Management's U.S. manufacturing index unexpectedly rose in January. 
""With global growth stabilizing in recent months and domestic demand also starting to pick up, the ISM survey adds to the evidence that 2020 is likely to be a better year for U.S. manufacturers,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist, at Capital Economics in London.
The Swiss franc also fell against the dollar, which climbed 0.3% to 0.9660 franc .
Gains against the yen and Swiss franc pushed the dollar index up 0.4% at 97.805 (DXY).
The euro also fell 0.3% versus the dollar to $1.1062 (EUR=).
Sterling, meanwhile, tumbled after Britain laid out a tough opening stance for future talks with the European Union following its departure from the bloc last week.
Sterling was last down 1.6% at $1.3030 , retracing all of its gains following the Bank of England's decision last week to keep interest rates on hold.

Invesing.com – The dollar climbed Monday, on data showing manufacturing activity expanded in January for the first time in six months, while a slump in the pound also boosted the greenback amid fears the U.K and European Union could clash on trade.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.42% to 97.62.
The ISM manufacturing index for January showed an uptick to 50.9, beating expectations of 48.5. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
Still, many expect that the turnaround in manufacturing is unlikely to be repeated.
""Looking ahead, we expect that the ISM Manufacturing Index will decelerate next month due to ... seasonal issues ... and the disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak,"" Stifel said in a note.
The weaker data did little to knock the dollar's advance thanks to a sharp decline in the pound.
GBP/USD fell 1.56% to $1.2994 as the U.K. and EU expressed opposing views on a future relationship, raising fears Britain risks leaving the economic bloc at the end of the transition period, Dec. 31, without a deal.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU was prepared to make a wide-ranging free trade agreement but stressed it would be conditional on the U.K. retaining various EU rules to ensure a ""level playing field.""
But U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was unwilling to adopt EU standards as means to secure a free trade deal.
EUR/USD fell 0.27% to $1.063, shrugging off data showing stronger-than-expected manufacturing activity in the eurozone.

The pound is back in the doldrums as concerns about a chaotic Brexit at the end of the year loom into view.
Sterling fell the most in a month, leading losses among Group-of-10 currencies, as traders brace for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to threaten to walk away from talks with the European Union rather than accept demands from Brussels to sign up to the bloc’s single market regulations. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is also due to set out his planned position on Monday.
The drop marks a turnaround from the U.K.’s formal exit of the EU on Friday, when the currency achieved its best week since mid-December after the Bank of England helped support the currency Thursday by keeping interest rates unchanged. While the U.K. is now in a transitional phase without rule changes, it could still be heading for an economically messy divorce if a trade agreement can’t be reached by the end of 2020.
“The U.K. government wants to pursue a harder Brexit trading relationship to allow more room for policy divergence with the EU which is seen as one of the key benefits of Brexit,” said Lee Hardman, a foreign-exchange strategist at MUFG Bank Ltd. “It continues to pose downside risks for the pound in the year ahead.”
The pound fell 0.8% to $1.3100 by 9:40 a.m., after gaining 1% last week. It dropped 0.6% to 84.48 pence per euro.
Sterling’s rally on Friday came on the back of month-end flows that pressured the dollar across the board and may have exaggerated a sense of buoyancy for the U.K. currency. Options market gauges were relatively steady, with bets on pound gains in the short and medium-term still in demand."

Investing.com - The Chinese yuan was hard hit Monday after the reopening of the country’s financial markets, with traders using this opportunity to register their concerns over the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus and the impact this could have on growth in the country.
At 03:10 ET (0810 GMT), USD/CNY traded at 7.0209, up 1.2%, breaking through the 7.0 level for the first time this year. The US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, pushed up 0.2% to 97.36.
Efforts to contain the spread of the virus, which has so far claimed 305 lives, have caused major disruptions and look set to deal a major blow to growth in China and globally.
Ahead of the reopening the Chinese central bank decided to cut reverse repo rates by 10 basis points and inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($173.8 billion) of liquidity into the markets on Monday. The net injection was far smaller, as around 1 trillion yuan in loans had been set to mature.
There had been concerns that the reopening of the financial markets on the Chinese mainland for the first time since the start of the Lunar New Year holiday would result in volatile trading.
“The EM currency space has stumbled badly on the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has impacted risk appetite,” said John Hardy, Head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank Group, in a research note.
“Coming into this virus outbreak, the EM complex and financial conditions could not have been more complacent, suggesting rather significant risk that significantly more volatility awaits if the concerns and fallout from the issue worsens,” he added, while urging “a very defensive stance on EM-related risk.”
Elsewhere, the euro has strengthened against sterling ahead of a speech by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London later Monday on the trade negotiations with the EU. Johnson is quoted in the U.K. press as saying ""there is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules.”
While the U.K. officially left the EU on Friday, it will remain wedded to EU rules during a transition period which ends in December this year.
Additionally, Philip Lane, the ECB's chief economist, cautioned against underestimating the effects of tariffs and rising wages in an interview with the Financial Times.
“There cannot be a permanent disconnect between labour costs and prices,” he said. “The narrative of ‘everything is inevitably low for longer’ — there is a lot of weight to that — but I do not put all my probability on it. You should watch out for other forces.”

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Bank Indonesia intervened in spot foreign currency trading as well as domestic non-deliverable forward and bond markets on Monday to stabilize the rupiah, an official said, as the currency fell 0.5% to the weakest since mid-January.
""BI is making sure of rupiah's stability,"" Nanang Hendarsah, the central bank's head of monetary management, told Reuters by text message.
""BI is boldly buying bonds in the secondary market and is offering DNDF (domestic non-deliverable forwards) through 8 brokers,"" he said, adding that intervention was also done in a measured way in the spot FX market.
Hendarsah attributed the rupiah's fall in early trade to a drop in China's equities market, which plunged after reopening from a 10-day Lunar New Year holiday amid a rapidly spreading virus epidemic.
The Chinese yuan and commodities markets in Shanghai slumped on Monday, on fears the coronavirus epidemic will hit demand in the world's second-largest economy. The death toll in China rose to 361 as of Sunday with the number of confirmed cases rising to more than 17,200.
The rupiah fell as much as 0.5% to 13,725 per dollar by 0442 GMT. So far this year, it has gained 1.1% helped by big inflows.
Indonesia is one of Asia's higher-yielding markets and has attracted heavy overseas inflows into its bond markets as investors sought better returns in a world of plunging interest rates.​
Indonesia's benchmark 10-year bond yield (ID10YT=RR) jumped to 6.701%, from the previous session's close of 6.645%.
The stock market (JKSE) fell 0.5% on Monday and is down 6.6% since mid-January, making it the second-worst performing in Southeast Asia after Manila so far this year.
BI intervened in bonds, DNDF and spot markets almost daily last week, according to a trader in Jakarta, but the central bank was seen focusing most of its intervention in the bond and DNDF markets.
Indonesia's one-month DNDF contracts on Monday traded at 13,751 to the dollar, stronger than comparable offshore non-deliverable forwards at 13,840 .
(GRAPHIC: Indonesia's central bank steps in to stabilize rupiah - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1689/1663/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
The interventions have helped keep the rupiah mostly stable in recent weeks, the trader said, but dollar liquidity in the spot market is tight.
""BI prefers to do their intervention through DNDF now, but most of the offshore traders are seeking dollar in the spot market, which currently is a bit illiquid,"" the trader said.
BI sold DNDF contracts worth more than $380 million early on Monday, the trader said, adding to around $450 million sold on Friday.
Meanwhile, the central bank believes the pressure on the rupiah is temporary.
""We believe the rupiah's weakness is temporary because fundamentally, the rupiah will be supported by a narrowing current account deficit, low and stable inflation and resilient growth,"" Hendarsah said."

Investing.com - The Chinese yuan fell more than 1% against the U.S. dollar on Monday in Asia amid continuing coronavirus worries. 
The USD/CNY pair gained 1.2% to 7.0173 by 11:30 PM ET (03:30 GMT). 
On Monday, China’s authorities reported that the death toll from the new coronavirus rose to 361 in China, while confirmed cases increased to 17,205.
Multiple countries including Australia, Singapore and the U.S. ramped up border controls and banned entry by foreign nationals who have recently visited China.
Last week, the World Health Organization declared the virus outbreak a global emergency but said travel and trade ban were unnecessary. 
The People’s Bank of China cut the rates on the funds by 10 basis points on Monday and said it will inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) into the financial system as the central bank seek to ensure ample liquidity.
While not a directional driver, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index eased to 51.1 from 51.5 in December, missing expectations but remaining above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for the sixth straight month.
The EUR/USD pair inched down 0.1% to 1.1081. 
On Friday, data showed German retail sales slumped 3.3% in December, a much weaker number than expected. The French economy also unexpectedly contracted in the final quarter of last year, with GDP shrinking 0.1%, the first time it has contracted since Emmanuel Macron took over as President.
Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair fell 0.3% to 1.3163 after the U.K. exited the European Union last week and said it would set its own agenda, creating uncertainties about future talks with the European Union.

Invesing.com – The dollar fell Friday, paced by losses against safe-haven currencies like the yen amid fears of a global pandemic as Chinese health authorities showed little sign they have a grip on the outbreak.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.41% to 97.25.
The new coronavirus has spread to nearly 10,000 people worldwide and the death toll in China rose to 213, raising concerns over China's ability to contain the outbreak, which could severely curtail global growth.
Against the backdrop of the coronavirus risk, investors have piled into safe havens like the yen and Swiss franc.
USD/JPY fell 0.49% to Y108.42 and USD/CHF fell 0.54% to 0.9641.
U.S. data, meanwhile, showing the ongoing weakness in manufacturing did little to support the greenback.
The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 42.9, well below forecasts of 48.8. That was the lowest reading since September 2015, as the slump in manufacturing activity continues.
As a leading indicator of the U.S. economy, the Chicago PMI helps economists measure business activity and new orders.
Consumer spending, meanwhile, increased 0.3% in December, in line with forecasts.
With just hours to go until the U.K. leaves the EU, the pound added to gains from a day earlier, rising 0.69% to $1.3184.
The pound surged on Thursday in the wake of the Bank England's decision to keep rates steady, with outgoing BoE Governor Mark Carney saying a cut would have risked inflation rising above the central bank's target.
EUR/USD rose 0.46% to $1.1081 despite ongoing signs of weakness in the eurozone economy after a preliminary reading of fourth-quarter GDP fell short of forecasts.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog will likely zero in on a chunky pound futures deal, which many reckon drove sterling's mystery spike just seconds before the Bank of England's interest rate announcement this week
The currency's jump to $1.3075 from $1.3024 in less than a minute before the central bank kept rates on hold -- instead of cutting as some had expected -- has raised questions on whether any market players knew of the decision before it became public.
While it is possible that the moves were coincidental, the Financial Conduct Authority said it would look into the issue in response to a request from the central bank.
But given the watchdog has regulatory oversight over derivatives rather than spot exchange rate markets, it will likely focus on the 100 million pounds in orders for sterling futures placed seconds before prices spiked, according to data from the CME, the world's largest futures exchange operator.
The CME page does not reveal who placed the bid for the chunky futures order, but Refinitiv data shows the pound quoted by a major bank at $1.3064 in the spot market, seven seconds before the BOE announcement hit newswires. That was 40 pips above the $1.3022 level contributed by another big bank two seconds earlier.
Any action in the futures market translates quickly into the spot market, analysts say.
There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the banks which can place orders on behalf of clients or just submit price quotes as market makers.
Rachel Kent, a securities lawyer at Hogan Lovells noted spot exchange rate markets do not come under the market abuse rules that allow regulators to fine firms for misconduct.
But the FCA could have room for enforcement if it were clear the sterling spike directly affected instruments that are regulated by the body, such as derivatives, she said.
In theory, it could also fall back on the FX code of conduct, a voluntary set of rules which were introduced globally after banks were fined for trying to rig currency markets. A senior manager at each regulated firm is legally accountable for upholding the code.
Regulated firms are also required to abide by the FCA's so-called general principles, a breach of which was used to fine banks for seeking to manipulate the Libor interest rate benchmark.
""If you are a regulated firm and even if the code is voluntary, the FCA could justify taking action for failure to act with integrity under one of its principles,"" Kent added.
The incident comes as FCA boss Andrew Bailey prepares to take over as BoE governor in March.
What's more, BoE's request for an FCA investigation is the second of this nature in recent weeks. In December the central bank said a rogue supplier had misused audio feeds from its news conferences, giving traders access to potentially market-moving information seconds before rivals.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee members vote on interest rates a day before the announcement. BoE staff then write the minutes and a Monetary Policy Summary which are published along with the decision at 1200 GMT on Thursday.
""There is confidential information circulating in the Bank for quite a long time,"" former MPC member Andrew Sentance told the BBC's Today program, though he urged markets not to ""jump to conclusions.""
The FX community meanwhile continues to debate the topic, with traders and analysts interviewed by Reuters calling on regulators and market participants to get to the bottom of the issue quickly.
""Banks have the means to look into it. They've done it in the past so they can do it again,"" said Athanasios Vamvakidis, global head of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""You definitely want to make sure that any question marks are being addressed, because you want to have an efficient market."""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some fund managers and investment houses who began the year bullish on Asia are already hedging some of their bets - or at least staying on the sidelines - as the spread of a new virus from China looks certain to weigh on the region's economy.
More than 200 people have died in China and almost 10,000 are infected. Many details about how fast the virus spreads and how deadly it is remain unclear and its overall cost difficult to gauge.
Airlines have pulled flights, factories have extended holidays, economists have slashed their China growth forecasts and Asian stocks have plunged.
All economists expect a rebound eventually, but differ on how hard and fast the bounce back comes.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) has fallen 9% in two weeks. Currencies widely expected to rise this year, such as the Thai baht, have tumbled and that is giving money managers cause to change their views, even if just for the time being.
The virus has jolted markets just as world economic conditions were improving and geopolitical risks were expected to abate with the signing of the Sino-U.S. trade deal, the top investment officers at Europe's biggest fund manager, Amundi, said in a note this week.
The 1.4 trillion euro ($1.6 trillion) fund downgraded its view of emerging markets FX from positive to neutral - citing risks to the baht and Chilean peso in particular - in what it called a ""tactical"" move to reduce volatility in portfolios.
Amundi is not expecting a long global shock from the virus, and in fact expects buying opportunities to arise as markets recover, but it is not alone in souring on emerging markets' currencies.
Price moves have already punished Thailand, which is heavily exposed to Chinese tourism. The baht, which has resisted months of policy easing, has shed 4% for the month.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which had in December expected the baht to grind higher over 2020, turned short on the currency on Tuesday, targeting a drop to 32 baht per dollar.
The bank's analysts also see the Singapore dollar weakening to between 1.38 and 1.40 Singapore dollars per greenback. The baht last traded at 31.12 per dollar and the Singapore dollar at 1.3624 per U.S. dollar .
""Both countries have room for a policy response which could weigh on FX, and neither central bank is likely to stand in the way of weakness,"" said Deutsche strategist Mallika Sachdeva.
Elsewhere economists have been cutting growth forecasts for China. J.P. Morgan cut its year-on-year growth figure for the first quarter to 5.6% from 6%. Citi expects it could fall as far as 4.8% in the quarter and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) estimates sub 5%.
UBS Asset Management, which controls $903 billion in assets, is sticking by its bullish view on stocks and debt in China and emerging markets.
""Our base case is that the virus has only a short-term impact on demand that does not extend into the second half of the year,"" said Evan Brown, head of multi-asset strategies, and Dan Heron, senior investment strategist, in a UBS client newsletter.
""Emerging market economies were hardest hit by the downturn in manufacturing and trade in 2018 and 2019. Simply put, we believe that they are the most leveraged to the rebound."""

Investing.com - The euro fell in early European trading Friday, weighed by signs of weakness in the region’s two largest economies.
At 03:10 ET (0810 GMT), EUR/USD traded at $1.1027, down 0.1%, while EUR/GBP fell 0.2% to 0.8398. 
First up, German retail sales slumped 3.3% in December, a much weaker number than expected, suggesting the country’s shoppers reined in their consumption in the final month of last year.
Retail sales are a volatile indicator, but this disappointing number came as a surprise after the GfK sentiment indicator suggested on Wednesday that consumer morale in the euro zone’s largest economy was healthy.
Earlier Friday, official data showed the French economy unexpectedly contracted in the final quarter of last year, with GDP shrinking 0.1%, the first time it has contracted since Emmanuel Macron took over as President.
This was much weaker than expected, as economists on average had forecast growth of 0.2% in the quarter.
France has been hit by a wave of strikes amid protests against Macron's controversial proposed pension reforms.
Preliminary data for eurozone GDP are due at 1000 GMT. The French numbers may be partly offset by better-than-expected ones out of Spain, where GDP grew 0.5% rather than the 0.4% expected.
Sterling meanwhile ticked up, after consumer confidence hit a 16-month high in January, on the day that the U.K. formally leaves the EU. GBP/USD was at a three-week high of $1.3140.
Elsewhere, the US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, pushed up 0.1% to 97.73.
The dollar remains in demand as a form of safe haven as the number of deaths from China’s coronavirus tops 200, with approaching 10,000 people affected.
That said, the Chinese yuan was a little stronger Friday, with USD/CNY at ,helped by the confidence shown by the World Health Organization in China's efforts to contain the outbreak.
""I have seen the capacity and I believe (China) will control this outbreak as soon as possible,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the heels of declaring the virus outbreak a global health emergency.

Investing.com - The Chinese yuan was flat on Friday in Asia as the World Health Organization (WHO) said China could “reverse the tide” and control the virus outbreak. 
The USD/CNY pair was unchanged at 6.9364 by 1:06 AM ET (05:06 GMT). 
The death toll in China has now reached 213 and the number of cases is 9,692 - up from 7,711 a day ago, Beijing confirmed today. 
Overnight, the WHO declared the fast-spreading virus a global health emergency, but noted that there is no need to issue travel and trade bans. 
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.1% to 97.755. The country’s GDP increased at a 2.1% pace in the fourth quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said in its advance estimate on Thursday, in line with forecasts.
On the labor front, initial jobless claims fell by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000, slightly missing economists' forecast for a drop to 215,000.
The GBP/USD pair was little changed at 1.3096 after the Bank of England held rates steady. Yesterday, the pound rose to a week high but Britain’s market watchdog was reportedly investigating the move because it began just before the bank's announcement.
The USD/JPY pair advanced 0.2% as global equities recovered. 
The AUD/USD pair and the NZD/USD pair were both little changed. "

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian currencies arrested their slide on Friday as confidence from the World Health Organization in China's response to a new virus and upbeat data from the world's second biggest economy tempered worries over a jump in new infections.
The WHO said late Thursday the outbreak was a global emergency, but China's response so far will ""reverse the tide"" of the virus' spread.
Together with official data showing Chinese services activity picking up this month, that was enough to pause selling from investors who are waiting for more information about the virus to judge its likely human and economic costs.
The death toll in China has now reached 213 and the number of cases is 9,692 - up from 7,711 a day ago.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars, which dipped on the news of rising deaths, recovered after the services data to hold steady. China's yuan was little moved at 6.9793 per dollar.
The Antipodean currencies have been pounded in recent weeks as investors pour out of assets exposed to the virus' fallout in China.
The Aussie is 4.1% weaker this month and, if the selldown does not reverse, is headed for its worst month since May 2016.
""Aussie and kiwi are what I've called the whipping boys, if you like, for expressing concern about the spreading of the virus and its potential global economic ramifications,"" said Ray Attrill, Head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank.
Some 60 million people in the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei province, are living under virtual lockdown. Several global airlines have stopped flying to mainland China and economists are slashing their forecasts for Chinese growth.
The yen and dollar have been beneficiaries of the resulting flight to safety.
The yen was steady at 109.00 per dollar and the greenback stable at $1.1030 per euro (EUR=EBS) in morning trade.
Against the Australian dollar, the yen has added 3.2% in the 10 days since concerns about the virus began roiling markets (AUDJPY=). Against the Korean won, the yen has gained nearly 4% (KRWJPY=R).
In Thailand - heavily exposed to Chinese tourism - the baht, which has stubbornly resisted months of jawboning and policy easing from the central bank, has shed 4% for the month.
""The problem for markets is the inability to price risk because lack of certainty around this,"" said Chris Weston, Head of Research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""We're probably going to hear a much clearer definition about how this is contained somewhere between the 3rd and 8th of February.""
Separately, relief the Bank of England held rates steady sent the British pound up 0.7% to a week high. Britain's market watchdog, however, is investigating the move because it began just before the bank's announcement."

Invesing.com – The dollar struggled to find its footing Thursday, amid mixed U.S. economic data and a sharp decline against the pound after the Bank of England held rates steady in the wake of firmer economic data.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.18% to 97.64 .
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% pace in the fourth quarter of last year, the Commerce Department said in its advance estimate on Thursday, in line with forecasts. But the growth was supported by a collapse in imports and final private domestic sales rose at an annualized rate of only 1.4% in the quarter, the slowest rate in four years.
The U.S. economy has been underpinned by strong consumer spending offsetting weakness in other areas like business investment and manufacturing.
""Business investment edged lower for a third straight quarter - the longest such streak since 2009 - with the industrial sector continuing to feel the pinch from the US-China trade war,"" RBC said. ""But consumer spending increased at a still relatively solid 1.8% pace (although that is down from a 3.1% increase in the third quarter) and residential investment growth picked up to its strongest pace in 2 years.""
On the labor front, initial jobless claims fell by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000, slightly missing economists' forecast for a drop to 215,000.
The greenback was also pressure by a surge in the pound as the Bank of England left its benchmark rate at 0.75%. But some analysts have suggested that a future rate cut is not completely off the table should the recent run of positive U.K. economic data fade.
""If the recent uptick in the data does not persist, those pressures will probably increase and markets may transfer cut expectations to the next BOE meeting,"" said George Lagarias, chief economist at Mazars. 
GBP/USD climbed 0.53% to $1.3091.
EUR/USD added 0.20% to $1.03 on mixed economic data from Germany as inflation undershot, but unemployment beat forecasts.
Safe-haven demand, meanwhile, continued to underpin the yen and Swiss franc as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 170, raising fears about the potential impact of the disease on global growth.
Fears of a pandemic intensified somewhat after Centers for Disease Control reported the first person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus in the U.S., which now has six confirmed cases. 
USD/JPY fell 0.33% to Y108.64 and USD/CHF fell 0.45% to 0.9688.

Sterling climbed as much as 0.5% after policy makers kept the rate at 0.75%. Policy makers voted 7-2 to keep the benchmark at 0.75%, an unchanged split that belied investor expectations the decision was on a knife-edge.
Money markets are now pricing a 100% chance of a cut in late 2020. Gilts erased their advance, with the yield on 10-year bonds little changed at 0.51%.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remains in demand Thursday, after the Federal Reserve did nothing to signal any near-term easing of policy despite issuing a statement that was seen as slightly less confident about the economic outlook. 
However, sterling could be the currency to keep an eye on in early trading in Europe, as the Bank of England meets to decide on its monetary policy.
At 03:00 ET (0800 GMT), the US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, pushed up 0.1% to 97.895, trading near a two-month high.
The greenback is the best performing currency among G10 currencies in January, with the dollar index rising 1.6% so far this month. Commodity currencies such as the loonie and Aussie have suffered most, due to fears for Chinese growth amidst a spreading coronavirus outbreak.
Overnight China's National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths had reached 170 as of late Wednesday, with the number of infected patients approaching 8,000. Infections have been reported in at least 15 other countries and in every province of mainland China.
This virus outbreak has resulted in weakness in many emerging currencies, with investors seeking out the safe haven status of the dollar. The offshore Chinese yuan briefly touched 7 to the dollar again overnight before strengthening just above that level later.
Elsewhere, sterling could be volatile Thursday, with a degree of uncertainty surrounding the meeting of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee.
At 03:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), GBP/USD traded at 0.2% lower at 1.3001, and EUR/GBP 0.2% higher at 0.8468.
At the start of the year the Bank of England was widely expected to cut interest rates at this meeting. A number of MPC members, including Governor Mark Carney, had spoken publicly about the weak state of the U.K. economy given the uncertainty surrounding the country’s exit from the European Union, which comes into effect on Friday.
However, economic data since then have been generally more positive than expected. For example, the services purchasing managers’ index – a gauge of the health of the country’s dominant sector – came in at 50 in December, ahead of a widely predicted reading of 49.2. 
“Despite a few economic data releases that came out stronger than expected, we still expect the BoE to cut the Bank Rate by 25bp,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note.
“ However, it is likely to be a close call, which is also reflected in market pricing, as investors are pricing a 45% probability of a cut, leaving some upside in EUR/GBP if we are right in our call,” the bank added."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar inched up on Thursday in Asia after the Federal Reserve said it will hold its benchmark rates steady as expected. 
The U.S. dollar index inched up 0.1% to 97.875 by 1:20 AM ET (05:20 GMT). 
The central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee said it will hold the rates between 1.5% and 1.75%. It was the second straight meeting the Fed made no changes to rates following three rate cuts in 2019. 
During his post-meeting news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed“wanted to underscore our commitment to 2% not being a ceiling, to inflation running symmetrically around 2% and we’re not satisfied with inflation running below 2%.”
""We expect (reserves to reach an ample level) during the second quarter and our plan, as we do that, is as those purchases get to that level we believe we can gradually reduce them and we believe we can also gradually reduce repo as we reach an ample level,"" he added. 
The decision came just hours after data showed weaker-than-expected housing activity.
The National Association of Realtors' measure of pending home sales unexpectedly fell 4.9% to 103.2 in December. That was the biggest decline since May 2010.
The GBP/USD pair was little changed at 1.3013. The Bank of England is expected to hold rates unchanged later in the day. 
The AUD/USD pair fell 0.2% to 0.6739, while the NZD/USD pair was also down 0.2% to 0.6509.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near a two-month high against a basket of major currencies while the Australian dollar and the yuan were under pressure on Thursday as investors tried to shield themselves from assets that could be hit by China's virus epidemic.
The U.S. Federal Reserve, while keeping interest rates on hold as expected on Wednesday, also cited the virus as a source of uncertainty for the economic outlook.
As the new pneumonia-like disease spread quickly in China and many of its trade partners in Asia and Europe, the dollar is emerging as an ultimate safe-haven destination.
The dollar is the best performing currency among G10 currencies so far this month, with the dollar index (=USD) rising 1.6% in January to hit a two-month high.
It last stood at 98.033, flat on the day but not far from Wednesday's two-month high of 98.037.
The yen and the Swiss franc, traditional safe-haven currencies, ranked a close second and third.
The yen traded at 109.06 yen per dollar , having gained 0.14% the previous day. The Japanese currency was down 0.3% against the dollar so far this month.
The Swiss franc changed hands at 0.9729 franc per dollar.
""The overall market is neither clear-cut risk-on nor risk-off. But in the currency market, the dollar, the yen and the Swiss franc are clearly favored now,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
""While it is highly uncertain how much the disease will spread and how hard it will hit the economy, downgrades to the Chinese economy looks inevitable.""
China's economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower due to the coronavirus outbreak, possibly pushing policymakers into introduce more stimulus measures, a government economist said in remarks published on Wednesday.
That would deal a severe blow to other economies that rely heavily to Chinese demand.
The Australian dollar fetched $0.6751 , having hit a 3-1/2-month low of $0.67355 in the previous session.
The euro stood at $1.1009 (EUR=), having touched a two-month low of $1.0992 in U.S. trade on Wednesday.
The offshore yuan steadied for now, trading at 6.9730 yuan per dollar , above the one-month low of 6.9900 touched on Monday.
Elsewhere, sterling traded unchanged at $1.3016 ahead of the Bank of England's policy decision later in the day.
Though expectations of a rate cut have substantially dropped after some robust data last week, they still remain almost 50%, suggesting the rate decision is likely to move the pound whichever way the BoE will go.

Investing.com – The dollar was little changed Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept rates steady and signaled that it was in no hurry to move off the sidelines. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.06% to 97.88.
In a unanimous decision, the Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
""The committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the committee's symmetric 2(%) objective,"" the Fed said.
The Fed's decision arrived just hours after data showed weaker-than-expected housing activity. 
The National Association of Realtors' measure of pending home sales unexpectedly fell 4.9% to 103.2 in December. That was the biggest decline since May 2010.
The surprise drop in housing activity is largely believed to be transitory amid a favorable backdrop of low-interest rates.
Upside in the dollar was also kept in check by demand for safe-haven yen as the spread of the coronavirus has been gathering pace, with the death toll in China rising to 132.
USD/JPY was flat at Y109.14 and USD/CHF rose 0.06% to 0.9734.
EUR/USD fell 0.16% to $1.1002, while GBP/USD fell 0.03% to $1.3024.

There are signs that concern in the global foreign exchange market over the deadly coronavirus may be wearing off.
Haven currency the Swiss franc slipped to nearly a three-week low against the dollar on Wednesday, even as the virus spread further. The Japanese yen, another traditional refuge, has failed to gain since Hong Kong initiated travel bans on Tuesday, while the Australian dollar is showing signs of weathering the outbreak.
Currency markets may be looking through headlines which have helped dictate sentiment across other asset classes. The move in the franc in particular indicates some traders have already adjusted their portfolios and are looking toward other risks instead.
Previous outbreaks of deadly diseases suggest currencies may be relatively resilient toward the spread of coronavirus, Nordea Bank Abp said in a research note earlier this week. While traditional bellwethers of risk appetite such as equities may face a temporary sell-off and bonds gain ground, moves in currencies are likely to be more contained, the bank predicted.
The haven moves may also be linked to speculation that the virus could prove less deadly than some of its predecessors.
“The latest focus seems to have shifted a bit to how the outbreak is progressing,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of foreign exchange strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank in London. “This episode has eclipsed the infection rate of SARS, but there are also some indications that the relative severity of those cases may not be as acute.”
Option markets are now signaling less bearish sentiment on the Australian dollar, a commodity-linked currency influenced by the country’s trade with China. One-week risk reversals, a barometer of positioning and sentiment, rallied in favor of buying the Australian dollar by the most in five months on Wednesday.
Signs are also emerging that the euro could be about to strengthen against the Swiss franc. An indicator of whether the euro is oversold against the franc rebounded from a five-year low on Wednesday. The so-called relative strength index rose above 30, a level seen as signaling a reversal in direction.
On technical charts, a candle pattern on the euro’s spot price against the franc on Tuesday suggested the shared currency could rise, or at least that a short-term bottom is in place.
Moreover, the euro-franc pair closed above a key long-term level at 1.0673, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of its gains since January 2015. That was when the Swiss National Bank removed its currency cap against the euro and triggered one of the biggest shakeups in foreign-exchange history. Options pricing remains relatively steady, as bets for a stronger franc in the short-term have lost traction since Jan. 17.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remained largely the currency of choice in early trading in Europe Wednesday, boosted by signs of a strengthening economy ahead of the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 03:15 ET (0815 GMT), the US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, had pushed up 0.1% to 97.90, trading around levels last seen in early December.
And more gains are possible given the apparent strength of the U.S. economy.
A closely-watched measure of U.S. consumer confidence impressed late Tuesday, jumping to its highest level since August, helped by low unemployment, mortgage rates and fuel prices.
This comes ahead of the latest rate-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve. 
“We expect the Fed to keep its target range unchanged at 1.50-1.75% without making any major changes to the statement,” said Danske Bank, in a research note, echoing the view of most in the market.
Fed chair Jerome Powell is likely to be asked about his views on the recent developments surrounding the coronavirus in Asia, “but we expect him to state that it is one of the risks the Fed is monitoring. In other words, the Fed is probably not going to strike a dovish tone given the labour market continues to tighten and private consumption growth remains solid.”
At 0315 AM ET (0815 GMT), EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1002.
The pair keeps looking to a potential test of the 1.0980 region, according to Karen Jones, Team Head FICC Technical Analysis Research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
“EUR/USD remains under pressure and attention is on the 1.0981 29th November low,” she added.
Elsewhere, U.K. house prices rose 1.9% from a year earlier, the most since November 2018, according to Nationwide Building Society. 
This will give the Bank of England food for thought ahead of Thursday’s meeting, particularly after the stronger than expected PMI data last week.
The central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates in the near future, with money markets predicting a near 100% likelihood of a reduction in the next six months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Risk currencies steadied on Wednesday as investors took stock of the economic damage from the outbreak of the coronavirus originating in China, with focus on Hong Kong shares that will resume trading later in the day after the Lunar New Year break.
As countries step up efforts to contain the spread of the deadly new virus, flight-to-quality bids in safe-haven currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc subsided for now.
The Australian dollar fetched $0.6758 , steady on the day and a tad above from Tuesday's 3 1/2-month low of $0.6737.
The offshore yuan traded flat at 6.965 yuan per dollar , off Monday's 6.9900 to the dollar, which was its weakest in almost a month.
While mainland Chinese markets will remain shut this week, markets will open in Hong Kong, where a lot of Chinese firms are listed, on Wednesday.
The euro stood at $1.1021 (EUR=), having hit a two-month low of $1.0998 in U.S. trade on Tuesday.
That helped to lift the dollar index (=USD) to a two-month high.
The yen traded at 109.16 yen per dollar , off Monday's three-week high of 108.73. It posted its first loss in five days on Tuesday.
President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China was sure of defeating the ""devil"" coronavirus while international alarm was rising as the outbreak spread across the world.
""The number of patients and death toll is rising day by day, nor do we know when vaccine will be ready,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.
""Yet, at the very base of market there is underlying optimistic sentiment, limiting risk-off moves,"" he said.
Behind investors' tolerance of risks are their expectations of policy support from the world's central banks.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times last year and expanded its balance sheet rapidly after ructions in U.S. bond repo market, a key dollar funding market, in September.
The Fed is expected to keep its policy on hold later on Wednesday and is likely to repeat its mantra that a ""material reassessment"" of the economic outlook would be required for any change in interest rates.
But some think a mere mention of risks from the coronavirus may spark speculation the Fed could dole out more stimulus if the U.S. economy is hit by fallouts from the outbreak.
Elsewhere, sterling traded at $1.3028 , off one-week low of $1.2976 set on Tuesday, capped by worries about Britain's future relationship with the European Union.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to grant Huawei a limited role in Britain's 5G mobile network is also said to have undermined the currency.
Traders feared the move may frustrate the United States, which is trying to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West's next-generation communications, putting the future of any U.S.-UK trade pact in doubt."

Invesing.com – The dollar climbed on Tuesday, underpinned by mostly bullish U.S. data and weakness in safe-haven currencies despite lingering concerns over the new coronavirus.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.12% to 97.97.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday durable goods orders rose 2.4% last month, beating economist forecasts for a 0.4% rise. But core durable goods orders unexpectedly fell 0.1%.
The beat on the headline durable goods orders is ""misleading"" as it was largely driven by a rise in aircraft defense orders, Jefferies said.
""This is a weak (durables goods) report and does not provide encouragement that conditions in the manufacturing sector are improving or will improve anytime soon,"" it added.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 131.6, beating economists' forecast for a reading of 128.
Consumer sentiment is a leading indicator of consumer spending, which plays a major role in overall economic activity.
The firmer dollar comes ahead of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's two-day meeting, which gets underway later today. 
Demand for safe-havens currencies eased, meanwhile, even as the death toll from the coronavirus in China rose to 106, with 4,600 affected globally.
USD/JPY rose 0.21% to Y109.13 and USD/CHF rose 0.39% to 0.9733.
EUR/USD slipped 0.02% to $1.1102 and USD/CAD fell 0.11% to C$1.3178.
GBP/USD fell 0.44% to $1.2996 as sentiment on sterling remains under pressure ahead of the Bank of England rate decision and Brexit.
""The Bank of England will probably cut interest rates at one of its next two policy meetings following recent signs of U.K. economic weakness,"" First State Investments said.
But Capital Economics disagrees.
""While there remains a chance that interest rates will be cut this year, we think it is more likely that the markets are caught out by rates being left at 0.75% this year and being increased to 1.00% in 2021,"" Capital Economics said."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar remains strong Tuesday, as heightened concerns about the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China prompt demand for currencies as safer. 
At 08:00 ET (0800 GMT), the USD/JPY traded 0.2% higher at 109.08, having fallen as low at 108.83 overnight. The US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, pushed up 0.1% to 97.81, approaching the levels last seen in early December. That follows broad gains against commodity currencies in recent days as the market has priced in the risk of a drop in Chinese demand for basic materials. 
Additionally, EUR/USD traded at 1.1019, after briefly visiting the 1.10 neighbourhood – or fresh yearly lows – at the beginning of the week.
The positive tone around the dollar, in combination with global growth concerns amidst the spread of the Chinese virus, have kept EUR/USD under heavy pressure of late.
“The pair remains under pressure although off Monday’s year-to-date lows near the psychological 1.10 mark,” said analysts at FXStreet. “Dynamics around the buck are expected to remain the exclusive driver of the pair’s price action for the time being along with alternating risk appetite trends in response to developments from the Wuhan coronavirus.”
With this in mind, attention is likely to be turned to the start of the Federal Reserve’s two day rate-setting meeting Tuesday, as well as the latest data releases in the U.S..
Durable goods orders are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are expected to have risen 0.3% last month, while at 10:00 AM ET, the January consumer confidence index is expected to come in at 128 from 126.5 in December.
Sterling was also weaker early Tuesday in Europe, amid concerns that the country will not be able to reach a trade deal with the EU by the end of the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year. GBP/USD and GBP/EUR were both around 0.2% lower."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yuan was mired near its weakest level in a month in offshore trade on Tuesday as heightened anxiety about the economic impact of a deadly new coronavirus in China battered riskier assets.
The Japanese yen, considered a safe-haven, traded near a three-week high versus the dollar as investors nervously watched the death toll from the virus climb to more than 100.
Global stocks and oil prices have tumbled over recent sessions on fears the virus could do further damage to China's already weakened economy, an engine of global growth.
Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to curb the spread of the virus, imposing stiff restrictions on travel and movement of people. Many of the largest Chinese cities in central Hubei province, where the flu-like virus originated late last year, are already on lockdown.
Scores of Chinese are canceling travel plans during the Lunar New Year, normally the busiest tourism season, while businesses in many cities have shut down.
""We still do not know the full scale of this outbreak, which is not only a public health problem but also an economic problem,"" said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.
""There are worries about the impact on tourism and China's broader economy, which affect global economic growth forecasts. The yuan is likely to be sold, and the yen is likely to rise.""
In the offshore market, the yuan was quoted at 6.9813 per dollar, near its weakest since Dec. 30. China's onshore markets are closed this week for Lunar New Year.
The yen held steady at 109.01 per dollar, close to its strongest level since Jan. 8.
Japan's currency has risen for the past five trading sessions against the greenback due to the growing risk aversion.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 97.932 following a 0.86% increase on Monday.
The coronavirus has spread to more than 10 countries. So far no fatalities have been reported outside of China.
The outbreak has evoked memories of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, another coronavirus which broke out in China and killed nearly 800 people in a global pandemic.
The Australian dollar traded at $0.6754, close to a three-month low. The New Zealand dollar was quoted at $0.6541 after falling on Monday to its lowest since mid-December.
Both countries have extensive trade ties with China, with tourism and education especially vulnerable to disruption from the virus.
The U.S. dollar was quoted at $1.1021 per euro (EUR=EBS), close to its strongest since December.
Officials from the U.S. central bank are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. They are expected to reiterate the Federal Reserve's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year.
The Bank of England also announces a policy decision on Thursday that many analysts say is too close to call.
The pound was little changed at $1.3064 on the dollar and at 84.37 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).

Invesing.com – The dollar remained on the back foot Monday, pressured by a surprise fall in new home sales data and a bid in the yen and Swiss franc as worries intensified over the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.12% to 97.97.
The Commerce Department said new home sales fell fell 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 units in December, confounding expectations for a 1.5% rise to 730,000 units.
The surprise drop in new home sales did little to steady the greenback against the yen and Swiss franc following a sharp uptick in safe-haven demand on reports of more Chinese deaths from the coronavirus.
USD/JPY fell 0.28% to $109.00 and USD/CHF fell 0.13% to 0.968.
The weakness in the greenback comes just a day ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting, which is expected to culminate in an unchanged interest rate decision.
EUR/USD slipped 0.02% to $1.1102 as German business confidence unexpectedly slipped in January, denting hopes that the weakness in the manufacturing sector had steadied.
With just a few days go until the Bank of England decision and Brexit, the pound remained under pressure against the greenback falling 0.21% to $1.308.

Sight deposits at the Swiss National Bank increased only marginally last week, suggesting President Thomas Jordan and his colleagues aren’t taking much action to counter the strengthening franc.
Iran-U.S. tensions and fears about the spreading Coronavirus has lifted the haven franc this year. Earlier on Monday, it breached the 1.07 per euro mark to touch a fresh three-year high.
Yet total sight deposits rose just 0.22% to 587 billion francs ($605 billion) in the week ending Jan. 24, central bank figures show.
While there’s been no evidence of interventions recently, the threat of action remains remains alive. SNB President Thomas Jordan told Bloomberg Television last week that the pledge to sell the franc if needed remains in place alongside the central bank’s record-low interest rates.
Last week, euro-area officials expressed optimism over signs of economic stabilization, citing easing global trade tensions and a mildly expansionary fiscal policy. UBS Group AG reversed its call for an SNB rate cut in March.
“The SNB is tolerating a bit stronger franc, maybe also because the economic environment is looking a bit better,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG economist Maxime Botteron said.
Responding to a U.S. decision to add Switzerland back on its watch list for currency manipulators, Jordan said the SNB was only looking to stave off deflationary conditions with its purchases of foreign currency.
He also said the SNB had the room to further cut its deposit rate, now at -0.75%,"

The Chinese government extended the week-long new year holiday by three days at the weekend, giving more time for screening and other countermeasures to take effect, but signalling a bigger-than-expected near-term hit to both retail sales and industrial output. 
Nearly 2,000 people in China had been infected and 56 killed by the disease, Chinese authorities said Sunday, although reports state that the death toll has since increased to 80.
""According to recent clinical information, the virus's ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,"" China's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said at a press briefing Sunday, adding that it is infectious in its incubation period, i.e. before symptoms show, making it harder to contain.
The virus apart, markets are bracing for policy meetings later this week at the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
“We doubt the Fed will have too much impact on USD/JPY this week,” ING analysts said in a research note, adding that Japanese data this week includes updates on Tokyo CPI, Employment, Industrial Production and Retail Sales. 
“At its recent meeting, the Bank of Japan modestly upgraded growth and downgraded its inflation forecasts to leave its complicated monetary policy unchanged. It is hard to see BoJ policy having much impact on the JPY this year,” ING added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yuan fell in offshore trade on Monday to its lowest level in three weeks as the death toll in China from the spread of a new coronavirus mounted, raising worries authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak and sparking a bout of risk aversion.
Japan's currency, often sought as a safe-haven in times of uncertainty, initially jumped versus the dollar to the highest since Jan. 8 before erasing some of those gains as investors gauged public health officials' response to the virus.
China's cabinet announced it will extend the Lunar New Year holidays to Feb. 2 to strengthen the prevention and control of the new coronavirus, state broadcaster CCTV reported early on Monday. The holidays had been due to end on Jan. 30.
Hong Kong has also banned the entry of visitors from China's Hubei province, where coronavirus outbreak was first reported in the city of Wuhan, underscoring the difficulty officials face during a peak travel season.
Health authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has infected more than 2,000 people in China and killed 80.
There are concerns that tourism and consumer spending could take a hit if the virus spreads further, which would discourage investors from taking on excessive risk.
""There is a lot of uncertainty about how much further the virus will spread, and this is behind the moves in currencies,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""I thought dollar/yen would be supported at 109, but it broke through that, so now the next target is 108.50. This risk-off mood is likely to continue for a while.""
In the offshore market, the yuan was under persistent pressure and slumped to 6.9776 per dollar, the weakest since Jan. 6.
The yen rose to 108.73 per dollar, its strongest level since Jan. 8, before paring gains to trade up 0.16% at 109.09.
Japan's currency also jumped more than 0.5% versus the Australian (AUDJPY=) and New Zealand dollars (NZDJPY=) as worries about the virus drew traders toward safe-haven currencies.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 97.881.
Traders said market moves could be exaggerated due to low liquidity, because financial markets in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia are closed for holidays.
The virus, which emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread to other countries, including Singapore, South Korea, Canada, Japan, and the United States.
China's National Health Commision confirmed 80 deaths from the coronavirus and 2,744 cases as of end of Sunday.
Big businesses across China are temporarily shutting stores or advising staff to work from home. Companies are also offering longer holidays, cancelling events, and imposing quarantine.
Singapore's government said on Monday the virus will hurt its already wobbly economy, and is considering tax breaks for the tourism sector and other firms.
The outbreak has evoked memories of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, another coronavirus which broke out in China and killed nearly 800 people in a global pandemic.
Sterling, the euro, and the dollar were subdued as traders awaited the release of economic data and two central bank meetings.
The pound was little changed at $1.3060 on the dollar, and 84.46 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3).
The Bank of England is closer to cutting interest rates this week than at any time in the last three years when it announces its policy decision on Jan. 30.
Growth at end of 2019 slowed to its weakest since 2012, prompting BOE Governor Mark Carney and two other policymakers to speak publicly about the possibility of a rate cut.
However, monetary easing is far from certain because other data have shown a pick up in business and consumer sentiment.
The dollar was quoted at $1.1028 per euro (EUR=EBS), little changed on the day but close to its strongest since December.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep policy on hold at a meeting ending Jan. 29. Data on the U.S. housing market, durable goods, and consumer confidence will be released before the Fed's decision.",,,,,
484,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 04:41PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Euro bulls may be looking at a longer wait before they can break free, with a compelling case that the shared currency may head lower into next week’s Federal Reserve monetary policy decision.
It comes in defiance of consensus views among analysts for the euro to rebound, an expectation also reflected by current pricing in the options market. The common currency slipped to a seven-week low of $1.1026 on Friday, at a time when the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey calls for a move to $1.1400 by end-June and sentiment through options remains bullish for the common currency. That’s turned the currency’s charts bearish in the short-term and may leave long positions looking exposed.
The euro failed to gain traction even after euro-area composite PMI data offered pockets of promise and the European Central Bank warned investors not to assume that policy is on autopilot mode. Momentum selling emerged earlier when the Governing Council’s meeting on Thursday didn’t offer signs that it was looking to tighten monetary policy soon.
Volatility in the euro fell to fresh record lows this week, a pattern that supports the case of it being used as a funding currency of choice for carry trades. That came as Europe became the focus of global trade relations, after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said tariffs on auto imports from the European Union remained under consideration.
The main check point for the market next week is Wednesday’s Fed rate call. Any rebound for the euro may depend on U.S. monetary policy rhetoric sounding more-dovish-than expected. A strong aversion to riskier trades and the ongoing dominance of tight ranges in the spot market could also help.
But don’t forget that the Fed isn’t expected to cut interest rates any time soon and the hurdle remains high for officials to sound outright dovish as the latest data have positively surprised the market, undermining the chances for a euro boost. That leaves the shared currency’s bulls looking for traction elsewhere. Market jitters over the economic effects of a China-originated virus could prompt outflows out of emerging markets and back to the euro area.
Euro bulls’ best chance may be with short-term traders who look to fade dips as expectations for a large move next month stand at multi-year lows. Technically, the euro remains in a bearish trajectory below its 55-daily moving average, currently at $1.1095, and may target a move below $1.0950, which could satisfy the projection of a head and shoulders pattern that was completed this week.
A lower volatility environment has pressured the euro in the past two years, yet at the moment it is just what could offer some short-term relief.

Investor attention will turn to the flash PMI releases for January, which are some of the first indicators of how the global economy has performed moving into 2020.

“In this environment, markets could pay most attention to the comments talking about a tentative stabilization of economic data and some removal of downside risks,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “which in other words would mean less need for immediate easing.”
That said, Nordea doesn’t expect the euro to receive much lasting support from the central bank, “as the bar for the market to price in any notable ECB tightening remains high.”"

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen was firm and the Chinese yuan fragile on Thursday as traders kept a wary eye on the spread of a virus in China, while the ailing Australian dollar jumped after a surprise drop in unemployment.
Deaths from the flu-like coronavirus, rose to 17 on Wednesday. A total of 571 cases have now been confirmed and Chinese state media reported overnight that transport to and from the city of Wuhan in central China, where the outbreak originated, is to be shut from 0200 GMT.
The World Health Organisation will decide later on Thursday whether to declare the situation a global health emergency.
""We'll be taking our leads from China and sentiment on the ground,"" said Chris Weston, Head of Research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""USD/CNH remains a solid guide, and I see risks if we see the cross push into 6.9150 ... with a belief that the Chinese authorities will stimulate should economics be threatened.""
The yuan held around 6.9110 per dollar in morning offshore trade , not far above a two-week low hit on Wednesday.
The Japanese yen , seen as a haven by virtue of Japan's position as the world's largest creditor, rose 0.1% to a two week high of 109.65 per dollar as investors sought safety.
The U.S. dollar was otherwise steady, holding at about $1.1093 per euro (EUR=) and at 97.527 against a basket of currencies (DXY).
A major concern is that the virus could spread quickly as millions of people travel across China, and the world, to celebrate the Lunar New Year at their hometowns.
""China's efforts to be transparent is a reprieve for markets, but our suspicion is that cautiousness is likely to remain a near-term theme nonetheless,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.
""For now it remains to be seen if China has managed to contained the outbreak, particularly given the upcoming holidays.""
Elsewhere the Australian dollar , which has shed more than a cent this year as the domestic economy stalls, rose 0.5% to $0.6877 after jobs data showed an unexpected drop in unemployment.
The figures showed 28,900 jobs created in December, nearly double market expectations, prompting a rapid unwinding of bets that the central bank will cut rates next month.
Futures pricing shifted quickly from an even probability of a rate cut to only about a 1/4 chance.
The British pound sat a fraction below a three-week high at $1.3147, after an overnight rebound in manufacturing sentiment prompted investors to trim rate cut bets.
Factories' optimism about the outlook rose to its highest since August 2014, according to a quarterly survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The focus now turns to broader business surveys due on Friday."

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.06% 97.58.
The National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose 3.6% to a 5.54 million annual rate. That was the strongest pace of growth since February 2018.
Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, attributed the higher level of housing activity to strong job creation, high consumer confidence and low mortgage rates.
A sharp uptick in the pound, meanwhile, kept the dollar on the backfoot as positive U.K. economy data cooled expectations that the Bank of England will cut rates at the end of the month.
GBP/USD rose 0.59% to $1.312.
But some analysts see limited upside for cable, arguing that seasonal factors will likely weigh on the sterling.
""There is little evidence so far of a broad based rebound in sentiment following the general election plus seasonal factors tend to weigh on GBP through February and March,"" Bank of America said.
With just a day ago until the European Central Bank meeting, the euro was largely flat against the dollar at $1.109.
USD/CAD rose 0.62% to C$1.315 after the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark rate on hold, but left the door open to a future rate cut, saying that it will monitor data to gauge whether the recent slowdown in domestic growth has accelerated.
""Today's statement makes us more comfortable with our call for a rate cut in April, and market odds of a move by mid-year are now slightly above 50%,"" RBC said
The loonie was also knocked by a fall in oil prices after the International Energy Agency warned of a surplus in oil supplies by 1 million barrels per day in the first half of this year.

Investing.com -- Sterling jumped by over half a percent on Wednesday against both the euro and the dollar after an upbeat survey from the Confederation of British Industry and evidence of the new government rapidly increasing spending further dented the case for an interest rate cut from the Bank of England.
By 7:28 AM ET (1228 GMT), GBP/USD was up 0.5% at $1.3111, after hitting an intraday high of $1.3124, while EUR/GBP was down 0.5% at 0.8449.
The public sector’s net cash requirement surged to 16.6 billion pounds ($21.7 billion) in December, as the government raised wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, a sign that fiscal policy in the U.K. is likely to be significantly more supportive of the economy this year as the government implements its expensive election promises. That should reduce the need for monetary stimulus, other things being equal.
More importantly, the CBI’s monthly survey of manufacturing companies showed the biggest improvement in six years in optimism over the last three months, even though output continued to suffer as a result of falling auto production.
“With business optimism improving at its fastest pace since 2014 and some of the squeeze on investment plans lifting, it’s clear manufacturers are entering the new year with a spring in their step,” the CBI’s deputy chief economist Anna Leach said in a statement. “Firms are now planning to invest more in plants and machinery, which will ultimately help increase capacity and output.”"

However, the Canadian dollar has downside risk on the back of this meeting, according to Francesco Pesole, an analyst at ING, in a research note.
“Investor sentiment around the prospect of BoC easing has shifted significantly in the past few months,” he said. But “we suspect that a downward revision to the GDP forecasts .… may be on the cards.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Storm clouds are gathering over the U.S. dollar, threatening a two-year rally in the currency that has squeezed corporate profits and angered President Donald Trump.
Dollar bullishness in future markets stands at its lowest level in more than a year-and-a-half, according to the most recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission measuring the net dollar amount of bets on a rising greenback.
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) say the dollar triggered a so-called ""Death Cross"" on the last day of 2019. The bearish technical formation occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, something that has been followed by a period of dollar weakness in seven out of eight instances since 1980, the bank said in a recent report.
Easing worries over global trade and Brexit are stoking investor appetite for risk, pushing them out of safe haven assets like the dollar, said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities.
""The global economy looks like it's healing,"" he said. ""The reduction of uncertainty will likely allow investors to take risks ... they didn't want to take before.""
Because of the dollar's central role in the global financial system, gauging its path is important for corporations and investors. Over the last several years, the currency has withstood a number of factors that analysts believed would pull it lower, including a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve and fears of a U.S. growth slowdown.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) Dollar Index edged 0.2% higher last year and was up around 10% from its 2018 low.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. Dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1349/1331/Capture.png)
UBS,  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and Société Générale are among banks calling for the dollar to fall this year. DoubleLine Capital's Jeffrey Gundlach has also told investors he believes the dollar's next big move will be lower. 
The buck's long stay near the top of its trading range has weighed on the balance sheets of multinationals like Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR), making it less profitable for them to convert foreign earnings into dollars.
Trump has complained about the dollar's strength, in part because it makes U.S. products less competitive abroad. An index that measures the dollar against the currencies of the largest U.S. trading partners stands near an all-time high.
Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management, believes that trend will soon reverse. He is betting the dollar will fall against the euro, Japanese yen and Australian dollar as growth in those countries accelerates and their central banks raise interest rates while the Federal Reserve keeps them steady. That should narrow the gap in yields that has buoyed the U.S. currency. 
A few central banks already appear to be shifting to a less dovish stance. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised investors when it left rates unchanged at its November meeting, while Sweden's central bank last month became the first to raise rates back to zero from negative territory.
The European Central Bank, for its part, has signaled that it is done cutting rates for now.
Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London, likes a range of emerging market currencies, including the Mexican peso and Indian rupee. He expects the currencies of developing countries to rise against the dollar as global growth picks up. 
(GRAPHIC: Emerging Markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1351/1332/EM%20Grahic.png)
Others though believe that any dollar weakness will be short-lived.
Lee Ferridge, North American head of multi-asset strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets in Boston, doubts that yield spreads between the United States and other developed countries will narrow enough to dent the dollar's appeal.
In fact, a sharp slowdown in U.S. growth would likely send nervous investors back into the dollar, he said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen was supported while the yuan was on the back foot on Wednesday as investors tried to assess the risk of the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China disrupting the country's economy and trade partners.
The virus, which causes a type of pneumonia, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai as the number of patients in China more than tripled. More cases were also reported outside China, including the United States.
Against the yen, the U.S. dollar slipped to 109.86 yen from Tuesday's high of 110.23.
The offshore yuan lost 0.6% on Tuesday, its biggest fall in more than a month, and last stood at 6.9100 yuan per dollar .
The Australian dollar, often used as a proxy bet on the Chinese economy, fetched $0.6844 , near its lowest levels in 10 weeks.
News of the coronavirus evoked memories of the 2002/03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally and led to a sharp downturn in tourism in Asia.
""The obvious comparison people are making is with the SARS. While we still don't know how lethal the new virus will be, my sense at the moment is that markets are not taking it as dire as SARS,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of currencies at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Tokyo.
""Back then, virtually every company was banning travel to Hong Kong. We haven't seen that kind of reaction yet,"" he said.
Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan market research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said that while the SARS outbreak caused massive economic downturn in Hong Kong and Singapore for about eight weeks through a drop in tourism, the pandemic had limited impact on supply chains in Asia.
""If the latest virus reaches a similar magnitude, some economies such as Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia could be negatively affected by a drop in tourism. But its long-term impact on the global economy and the currency market will be limited,"" he said.
The euro stood at $1.1083 (EUR=), after dipping slightly on Monday.
Sterling traded at $1.3050 , having gained a tad on Tuesday after data showed the British economy created jobs at its strongest rate in nearly a year in the three months to November.
The strong data slightly dented expectations of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England at the end of this month, though markets are still pricing in about a 60% chance of a 0.25 percentage point cut."

Hungary’s government offered to buy back $1 billion in dollar-denominated bonds, the latest effort to reduce foreign-currency risk and exposure to investors abroad.
The tender offer relates to four notes maturing in 2021-2024 with a total issue size of $9 billion, and expires on Jan. 27, according to a person familiar with the matter, who is not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. Hungary won’t issue foreign debt to fund the deal, Finance Minister Mihaly Varga told the MTI state news service.
Hungary has cut the share of foreign-currency bonds to 18% from more than 50% a decade ago, helped by sales of retail notes domestically. These bonds now account for almost a third of government debt. The eastern European nation has earmarked 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in non-forint debt sales for 2020, with a focus on selling green bonds denominated in Japanese yen or Chinese yuan.
Varga said successful economic policies, a favorable market environment, and low financing needs this year allow Hungary to replace high-yielding foreign-currency debt with longer-maturity funding.
Hungary’s dollar bond due 2024 jumped after the announcement, pushing yields 3 basis points lower on the day to 2.06%.
The tender, which is managed by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., follows the debut sale of a new benchmark 20-year forint bond last week. The debt agency sold 17 billion forint at the auction, more than the 15 billion forint planned."

LONDON (Reuters) - The swift repricing of short-dated UK interest rate futures has sent bond yields plunging but barely moved sterling, which is still holding out hopes of a post-election, post-Brexit inward investment bounce that will lift the pound in time.
On Jan. 9, money markets saw just a 20% chance of an interest rate cut this month. But by Jan. 17, dismal UK growth and inflation readings from late 2019 and a series of speeches from Bank of England chief Mark Carney and at least three of his policymaking colleagues pushed those easing expectations to 70%.

(Graphic: Money markets price UK interest rate cut: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1287/1273/moneymarket.png)
Gilt markets responded with a roughly 25 basis point fall in yields. But sterling, which would typically weaken on the prospect of lower rates, slipped by less than 1%.
""We do not often see such a dichotomy between gilts and sterling,"" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho. ""The explanation would lie in the gilt market focusing heavily upon interest rate expectations while the pound ... is also looking at other factors such as longer-term investor inflows.""
Bullish sterling bets rose to 21-month highs in the week to Jan. 14, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and speculators are now substantially net 'long' of pounds.
Derivatives markets also show little sign of worry -- for the first time since October, there's an implied volatility premium to buy one-month sterling 'calls' over puts -- options conferring the right to buy and sell, respectively.
(Graphic: Sterling risk reversals: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1314/1300/riskreversals.png)
Sterling remains sensitive to developments following Brexit on Jan. 31, however, while Carney's replacement as central bank governor by Andrew Bailey next month is another source of potential uncertainty.
The pound relapsed below $1.30 on Monday after comments by finance minister Sajid Javid revived fears that Britain and the European Union will not have agreed a trade deal before the post-Brexit transition period expires at year-end. It has recovered since.
Investors have mostly shunned Britain since the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, pulling around $30 billion from UK shares, according to EPFR data, while firms borrowing on bond markets have been saddled with a 'Brexit premium'.
Direct investment from abroad dropped 6% last year, United Nations data showed on Monday, after a 36% plunge in 2018.
But relief that Brexit is happening with a political agreement in place and commitment to talks on a trade deal is encouraging hopes of some rebalancing toward UK assets within international portfolios.
A rate cut would lift those assets further, offsetting the impact on sterling.
What's more, the March 11 budget should bring some big fiscal stimulus. The government has pledged the largest public services spending increases in 15 years, with plans to spend 3% of annual output on infrastructure, almost double historical averages.
""Even if the BOE cuts rates, fiscal policy will be supportive and that suggests upside for sterling,"" said Sarah Hewin, chief Europe economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), who expects the BOE to cut next week then stop.
She noted that the data which drove the money market shift -- growth, inflation and retail sales -- were from before Dec. 12's election, so would not reflect the upticks registered by some post-election surveys on business confidence and housing.
Flash January Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings on Friday will be the first significant indicator of business sentiment after the election.
""The broader theme is yes, the BoE may cut but this ought to be enough to allow the economy to stabilise,"" Hewin added.
Some argue that gilts reacted to a clearly dovish signal from policymakers who had until now mostly implied rates could move either way. That left short-dated yields more or less tracking the 0.75% Bank Rate, said Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services.
""The adjustment in the gilt curve is all about having somewhat greater clarity on where rates are likely to go over the next six to 12 months,"" Ostwald said.
Sterling has meanwhile been the main Brexit barometer, he said, with the possibility of crashing out of the EU keeping the currency languishing well off pre-referendum levels of $1.50.
On a ""real"" basis too -- against the currencies of Britain's trade partners -- sterling remains below its long-term average. Fair value is around $1.40, Hewin reckons.
(Graphic: Sterling cheap on a historical basis: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1290/1276/valuations.png)
Of course, the build-up in 'long' positions makes sterling vulnerable should data, BOE signals or trade headlines disappoint.
UK economic surprises, reflected by a Citi index, are already the most negative since August, contrasting with positive momentum almost everywhere else.

Ned Rumpeltin at TD Securities expects a sober reassessment to dull sterling's election-led cheer.

The outbreak of the disease, which has spread from the central city of Wuhan, is still in its early stages. So far there have been four deaths confirmed, but with the peak travel season during the Lunar New Year holidays approaching, the risk that it could spread further is rising.
The impact of the 2002 SARS epidemic is still fresh in many minds. On that occasion more than 8,000 people across 37 countries were affected, with around 800 deaths. 
So far the movements in the foreign exchange market have been fairly restrained, with traders fairly sanguine about the situation.
“There is no doubt that eventually the virus will be contained – it’s just a question of when, and does it scale in magnitude,” said Kay-Van Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Bank, in a research note. 
He added that it’s hard to see a case where this becomes super negative for Chinese (and proxy Hong Kong) equities, and by extension the yuan, “unless it somehow induces local panic selling – yet things would have to get dramatically worse for such a scenario.”
That said, it’s important to remember the impact of the SARS pandemic, with a 2003 academic study estimating the global economic cost at close to $40 billion or more."

Investing.com - The Chinese yuan slid on Tuesday in Asia as authorities confirmed a new virus can be passed form person-to-person. 
 
The USD/JPY pair lost 0.2% to 109.96 as Asian markets traded lower. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept rates unchanged, but took a brighter view of the economy
 
The BOJ raised its growth projections for the first time in a year. The central bank trimmed its inflation forecast at the same time. 
 
The decision came ahead of meetings by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve later this week and next.
 
The USD/CNY pair gained 0.4% to 6.8931 as a pneumonia-like virus in China continued to spread. China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed that two cases of infection in China's Guangdong province were due to human-to-human transmission. 
 
In a separate statement, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus, with one in a critical condition.
 
The news sent Chinese stocks down more than 1% while the yuan also fell. The outbreak of the disease came right before the Chinese New Year, which is a peak travel season, raising risks that the virus could spread further. 
 
The AUD/USD pair traded 0.1% lower to 0.6862 amid concerns about the Chinese virus. 
 
The U.S. dollar index was little changed at 97.335. 
 
While not a major directional driver today, the International Monetary Fund predicted that global growth will be slower than previously expected. 
 
The fund said growth will accelerate this year to 3.3% from 2.9% in 2019. That’s the first pickup in three years, but less than the 3.4% projected in October.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen pulled ahead and the yuan fell against the dollar on Tuesday as the spread of a pneumonia-like virus in China sparked a sudden bout of risk aversion and sent Asian stocks skidding.
The yuan slipped against the U.S. currency in onshore and offshore trade after a Chinese health expert said the virus can pass from person to person as the fourth death from the illness was confirmed.
The outbreak of the disease, which has spread from the central city of Wuhan, is still in its early stages. However, it comes right before the peak travel season during the Lunar New Year holidays, raising risks that it could spread further.
""Hong Kong stocks fell sharply at the open due to worries about the virus, which sparked risk-off trades that pushed up the yen and U.S. Treasuries,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
""So far, the number of deaths from the virus is low, so hopefully there will not be a big panic.""
The yen edged 0.2% higher to 109.97 per dollar on Tuesday.
In the onshore market, the yuan fell to 6.8973 per dollar, the lowest level in almost a week. In the offshore market, it dropped to 6.9007.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 97.589, near the highest level in a month.
The yen remained higher after the Bank of Japan kept its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1% and its pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero.
The BOJ also nudged up its growth forecasts, but traders will scrutinize governor Haruhiko Kuroda's remarks at a press conference later on Tuesday.
Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar fell 0.15% to $0.6865 as worries about the Chinese virus hurt currencies sensitive to risk. The New Zealand dollar also eased slightly to $0.6607.
The euro was locked in a narrow range before a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday where it is expected to launch a comprehensive review of central bank strategy, including the ECB's inflation target.
Against the dollar, the euro (EUR=EBS) traded at $1.10968 The common currency was also quoted at (EURGBP=D3) 85.30 pence.
The ECB's first meeting of the year is most likely to launch a rethink of an inflation goal the bank has failed to meet since 2013.
The scope and scale of the review will be a key focus for markets given the far-reaching implications for monetary policy.
A slightly brighter tone to data means the ECB's assessment of the economic outlook will also be watched closely by investors on Thursday."

The Swiss National Bank appears to have resisted taking dramatic action in the past week to curb the franc’s appreciation to the strongest in almost three years.
Sight deposits at the SNB, considered an early indicator of activity, increased about 1.3 billion francs ($1.3 billion) to 585.9 billion francs in the week ending Jan. 17. That’s a gain of 0.2%, and analysts said it suggests no intervention.
The figures come as the franc pushes higher against the euro, something the Swiss central bank has been battling against for a decade. The currency rallied 0.7% last week after the U.S. Treasury added Switzerland back onto its currency watch list.
Yet the sight deposit data suggest the SNB didn’t do much to counter the rally, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Maxime Botteron considering the figures in line with seasonal fluctuations. A spokeswoman for the SNB declined to comment on the data.
The SNB has used interventions on-and-off for years, and the franc’s recent appreciation had raised speculation it might have done so again recently. To help control the currency, which investors typically buy at times of market stress, the SNB also has a deposit rate at a record low of -0.75%.
Just days after the U.S. decision to monitor Switzerland, Alternate SNB Governing Board Member Martin Schlegel stressed that if policy needs to be eased, there’s room to expand the balance sheet.
Swiss central bank officials don’t usually comment on intervention and they they publish statistics once a year.
According to St. Galler Kantonalbank Chief Investment Officer Thomas Stucki, the SNB will continue to selectively intervene. An average franc appreciation of 1.5%-2% annually is manageable for the country, he said.
“Our base case is that the pace of franc strength wears off -- but in the event of a deteriorating euro-zone outlook the franc appreciation drift could resume,” said Christin Tuxen, Danske Bank’s head of currency research.

At 03:35 ET (0835 GMT), the Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was essentially flat at 97.40. USD/JPY traded flat at 110.15, EUR/USD at 1.1095, up 0.1%, and GBP/USD at 1.2979, down 0.2%.
Figures released by the Commerce Department on Friday showed U.S. housing starts in December were well above economists' estimates for 1.38 million and were the biggest gain in 13 years.
Retail sales were also on the rise and a gauge of manufacturing activity rebounded to its highest in eight months.
The positive data reduced chances that the Federal Reserve would slash rates when it meets later this month. 
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are also not expected to make any changes in their first policy meetings of the year this week, but the Bank of England is widely expected to cut rates in the near future.
The dollar story is staying firm in the G3 space, analysts Chris Turner, Petr Krpata and Francesco Pesole at ING, said in a research note. “Talk of a Republican Tax Cut 2.0 may cement that trend – at least in the G3 space.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar began the week on a firm note on Monday as economic data pointed to strength right across the U.S. economy, reducing the likelihood of interest rate cuts.
The greenback held steady near a one-week high against the euro (EUR=), at $1.1096, and just below an eight-month peak on the Japanese yen, at 110.19 yen per dollar .
""People are just searching out good news across the world,"" said Chris Weston, Head of Research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""An emerging theme driving FX in 2020, in the absence of central bank divergence, I think, is economic divergence and relative economic trends,"" he added.
Figures on Friday showed U.S. homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December, with retail sales also on the rise and a gauge of manufacturing activity rebounding to its highest in eight months.
Futures pricing suggests nobody thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates when it meets at the end of the month.
The strength comes as European economic data points in the opposite direction. The German economy last week posted its weakest growth since 2013, while British inflation is anaemic and retail sales are sliding.
The pound edged lower on Monday to $1.3002, its weakest in a week. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was steady at 97.620, a whisker below a three-week high hit on Friday (DXY).
Trade was tepid leading in to a U.S. holiday on Monday.
China, meanwhile, on Friday posted its slowest annual growth figure in almost 30 years, although December data showed revived business confidence and quickening factory output.
China's financial markets are evenly divided over whether the benchmark lending rate will be lowered or kept steady in response, when it is set at 0930 GMT on Monday.
The yuan held flat at 6.8643 per dollar in offshore trade , not far below a six-month high it reached last week.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars crept up slightly, although gains were capped as investors look to Australian jobs data due on Thursday for a crucial clue to the next move for Australian interest rates.
The Aussie last traded 0.1% firmer at $0.6880, while the kiwi rose by the same margin to $0.6615.
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets next month with widespread bushfires, and their depressing effect on already weak consumer sentiment, adding to the case for further stimulus following three rate cuts last year.
Futures are pricing a 46% chance of a rate cut when the RBA meets on Feb. 4, but that will likely shift higher if Thursday's read on unemployment puts it higher than market expectations of 5.2%.
""A 'high' unemployment rate above 5% will reinforce the view that further stimulus is required,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts wrote in a note. ""We expect the RBA will deliver more policy stimulus with a 25bp rate cut."""
510,"<span>Jan 18, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SANAA/ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen's warring sides opened a new front in their five-year conflict on Saturday - a battle over old and new banknotes that threatens to create two economies in the same state.
As of midnight, the Houthi movement which controls the capital Sanaa outlawed the use and possession of crisp new Yemeni riyal bills issued by its rivals in the internationally recognized government based in the southern port town of Aden.
The Iran-allied Houthis, who say people should only use the old bills, have defended the ban as a move against inflation and what they call rampant money-printing by the government. 
The government has branded the ban an act of economic vandalism. And the population, as ever, have been left stuck in the crossfire. 
Yemenis from both sides told Reuters the ban had effectively created two currencies with diverging values, adding to the turmoil in a state already governed by two powers and brought to its knees by the war. 
In the one-month build up to the ban, people in Houthi-controlled areas have been queuing to try to exchange their new riyal notes for old, turning the grubby and torn bills into a prized and relatively scarce commodity. 
The riyal stood at about 560 to the dollar across Yemen before the ban was announced in mid-December. The rate has since slipped a little in Houthi-controlled areas to around 582, but slumped much further to 642 in the south, an area now awash with new bills.
That relative strength might look like a boon for northerners, if only they could get hold of enough of the old notes in time to keep afloat in the largely cash-based economy.
""We go for the exchange and they won't take [the new notes] from us. Or say they need three, four or five days,"" craftsman Abdullah Saleh al-Dahmasi told Reuters on a Sanaa street a week before the ban came into force. 
""The new one isn't accepted and the old one is worn out, they have to find a solution,"" the 27-year-old said.
A few days before the ban came in, around 20 angry men and women were turned away from one exchange which said it had filled its quota for the day. Many had been coming there for three days in the hope of swapping their cash.
North-south trade has become far more expensive as traders have to buy and sell two types of riyal - told apart by the state of the paper and the different sizes and designs. 
TWO CENTRAL BANKS 
Many people in Sanaa told Reuters they felt the ban was needed to constrain inflation. But they were facing difficulties in the short-term.
""When people saw that new currency come into circulation, they held onto it as it was new and shiny. But now it's a problem that they have it,"" said 28-year-old Abdallah Bashiri, a private sector worker in Sanaa. 
In that city, legal exchanges will swap 100,000 Yemeni riyals (around $172) in new notes for electronic currency that can be spent on things like phone credit or electricity bills, for a small fee of around $1.50. 
But things get more challenging when it comes to actual paper that can be spent in food markets. Sanaa residents said unofficial exchanges are offering to change 100,000 riyals of new notes into 90-96,000 riyals of the scarcer old.
After the Houthis stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014 and ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, Yemen's central bank split into two branches - one in Sanaa, under Houthi control, and one internationally recognized branch in Aden, which has access to money printers.
The Aden authorities have defended their decision to step up the printing of new money from 2017, saying it was an attempt to deal with a building cash crunch and pay public sector salaries.
""The Houthis ... did not consider the economic cost to society,"" Yousef Saeed Ahmad, adviser to the governor of Aden's central bank, told Reuters there this week. 
""We hope the measures taken are short-term. They cannot be kept up because the economy is one, it is interrelated and commodities flow from Sanaa to Aden and vice versa. This measure will aggregate the living conditions of all Yemenis,"" he said.
The crackdown on new banknotes means many public sector workers in Houthi areas have stopped receiving salaries from the Aden government. The resumption of these salary payments across conflict lines had been a key bipartisan step to alleviate Yemen's humanitarian crisis.
The Houthis have defended their ban as a way of defending the value of the currency. 
""The Sanaa central bank had to take measures to stem the dangerous practices the Aden central bank was carrying out through their monetary policy,"" said Sami al-Siyaghi, in charge of foreign banking operations at the Sanaa central bank.

""The imposition of [Aden's] monetary stance on us led to the collapse of the national currency against foreign currency ... With each new issuance you notice a commensurate collapse in the riyal against foreign currency,"" Siyashi told Reuters.

(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to get the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox every weekday.
What’s Happening? The U.K. economy’s post-election economic optimism is quickly disappearing.
Boris Johnson’s decisive election win before Christmas was supposed to provide a much-needed fillip for the U.K.’s sluggish growth rate, lifting near-term Brexit uncertainty and finally allowing companies to plan for the future.
Still, signs of a “Boris bounce” aren’t too strong. While some private surveys have shown signs of a pick up in sentiment, this week has seen a string of disappointing data, including evidence that the economy was unexpectedly contracting before the vote. Inflation and retail sales reports for December, which included the period immediately after the election, came in well below expectations, suggesting U.K. consumers may be losing some of their resilience.
That’s taken a chunk out of the pound, which has fallen more than 1.7% against the dollar this year. Combined with dovish noises from Bank of England policy makers, traders now put the chances of an interest-rate cut later this month at more than 70% — levels which indicate near-certainty for some in the market.
Analysts don’t see pressure on the pound ebbing any time soon:  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said today that a rate cut could be followed by a new cycle of quantitative easing. More data is due next week, with the forward-looking Purchasing Managers Index likely to influence whether the BOE takes action
“If you look at the fundamental driver behind U.K. economic weakness, it has been Brexit. And the reality is Brexit uncertainty is not going to go away,” George Saravelos, the bank’s global head of currency research, told Bloomberg TV.

Reassurance | EU citizens who have not secured “settled status” by the deadline of June 2021 will not automatically be deported from the U.K., Downing Street confirmed.
Big Bong Update | The Brexiteer campaign to raise funds for Big Ben to bong on Jan. 31 continues apace, with more than £222,000 ($289,000) now pledged. Lawmaker Mark Francois, who is leading the bong bid, told the BBC that Brexit-backing businessman Arron Banks has pledged £50,000.
Preparation Costs | The U.K. has already committed to spend £6.3 billion on preparations for Brexit, the Institute for Government notes in a briefing paper on government readiness. That’s roughly the equivalent of a railway extension project or two new aircraft carriers, the IfG says. Another £2 billion is set aside for 2020-2021.

Invesing.com – The dollar advanced Friday as bullish housing data offset weaker labor data, adding to growing expectations that the U.S. economy will continue to expand.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.30% to 97.61.
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 16.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.61 million units in December, well above economists' estimates for 1.38 million and the biggest gain in 13 years.
The strong uptick in housing starts will lift forecasts for fourth-quarter residential investment, but is unlikely to be sustained, increasing the chances of a hefty correction in January is a good bet, Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The report also highlighted a 3.9% decline in building permits to a rate of 1.42 million units, short of estimates for 1.47 million.
The U.S. Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in November were 6.8 million, well below expectations for 7.23 million.
Sentiment on the economy was also supported by ongoing signs that the consumer remains in good shape.
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for January edged down to 99.1 from a seven-month high of 99.3 in December, data showed Friday.
GBP/USD fell 0.45% to $1.301 as disappointing retail sales data raised expectations that the Bank of England will cut rates at its next meeting.
EUR/USD fell 0.40% to $1.11 as bearish sentiment on the single currency continued ahead of the European Central Bank meeting next week.
USD/JPY was flat at Y110.14 as demand for safe-haven yen continued to fall amid a rally in equities.

Options traders see a low risk so far for a breakout from the pair’s month-long range and volatility remains suppressed, keeping hedging costs low for those taking no chances. Attention will be on Thursday’s outline of the ECB’s strategic review, particularly its implications for shifting the outlook among policy makers. That will be followed by the U.K. Purchasing Managers Indexes for January on Friday.
While the ECB is just expected to monitor the impact of its policy so far, money market traders have started to assign a higher probability for a BOE cut, with current pricing at around 75% for a move at its Jan. 30 meeting. A combination of dovish comments from officials and soft U.K. data has weighed on the pound recently, yet the euro has been unable to significantly benefit, with rallies versus the dollar met this week by profit-taking interest.
The euro reversed early losses versus sterling on Friday and stood at 85.21 pence per euro after data showed that U.K. retail sales unexpectedly fell in December.

514,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks may be grabbing most of the headlines, but equities aren’t the only asset class in uncharted territory.
Global currency volatility has dropped to the lowest level ever recorded. Less than 48 hours after the U.S. and China put pen to paper on a trade deal that reaffirmed an agreement not to devalue their currencies, the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Global FX Volatility Index -- which tracks the options market to measure expected price swings -- is trading lower than at any point since it was created almost three decades ago.
The milestone is a culmination of a multi-year trend toward calmer currency markets, one which accelerated last year as central banks shifted to easier monetary policies in a bid to shore up growth. It’s also a phenomenon on display across major asset classes, where the resultant abundant liquidity has stoked valuations and suppressed price swings.
“The signing of the phase one trade deal has led investors to assume that a negative threat to global growth has been removed,” said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank. The risk of such unprecedented low volatility “is that investors start to behave as if high-risk assets such as stocks can never go down. This would be classic bubble behavior,” she said.
The impact of the trade-deal signing on currency markets is clearly on show in the implied volatility of the dollar-yuan currency pair: In the offshore market it’s near the lowest since China’s surprise devaluation in 2015. The day of the signing also saw the JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index close at its record low.
Currency calm can be a good sign for many market players and economy watchers -- foreign-exchange turmoil often coincides with stress between nations, unstable monetary trajectories or diverging growth. But there is such a thing as too much calm, according to Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency strategy at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG).
“FX markets have to produce at least so much volatility that shifts in fundamentals can be properly reflected,” he said. “My gut feeling is we are at the lower end of what’s possible before the FX market loses its ability to reflect fundamentals.”"

The pound slipped after U.K. retail sales data unexpectedly fell in December, increasing the chances that the Bank of England may cut a key interest rate this month.
Sterling dropped 0.2% to $1.3049 and declined against all its Group-of-10 peers as the volume of goods sold in stores and online fell 0.6% in December, confounding expectations of a 0.6% increase. Money markets are pricing a 75% chance of a rate cut on Jan. 30, compared with 62% on Thursday.
Markets are now turning their attention to impending purchasing managers’ indexes for further signs of the BOE’s direction.
“Clearly, there is a chance for a decent rebound of the PMIs next week and this may stay the BOE’s hand,” said Valentin Marinov, a strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. “That said, following this week’s weaker CPI and retail sales, the bar for stable rates is getting very high.”
Traders had been speculating that the central bank will cut rates at Mark Carney’s last monetary policy decision as BOE governor after a flurry of dovish comments from policy makers. The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds was down three basis points at 0.61%, falling a sixth day and on course for its longest streak since August."

At 03:25 ET (0825 GMT), the USD/CNY pair traded at 6.8598, down 0.3%, while the US Dollar Index Futures, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was essentially flat at 97.06. 
The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate for the yuan at 6.8878 Friday, compared with 6.8807 Thursday. 
Earlier Friday, China reported that its gross domestic product grew 6% in the fourth quarter, meaning economic growth slowed to 6.1% in 2019. While this is in line with expectations, it’s also the country’s weakest growth in nearly three decades. Traders zeroed in on the monthly data for industrial production, which grew at the fastest rate since April in December, while retail sales growth stayed at 8% and fixed asset investment ticked up from a multi-year low. All those indicators point to a bottoming out of the world's second-largest economy.
That said, there had been fears that the U.S.-China trade war could result in the annual GDP figure losing its 6% handle. Additionally, the country’s industrial production rose 6.9% in December, well above economists’ estimates of 5.9% and the fastest gain since April 2019. And annual retail sales growth stayed at 8.0%, more than expected. 
These figures added to the tailwinds which have been boosting the currency of late.
It was only Wednesday that the signing phase one trade agreement between the U.S. and China drew a line under 18 months of tit-for-tat tariff hikes that hurt global, and domestic growth.
And prior to that, the U.S. removed China from a list of trading partners it considers currency manipulators. The U.S. Treasury Department said it had lifted the label after Beijing made “enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation and not target its exchange rate for competitive purposes.” 
The U.S. had announced the manipulator label in August, after the yuan slid above 7 to the dollar for the first time in more than a decade.
Whether this strong tone can continue for any length of time is uncertain. 
MUFG Bank thinks trade tensions will return and the yuan will end 2020 as one of emerging Asia's worst-performing currencies.
“People are very bullish and they’re not really seeing any clouds in the sky for the yuan. They are kind of acting as if Trump is going to be a very different creature when it comes to trade this year,” Bloomberg quoted analysts at the bank as saying. 
“The crusty cake of protectionism that sort of enveloped the global economy is still going to be there.”
In Europe, meanwhile, the pound rebounded after a string of losses to trade up 0.2% at $1.3094, while the euro was flat at $1.1136."

The US Dollar Index Futures that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was slightly lower, down 0.02% to 97.30 by 8:30 PM ET (01:30 GMT). The index has remained strong after falling at the beginning of the year. 
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the reference rate for the yuan at 6.8878 on Friday, compared to 6.8807 on Thursday. The USD/CNY pair was essentially flat, down 0.01% to 6.8759 on Friday morning. 
China’s economy grew 6.1% through 2019, the lowest rate of growth since 1990, according to numbers released by the National Bureau of Statistics Friday morning. The growth rate is lower than market expectations of 6.2% but within the 6% to 6.5% the central government set in early 2019. 
Growth in the fourth quarter was 6%, unchanged from the previous quarter. 
The Friday data follows the release of monthly export and import numbers earlier in the week that showed exports rising in December for the first time in five months and import growth beating estimates. Exports from China rose 7.6% year on year in December while imports jumped 16.3%, the largest monthly jump in more than a year.

518,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yen’s drop is becoming a problem for Japan’s life insurers, some of the biggest investors in global bond markets.
The currency’s 1.4% slide against the dollar this year puts it at the weaker end of the range expected by some of Japan’s major insurers. The companies have tended to curb overseas investments when the yen weakens, and there are signs that’s happening again.
The investment strategies of Japan’s insurers are constantly under scrutiny given the clout they hold with about 380 trillion yen ($3.5 trillion) worth of assets. Negative bond yields at home have put them under increasing pressure in recent years, while rate-cuts globally have also depressed returns and spurred them into riskier assets.
“Japanese investors are unlikely to shift their money significantly into overseas assets with the dollar-yen around 110,” said Masahiko Loo, a fixed-income portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein Japan Ltd. “They will stay sidelined, given that U.S. 10-year yields at current levels aren’t particularly attractive.”
The warning signs are getting louder. The insurers dumped 350.7 billion yen of overseas bonds and stocks in December, the most since 2015, as the yen slipped to a six-month low against the dollar.
Japan’s currency reached 110.21 on Tuesday.
The latest forecasts from six of Japan’s largest life insurers showed they expect the yen to trade between 95 and 115 per dollar in the six months ending March 31. Some, including Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. and Taiju Life Insurance Co., saw 110 as the bottom.
Investments “appreciably slowed” toward the end of 2019, particularly in bonds, Mazen Issa, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at TD Securities in New York, wrote in a research report this week. Portfolio outflows will be muted going into the end of the fiscal year after Japanese investors extensively reallocated their assets.
Still, not everyone thinks Japanese demand for overseas assets is set to wane. Some market watchers say currency volatility near multi-year lows would encourage investors to seek carry returns from Treasuries.
Japanese funds will get a yield premium of about 1.8% from 10-year Treasuries versus comparable domestic debt, if they forgo currency hedges. While that saves on insurance costs, it leaves them exposed to sudden fluctuations in the yen.
“There isn’t much downside risk seen for dollar-yen,” said Shinji Kunibe, general manager of the global strategies investment department at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co. “If volatility remains subdued, Japanese investors may remove currency hedges to enjoy as much carry income as possible from U.S. bonds.”"

The European Union’s new trade chief pulled no punches on an inaugural visit to Washington, saying President Donald Trump’s tariff threats amount to short-sighted electioneering and warning him about widespread economic damage from protectionism.
Phil Hogan said Trump’s “America First” agenda has helped bring about “a high-pressure crisis moment for the international trading system.” He urged the U.S. government to work with the EU to uphold open commerce.
“If we go about this in the right way, working together, the mutual benefits can be very significant,” Hogan told a conference in the U.S. capital on Thursday. “But, if we fail to do so, the damage will be significant, not alone for us both, but for the world.”
Hogan is seeking to prevent a deterioration in transatlantic commercial ties that have been fraying for months as a result of disagreements over everything from aircraft subsidies to farm tariffs. He spoke bluntly about growing EU unhappiness over U.S. unilateralism, saying it was driven by Trump’s desire for re-election.
‘Managed Trade’
“It’s short-term thinking,” Hogan said in a separate video interview with Global Counsel Chairman Peter Mandelson, a former EU trade commissioner. “Between now and the November elections is what Mr. Trump is thinking about.”
Hogan took a swipe at a preliminary trade agreement reached between the U.S. and China, saying the deal smacked of “managed trade” and threatening an EU complaint to the World Trade Organization. The pact was signed with much fanfare in Washington on Wednesday, two days after Hogan arrived in the city.
The EU is concerned about a Chinese pledge in the accord to increase purchases of U.S. goods and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years.
“We haven’t analyzed the document in detail, but we will, and if there’s a WTO-compliance issue of course we will take the case,” Hogan told the Washington conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “We’re not trigger-happy about taking cases to the WTO -- we don’t want to create that impression. But we’ll stand up for our own economic interests.”
Hogan said Trump is misguidedly “obsessed” with a U.S. deficit in goods trade with the bloc and should also take into account services, where the country has a $60 billion surplus. Altogether, transatlantic trade in goods and services is worth over $3 billion a day, according to Hogan.
“Sounds like a fairly healthy relationship to me,” he said. “So why put tariffs on these EU products to make them more expensive for your people?”
‘Let’s Talk’
Hogan sharply criticized the Trump administration’s invocation of national security to apply duties in 2018 on EU steel and aluminum, and threaten similar levies on European cars and auto parts. The metal duties prompted tit-for-tat EU tariffs, and the bloc has pledged to react the same way were European automotive goods to be targeted.
“We reject the U.S. labeling the EU as a security risk in order to justify the imposition on tariffs,” Hogan said. “This narrative is hurtful to both our people.”
The two sides are locked in arguments on other points too, including:
A U.S. threat to hit $2.4 billion of French goods with tariffs as retaliation over a digital tax in FranceA deadlock on the WTO’s appellate body caused by a U.S. refusal to consider new panelistsU.S. tariffs on a range of European products following a WTO ruling about illegal aid to AirbusAmerican demands to add agriculture to the agenda of talks that are due to address charges on industrial goodsHogan, who has met U.S. government officials as well as member of Congress this week, pleaded for a more diplomatic and collaborative approach from the Trump administration.
“If we continue to beat each other up then the future risks being lost to new competitors,” Hogan said. “Let’s talk, let’s cooperate, let’s lead.”"

Invesing.com – The dollar edged higher Thursday as better-than-expected U.S. retail sales suggested the consumer will continue to keep the economy on solid footing.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.10% 97.33.
The Commerce Department said that core retail sales rose 0.7% last month, topping economists’ forecast for a 0.5% rise. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – rose 0.5%, above expectations for a 0.4% rise. 
Some have warned, however, that the economy will need to be proped up by other sectors.
""The consumer, the cornerstone of the economy, while proving more resilient than originally expected will likely prove incapable of alone supporting the economy – at least indefinitely – without assistance from other key areas such as business investment and manufacturing,"" Stifel said.
As well as firmer retail sales, lower-than-expected jobless claims and stronger manufacturing data supported sentiment on the greenback.
Elsewhere, sterling found its footing against the dollar, staying above the $1.30 handle. The pound wobbled earlier this week as weaker U.K. economic data strengthened calls for a Bank of England rate hike.

That signing of the much-anticipated phase one trade agreement between the U.S. and China should draw a line under 18 months of tit-for-tat tariff hikes that have hurt global growth.
The signing should result in a calmer market in 2020 from at least one point of view, although underlying tensions between the U.S. on the hand and Europe and China on the other still remain.
“The U.S.-China deal implies that the amount of uncertainty related to trade war declines significantly in the short-term,” according to a research note from Tuuli Koivu at Nordea. “We assume that after having achieved the phase one trade deal with China, Trump will not take huge risks when running for president at the November elections.”
Looking elsewhere, the South African central bank holds its latest rate setting meeting at 8:00 AM ET (13:00 GMT). The bank is widely expected to hold its key repo rate unchanged at 6.5%. That said, the last meeting in November showed a split between the members, with three of the five members voting to hold, while two favored a cut.
Turkey’s central bank also meets Thursday to decide on interest rates, having slashed borrowing costs in half from 24 percent in July. Thirteen of 21 economists surveyed by Reuters predicted another rate cut, with six expecting the bank to lower interest rates by 100 basis points to 11 percent. Some analysts argue that that would leave Turkish real interest rates too low, given that inflation has rebounded to nearly 12% in the last couple of months.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was largely unchanged on Thursday in Asia following the conclusion of much-awaited Sino-U.S. one trade deal. 
 
The U.S. and China completed the signing of the partial trade agreement at the White House overnight, putting the trade war between the two sides on a pause. 
 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said further phase two talks had already begun as negotiators work to resolve differences.
 
Under the terms of the first deal, the U.S. reduced tariffs on $120 billion in Chinese goods to 7.5% from 15%. In exchange, China agreed to increase purchases in the U.S. by $200 billion over the next two years in manufactured goods, agriculture, energy and services.
 
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was largely unmoved following the news, as the deal was already largely priced into the markets.

The Labor Department said its producer price index, which measures prices that businesses receive for their goods and services, slowed to a pace of 0.1%, below economists' forecasts for 0.2% rise. In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 1.3%, in line with forecasts of 1.2%.
 
Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair inched up 0.1% to 1.3047, lifted by comments from Prime Minister Boris Johnson who said late Tuesday that he considers “very likely” the U.K. will get a “comprehensive trade deal with the EU by year-end.”

The United States will also cut by half the tariff rate it imposed on Sept. 1 on a $120 billion list of Chinese goods, to 7.5%.
Yet it addresses few of the issues that led to the trade conflict in the first place, checking potentially more dramatic market moves.
The safe-haven Swiss franc's overnight rally to a 15-month high of 0.9680 per dollar - close to where it held in early Asian trade - points to the level of caution.
The agreement does not fully eliminate tariffs. It is vague on enforcement. It makes no real progress on host of thorny problems from intellectual and many analysts are skeptical that the purchase targets are realistic.
""I'm not sure that there's any hidden gold nugget,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow.
""There's a sense of markets having traded off the positive vibes of the trade agreement for long enough, and it's very hard to see where the upside is from here,"" he said.

Sterling fell against all its peers and 10-year government bond yields dropped to the lowest in more than a month as the data fueled bets that the central bank will lower interest rates this year. Money markets are now fully pricing in a full 25-basis-point rate cut for June, compared to November a day ago, and see a 62% chance of a move this month.
Saunders’ view on the need for more accommodative policy comes just days after BOE Governor Mark Carney said Britain’s economic growth had slowed below potential and that the Monetary Policy Committee had discussed the merits of near-term stimulus.
“There is more room for easing expectations to rise should incoming data disappoint and that could keep short-term sterling downside risks intact,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) AG.

The Swiss franc reached its highest level since April 2017 against the euro on Tuesday after Washington added Switzerland back to its currency watch list and urged the country to adjust its macroeconomic policies. Yet strategists say Switzerland’s growth and inflation data could make the case for the SNB to continue buying foreign currency in an effort to curtail the franc’s appreciation.
“We know from the SNB’s intervention activity that the franc is already at critical levels, i.e. at levels at which it has intervened before last year,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, a strategist at Commerzbank. “There is a high likelihood that it will step into the market, or is already active.”
SNB data in August suggested the bank had pumped billions of francs into markets, buying foreign currency in an effort to curb the franc’s strength. The SNB said Tuesday that its interventions were designed only to offset the ill effects of too strong a currency. The interventions, which aren’t aimed at giving the nation a competitive advantage, are disclosed in an annual report, the SNB said in a statement.
Five years since the SNB jolted markets by scrapping a cap on the franc and introducing negative interest rates, the currency’s strength means there’s little chance it will be able to end the policy any time soon. The other countries on the Treasury’s monitoring list are China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. It removed the tag of currency manipulator from China.
The U.S. decision on Monday “encouraged market participants to test the SNB’s appetite to keep intervening to dampen Swiss franc strength,” said Lee Hardman, a strategist at MUFG Bank in London. “We still think the SNB will continue to intervene after the U.S. Treasury announcement, but it has created some additional uncertainty in the near-term which the market is testing now.”

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.01% 97.34.

The sluggish pace of consumer price pressures has continued despite the lengthy U.S.-China trade war, with overall prices held back by declines in cars and household utilities, and only modest gains in housing, BMO said.
Given that some of the other inflationary indicators - particularly the core PCE – have remained sluggish somewhat, it will ""take a more consistent, broad move upward to spark more interest from the Fed,"" the bank added.
Citing expectations for subdued inflation to continue, Kansas Federal Reserve president Esther George suggested would be appropriate for the Fed to keep rates on hold.

533,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 11:33AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s currency is on the march, and it’s powering bets across every corner of global markets.
From the euro and copper to bunds and luxury stocks, traders are adjusting to the strongest yuan in more than five months after the U.S. lifted the label of currency manipulator from the Asian nation. The two countries are due to sign the first part of a trade accord on Wednesday, another step in the thawing of tensions.
The upshot is a brighter outlook for global growth that’s feeding first and foremost into the currencies of both nations while firing up bets on looser international financial conditions.
As the yuan blasts through key levels, the dollar is now the most oversold against it in two years. The yuan -- up about 4% against the greenback since August -- has gained far less versus a basket of currencies, making this just as much a story of dollar weakness.
“The U.S.’s well-considered decision to refrain from accusing China of being a currency manipulator is an encouraging basis for further negotiations,” Marc-André Fongern, head of research at MAF Global Forex, wrote in a note. “The resulting appreciation of the Chinese yuan can be expected to breathe life back into the FX world.”

Here’s a look at how yuan strength may affect major assets.
Stocks
Yuan appreciation is being felt most acutely across Hong Kong with markets with the city state tied to global risk-on sentiment and Chinese growth. Shares have gained 11% since a low on Dec. 4, adding $579 billion to market values through Monday and pushing the index back to the level it was trading at last year before political protests escalated.
Similarly, yuan strength is also potentially good news for European exporters like luxury goods manufacturers. While they’re able to cope with a weaker Chinese currency, they usually benefit from periods when the yuan is rising.
The MSCI Europe Apparel and Luxury Goods Index has gained 3% this year compared with an increase of about 0.8% for the MSCI Europe Index.
Commodities
China is the world’s biggest buyer of copper and gold, so commodity traders could tell their European stock counterparts plenty of stories about market dynamics in the Asian nation. A stronger yuan typically makes both assets cheaper for local consumption.
For the industrial metal, the rising yuan may therefore provide an additional boost to an already tight market. Copper has climbed 14% above September lows, when the trade-war rhetoric still looked fierce.
Sino dynamics remain key to the direction of gold from here. Chinese New Year -- the peak buying season for the yellow metal -- combined with yuan strength may buttress gold as demand for havens ebb.
Rates
Speaking of consumption, China absorbs around 7% of German exports -- including some from the kind of luxury companies whose shares are mentioned above. That means Europe’s biggest economy stands to gain if the buying power of the Asian nation increases. Throw in an improving global trade outlook, and there could be upward pressure on German bund yields, according to market participants.
That would come as rates are already creeping back toward positive territory for the first time in eight months amid a deluge of supply and increasing hopes that European growth may have bottomed.
Currencies
Implicit in the yuan strength is an improving outlook for the global economy, which can encourage capital flows out of the safety of U.S. dollars and spur greenback weakness.
Since a shock devaluation in August 2015, turning points for the Chinese currency have coincided with shifts in the dollar-euro pair as China influenced the global macro cycle.
But during the trade war the yuan’s correlation to the euro has been falling, and it’s now the most negative in around five years. A stronger yuan could therefore signal further weakness in the single currency -- hurting the Chinese economy’s competitiveness relative to Europe.
Still, while Chinese currency moves are focal point for Wall Street traders this week, there’s a key factor limiting the day-to-day impact of a stronger yuan for Western companies. The currency’s status as the preferred exchange rate for international transactions has been failing after devaluations in 2015 and 2019.
Those moves helped further erode the yuan’s already limited use as an international currency. By comparison, the euro has gained market share and accounted for a third of all transactions in November 2019."

""The State Bank of Vietnam will coordinate with relevant agencies to discuss and address the issue raised by the U.S. Treasury in a cooperative manner,"" it said in a statement.
Vietnam has been singled out by Washington given its trade surplus with the United States, a highly positive current account balance and a perception that its central bank has been quite active in terms of net foreign exchange purchases.
Vietnam's trade surplus with the United States, the southeast Asian country's biggest export market, widened to $46.98 billion last year from $34.87 billion in 2018.
The central bank also said it would continue to pursue a ""flexible monetary policy"" meant to contain inflation and maintain macro-stability."

LONDON (Reuters) - China's yuan climbed to its highest level since July on Tuesday and the Japanese yen plumbed eight-month lows as the U.S. Treasury Department reversed its decision in August to designate China as a currency manipulator.
The Treasury Department's new report on currency manipulators could help explain the reason for the Swiss franc surging to a 33-month high against the euro, some analysts said. [L8N29J36G] Washington included Switzerland on a watchlist, although other market participants said it had been expected and broader safe-haven flows were behind the franc's move.
The announcement on the yuan came as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He arrived in Washington ahead of Wednesday's signing with U.S. President Donald Trump of a preliminary trade agreement aimed at easing tensions between the two countries.
""Washington's decision to lift its designation of currency manipulator on China has added to the positive mood that has been already in place ahead of the signing of the trade deal,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency strategist at MUFG Bank.
People familiar with the negotiations said its removal was an important symbol of goodwill for Chinese officials.
China has also pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a Reuters source.
The dollar rose as much as 0.3% against the Japanese yen to 110.22 yen , its highest since late May versus a currency that tends to weaken when investors are buoyant. It last stood at 109.97 yen.
In onshore trade, the yuan strengthened to as high as 6.8731 per dollar , its strongest since late July. China's central bank set the midpoint of the yuan's daily trading band at 6.8954 per dollar on Tuesday, its strongest fixing since Aug. 1.
The offshore yuan also firmed to its strongest level in six months, hitting 6.8662 yuan before easing off .
Chinese forecast-beating trade data also helped to boost optimism about the economy and the yuan.
Despite the optimism, some analysts said there were signs of a bid for safety.
The Swiss franc rose to its strongest since April 2017 at 1.0763 against the euro (EURCHF=EBS), up nearly 0.5%. It rose 0.4% versus the dollar .
Some analysts said this reflected nervousness, as risky emerging market currencies such as the South African rand and Turkish lira fared poorly.
""The interesting question is how long can this optimism last, how much further can it go. A lot surely has to be in the price,"" said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank.
""If we were to get another rise in tensions between the U.S. and China and if we were to turn our attention to phase two (of the trade deal)... it's very likely that we will see the renminbi falling again,"" Rabobank's Foley said, adding that the currency might face a low at the 7.18 level hit in September.
In Europe, sterling weakened further on Tuesday, hitting a seven-week low against the euro at 85.95 pence before recovering. (EURGBP=D3)
The currency has come under pressure from weak data releases, raising the chances of a cut to interest rates by the Bank of England. Money markets forecast an almost 50% probability of a cut at a meeting on Jan. 30.
The euro was mildly supported by risk-on sentiment, remaining off a two-week low of $1.10855 (EUR=EBS) hit on Friday, last trading at $1.1124.
The dollar index gained 0.1% to 97.43 (DXY)."
536,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 06:42AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan is finding it’s hard to revert to normal monetary policy without risking an unwanted appreciation of the franc.
Five years since Jordan jolted markets by scrapping a cap on the franc and introducing negative interest rates, the currency’s strength means there’s little chance he’ll be able to end the controversial policy any time soon. At home, the subzero rates are frustrating banks, while the SNB’s interventions in currency markets have put Switzerland in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities.
The unexpected decision nicknamed the “Frankenshock” -- five years ago this week -- sent global financial markets into a tailspin. While at home Jordan was hailed for taking a brave step, the situation has since shifted. In addition to the financial industry, labor unions say the SNB’s -0.75% rate is blowing a hole in social funding.
“When you try and be very critical, you conclude -- what else could they have done?” said Gianluigi Mandruzzato, an economist at EFG Asset Management Switzerland. “After five years, we’re still there with a prospect of keeping rates at rock bottom for some years.”
Yet even with negative rates plus a pledge to intervene in currency markets, the franc is near the highest since 2017 versus the euro.
Data suggest the SNB stepped up interventions in the latter half of last year, prompting the U.S. Treasury to put Switzerland back on its currency watch list this week. The SNB declined to comment on the U.S. decision, while officials in Bern stressed that they in no way manipulated the franc to gain “an unjustified competitive advantage.”
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the SNB’s deposit rate to remain at a record low for the rest of this year.
The dam of Swiss public opinion would probably burst if the man or woman on the street saw their bank account hit with negative rates. So far that hasn’t happened, though banks are increasingly targeting the cash holdings of the rich.
As was the case five years ago, Switzerland’s fate is tied to that of the global economy. The franc cap was scrapped in anticipation of European Central Bank quantitative easing, and the absence of any meaningful reversal in the euro area’s fortunes leaves the SNB with no room to move.
Unilateral SNB tightening could add to upward pressure on the currency, which would depress prices, and hurt exporters and the economy.
The central bank said in early 2015 that the franc would depreciate over time, but hasn’t happened. In 2018, it briefly touched 1.20 francs per euro -- the level of the cap -- but has since appreciated.
“I fault the ECB,” said Thomas Matter, chairman of Helvetische Bank and member of parliament for the Swiss People’s Party, who proposed some SNB profits be used to top up the public old-age insurance. “The SNB cannot scrap the negative rates. That would generate huge appreciation pressure.”"
537,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 05:34AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England’s dovish shift in the past week has already rippled through markets, and now economists are starting to react too.
Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc changed its interest-rate forecast and now sees a cut to 0.5% from 0.75% at this month’s meeting. It also sees a second reduction later in the year, having previously predicted no move by the BOE at all until May.
RBS’s change of view may be followed by others after Governor Mark Carney and other policy makers said the BOE is looking at whether more stimulus is needed for the economy. Those comments have already sent the pound on its worst losing streak since May, and market bets on a rate cut on Jan. 30 have jumped to around 50%.
Economic data on Monday showed the U.K. economy unexpectedly shrank in November. The year-on-year rate of 0.6% was the weakest since mid-2012.
RBS said there’s been an “unmistakable underlying deterioration in the U.K. economic data.”
The pound fell 0.2% to $1.2967 as of 9.10 a.m. London time, heading for a sixth straight decline. U.K. government bonds rose, pushing 10-year yields down three basis points to 0.72%, the lowest since early December.
In his first major speech of 2020, Carney said the Monetary Policy Committee has plenty of firepower to aid the economy if necessary. Policy maker Silvana Tenreyro said she may support a rate cut in the next few months if sluggish global growth and Brexit uncertainty persist. Gertjan Vlieghe went further, saying he’d need to see an improvement to justify waiting to cut."

Bets the BOE will lower borrowing costs this month grew after data on Monday showed the economy shrank in November, casting doubt over whether there was any growth at all in the fourth quarter. That added fuel to a sell-off spurred by policy makers Gertjan Vlieghe, Mark Carney and Silvana Tenreyro, who signaled support for a cut.
The next rate setter due to speak publicly is Michael Saunders on Wednesday morning in Northern Ireland. Consumer price index data for December is also due Wednesday.
“A more dovish rhetoric from Saunders, as well as potential downside surprises from the U.K. CPI could add to the headwinds for the pound,” Credit Agricole strategists including Valentin Marinov said in a note. “Looking ahead, investors will also focus on the December retail sales data, looking for any evidence that political uncertainty has weighed on domestic demand.”
The pound fell to $1.2970 as of 8:29 a.m. in London, taking its retreat so far this year to 2.2%. It weakened by 0.2% to 85.86 pence per euro, setting course for its fourth day of declines. The yield on 10-year government bonds slipped a third day to 0.719%, the lowest level since Jan. 6."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank is still concerned about the strength of the baht and is ready to take further action if necessary, a deputy central bank governor said on Tuesday.
The baht's gains have been driven by the country's large current account surplus, and not speculation in the currency, Mathee Supapongse told a news briefing.
""We have a lot of weapons ready, but there is no speculation from foreign investors yet,"" he said, adding the central bank was monitoring the market closely.
As Asia's best performing currency in 2019, the baht rose nearly 9% against the dollar, putting more pressure on the export-dependent economy amid global trade tensions and markets are concerned the authorities will introduce capital controls, among other steps.
The baht traded at 30.24 per U.S. dollar at 0510 GMT.
Rising international reserves show the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has closely managed the baht by buying dollars, Mathee said. The reserves increased by $18 billion to $223 billion in 2019.
""If the BOT had not intervened, the reserves would not have risen and the baht may have been stronger than this,"" he said.
But the central bank is mindful of side-effects and limitations of currency intervention, as it may face trade protagonist measures from other countries, he said.
On Monday, the U.S. Treasury said Thailand was close to triggering thresholds to be added to its currency monitoring list.
Mathee also said quantitative easing was not suitable for Thailand due to very high liquidity and it would largely benefit certain business groups.
The central bank will further relax rules to spur outbound investment to help ease upward pressure on the baht, he said.
Last year, the BOT introduced steps against short-term speculative inflows and relaxed rules to spur fund outflows in a bid to curb the baht's strength.
In November, the central bank said within the next three months the limit exporters can keep proceeds abroad will be raised to $1 million per lading bill from $200,000 currently. Such proceeds account for about 80% of all exports.
While the baht's appreciation has affected the economy by hurting export competitiveness, it has benefited importers and companies and individuals with foreign debt, he added.
The central bank has forecast Southeast Asia's second-largest economy will expand 2.8% this year after growing by an estimated 2.5% in 2019, a five-year low.

Investing.com -- The dollar was little changed against other major currencies in early trading in Europe on Tuesday, while the pound continued to give ground amid growing expectations of an interest rate cut from the Bank of England at the end of the month.
By 3 AM ET (0800 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basked of developed market currencies, was up less than 0.1% at 97.095, consolidating gains of around 1% since the start of the year.
The euro was up 0.1% at $1.1147, while Sterling bounced slightly after testing but failing to break through Monday’s lows. It was down 0.1% at $1.2978, and at 1.1648 euros.
The Chinese yuan also ground higher after the U.S. removed it from its list of currency manipulators, an apparent goodwill gesture ahead of the signing of the two countries’ partial truce in trade relations on Wednesday. It rose as high as 6.8669 before retracing slightly.
""China has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and accountability,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
Politico reported that the so-called Phase-1 deal will include enforceable commitments from China to buy over $200 billion of U.S. goods across four sectors (energy, agriculture, manufactured goods and services) over a two-year period.
Earlier, Chinese trade data showed imports bouncing well above expectations in December, a data point that would normally support European assets. Exports also rose, more than expected, boosting hopes that the worst of its economic slowdown is now over.

541,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 12:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand’s central bank is ready to take additional steps to rein in the currency, Deputy Governor Mathee Supapongse said.
The Bank of Thailand and the government remain concerned about the baht’s appreciation and continue to discuss the issue, Mathee told reporters in Bangkok Tuesday. The bank’s foreign-exchange intervention has helped to boost reserves and curb the baht, he said.
The Bank of Thailand has taken several steps in recent months to limit gains in the baht after it surged almost 9% against the dollar in 2019, the best performer among Asian currencies. The strong currency has hurt the nation’s exports, prompting calls for further action from the government.
Mathee said it’s not the central bank’s job alone to manage the baht.
“The central bank is like the last door to defend the baht,” he said. “The first door is the private sector and the second door is the government. We all need to help out.”
If the central bank is left to solve the baht problem on its own, “they will need to use strong medicine to handle it,” said Mathee. “And it may not benefit much. If all parties help, they can use milder measures which will benefit all parties.”
He added the central bank will take action if it sees currency speculation. Separately, the bank published a foreign-exchange code of conduct on its website, outlining ethical and governance practices for market participants.
Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said last week the central bank will relax restrictions on capital outflows again, in an effort to ease upward pressure on the baht. Those steps includes boosting the amount of proceeds exporters can hold overseas to $1 million.
Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana said Monday any steps authorities take to curb gains in the currency won’t disrupt the “market mechanism” of the baht.
Some of the steps already taken by the central bank include:
Interest rates cut twice last year to match a record-low 1.25%In July, measures were imposed to counter short-term inflowsIn November, rules on capital outflows relaxedThe government also plans to issue measures to boost imports on capital goods and machinery for investment to help reduce pressure on the baht."

Just two days before the signing of the phase one trade deal, the Trump administration announced that it was removing China from its designation as a currency manipulator. However, China remained on a monitoring list for foreign-exchange practices. 
The administration praised China for making “enforceable commitments” not to devalue the yuan. The Chinese currency has now recouped about a third of the losses it sustained against the dollar since mid-June 2018.
“The yuan’s outperformance since last week has reflected the improving risk sentiment, thanks to signs of the economy bottoming out,” said Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking. “There’s some speculation that China may get a better trade deal than expected.”
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to seal the partial trade deal with the U.S. in Washington on Wednesday.

In yuan terms, 2019 exports rose 5% from a year ago while imports 1.6% in the same period.

544,"<span>Jan 13, 2020 12:23PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s administration plans to lift its designation of China as a currency manipulator, people familiar with the matter said, removing an obstacle to a trade deal the two nations are set to sign this week.
The Treasury Department will make the move in a semi-annual report, expected to be released soon, after being delayed as the U.S. and China finalize a “phase one” trade pact, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in August first formally labeled China a currency-manipulator, a move that further escalated the trade war with Beijing after the country’s central bank allowed the yuan to fall in retaliation to new U.S. tariffs.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment. A reporter for Fox Business Network earlier tweeted the news about Treasury’s plans.
Now that a deal is in sight, the designation is being lifted. The administration had at one point considered maintaining the label and instead announcing it would monitor the yuan with the possibility of lifting the designation in August of this year, according to the people.
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened to 6.883 per dollar on Monday.
Mnuchin’s August 2019 announcement prompted authorities in Beijing to increase transparency around how they manage the yuan. Some of that data has provided support for the Treasury’s view that the People’s Bank of China engages in competitive devaluations of its currency, the people said.
But economists have criticized the U.S. decision to call China a manipulator. The International Monetary Fund said in September the yuan is fairly valued and that there’s no evidence of manipulation. China’s weakening currency could also be attributed to a slowdown in growth.
China also doesn’t meet the criteria outlined in a 2015 U.S. law for formally designating a country a currency-manipulator. Mnuchin instead relied on a 1988 trade law that has a looser definition of currency manipulation to justify the claim. He did so after the yuan broke the 7 per dollar level for the first time since 2008, drawing Trump’s ire. Mnuchin had resisted using the label in the previous five reports he released.
The August announcement was made in a press release, outside the normal issuance of the report. That left currency strategists and policy experts without a full explanation for the decision. Treasury’s currency report examines 20 countries for possible currency manipulation, a number that was increased from 12 in May.
Trump was involved in drafting the press release, which on his direction refers to China as a “Currency Manipulator,” using capital letters, one of the people said.
When Treasury officials briefed congressional committees in August on their decision, they read quotes by Chinese leadership officials stating that they had all the necessary tools to prop up the yuan. According to the Treasury officials, those statements prove intent and serve as evidence that the country was manipulating its currency, two people familiar with the briefings said.
Mnuchin in October said that if a trade deal with China were signed, he would consider removing the manipulator tag, saying that signing an agreement would be “a big step in the right direction.”

However, that masked a 0.5% rise for the dollar against sterling, which continued to suffer from speculation on an interest rate cut from the Bank of England. The euro was up marginally at $1.1128.
Speeches by Governor Mark Carney and Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro last week had encouraged hopes of a cut. Over the weekend, another MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe, had signalled in an interview with the Financial Times that he would also back a rate cut barring “an imminent and significant improvement in the U.K. data.”

He sees a near-term range of $1.2900-$1.3200 for Cable.
The continued unrest in Iran over the weekend appears to have had little impact on broader sentiment, which is firmly in risk-on mode as the risk of war with the U.S. recedes and the signing of the preliminary trade agreement between China and the U.S. – scheduled for Wednesday – draws nearer.
The Chinese yuan broke through 6.90 to the dollar for the first time in five months overnight, while the Russian ruble rose to a 20-month high. The dollar also continued to lose ground against other barometers of risk appetite such as the Indonesian rupiah and Turkish lira.
Analysts at Nordea pointed to the incongruity of sharply rising emerging market currencies, given the consistently weak numbers coming out of global purchasing manager indexes.
“Either EM FX and equities are too expensive or else the global manufacturing PMI is about to explode higher.

JOHANNESBURG/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies will cede more ground against the dollar this year, reversing the brief rally at the end of 2019, Reuters polls of foreign exchange strategists found.
Last year was marred by the U.S.-China trade war, which forced investors to take refuge in safe havens and proved to be painful for emerging market assets.
Major emerging currencies staged a rally of sorts in the last quarter of 2019 on hopes of Washington and Beijing inching closer to less fractured trade relations, but the political tension between the U.S. and Iran has poured cold water on that already.
""As the economic cycle is nearing its endgame and markets continue to face elevated risks, more emerging market currency weakness lies ahead,"" noted currency strategists at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). ""We expect modest depreciation of 5% in spot EM FX.""
The dollar was predicted to reign supreme again after dominating currency markets over the previous two years, according to the latest Reuters polls. [EUR/POLL]
Sixteen of the 20 emerging market currencies polled Jan. 3-9 were forecast to weaken versus the dollar in 2020 after having taken a beating for the better part of the previous two years.
A majority - 35 of 62 - of currency strategists chose either developed market currencies to outperform the greenback or said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch.
The remaining 27 picked emerging market currencies, which shows lack of conviction among forecasters despite these assets looking attractively cheap.
""FX markets remain priced to more optimistic growth outcomes which is a risk. We take a cautious approach to 2020 trades given limited visibility around key political events and uncertainty surrounding global macro momentum,"" noted Meera Chandan, FX strategist at JP Morgan.
The World Bank in its latest report suggested the global economy was poised for a fragile recovery, beset with risks, which could weigh further on emerging markets.
Indeed, there was no respite predicted for either the battered Chinese yuan or the Indian rupee over the coming year. [CNY/POLL] [INR/POLL]
""The most important driver of China's currency is now economic slowing, which is increasing in scale and scope,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.
""Though stimulus is expected...we think the government will reap much less yang for the yuan - and more yin: Rolling over dud projects doesn't increase growth,"" he added.
The resilient South African rand was expected to sell off over 5% to hit 15 per dollar in six months and then keep steady.
With the government expected to set its budget next month for the next three financial years, the rand faces some more challenges as ratings agencies keep watch.
""Volatility will continue to remain a feature of the rand outlook in 2020, and we expect that the currency will give back some of its December outperformance as we head towards the February Budget - and a potential Moody's downgrade,"" noted strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
The highly volatile Turkish lira was forecast to shed almost 9% to 6.40/$ by end-December, a consistent expectation in previous surveys.
Latin America's currencies were forecast to tread carefully in the face of continuing political tensions in the region and worries over more protectionist talk in the U.S. presidential election campaign later in 2020. [BRL/POLL]
But last month, emerging market currency gains, already in full swing, were expected to be dominated this year by high-yielding currencies rather than low-risk bets as growth finally recovers in response to lower interest rates around the globe.
Low volatility was expected to be part of this year's theme that supports ""carry trades"" as investors did not expect another reduction in U.S. rates until at least the middle of 2020, delaying the likelihood of hikes capable of stoking a market frenzy."

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Friday and is on track for its biggest weekly gain in two weeks as dissipating geopolitical tension prompted investors to buy riskier currencies, while the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc gave up all their recent gains.
With the United States and Iran backing away from further confrontation, traders will focus on monthly U.S. jobs data, which will follow a batch of strong economic figures.
""The galvanising force for the dollar rally this week was the fizzling of tensions in the Middle East with the recent U.S. data also giving investors some further room for optimism,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, a senior analyst at ActivTrades.
Against a basket of its rivals (DXY), the dollar gained 0.1% on Friday to 97.53, taking its cumulative gains this week to 0.7%, its biggest weekly rise since early November.
Recent data have showed a pick-up in the U.S. services, falling joblessness claims and solid private hiring. Traders are focused now on December jobs data due at 1330 GMT. The consensus forecast is the United States added 164,000 jobs in December, after 266,000 were added in November.
The dollar's gains were particularly pronounced against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, against which it has rallied 1.7% and 1% respectively from this week's lows.
""Hopes of an interim trade deal between China and the U.S. as early as next week is also boosting the dollar,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar, which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years, looks set to do so again in 2020, according to the latest Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists.
While most of those who forecast spot FX rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year, when asked about the overall trend, few say the well-established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade.
Part of that stems from the recent flare-up in tensions between the United States and Iran, with investors piling into safe-haven assets such as the yen, which hit a three-month high on Wednesday. That has parallels with market behavior during bouts of worry about the U.S.-China trade war last year.
Despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year, the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies. It is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months.
About 60% of analysts in the Jan 6-9 Reuters poll who answered an additional question - 32 of 57 - said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year.
This time last year, over 60% of forecasters said the dollar's rally had already stalled.
""Your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another, and I think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless.
""We all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up.""
However, with U.S. economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out, the dollar could lose some of its shine.
""We're not telling investors to go out and buy euros. What we're telling investors is that the U.S. is converging back to Europe, there are tentative signs across the data set that Europe is stabilizing,"" said Jamie Fahy, global macro and asset allocation strategist at Citi.
""Broadly speaking, we're looking at the big picture theme of U.S. exceptionalism probably reversing.""
In a sign of dollar fatigue setting in, speculators have cut back their bets in favor of the greenback to the lowest in two months, according to the latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
But there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head-on.
Indeed, when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the U.S. dollar this year, there was a near split among the poll respondents.
Twenty-seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies, while 22 opted for developed ones. The 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch.
The euro, which has the potential to dent the dollar's strength, has fallen on hard times, losing nearly 7% over the past couple of years.
However, analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2% to trade around $1.13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4% higher at $1.15. It was last changing hands around $1.11 on Thursday.
But much will depend on how euro zone economies perform.
""If the U.S. has to cut rates because it's under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound,"" said Tim Riddell, macro strategist at Westpac.
Over two-thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year. The remaining ones chose safe-haven buying and/or political tensions.
That comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe-haven bets like dollar- and yen-denominated assets.
Broadly, the more liquid and volatile Japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3% by end-2020. The other popular safe-haven bet, the Swiss franc, was expected to rise by a touch less than 1% against the dollar in a year.
""Hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""Not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if China-U.S. relations sour again, but Iranian-U.S. tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - There will be no respite for the battered Chinese yuan over the coming year as U.S.-China trade relations are expected to remain rocky despite recent hopes for some resolution, a Reuters poll of FX strategists found.
After weakening nearly 1.3% against the dollar in 2019, the yuan has pared some of those losses in the first days of 2020. It rose to a five-month high on Thursday on optimism Washington and Beijing will sign a Phase 1 trade deal next week.
But a majority of strategists polled by Reuters expressed caution about the rising yuan and did not expect that trend to last without a broader, clearer and permanent deal that rolls back existing tariffs.
""I believe future trade deals will break down and there is no reason for recent optimism - this is just an illusion. In the long term, there is an absolute bearish renminbi,"" said Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank.
""Although China could swallow this deal that it doesn't like, keeping the yuan temporarily stable, it's unlikely that Beijing would want to see the yuan move higher, and especially not to please the U.S.""
According to the Jan 3-9 poll of over 60 strategists, the yuan was predicted to weaken about 1% to 7.0 per dollar in three months and hover around that rate in 12 months time. It was trading around 6.92 on Thursday.
Hopes of some sort of an agreement have increased on reports Beijing has agreed to Washington's demands.
But one potential impediment to progress is a demand that China buy more U.S. farm products. Chinese media group Caixin reported Beijing would not increase its annual low-tariff import quotas for corn, wheat and rice.
""High yuan volatility will continue even if there is a Phase 1 deal because the market will then start to question the likelihood of Phase 2 or 3 deals,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.
""The market is likely to remain skeptical on progress of the trade talks (until) after the U.S. presidential election. It seems likely that trade tensions will persist even if there is a new U.S. president, which is also uncertain.""
The trade war has not only weighed on most emerging-market assets, including the yuan, but the underlying economies also suffered in 2019 and were expected to slow further this year. Wall Street stocks, on the other hand, are trading near record highs.
To shore up the Chinese economy, the People's Bank of China last week said it would cut the amount of cash all banks must hold as reserves, likely exerting further pressure on the yuan.
""Even with the Phase 1 deal done, we expect Chinese economic growth to continue to slow,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.
""We believe that there will be quite strong onshore dollar demand to meet interest repayments that are due this year. This all will lead to some modest weakening in the yuan.""
Still, views on how the yuan will trade in the year-ahead were somewhat less pessimistic than previous polls.
Twenty-four of 49 common contributors from last month revised their forecasts to show a stronger yuan. Eleven downgraded their outlook. The rest left it unchanged.
That was in line with a separate Reuters poll on currency positioning, which showed bullish bets on the yuan scaled to a near 10-month high. [ASIA/FXP]

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound will gain more than 3% against the dollar this year, supported by interest rate differentials and hopes for a smooth departure from the European Union, a Reuters poll found on Friday.
Sterling has gyrated wildly on any snippet of news about Brexit, largely ignoring economic data, and soared more than 2% after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a resounding election victory in December, leading markets to believe an orderly exit from the EU was all but certain.
It has since dropped back and was trading around $1.30 on Thursday as Johnson has signaled he plans to take a hard line in talks with the EU, raising fears about the prospect of a new cliff edge at the end of the year if no deal is reached.
But the poll of nearly 60 foreign exchange strategists, taken this week, said the pound would be up at $1.32 at the end of this month - when Britain and the EU are due to part ways - and will have risen to $1.35 by the end of 2020.
""Knee-jerk moves and profit-taking aside, the trend in 2020 remains for a drift higher in GBP/USD in our view and we look to renew our GBP long bias,"" said Jordan Rochester at Nomura.
""The removal of near-term hard Brexit risks, the widely expected fiscal expansion, U.S.-China trade tensions lower and a global recovery in economic data suggest the Bank of England will stay on hold.""
Most major central banks eased monetary policy last year, including the U.S. Federal reserve, which cut interest rates three times in 2019, but the Bank of England has kept its key policy rate steady at 0.75%.
The Bank is not expected to move interest rates until 2022 at least, and while the European Central Bank eased policy late in 2019 it is expected to stay on the sidelines for the next two years.
So against the common currency the pound (EURGBP=) will have barely moved by the end of the year. On Thursday one euro would get you 85.16 pence and at the end of 2020 its value will be little changed at 84.5p, the poll found.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar, last year's top-performing G10 currency, will shift into a sideways trading pattern this year as the domestic economy softens and the recent boost from easing trade tensions fades, a Reuters poll showed.
The currency rallied 5% against the U.S. dollar in 2019, with about half that gain accumulated in the final few weeks of the year as signs emerged of recovery in the global economy and as the United States and China moved toward an interim trade deal.
Canada is a major exporter of oil and other commodities so its economy is more dependent on trade than some other countries, including the United States.
""Risks decreased significantly at the end of 2019, which helped the loonie and several other currencies. We do not expect another significant reduction in risks in 2020,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins. ""We prefer to bet on a fairly flat trajectory for the currency for the short term.""
The poll of over 40 currency analysts showed they expect the loonie to weaken 0.5% to 1.31 per U.S. dollar, or 76.34 U.S. cents, in three months, from 1.30 earlier on Thursday. It is then expected to strengthen to 1.30 in one year, matching the forecast in December's poll.
The projected loss of upside momentum for the loonie comes after recent data pointed to a slowdown in the domestic economy that could keep the door open to a Bank of Canada interest rate cut. Last year, the central bank left its benchmark rate on hold at 1.75% amid easing by some of its major peers, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
Data in recent weeks has showed Canada's economy shrank 0.1% in October and shed more than 70,000 jobs in November. The December employment report is due on Friday.
Some economists are projecting annualized growth of less than 1% for the fourth quarter. In October, the Bank of Canada projected fourth quarter growth of 1.3%.
""We believe that restrained exports and business investment will feed into the weaker growth dynamic and set the stage for a BoC rate cut in Q2 (the second quarter), most likely in April,"" said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
A Reuters poll in November showed four of the top five major Canadian banks expected the BoC to cut rates at least once by end-2020. Money markets see about a 50% chance of an ease over the same period.

Sterling fell versus all of its Group-of-10 peers as Carney said in a speech that the central bank was debating the merits of near-term stimulus, adding that a rebound from Brexit uncertainty wasn’t guaranteed and that U.K. economic growth was below potential. That led money markets to price in a higher chance of a BOE rate cut by the end of the year.
“The comments are a stark reminder that the U.K. and by implication the global economy are still quite fragile as they remain buffeted by geopolitical risks,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. “The pound could remain vulnerable in the run up to the next policy decision at the end of January.”
The pound fell as much as 0.6% to $1.3018, the lowest since Dec. 27. It also weakened as much as 0.6% to 85.28 pence per euro. The market now prices about a 60% chance of a BOE rate cut by December 2020, and a 15% chance of a move this month compared to just 6% a day ago.
The downbeat Carney comments strengthen the case for an interest-rate cut in the first half of 2020, and should lead to another leg higher in the euro-pound pair, according to Danske Bank A/S.
The pound’s drop is a turnaround after posting its best quarter in a decade in late 2019, when optimism the Conservatives would win a decisive election majority and break the Brexit deadlock turned into reality. The euphoria has since given way to fears the U.K. won’t be able to reach a trade pact with Brussels by the end of 2020."

LONDON (Reuters) - Safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen retreated on Thursday as the United States and Iran backed away from further conflict, with markets flipping back to a more risk-taking approach on hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal.
U.S. President Donald Trump responded overnight to an Iranian attack on U.S. forces with sanctions, not violence. Iran offered no immediate signal it would retaliate further to a Jan. 3 U.S. strike that killed one of its most senior military commanders.
The yen, seen as a safe haven in times of geopolitical turmoil because of its deep liquidity and Japan's current account surplus, quickly reversed its gains made after Wednesday's missile strike.
It was last down 0.2% at 109.36, a 1-1/2-week low .
""Markets are brushing aside fears of a major escalation in U.S./Iranian conflict,"" said Societe Generale's strategist Kit Juckes. ""The Japanese yen is the biggest FX loser.""
The dollar, also seen as a safe choice to park money in times of turmoil, fell against other major currencies.
The greenback was down 0.1% versus the euro as euro/dollar traded at $1.1115 (EUR=EBS) and by the same magnitude versus the pound, last trading at $1.3112 .
The euro was also rising against the Swiss franc, another safe-haven, by 0.2% to 1.0833 (EURCHF=EBS).
Traders' focus is expected to shift back to the global economy, with expectations that the United States and China will sign a trade deal next week providing underlying support for risk assets.
Investors think the deal will clear one of the world economy's biggest uncertainties and help boost global growth this year, although some think that view is too optimistic.
China's yuan rose to a five-month high of 6.9175 against the dollar overnight in the offshore market , boosted also by a steady inflation readout. 
Moreover, Chinese factory-gate prices fell at a slower pace in December, giving Beijing room to stay on course on monetary easing as economic growth cools. Some investors have worried that consumer inflation, hovering near eight-year highs, could make China's central bank more cautious about further stimulus.
""A trade deal, falling inflation ... combined with past and current PBOC easing should over the next few months help the Chinese economy,"" said Sebastien Galy, a Nordea strategist.
Traders will be watching the euro zone November unemployment rate, expected to stay at 7.5%, and U.S. jobless claims, which economists polled by Reuters expect to have inched down to 220,000 in the week to Jan. 4 from 222,000 in the comparable period.

The jobless claims should give an indication of how healthy the U.S. job market is ahead of the more closely watched non-farm payrolls data due out on Friday.

In response to the attacks from Iran, Trump said the U.S. ""will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime."" The sanctions would remain in force until Iran changes its behavior, he added.
The decision from the president to opt for sanctions rather than military response sent safe-haven assets down, while stocks and other risk assets recovered.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen slid from three-month highs against the dollar on Wednesday, as U.S.-Iran tensions eased after President Donald Trump signaled there would be no further military action, for now, with Tehran appearing to have pulled back from its threats. 
Another safe haven, the Swiss franc, also fell. It had earlier touched a more than one-week peak versus the greenback. Gold, which draws a bid in times of geopolitical stress, also gave up earlier gains, as did crude oil.
Trump backed away on Wednesday from days of angry rhetoric against Iran as the two countries tried to defuse a crisis over the American killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.
In an address from the White House, Trump said the United States did not necessarily have to respond militarily to Iranian missile attacks on military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq overnight.
Iran said it had fired missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq in retaliation for last Friday's U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani.
""It's a big sigh of relief for the markets,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. 
""The markets were concerned that there was the risk of an escalation. I would be very surprised though that this would be the absolute end of all of this, but the risk of a direct confrontation between the U.S. and Iran seems less of a risk,"" he added.
SAFE HAVENS
The yen, regarded as a safe haven in times of geopolitical turmoil because of its deep liquidity as well as Japan's current account surplus, dropped, pushing the dollar to a more than one-week high of 109.19 yen . The dollar earlier fell to a three-month low of 107.66 yen following Iran's strike, but was last up 0.8 at 109.18 yen.

The dollar also rose against the Swiss franc at 0.9737 franc , up 0.3%, after falling to a more than one-week trough earlier in the global session. 
A higher-than-expected U.S. private payrolls number for December also boosted the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.3% to 97.30 (DXY) in mid-afternoon trading.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls jumped by 202,000 jobs last month after an upwardly revised 124,000 gain in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls of 160,000 last month following a previously reported 67,000 rise in November.
""The market still has the ultimate ballast, or anchor, which is the U.S. economy,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ""Even though there's some variance month-to-month between the ADP and the non-farm payrolls report, the ADP is still a good indicator of the underlying trend.""

In response to the attacks from Iran, Trump said the U.S. ""will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime."" The sanctions would remain in force until Iran changes its behavior, he added.
Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc fell, boosting the greenback as the decision from Trump to impose sanctions rather than signal a military response suggested he is seeking to de-escalate tensions.

Helping the move to the more relaxed tone were reports that there were no American casualties from the missile attacks as well as tweets from Iran’s foreign minister who indicated that his country did not seek an escalation of the conflict and U.S. President Donald Trump who stated that “all is well.”
This bout of military action was prompted by the killing of a key Iranian military adviser Qassem Soleimani by a U.S. airstrike last week, and investors will now wait for the promised press conference from President Trump to gauge whether he sees the need for a response to the Iranian missile attacks, or whether he seeks to deescalate the heightened tension."

ANKARA (Reuters) - The Turkish lira was flat on Monday despite another jump in oil prices, and three traders said state banks were again selling dollars to support the currency through market turbulence after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander.
The lira was at 5.9735 against the dollar, little changed from Friday's close at 5.9740.
It weakened 11% last year, in part due to Turkey's military incursion in Syria and the threat of U.S. sanctions, bringing losses over the last two years to 36%.
""The state (banks) are in the market on the forex supply side today too, as they were on Friday,"" one trader said. ""It is difficult to say how many dollars are being sold but it's clear they will not allow an excessive loss in the lira's value.""
Since March of last year, traders have pointed to occasional state bank interventions to stabilize the lira.
The U.S. killing last week of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani fueled geopolitical tensions and brought more selling pressure on both the lira and on oil, sending crude prices up another 2% on Monday and hurting emerging-market currencies.
Turkey relies on imports for almost all of its energy consumption including oil.
State banks have not spoken publicly about the interventions, though Turkey's central bank has said they have been more active in markets this year conducting two-way transactions.
""We can say that there was support for the lira, particularly on Friday, in order to reduce the impact of geopolitical tension,"" said a senior banker.
""When we look at state banks' foreign exchange positions, we can see that in the last weeks of the year steps began to support the lira.""
The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond (TR10YT=RR), which has fallen from 21% in May, was steady at 12.4% on Monday.
The main BIST 100 share index (XU100), which fell 1.94% on Friday, was down 1.4% on Monday.
Investors are also weighing up the outlook for Turkish monetary policy after data on Friday showed annual inflation rose slightly more than expected to 11.84% in December, narrowing the window for more rate cuts in 2020.
Encouraged by the government to cut aggressively to lift the economy out of recession, the central bank slashed its key policy rate to 12% by December from 24% in July.
Bankers said the Treasury could make a eurobond issue this week but such an issue, often made early in the year, could be delayed for several weeks due to the lessened global appetite.
The Treasury will begin switch auctions this week, holding three such auctions on Tuesday. It will buy back fixed-coupon, floating-rate and CPI-indexed securities maturing in 2020 and issue bonds maturing in 2027.
Investors who met Turkish authorities in September told Reuters they expected the Treasury to start issuing longer-term bonds after the sharp cuts in interest rates.",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen and other safe-haven currencies were in demand on Monday, along with assets such as gold, as investors fretted that the killing of Iran's most prominent military commander by the United States could trigger a broader Middle East conflict.
The moves extended a flight to safety that began on Friday after Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned of a ""major retaliation"" if Iran hit back, while Iran's replacement commander vowed to expel the United States from the region.
On Sunday, Iran further distanced itself from the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, which the United States withdrew from in 2018, saying it would continue to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog but would respect no limits to its uranium enrichment work.

The Swiss franc, another safe currency, was trading flat too, though close to the four-month high of 1.0824 it reached against the euro on Friday (EURCHF=EBS).
The dollar was treading water versus six major currencies (DXY) and was slightly weaker against the euro, with euro/dollar last up 0.1% at $1.1167 (EUR=EBS).
Implied volatility gauges in the most traded currency pair, on the other hand, were relatively calm, suggesting investors are not yet fleeing to add protection to their portfolios by buying currency options.
Currencies sensitive to global risk appetite were weaker, including the Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar and Swedish crown.
""Iran is almost certainly to respond in some scale, scope and magnitude,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.
Therefore ""market participants are likely to remain nervous until there is more clarity over how geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran will proceed,"" Hardman said, noting that geopolitical tensions could hurt global economic growth, especially if the price of oil increases.
So far, however, oil-related currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Norwegian crown and Russian rouble have not yet strengthened even though Brent crude continued last week’s rise and topped $70 on Monday for the first time since September.

576,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 06:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Soon after he became president of the Philippines in 2016, Rodrigo Duterte ordered government officials “to refrain from changing and bending the rules of government contracts.”
Halfway through his six-year term, Duterte’s commitment is under question. In December, the firebrand leader ordered the renegotiation of long-agreed contracts for Manila Water Co. and Maynilad Water Services Inc. to supply the capital until 2037. He also said his government will not pay billions of pesos to Manila Water for delayed tariff increases as ordered by a court, while threatening to jail owners of both water providers.
Stock Rout Hits $2.4 Billion on Shock Manila Water Dispute (2)
The sudden review, triggered by what Duterte says are “onerous provisions” in the contracts, highlights the elevated regulatory risk in the Philippines compared to other major markets in the region, according to Fitch Solutions Inc.
Investors fear the water dispute could pave the way for the state to probe other agreements it deems “disadvantageous,” threatening the financial viability of companies involved, James Su, Fitch Solutions’ infrastructure analyst, wrote in a research note in December.
Muddy Waters
The water issue is the latest in a history of contractual disputes that have caused companies like Fraport AG and Suez SA to leave the Philippines. It also comes as the country, competing with its Southeast Asian neighbors for foreign investment, is seeking to lure companies to join an 8-trillion-peso ($157 billion) infrastructure program.
Foreign investors are “sensitive” to a country’s reputation in honoring contracts, said John Forbes, a senior adviser of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines. They are likely seeing greater risk in the Philippines as Duterte, like previous presidents, redefines what “onerous” deals are, he said.
Duterte’s economic managers have sought to dispel fears of uncertainty. “It is an isolated incident” and won’t go beyond the sector, Economic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said when asked whether other utilities could come under scrutiny next.
In a Dec. 30 speech where he threatened to sue owners of the water companies, Duterte also suggested that the franchise of a television network he accuses of bias may not be renewed. He urged its owners to sell before the franchise expires in March.
Image Boost
Duterte says some provisions in the water contracts prevent government from interfering in setting tariffs and provide generous performance guarantees for the companies. The sudden review of the deals, signed in 1997 and renewed in 2009, harks back to moves by past Philippine leaders who questioned agreements signed by their predecessors.
Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, the man tasked to lead the review of the water contracts, said public interest is the key consideration.
“These profit-oriented foreign investments, we couldn’t care less about them. What we want are foreign investments with a sense of corporate social responsibility,” he said when asked about the review’s possible impact on business confidence.
In December when Duterte repeatedly spoke against the water companies, foreign investors sold net $173 million of Philippine stocks, ten times more than a year ago. Manila Water, parent Ayala Corp., and Maynilad owners DMCI Holdings Inc. and Metro Pacific Investments Corp. have lost $1.7 billion in market value since early December when he said he wants new water contracts for the Philippine capital.
The president’s attack -- which comes on the heels of Manila’s most severe water shortage in a decade -- burnishes his populist image and his promise to go after oligarchs, said Ramon Casiple, who heads the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. Duterte has the highest popularity rating among top Philippine officials, with more than 80% of Filipinos trusting him, according to a Pulse Asia survey in December.
“Elite capture of regulatory agencies, profit-oriented policies and monopolies are publicly known factors,” Casiple said. “No previous president has successfully tackled these problems.”
Ratings Impact
While Duterte’s tirades have sent some stock investors fleeing, their impact on the economy has yet to be seen. Moody’s Investors Service said any regulatory risk from the water dispute won’t likely affect the Philippines’ overall credit rating, which stands at Baa2, the second-lowest investment grade.
“We are watching the situation, but there also are more material developments that we are looking at that could affect the Philippines’ credit profile,” Moody’s senior vice president Christian de Guzman said in a phone interview. Items include the passage of the 2020 budget and tax-reform bills, he said.
Duterte is set to make an announcement on the water deals Jan. 6, according to presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo. Both Manila Water and Maynilad have said they’re willing to work with the government to draw up better contracts.
“We wait,” Isidro Consunji, chairman and president of DMCI Holdings Inc. said in a phone interview. “What else can we do but wait?”"

579,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 05:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s government and central bank are running into policy limits as they try to stimulate Southeast Asia’s largest economy.
Authorities are predicting growth in 2020 will be the fastest in seven years despite lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and China and subdued global demand. Yet policy options to spur demand are limited: The central bank is already taking a more cautious approach after four interest rate cuts last year, while a revenue shortfall is pushing the budget deficit close to the legally mandated cap of 3% of gross domestic product.
“Fiscal stimulus as this point is more effective than adjustments in monetary policy, and the government needs to be more proactive,” said David Sumual, chief economist of PT Bank Central Asia in Jakarta. But the deficit ceiling “locks us into a soft pro-cyclical policy,” and even if the deficit were pushed to the limit this year it would only add 60 basis points to the growth rate, he said.
Economic growth has been hovering around the 5% mark for several years now. The government forecast 5.1% for 2019 -- down from an initial 5.3% -- and sees growth rebounding to as much as 5.6% this year.
Front-loading
To support the economy, the central bank cut interest rates by a total of 100 basis points in 2019. It has kept the benchmark rate unchanged at 5% at its past two meetings as the Federal Reserve signals a prolonged pause in U.S. rates.
For its part, the government has been widening the budget deficit and planning to front-load spending in the first quarter to support the economy. Last year’s deficit was projected to come in at about 2.2% of GDP amid a revenue shortfall. The government is targeting a deficit of 1.76% of GDP in 2020, but says it will be flexible on the target.
“On one hand we will continue to maintain prudent debt management, but at the same time we will also be supportive and flexible enough when the economy is under strong pressure coming from the global economy,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in November.
Deficit Ceiling
President Joko Widodo has held discussions with the cabinet about adjusting the deficit ceiling, but no immediate change is expected, according to the Finance Ministry.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to lower its benchmark rate to 4.75% this year. Inflation, which eased to 3% in November, is forecast to stay within the central bank’s new target of 2%-4%, while the economy is projected to grow about 5%.
“The monetary policy space looks limited,” said Charu Chanana, deputy head of Asia research at Continuum Economics in Singapore. “Fiscal easing is likely to be more effective to lift credit demand, and we see room for the Indonesian government to announce targeted measures despite the revenue and deficit ceiling constraints.”"
580,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 04:41PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- One U.S. service member and two defense contractors were killed Sunday in an al-Qaeda-linked raid on a joint defense facility in Kenya, authorities said. Two more service members were wounded and have been evacuated.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of our teammates who lost their lives today,” U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, commander, U.S. Africa Command, said in a statement.
Earlier, the Kenyan army said it stopped the Sunday morning raid on a base it uses with the U.S. in the coastal county of Lamu, killing at least four attackers from the al-Shabaab terror group. “We remain committed to preventing al-Shabaab from maintaining a safe haven,” Townsend said.
An attempt was made to breach security at Manda airstrip early Sunday but was “successfully repulsed,” KenyaDefence Forces said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. “Four terrorist bodies have so far been found. The airstrip is safe.”
“Although this attack shows a clear intent to continue targeting the United States’ presence in the region, the United States continues to stand in strong partnership with Kenya,” Representative Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.
The Manda Bay raid comes less than a week after a U.S. airstrike killed three members of al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based al-Qaeda-linked group that has claimed responsibility for the Sunday attack. The Jan. 3 strike was in support of Somalia, which with a regional mission that includes Kenya is striving to improve its security, according to the U.S. Africa Command.
Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he’s hopeful the attack will lead the panel to convene a hearing to examining the Trump administration’s policy in the region later this month.
“As we await further information on the specifics of this latest attack, it is clear that despite U. S. and international efforts to contain al-Shabaab, this terror organization remains a significant and active threat,” Menendez said in a statement."
581,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Investor sentiment toward Taiwan has rarely been this good, with only days to go before its first presidential election in four years.
Its financial markets keep hitting new milestones: the Taiwan dollar last week strengthened past 30 per greenback for the first time since June 2018, government-bond yields remain near all-time lows and stocks are inching toward a record after their best year in a decade.
While many anticipated Taiwan might get caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, its economy and markets were aided in 2019 by local firms being incentivized to invest at home and there being about $12 billion of net inflows to foreign investors’ portfolios through November, according to government data. Fresh proposals to attract investment were announced last week.
“Inflow from both foreign and domestic investors are going to help boost the stock, FX and bond markets in Taiwan,” said Angela Hsieh, a Singapore-based economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. Reasons she cited include investors continuing to take advantage of new tax breaks; as much as 30% of the money repatriated can go into Taiwan’s financial markets.
Meanwhile, with signs of global semiconductors bottoming and equipment related to 5G wireless technology starting to be deployed, “I am positive on Taiwan’s equity market regardless of the upcoming election results” following Jan. 11’s vote, said Vincent Tsui, senior Asia analyst at Gavekal Research.
For now, stock investors have shrugged off Taiwan equities sporting rich valuations, with the price-to-earnings ratio for components in the Taiex index the highest since 2012 on a year-end basis. Money is instead attracted by factors including a 3.8% dividend yield that’s among the world’s highest. Foreigners put a net $9.4 billion into Taiwan stocks last year, the most since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Also on the horizon is a strong earnings rebound. Analysts predict a 20% jump for this year, which would be the most since 2014 and more than reverse 2019’s projected 13% profit drop caused by early-year weakness at semiconductor, plastic and panel makers. 5G adoption and Chinese companies diversifying to non-U.S. suppliers should help boost Taiwan firms’ earnings at least through 2021, KGI Securities said in a research note last month.
Then there’s the economy. The government forecasts growth will top 2.5% again this year, stronger than regional peers. Foreign inflows boost Taiwan’s currency from demand to convert overseas cash into local dollars. The Taiwan unit has strengthened versus the U.S. dollar for seven straight weeks, the longest streak since May 2015.
Cash remains plentiful, meanwhile, domestically Taiwan’s markets -- particularly from life insurers.
As early redemptions of overseas bonds and debt listed in Taiwan but denominated in mainly greenbacks pick up, Taiwan life insurers may be handed back as much as $44 billion this quarter, estimates Fubon Financial Holding Co. There’s little room for that cash to go overseas as insurers’ international investments are approaching the limit of 65.25% of working capital. The cap exists to reduce foreign-currency risks from overseas holdings.
Bonds are a hallmark of insurers’ investment portfolios globally, and in Taiwan “all the bonds available on the market are mostly snapped up by banks and life insurers,” said Rachel Chang, a bond trader at Capital Securities. She sees that trend continuing for at least the first several months of 2020.
That will keep prices up for bonds. A Bloomberg survey shows expectations that Taiwan’s 10-year government-bond yield may reach a record low of 0.6% by April due to abundant funds available for investment and limited supply of new notes."
582,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Croatians shot down President Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic’s bid for a second term, electing the prime minister who led the nation into the European Union to rebalance politics in the bloc’s newest member.
Zoran Milanovic, who ran the Adriatic state’s government from 2011 to 2015, won 54% of votes in Sunday’s presidential runoff, according to partial results with 71% counted. Kitarovic, a former NATO executive whose popularity unexpectedly plummeted in the last weeks of the campaign after she was tied to the scandal-plagued mayor of Zagreb, got 46%.
Kitarovic’s defeat could spell trouble for her ally Andrej Plenkovic, the current prime minister, before general elections in the fall and just after his government took over the EU’s rotating presidency. While she reached out to voters embracing anti-immigrant positions seen in fellow EU states Poland and Hungary, Milanovic vowed to reject extremism, fight graft, and stop the outflow of young people who have left Croatia to seek better lives in western Europe.
“I will fight against the plague that’s consuming Croatia, and that’s corruption and conflicts of interest,” Milanovic said in a televised debate with Kitarovic before the vote. “We can overturn demographic trends and keep our young people here only with a decent, honest government.”
While the president’s role is largely ceremonial, the office commands the armed forces and decides over foreign-policy appointments with the premier. It also provides a political platform and Milanovic’s opposition-leading Social Democratic party is looking for any edge it can get over Plenkovic’s conservative Croatian Democratic Union.
“The result is a big blow to right-wing voters,” said Nenad Zakosek, political science professor at the University of Zagreb.
Parliament Vote
The rivals also differed on who the nation’s biggest ally is. While Kitarovic said it was the U.S., and touted when she met President Donald Trump, Milanovic said Croatia depended most on ties with the EU.
But the main issue before the presidential vote was corruption, and Kitarovic’s campaign suffered after she was filmed singing Happy Birthday and giving a cake to Zagreb Mayor Milan Bandic. He’s fighting graft accusations over the granting of preferential access to stalls at Zagreb’s Christmas market.
The accusations, which Bandic denies, come at a sensitive time for former Yugoslav republic of 4.2 million, which joined the EU in 2013 and took over the EU’s six-month rotating presidency on Jan. 1. During the term, it will organize meetings that may decide important issues including Brexit and the bloc’s next seven-year budget.
The bloc is scrutinizing Croatia’s readiness to adopt the euro and join Schengen, the EU’s passport-free travel zone. Graft concerns delayed similar efforts in nearby Bulgaria, adding pressure to Croatia, which is ranked fifth-worst in the EU by Transparency International.
“Milanovic’s victory means all bets are off now for parliamentary election in the fall,” said Zarko Puhovski from the University of Zagreb. “For the rest of the year we will have an unclear picture of where the real power in the country is situated.”

583,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and the euro area face daunting economic challenges in a world of low inflation and interest rates and central banks alone don’t have the tools to cope.
That’s the message delivered to the American Economic Association’s annual meeting on Sunday by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and ex-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.
“I believe that for the euro area there is some risk of Japanification, but it is by no means a foregone conclusion” if it acts comprehensively to avoid a deflationary malaise, Draghi said via a video link to the conference in San Diego. “The euro area still has space to do this, but time is not infinite,” he added.
Yellen, now at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said she agreed with former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that the U.S. was enmeshed in secular stagnation -- a state where desired savings are bigger than investment and interest rates are depressed as a result.
Chronic by Nature
She ticked off a number of structural forces holding down interest rates -- including an aging population and sluggish productivity -- and suggested they might be around for a while. “These factors are apt to prove chronic by nature,” she said.
Draghi took euro area governments to task for working at cross purposes with the ECB’s efforts to aid the economy in recent years by pursuing restrictive fiscal policies. “This is why the ECB has been consistently calling for fiscal policy to play a stronger role and capitalize” on the low rates, he said.
He counseled policy makers in Europe against becoming resigned to slipping into deflation. “It is certainly not too late for the euro area to avoid this,” he said, adding, “The euro area is not in a deflationary trap.”
Don’t Give Up
Yellen said that monetary policy in the U.S. should not be written off as a policy tool to combat recessions just because interest rates are so low. She agreed with her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, that quantitative easing and forward interest-rate guidance can be effective in providing stimulus to the economy.
But while “monetary policy has a meaningful role to play, it’s unlikely to be sufficient in the years ahead,” Yellen said. It “should not be the only game in town.”
“We can afford to increase federal spending and cut taxes” to support the economy in a recession even though government debt has risen sharply in recent years, the former policy maker said.
Yellen did, though, express concern about financial stability risks arising out an extended period of low interest rates. She also bemoaned the paucity of macro-prudential tools the U.S. has to deal with that."

This week will also bring the first U.S. nonfarm payrolls report of the decade, which is expected to point to a slowdown in jobs growth after November’s bumper gains. Market participants will also be watching ongoing developments relating to the U.S. -China trade deal and Brexit.
Investors rushed into safe-haven assets on Friday after U.S. air strikes in Iraq killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehran’s most prominent military commander, sending the Japanese yen to a three-month high, while the U.S. dollar was knocked by the weakest domestic factory activity in a decade.
The dollar fell as low as 107.8 per yen and was last down 0.4% on the day at 108.1. The yen is often seen as a haven from risk, given Japan's status as the world's largest creditor nation. A holiday in Tokyo also made for thin conditions, exaggerating the move.
The Swiss franc, another currency perceived as safe, surged to a four-month high of 1.0825 against the euro. The U.S. dollar hit a one-week high versus the euro.
The U.S. dollar index initially benefited from the move into safe-haven assets, but those gains were erased after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that the manufacturing sector contracted significantly in December. It was last up 0.08% on the day at 96.602.
The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in December by the most in more than a decade, with order volumes crashing to a near 11-year low and factory employment falling for a fifth straight month.
The longer-term effects on the dollar are unclear. Though it weakened Friday, the greenback may ultimately benefit if slower U.S. manufacturing dents hopes for global growth in 2020.
“The idea that other countries that are large exporters to the U.S. might see a large rebound in the near term - that idea is losing traction here,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments.

586,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 10:29AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The new year has barely begun and global markets are already under threat from a geopolitical flare-up that few saw coming, and that’s hurting risk-sensitive currencies such as Sweden’s krona.
The Scandinavian currency was set for worst week against the dollar since early November amid escalating tensions in the Middle East after a U.S. airstrike killed a top Iranian general. The krona had staged a dramatic recovery in the final quarter of 2019 -- rallying about 5% -- as the Riksbank exited almost half decade of negative interest rates.
With Iran’s threat of “severe retaliation” raising fears of an armed conflict in the Middle East, investors may be in for more volatility than they were ready for. That’s undermining the optimism that has been building in recent weeks for brighter economic prospects in 2020, with the U.S. and China now headed for a trade truce and the U.K. looking set to avoid an immediate chaotic exit from the European Union.
“The timing of the latest escalation of the tensions between the U.S. and Iran is unfortunate,” said Valentin Marinov, head of G-10 currency research at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA in London. “It could trigger unwarranted tightening in the global financial conditions and dash market hopes for a rebound of the global economy that is still to emerge from under the cloud of the U.S.-China trade war. Risk sentiment should remain fragile.”
The krona was down 0.7% this week at 9.4059 per dollar as of 2:10 p.m. in London, on track for the biggest five-day loss since the period ended Nov. 8. The Swedish currency reached 9.2949 on Dec. 31, its strongest level in six months. The Australian and New Zealand dollars dropped around 0.5% each this week. The yen led gains Group-of-10 peers on haven bids, with an advance of 1.2% against the dollar.
While key economic data such as services-sector figures from Europe and trade and payrolls reports from the U.S. will be in focus next week, geopolitics may continue to overshadow them.
The “geopolitical wind blows against the tide of economic data,”  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA strategist Kit Juckes wrote in a client note. “In foreign-exchange markets, safe havens and oil-sensitive currencies benefit but it’s the yen which is the clear winner.” He also recommended betting on Sweden’s currency weakening against the Norwegian krone.",,,,,
587,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 09:33AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish state lenders sold between $1 billion and $1.5 billion to stem the lira's decline on Friday, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
The sales appear to have been triggered by a global flight from riskier assets as tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated, two of the people said.
The lira slipped as much as 0.4% amid the rout to a seven-month low of 5.9781 against the dollar, posting one of the smallest declines across emerging-market currencies.
State banks have sold dollars to prop up the lira over the last year, especially in times of heightened volatility, traders say. The currency is a key economic barometer for voters and a driver of consumer confidence.
But the practice has been a source of controversy, with speculation mounting the sales amount to veiled intervention by the central bank. It’s also made trading the lira less attractive for foreign investors.
In the run-up to municipal elections in March, state banks sold as much as $15 billion to support the currency, according to traders’ estimates. In the second week of October, transactions amounted to at least $3.5 billion amid fears that punitive measures from Washington could deal a fresh blow to the Turkish economy."

LONDON (Reuters) - Safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen jumped to their highest in months on Friday after U.S. air strikes on Baghdad airport killed a senior Iranian military official, stoking tensions in the Middle East.
U.S. Treasuries, oil prices and gold rallied after an Iraqi militia spokesman told Reuters that Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in the attack.
The Pentagon confirmed the strike, saying Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack Americans in Iraq and the Middle East.
The Japanese yen hit a two-month high of 107.92 against the U.S. dollar and was last up 0.5% on the day.
The yen is often seen as a haven from risk, given Japan's status as the world's largest creditor nation. A holiday in Tokyo also made for thin conditions, exaggerating the move.

Jeremy Stretch, head of currencies as CIBC, said the fall in U.S. yields showed a reversal of the optimism seen on Thursday.
Market participants are now calculating the risk of retribution from the Iranian side, he said. ""We are still waiting and watching to see whether there is going to be (the) dynamic reaction that the initial headlines suggest.""

Traders will be watching preliminary German inflation numbers for December, due at 1300 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters expect yearly inflation to have risen to 1.4% from 1.1% the month before.
Preliminary data in France showed inflation beating market expectations, rising to 1.6% from 1.2%. Polls had forecast an increase to 1.4%.
An index of U.S. manufacturing activity is also due at 1500 GMT, but markets will be more interested in scrutinizing the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting in December.
Though the Fed has left interest rates unchanged, analysts will look for clues on how the bank is looking to solve the liquidity squeeze in the ""repo"", or repurchasing agreement, market, CIBC's Stretch said.
Several Fed official are speaking on Friday, including Governor Lael Brainard and the heads of the San Francisco, Chicago, Richmond and Dallas banks.

The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies was little changed at 96.500 by 1:30 AM ET (05:30 GMT).
While not a directional driver today, fund managers and strategists said things may get worse for the dollar. 
“We expect to see better growth in the rest of the world ex-USA,” said Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia. “The primary driver of dollar weakness will be a shift in relative economic growth rates between the U.S. and the rest of the world.”
U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that Beijing and Washington will officially sign the phase one trade deal later this month.
The announcement removed much of the lingering uncertainty about the so-called ‘phase-1’ deal and also reinforced hopes that Trump’s need for re-election will keep an economically damaging trade war with China relatively contained over the coming months.
“You had safe-haven support for the dollar in 2019, but we have a trade truce now,” said Georgette Boele, senior foreign-exchange strategist at ABN Amro Bank in Amsterdam. “The dollar is on a path of long-term weakness.”

591,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar had an awful December and things may only get worse.
The currency is set to extend losses as a truce in the U.S.-China trade war and signs that global growth is improving sap demand for haven assets, according to ABN Amro Bank NV. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has taken a dovish tilt, which will help shrink the yield premium offered by U.S. Treasuries, says M&G Investments Ltd.
“You had safe-haven support for the dollar in 2019, but we have a trade truce now,” said Georgette Boele, senior foreign-exchange strategist at ABN Amro Bank in Amsterdam. “The dollar is on a path of long-term weakness.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against 10 global peers, slid 2% in December, the biggest monthly decline in almost two years. The gauge’s failure to sustain gains made earlier in 2019 appears to have drawn a line under a rally that saw it surge about 40% from a low in 2011 to a peak in early 2017.
The U.S. currency started to weaken from October amid signs the U.S. and China were closing in on an initial deal to end their long-running trade dispute. The agreement was finally confirmed by President Donald Trump in December.
Another major pillar behind the dollar’s multi-year advance was also undermined last year as the U.S. central bank halted a series of rate hikes by cutting its benchmark in July, September and October to support slowing growth.
“The Fed does have some room to move lower in 2020, and for this reason I would expect a weaker dollar,” said Jim Leaviss, head of fixed-income at M&G Investments in London. There may also be “more pressure on the Fed if growth remains mediocre going into the U.S. elections,” he said.
The Fed’s dovish pivot has seen the U.S. two-year yield advantage over similar-maturity German debt shrink to 216 basis points from around 350 basis points in late 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“We expect to see better growth in the rest of the world ex-USA,” said Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia. “The primary driver of dollar weakness will be a shift in relative economic growth rates between the U.S. and the rest of the world.”
‘Not Convinced’
Not everyone is convinced the dollar is poised to keep weakening.
  Citigroup   (NYSE:C) recommends betting the greenback will strengthen against the euro and Canadian dollar on a view the U.S. economy will outperform the rest of the world. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) argues the dollar will only decline if the euro and yuan appreciate significantly, and it says that looks unlikely for now.
“While we can understand the top-down logic, we are not convinced on the bottom-up case -- at least over the next few months,” Goldman strategists including co-head of global foreign-exchange and emerging-markets strategy Zach Pandl in New York wrote in a client note last month.
Back on the bearish side, National Australia Bank Ltd. is looking for further dollar losses, but sees more of a grind lower than a sudden sell-off.
“The dollar is set to begin 2020 fundamentally overvalued,” strategists at the bank including Ray Attrill in Sydney wrote in a research note. “We expect it to fall in 2020, but in a relatively sedate fashion barring resumption of Fed easing or dramatic improvement in growth prospects outside the U.S.”"

By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, was at 96.215, having traded as low as 96.02 over the new year. Despite the modest bounce, the dollar index has lost nearly 1% over the last week, chiefly against sterling and commodity currencies such as the Aussie and loonie. The euro was steady at $1.1210, having breached $1.1200 for the first time since August.
Overnight, the Chinese central bank again loosened its monetary stance with a further cut in its reserve requirement ratio. The move freed up over $110 billion in liquidity for the domestic banking system, which has struggled increasingly in recent months with an overhang of corporate debt.
The move, coming on the back of the news of the trade deal with the U.S., also propelled China’s stock index to its highest in nearly two years.
The day’s data calendar is dominated by the release of purchasing manager indexes by IHS Markit. The Chinese PMI fell to a three-month low earlier, but stayed comfortably in expansion territory, but the impact of that was softened by an encouraging bounce in industrial profits in November that was announced last week.
In Europe, meanwhile, the Spanish reading fell less than expected but Italy’s fell to 46.2, its lowest since April 2013. France’s and Germany's ticked up fractionally from the flash assessments to 50.4 and 43.7, respectively.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar started the new year where it left the old one, on the back foot as investors wagered U.S. economic outperformance might be drawing to a close as optimism on trade brightens the outlook for growth globally.
Signs of progress in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute undermined the dollar for much of December, leaving its index (DXY) down 1.9% on the month. It was up just a fraction on Thursday at 96.546 having touched a six-month trough ahead of the holidays.
The euro held at $1.1215 (EUR=), after gaining 1.8% in December to reach its highest since early August. It now looks set to challenge the August peak at $1.1249.
The dollar eased further on the Chinese yuan after shedding 1% last month to stand at 6.9630 . It was also finely poised on the yen at 108.68 , just a whisker from the December lows and major support around 108.40.
""A more encouraging global growth outlook and flush dollar liquidity conditions are undermining the USD,"" said Elias Haddad, a senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
""Specifically, global fiscal/monetary policy settings will remain accommodative in 2020 and China's growth slowdown is stabilizing.""
China's central bank on Wednesday cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing around 800 billion yuan ($114.91 billion) to shore up the economy.
A survey of Chinese manufacturing out on Thursday showed activity was still expanding in December while confidence shot higher as trade tensions eased.
The dollar had benefited from U.S. economic outperformance for much of 2019, but an easing in Sino-U.S. trade concerns has boosted optimism that this year could favor other major nations.
While activity was light on Thursday, traders were on watch for any repeat of last January's ""flash crash"" when massive stop-loss selling swept through an illiquid holiday-hit market.
There are fears the same could happen this week with Tokyo off and Japanese retail investors again heavily short of yen and long of risky high-yielding currencies, including the Turkish lira and the South African rand.
For liquidity reasons, these positions are usually ""legged"" through the U.S. dollar - selling yen for dollars and dollars for lira - so any mass unwinding roils more than just the yen crosses.
Yet, unlike last year, the authorities are on alert with the Financial Futures Association of Japan warning against wild moves.
The Federal Reserve has already averted a squeeze in lending markets as banks took only a small portion of its d $150 billion in year-end funding, leaving repo rates at the lowest since March 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro, the pound and a clutch of trade-sensitive currencies rallied as the dollar slid to a six-month low on Tuesday, as investor confidence in global growth prospects and the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal spurred a risk-on move. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the first phase of an American trade deal with China would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House. 
The dollar index (DXY) was down 0.36% to 96.388, its fourth consecutive session in the red and its weakest level since July 1. The Phase 1 trade agreement, which was reached earlier in December, has reduced demand for the safe-haven currency, pulling the dollar down 1.92% in the last month. 
December's move has undone much of the dollar's strong 2019 thanks to the relative outperformance of the U.S. economy and a long period of uncertainty in the negotiations between Washington and Beijing. 
""Weakness in the U.S. dollar towards the end of this year has coincided with the renewed expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and the paring back of pessimism over the outlook for global growth,"" MUFG analysts said. 
On the last trading day of the year, the dollar was up just 0.25% for 2019 compared to 4.4% in 2018. At the end of November, it was up 2.18% for the year. The shift also reflects investor bets that the dollar will weaken further in 2020. 
""Everybody has been wanting to short the dollar. It has been the most frustrating trade of the year. I think for the most part, there's not a lot of resistance going back into that trade. If we look into the top 2020 calls for FX, it's going to be short the dollar,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. 
Buoyant end-of-year sentiment encouraged investors to buy up currencies linked to trade and global growth, sending the Australian dollar , Chinese yuan  and Scandinavian crowns to multi-month or multi-week highs against the greenback.
Investors' appetite for risk also helped drive the euro (EUR=) to $1.124, a five-month high. It was last trading 0.27% higher at $1.123. 
Signs that the euro zone economy may be stabilizing have lifted the common currency in recent weeks as investors unwound short positions.

Sterling  hit two-week highs against the dollar, although the possibility of a 'no-deal' Brexit at the end of 2020 means the currency is still not close to where it was on Dec. 12, the day Prime Minister Boris Johnson won the British election.

The subdued but positive PMI reading comes as China and the U.S. prepare to sign a phase one deal on their ongoing trade war that has hit both economies.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda said it plans to borrow 6.9 trillion shillings ($1.89 billion) from external lenders in the 2020/2021 (July-June) fiscal year to partly finance its budget, which could come under pressure as veteran leader Yoweri Museveni seeks re-election.
A finance ministry budget paper seen by Reuters on Monday showed the funds will be in ""form of concessional and non-concessional"" credit.
The paper did not indicate how much was borrowed in the previous financial year. It also did not indicate from whom the money would be borrowed, but in recent years China has become one of Uganda's top external lenders.
Museveni, in power since 1986, is widely expected to seek re-election early in 2021. He is expected to face a formidable challenge from pop star-turned-lawmaker Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.
Public spending typically surges in election periods in Uganda, which has some times triggered pressure on consumer prices and the local currency.
The paper said economic growth in 2020/2021 would be 6.2%, driven by higher productivity in manufacturing and agriculture and ""public and private sector investment as well as regional and domestic trade.""
Uganda's mounting public debt has been fuelling concern. The International Monetary Fund has urged authorities to rein in borrowing.
Some opposition critics have also accused government of front-loading debt before an expected windfall from oil sales. Uganda hopes to commence crude oil production in 2022.
This month, the government said it was planning to borrow 600 million euros ($661 million) from international banks to plug a hole in its 2019/2020 budget after domestic revenue collections fell short by 9%.
The shortfall was caused by delays in implementing some planned tax-generating measures, according to the finance ministry."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on Monday in light year-end trading after suffering a setback the previous session, as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal lifted investors' risk appetite, sapping safe-haven demand for the greenback.
The dollar index (DXY) was stable at 96.942 against six major currencies after sliding 0.6% on Friday for its biggest single day percentage drop since June.
With Friday's loss, the index's gains for the year have shrunk to under 1%, putting it on track for the smallest annual change in six years.
Against the Japanese yen the dollar was treading water at 109.41, on track to end the year where it started in January.
The big gainers in recent weeks have been the risk-sensitive and commodity-linked currencies of Australia and New Zealand.
The Aussie and the kiwi scaled five month peaks on Monday to $0.6990 and $0.6717 respectively, boosted by higher commodity prices and expectations the United States and China would sign a trade deal soon.
Last week, Chinese authorities said Beijing was in close contact with Washington about an initial trade agreement. Prior to those comments, U.S. President Donald Trump had talked up a signing ceremony for the recently struck Phase 1 trade deal.
But despite recent rallies, the annual performances of the antipodean currencies are still dreary with the Aussie down 1% so far this year and the kiwi off a shade.
""What’s really noticeable is the narrow range of currencies during the year,"" said Marshall Gittler, Cyprus-based chief strategist at ACLS Global, pointing to ""economic and monetary policy convergence.""
""I expect less of both in 2020, for two reasons,"" he said, noting the expected end of the Sino-U.S. trade war which should lead to broader economic recovery across the world.
The second reason, Gittler said, was that inflation seemed to have bottomed.
""As (inflation) accelerates, countries are less likely to cut rates and maybe, possibly, conceivably some countries could start thinking about hiking rates, which would encourage monetary policy divergence.""
Elsewhere, the euro (EUR=) rose for a sixth straight session on Monday to $1.1186.
Bleak European economic data had prompted hedge funds to bet on a weaker euro during 2019, but some strength in recent Eurozone data along with weakness in other currencies have lifted the euro.
The common currency has jumped 2.6% in this quarter but that was still not enough to wipe out this year's losses.
Sterling was higher after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union may need to extend the deadline for talks about a new trade relationship with Britain.
Even with the recent UK general election smoothing the path for Britain's exit from the European Union, Britain's ability to strike a new trading deal between the EU in a relatively short span of time remains a concern for some investors.
The pound was last up 0.15% for its fifth straight session of gains at $1.3096.
Later in the day, investors will stay tuned for the Chicago Purchasing Management Index, also known as the Chicago Business Barometer for clues about the health of the U.S. economy."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a six-month high versus the Japanese yen while the Australian dollar climbed to its strongest since July on Friday, buoyed by easing Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
The optimism around prospects for a Phase 1 trade deal reduced demand for safe-haven currencies such as the yen, but with global currency markets in a holiday mood after Christmas Day on Wednesday, overall trading activity was mostly subdued.
Beijing said on Wednesday it is in close touch with Washington on a trade deal signing ceremony, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will have a ceremony to sign the agreement.
Overnight, the dollar rose to as high as 109.68 yen against the safe-haven Japanese currency, a one-week high and not far from 109.73 yen, its late May peak brushed earlier this month. In late Asian trade, the pair was last quoted at 109.50 yen, down 0.1% on the day.
""Although the overnight gains in the dollar were partly erased by dipping Treasury yields after the seven-year note auction, U.S.-China trade optimism has put a solid floor under the dollar,"" said Toshinobu Chiba, chief portfolio manager for fixed income at Nissay Asset Management.
""In any case, I don't expect any large moves either way in markets today as trading remains subdued due to the holiday week.""
U.S. Treasury yields slipped on Thursday after the Treasury Department sold $32 billion in seven-year notes to strong demand. The 10-year last stood at 1.894%, its lowest level in 1-1/2 weeks.
The trade-sensitive Aussie dollar firmed to as high as $0.6956 against its U.S. counterpart, its five-month high.

The Australian dollar fetched $0.69295 in early trade, up 0.12% and within striking distance of its Dec. 13 peak of $0.6939, its highest level since late July. The currency has gained over 1% in the past four sessions.

Other risk sensitive currencies were also generally well-supported.
The New Zealand dollar stood at $0.6626, just below a five-month high of $0.6639 hit on Monday, while many emerging market currencies, including the Mexican peso , the Indonesian rupiah and the Russian rouble , held near multi-month peaks.
The British pound, however, slipped to three-week lows as the market braced for more uncertainty after the United Kingdom officially leaves the European Union in January.
As Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made it illegal to extend trade talks with the EU beyond the end of next year, investors fret the country could crash out without any trade deal.

Sterling led declines among major currencies, slipping below its 50-day moving average for the first time in more than two months. While the pound surged after Boris Johnson’s party won a landslide victory in the Dec. 12 election, investor sentiment soon soured as the prime minister was set to use his majority to take a hardline stance in talks with the European Union.
“Conditions are extremely quiet, so it’s difficult to read too much into it,” Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank, said on the pound’s drop. “That said, sterling has dropped lower and the market is reevaluating how much Brexit is going to be a feature in the next year. This is just a realignment and a realization that the risk of no-deal Brexit is still a reality.”
The pound fell as much as 0.7% to $1.2905, the lowest since Dec. 2. Its five-day losing streak is the longest since May 17. The currency also weakened by as much as 0.7% to 85.80 pence per euro.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm at the start of a holiday-thinned week on Monday, as U.S. data pointed to solid economic growth while the British pound bounced slightly after having suffered its biggest weekly fall in three years.
A batch of economic data published on Friday showed the U.S. economy, already in its longest expansion in history, appears to have maintained the moderate pace of growth as the year ended, supported by a strong labor market.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was unrevised from November's estimate.
""The U.S. economy appears to have stopped slowing. There is no indication it will be hitting a recession,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
Earlier this year, investors were spooked by fears over the possibility of a U.S. recession when the U.S. yield curve inverted, which has been historically one of the most reliable signs of a U.S. downturn.
Separate data showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and spent more on healthcare.
That contrasted with an unexpected deterioration in German consumer sentiment.
The euro stood at $1.10778 (EUR=), little changed on the day but in retreat since it hit a four-month high of $1.12 on Dec. 13.
The dollar index (=USD) was at 97.659, flat on the day but maintaining its recovery trend since hitting a five-month low of 96.605 on Dec. 12.
The dollar has been supported by optimism over the global economy since Washington and Beijing came to an interim trade agreement earlier this month.
China said on Monday it would lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork to some type of semiconductors next year, as Beijing looks to boost imports amid a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday the United States and China would ""very shortly"" sign their so-called Phase 1 trade pact.
Against the yen, the dollar changed hands at 109.41 yen , little changed on the day and not far from a six-month high of 109.73 touched earlier this month.
""One thing to look at is whether market players cut their (yen-short) positions ahead of the holiday period on concerns there could be a flash crash like a year ago,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
The dollar tumbled as much as 4.4% on the second trading day of this year as a lack of yen liquidity, due to a Japanese market holiday, amplified the dollar/yen's fall sparked by a rare revenue warning from Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Currency speculators have cut their net short positions in the yen slightly in the week that ended last Tuesday after having increased bets against the currency constantly for a few months, data from the U.S. financial watchdog showed on Friday.
Some noted concerns over increasing tensions between North Korea and the United States.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a meeting of top military officials to discuss boosting the country's military capability, the state news agency reported on Sunday amid heightened concerns the North may be about to return to confrontation with Washington.
Sterling traded at $1.3011 , up slightly as it regained some stability after hitting a 2-1/2-week low of $1.2979 on Friday.
It fell 2.6% last week, the biggest weekly fall since October 2016, after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson set December 2020 as a hard deadline to reach a trade agreement.

609,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 10:33PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Thai baht’s heady gains are petering out, thanks to slowing growth and a central bank that’s bent on taming the currency’s strength.
After clocking an 8% rise this year, Asia’s best-performing currency is losing momentum as easing U.S.-China trade tensions damp its appeal as a haven. Falling yields on local bonds and equity outflows are adding to the pressure.
The baht has defied the broad weakness in regional currencies as investors sought refuge in Thailand’s safe but low-yielding debt. A hefty current account surplus and a sizable pile of foreign reserves helped reel in global funds.
But, the tide has started to turn. The baht has climbed just 0.1% in December, making it the region’s worst-performing currency. It has dropped 0.2% to around 30.2 per dollar since rallying to the strongest in more than six years in October.
The baht may continue this underperformance if U.S.-China trade relations improve further as Bloomberg’s analysis of 19 emerging-market currencies shows it’s among those that are least responsive to the yuan’s move.
The baht’s retreat in December came as the central bank lowered its economic growth forecasts, citing global risks. November trade data due Monday may confirm the slowing trend, with the nation forecast to have recorded its first trade deficit since April as both exports and imports shrank.
The baht is expected to decline 1% to 30.5 per dollar by end-2020, a performance that would put it behind all but three of its Asian peers, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.
If Thailand’s growth weakens, this could fuel further selling in Thai stocks and weigh on the baht. The 12-month foreign outflow from domestic equities is already above the five-year average.
Bonds may also fall out of favor as yields decline after the central bank slashed the policy rate to a record low this year. Ten-year Thai sovereign debt yield about 1.6%, less than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.
Should the baht defy expectations for a drop, the central bank may step in again to check its strength. Policy makers have rolled out a slew of measures including cutting the supply of short-term bonds and easing rules on outflows to rein in the currency’s advance.

611,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 08:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- In an era of low global interest rates, currency traders will have to look elsewhere for an impetus. In Canada, they can bank on population growth.
The flood of immigrants and non-permanent residents to levels not seen in a century has been one of the main drivers supporting Canada’s economic expansion over the past several years. That has kept the Bank of Canada as an outlier in the global easing trend as it held its policy rate unchanged, bolstering the allure of the loonie.
“These high levels of immigration -- if they are to continue and help support growth -- are actually supportive of a Canadian dollar over time,” Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management, said in an interview in Toronto.
The country’s population grew by 208,234 in the July to September period, or 0.6%, the fastest quarterly increase since at least 1971. Some 83% of that increase is due to international migration, according to estimates from Statistics Canada released Thursday in Ottawa. Over the past year, Canada’s population has jumped by almost 560,000, an increase of 1.5% -- that’s the fastest annual pace since 1990.
“This is the story I think markets are missing: how powerful immigration is at actually changing your financial markets, particularly your rates and FX,” Donald said.
The Canadian dollar is on pace to take the No. 1 spot among its Group-of-10 counterparts this year, strengthening by about 4% against the U.S. dollar.
Canada’s population boom has driven robust gains in the housing and labor markets, countering the effect of an aging demographic. This has helped to avoid the Japanification trap of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates that are slowly becoming evident in other parts of the world.
“What’s fascinating about the story however, from a strategist, like myself, is not even how it relates to GDP growth but how we’re substituting one form of policy for another,” Donald said.
While Donald argues immigration can be a proxy for monetary policy, currency strategists say the central bank is still the main driver of the loonie, and immigration is more of a long-term variable that can influence policy.
“Immigration informs the output gap and hence policy stance,” wrote Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York. “FX will react to how the Bank changes policy.”
Case in point, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has cited the country’s robust labor force, supported by new entrants, as a reason for holding interest rates despite concerns around a slowdown.
Relying on human capital to improve growth and inflation numbers over time actually acts as a curve steepener, Donald added. “If we rely on this so called human stimulus then we don’t have to rely on monetary policy to the same extent.”"

The dollar had also been supported by demand for U.S. equities, which rose to yet another record high on Thursday, shrugging off the impeachment of President Donald Trump and pricing in a more benign trade outlook with China in the near term.
The new U.K. parliament met on Thursday for the first time since the General Election last week, with the Queen’s Speech outlining a program that makes it much easier for the U.K. government to pursue a potentially destabilizing policy of brinkmanship with the EU in negotiations next year over future trading relations.
The speech also outlined big increases in health spending and grand promises on infrastructure investment, notably in broadband provision. That is likely to put pressure on the budget deficit at a time when the economy is facing only a modest improvement after years of Brexit-related uncertainty.

EUR/GBP was down 0.1% at 0.8531, after hitting its highest in two weeks on Thursday.
Sterling got a small boost from the publication of figures showing consumer confidence at its highest since July. Eurozone consumer confidence figures due out later aren’t expected to show any comparable improvement but will in any case merely be a revision of preliminary data. The same goes for the revision of the Michigan U.S. consumer sentiment survey.

The exchange rate dropped to as low as 7.7998 per greenback, near the midpoint of 7.8 in its allowed trading range. The pullback in the Hong Kong dollar followed a seven-day advance, which this week made the currency the most overbought in more than a year, according to its relative strength index.
The adjustment isn’t surprising as market watchers thought the rally would prove short-lived. The ascent was mostly triggered by transitory factors, such as bets that liquidity will tighten toward year-end with banks hoarding funds for regulatory checks. Also, stronger risk appetite that’s been helping Hong Kong assets may not last, as the China-U.S. trade war is expected drag on next year.
Longest Hong Kong Dollar Rally in Eight Years Is Burning Shorts
But that doesn’t mean the Hong Kong dollar will fall all the way back to the weak end of its trading band. That’s because local interbank interest rates have stayed higher than funding costs in greenbacks since November, outstripping the income a trader can expect on U.S. dollars. Therefore, the short carry trade -- where investors sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy greenbacks -- won’t become popular anytime soon.
The currency’s one-month interbank borrowing costs are 78 basis points higher than similar rates on the greenback. That’s close to the highest since the 1990s.
That short strategy repeatedly helped push the Hong Kong dollar to the weak end of the band, triggering official intervention. The city’s interbank liquidity pool shrank by 70% since April 2018 as the de-facto central bank bought back local dollars to defend the peg to the greenback.
As of 10:34 a.m. local time, the Hong Kong dollar weakened 0.07% to 7.7995 per greenback."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Sterling headed for its worst week in more than two years on Friday, hobbled by familiar fears of a chaotic British exit from the European Union, while firm data helped the dollar arrest its recent slide.
Overnight the pound slipped below $1.30 for the first time in a fortnight. It sat at $1.3008 early in Asian trading hours as worries grow about whether a deal can be sorted out before the December 2020 hard deadline.
Cable has given up all the gains won after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was re-elected last week and has slumped 2.4% against the dollar since Monday. It has fared even worse against the euro, headed for its largest weekly loss in more than three years if the slide persists (EURGBP=).
""The market was always a little bit naive in a way to think that a Tory election win was going to remove the fog of Brexit,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank. ""There were obviously some longs in weak hands that got forced out.""
More than three years since Britain voted to exit the European Union in a 2016 referendum, Johnson's government will leave the political bloc at the end of January and has set Dec. 2020 as a hard deadline to reach a trade agreement.
Uncertainty over that prospect helped the safe-haven Swiss franc to its highest in a month against the euro at 1.0881 francs per euro (EURCHF=R) and its strongest against the dollar since September .
Elsewhere, the greenback found broad support. Solid housing starts and firmer-than-expected manufacturing data this week helped to halt two weeks of declines against a basket of currencies (DXY). The dollar was steady at 97.404.
Nobody expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to move interest rates anywhere when it meets in January.
The dollar last traded a whisker stronger on the Japanese yen at 109.37 yen and a tiny bit weaker against the euro (EUR=) at $1.1124. The dollar has gained 0.7% on the yen this week.
The best performer of the last 24 hours has been the Australian dollar , which rallied half a percent as strong jobs data prompted traders to pare back bets on a interest rate cut when the central bank meets in February.
Expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia will reduce rates fell from about 60% to just under even.
""That's a notable change. When you drop under 50% the psychology changes a little bit,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow. ""I can see why people are not quite convinced,"" said Callow, who is sticking with a forecast for a cut.
The Aussie was last steady near a one-week high at $0.6883. The New Zealand dollar was stable at $0.6607, in a week where weakness in milk prices was offset by another round of positive economic data.
The Chinese yuan held just on the strong side of the symbolic 7-per-dollar as China's unveiling of new tariff exemptions on U.S. chemical and oil product imports supported optimism about the Sino-U.S. trade detente.

Analysts say the recent elusiveness of hard currency is likely due to a deteriorating economic situation and increased demand as the government steps up moves to end Cuba's labyrinthine dual currency system.
Among those affected are Cubans who want to protect themselves from any kind of possible depreciation this complex process could entail by parking their savings in hard currency and those, like Roly, wanting to travel abroad.
Neither of Cuba's two currencies - the peso or the dollar-equivalent convertible peso (CUC) - are legal tender outside the island, where all financial institutions are state-run.
""There's been no money available at the banks or exchange houses for weeks, you have to look elsewhere,"" said Roly. ""I've spent half a day on the streets under the sun and I haven't managed to buy a single dollar.""
Cuba's foreign exchange earnings have declined in recent years in tandem with the economic woes of its ally Venezuela and a tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo under President Donald Trump, including increased restrictions on U.S. travel.
Several countries such as Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador have also ended over the past year contracts under which they hired thousands of Cuban doctors from the state. Such service exports make up most of Cuba's hard currency earnings.
In October, Cuba opened around a dozen stores selling appliances, car parts and other items for dollars, with a bank card. Economists said this should help authorities rake in some hard currency and stem capital flight through the activity of mules such as Roly.
Some say establishing the ""dollar stores"" could also be a sign the government is bringing back the greenback to stabilize the economy during elimination of the dual currency system, at least during a transition phase.
""The economy is already being dollarized, even if no-one says it"" said Cuban economist Omar Everleny. ""That the CUC has started to lose value...is a reality"". 
Cuba's two currencies have circulated on the island at multiple exchange rates ever since the decline of Cuba's former benefactor the Soviet Union as part of a strategy to open up the economy while shielding local industry and citizens.
But the system has for years been deemed more damaging than beneficial to the economy and the government is expected to eliminate the CUC over the next year.
In November, it banned its export and import. Passengers catching flights abroad have to now exchange their CUCs before passing through customs and purchase goods on the other side in tradeable currency.
""For the last few weeks, they've not allowed us to sell hard currency, neither dollars or euros, because there's no money,"" said Miriam Gonzalez, 55, a cashier at an exchange house.
""They are sending all the hard currency received here to the airport.""
Even those with accounts in hard currency at Cuban banks have struggled to get their money out, sometimes having to wait for weeks, much to their frustration.
""You just can't trust our country's banks,"" said one client, who declined to give her name after attempting to withdraw 500 euros someone had transferred her from Spain. Her bank instead put her on a waiting list.

""There's no money available at the moment ... it's disrespectful.""

Turkey is limiting the amount of foreign currency local banks can swap for the lira as policy makers seek to reduce volatility in the battered currency.
The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, or BDDK as it’s known, will limit foreign exchange swaps, forwards and other derivatives with a maturity of seven days or less to a maximum of 10% of banks’ equity, it said late on Wednesday.
The regulator in September 2018 limited swaps on foreigners selling forex in exchange for lira at 25% of equity to prevent short selling.
“This time the regulator looks like it’s trying to prevent carry trades,” said QNB Finansbank chief economist Erkin Isik. “The regulator may also want to prevent FX outflow and encourage banks to use the swap mechanism with the central bank.”
Worst Performing
The lira reversed earlier gains and was down 0.2% against the dollar at 5.9380 at 11:25 a.m in Istanbul. The currency has lost 3.4% since the beginning of December, making it the worst-performing emerging market currency tracked by Bloomberg in the period.
The move may also encourage banks to use local market short-term funding after money market rates declined to 11%, Isik said.
The dollar/lira one-week implied yield fell as low as 7.2% from 10.4% at Wednesday’s close. That’s below the central bank’s policy rate of 12%, making it cheaper for banks to borrow in lira in exchange for their forex holdings. The dollar/lira overnight forward implied yield also sank as low as 3.4% from 10.7% at close.
Turkey’s gross forex reserves fell to $79 billion as of Dec. 6., from $96 billion two years ago, according to central bank data. The bank opened a three-month swap auction for $1 billion on Thursday to encourage local banks to bring their foreign currencies."

As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% and that for 10-year government bond yields around 0%.
The focus now turns to Scandinavia, where two of the only central banks in the world to consider tightening monetary policy have their regular meetings. The Swedish Riksbank is set to end its experiment with negative rates and raise its key rate to 0% from -0.25%, chiefly on concerns about financial stability. The krona has risen some 2% against the euro in the last month in anticipation but was effectively flat at 10.4658 by 3:05 AM ET (0805 GMT). Norway’s central bank is expected to leave its key rate unchanged.
The pound is also in focus after a volatile week in the wake of the general election. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee meets later, and is expected to vote 7-2 again in favor of keeping interest rates unchanged, although some have raised bets on a rate cut after weak economic data and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s revival of the specter of a no-deal Brexit scenario, both of which increase the pressure for monetary support.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar bounced from a one-week low on Thursday after the country's third quarter economic growth came in stronger than expected while greenback traders awaited a vote to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump.
In Britain, the pound remained under pressure on rekindled fears of a chaotic exit from the European Union. It was last at $1.3077 after sliding nearly 2% in as many days.
The kiwi climbed to $0.6589 from Wednesday's low of $0.6555 after New Zealand's annual gross domestic product accelerated 2.7% in the third quarter against expectations for a 2.4% gain.
Risk sensitive currencies such as the kiwi and its Australian counterpart started December on a firm footing led by the apparent removal of two main risks dominating global markets: a preliminary U.S.-China trade deal and the election victory of U.K. Prime Minister.
However, fears have resurfaced this week. Despite the Sino-U.S. trade agreement, the specter of a U.S.-led tariff war has not disappeared as traders await clarity on the deal.
The safe haven yen held in a tight range at 109.57 per dollar. It is mostly flat so far this month.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Tuesday that the United States may raise tariffs on European goods as it tries to shrink its chronic trade deficit with the continent, re-igniting worries of the prospects of the export-driven euro.
The euro (EUR) was last hovering around Wednesday's trough of $1.1109 against the dollar, shrugging off a better-than-expected survey of German business morale.
""The most significant piece of news overnight has been the German December IFO survey, which... has shown evidence that the German economy may be in the process of pulling itself up by its boot straps,"" said Ray Attrill, Sydney-based head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank.
""Improvement in the German – and broader Eurozone – economy – is fundamental to our expectation for a softer U.S. dollar and stronger Euro next year.""
A major headwind for the dollar was a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on whether to impeach Trump later in the day. The Senate is expected to vote in January.
Despite the political uncertainty, an index that tracks the dollar against six major currencies jumped to a six-day high of 97.475 (DXY).
Solid U.S. economic data in recent days have tamed expectations of any easing by the Federal Reserve in the near term, keeping the dollar stronger. Money markets are not pricing in a rate cut anytime soon.
The Australian dollar was a shade weaker at $0.6851 ahead of a monthly jobs report that could make or break expectations for another interest rate cut as early as February.
Markets will focus on interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan later in the day, with both seen unlikely to change policy."

That would leave little time to reach a trade deal with the European Union.
The USD/JPY was little changed at 109.43 against the U.S. dollar following the release of data that showed Japan’s export fell 7.9% in November from a year earlier, which is its 12th straight month of decline. Imports also fell 15.7%. 
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies inched up 0.1% to 96.873. Overnight, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan reiterated that interest rates will be kept on hold unless there is a huge change in the U.S. economic outlook.
“I’ve already got baked into my outlook, we’re going to have weak manufacturing next year, sluggish global growth, pretty sluggish business investment, but with a strong consumer,” Kaplan said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“I’d been worried that weak business investment and weak manufacturing would seep into other parts of the economy. We haven’t seen that yet,” he said.
“We’ve got a very tight jobs market, and there’s no evidence I see that the jobs market is doing anything but getting tighter. That’s a pretty good tailwind for the consumer,” he said. “So, unless something changes, that causes the employment picture to change, the consumer is going to be solid for next year.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose modestly on Tuesday, lifted by a dramatic slide in the pound after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson put a no-deal exit from the European Union back on the table. 
Britain on Tuesday set a hard deadline of December 2020 to reach a new trade deal with the EU, trying to pressure Brussels to move more quickly to seal an accord. Johnson will use his control of parliament to outlaw any extention of the Brexit transition period beyond 2020. It was his boldest move since winning a large majority in last Thursday's election, and it spooked financial markets.
The pound  had fallen 1.23% to $1.317 in North American trade, and was down 2.55% from Friday when it hit its highest since May 2018 in the wake of Johnson's electoral victory. 
""Sterling-negative Brexit uncertainty returned to the forefront,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. 
The euro rose against the pound (EURGBP=), last up 1.36% to trade at 0.847 pence, its strength bolstering it against the U.S. dollar as well (EUR=).
""The move appears to be the knee-jerk variety for the euro as Brexit uncertainty would only complicate Europe’s already challenging economic backdrop. A better test of euro sentiment arrives Wednesday with the final reading of euro zone inflation for November which is forecast to go unrevised at a low 1%, compared to the ECB’s near 2% bullseye,"" said Manimbo. 
The dollar index (DXY) was slightly higher, up 0.13% to 97.147, driven by the fall in the pound as well as a fall in the Australian dollar . 
The Aussie fell to a weekly low on Tuesday after the central bank opened the door to another cut in interest rates as early as February. The trade-linked currency also weakened as euphoria from the U.S.-China trade agreement faded. It was last down 0.51% at 0.685 U.S. dollars to the Aussie. 
The ""phase one"" trade deal between Washington and Beijing, announced on Friday after more than 2-1/2 years of volatile negotiations, will reduce U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for increased Chinese purchases of some U.S. goods.

Fitch ratings agency said the deal eased U.S.-China tensions but that renewed escalation remains a significant risk, with the issue of technology posing an obstacle to full resolution.

623,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 03:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pound slumped more than 1% after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to change the law to guarantee the Brexit transition phase isn’t extended beyond the end of next year, reviving the threat of a no-deal split.
Sterling dropped by the most since July as traders reacted to the news. Johnson’s planned legislation will include legal text to prevent the government from delaying the day Britain stops being subject to European Union laws, even if no new trade terms have been secured in time, an official said.
“The honeymoon of the election is now over and the risks of a potential hard Brexit have been brought forward,” said Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG Markets Ltd. in Melbourne. “Johnson is taking an assertive stance on Brexit and although a hard divorce may still be in the margins for now, there are increasing risk premiums priced into the pound.”
The pound was 1.1% weaker for the day at $1.3186 as of 8:26 a.m. in London. The currency had climbed to as high as $1.3514 on Friday as the Conservative Party swept to victory in the U.K. general election, fueling optimism there would be a speedy resolution to the Brexit deadlock.
EU leaders have warned it’s highly unlikely that negotiators will be able to complete the kind of deal Johnson wants, which he’s modeled on Canada’s agreement with the EU, in the 11 months between Brexit day Jan. 31 and the December deadline. This sets up a fresh cliff-edge for a no-deal split with the EU at the end of 2020.
“In practice it would erode all the positives of a large Tory majority and bring us back to previous position of pound uncertainty rising rather than falling next year,” wrote Elsa Lignos, global head of currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, in a research note. “If passed, it would mean further pound downside that should be apparent by January.”
Still, the U.K. currency has already recovered significant ground since the election result. A  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). index indicates that currency funds have almost completely unwound their bearish bets on sterling. Asset managers have also switched to a net long position position in the pound from a net short before the vote, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.
Currency strategists at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) see the biggest surge in the pound since 2017 as only the start of the rally. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plans to boost spending should give the economy a shot in the arm and help the pound to $1.45 by the fourth quarter of 2020, the strategists said in a note dated Thursday."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's black market peso fell almost 8% against the dollar on Monday after a senior official flagged the return of a so-called tourism tax on spending in dollars, a move to help prop up the local peso and help fill drained state coffers.
The peso was down 7.93% at 72.50 per U.S. dollar in the informal market, traders said, taking it around 20% away from the official spot rate , which has been held steady by strict capital controls imposed in September.
The move, alongside higher export taxes on farm products, underscores the policy shifts under the new administration of center-left Peronist Alberto Fernandez, who took office last week after beating out conservative Mauricio Macri.
Argentina's new Cabinet chief, Santiago Cafiero, said over the weekend a bill would be sent to Congress to hike taxes on goods and services purchased in U.S. dollars. He said on local radio that this could be as high as 30%, amending earlier comments that it would be around 20%.
The tourism tax, which will apply to all expenses incurred using credit card abroad, is spurring Argentines to stock up on dollars, already scarce due to tight limits imposed on official purchases of greenbacks.
""People who can buy (dollars) are buying them now to spend them later,"" one trader said.
The move would aim to stabilize the peso by stemming outflows of the currency that has lost more than 80% of its value over the past four years under former president Macri. The weak peso has in turn fanned high levels of inflation.
It is not clear when the new tax, which could hit Argentines traveling abroad as well as those buying overseas services, would come into effect, though Congress is expected to hold a series of extraordinary sessions to debate plans to revive the economy this month.
Argentina, in recession for much of the latter period of Macri's government, needs to revive growth in order to service a mounting pile of debt payments, including to the International Monetary Fund, in order to avoid a damaging default.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar hovered below four-month highs touched last week in early Monday trade as investors pored over the U.S.-China trade deal, while sterling stayed strong after a decisive UK general election.
Washington and Beijing cooled their trade war last week, reducing some U.S. tariffs in exchange for what U.S. officials said would be a big jump in Chinese purchases of American farm products and other goods.
The last-minute agreement that averted additional tariffs on Chinese goods totaling $160 billion had lifted the yuan and the Australian dollar and had pushed down the safe-haven yen and the dollar last week, before profit-taking set in.
""It is not that markets are unhappy with the agreement but we will inevitably see some position adjustments as we approach the year-end holiday period,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The offshore yuan traded at 7.0026 yuan per dollar , slipping back from a four-month high of 6.9247 per dollar hit last week.
The trade-sensitive Australian dollar fetched $0.6876 , easing from Friday's four-month high of $0.6930
The euro stood at $1.1126 (EUR=), up 0.05% so far in Asia, off four-month peak of $1.1200 set in Asian trade on Friday.
The dollar traded at 109.40 yen , having risen to 109.71 yen on Friday.
Some analysts also noted investors may need to read the fine print of the deal, which has yet to be officially signed.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday the deal will nearly double U.S. exports to China over the next two years and is ""totally done"" despite the need for translation and revisions to its text. A date for senior U.S. and Chinese officials to formally sign the agreement is still being determined, he added.
""We have seen over time more reports about the differences between what U.S. said and what China said about the agreement,"" said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of fixed income research at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities in Tokyo. ""The U.S. talks about the size of U.S. farm products China will buy but China stayed mum.""
Many traders were also skeptical whether there will be any another deal after the latest one, which the Trump administration has called ""phase one"", given the fundamental differences over key issues such as intellectual property rights.
Elsewhere, sterling gained 0.2% in early Asian trade on Monday to $1.3353 .
It has risen to $1.3516 on Friday, a high last seen in May last year, after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a commanding election victory last week, enabling him to end three years of deadlock over Brexit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound rose to a three-and-a-half year high versus the euro and the highest in more than a year versus the dollar after exit polls suggested a win for the Conservatives, which should help ensure the UK's smooth exit from the European Union.
The Chinese yuan rose in offshore trade and the Japanese yen fell after a source told Reuters that the United States and China have agreed some tariff reductions and a delay on tariffs set to go effect on Dec. 15.
The early results suggest the election will relieve almost four years of uncertainty about when Brexit would take place, which should be supportive of the pound.
A successful scaling back of trade tension would relieve one major headwind to economic growth, which suggests lower demand for the safe-haven yen. Avoiding new tariffs should also be a boost to China's slowing economy, which should draw more investors to the yuan.
""We've already seen a strong reaction in the pound from the exit poll,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""We also see a rise in stock futures in reaction to two very important pieces of news for markets. This should support global growth. The yuan can also go higher, but it depends on how much dollar strength we get.""
Against the euro, sterling (EURGBP=D3) rose around 2% to as high as 82.80 pence, the highest since July 2016, which is shortly after the Brexit referendum that hammered the currency.
The pound surged by 2.2% to $1.3474, reaching the highest since May 2018.
The pound plunged more than 10% in the immediate aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, while $2 trillion was wiped off world markets.
The exit poll, which suggested UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would get a majority of 86 - the largest of any Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher won in the 1980s - should empower him to deliver Brexit on Jan. 31.
Official results will be declared over the next seven hours.
Even if Brexit is completed on Jan. 31, there is still some uncertainty because Britain will then enter a transition period during which it will negotiate a new relationship with the remaining 27 EU states.
In the offshore market, the Chinese yuan rose 0.33% to 6.9273 per dollar, after surging on Thursday to the highest since Aug. 1 due to relief about a resolution to trade friction.
As part of the trade deal, China has also agreed to purchase $50 billion of U.S. agricultural goods next year, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The yuan rallied and the yen fell late on Thursday after Bloomberg News reported that U.S. President Donald Trump signed off on a trade deal with China that will delay a new round of tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15.
A trade dispute between the United States and China over Chinese trading practices that Washington says are unfair has dragged on for almost two years, making the stand off the biggest risk to the global economy.
Against the dollar, the yen fell to 109.595, the weakest since Dec. 2.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies fell 0.35% to 96.736, approaching the lowest since July this year.

631,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>",,,,,,"Investing.com - The British pound jumped as the U.K. general election exit poll showed Thursday the ruling Conservative party running away with a big majority in parliament.

GBP/USD surged more than 2.2% shortly after the polls came out.

The Conservatives are predicted to win 368 seats, with opposition Labour taking 191 seats, the Scottish National Party with 55 seats and the Liberal Democrats winning 13 seats.
That would be the highest number of Tory seats since 1987 and the lowest number of Labour seats since 1935.
"
632,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 01:24PM ET</span>",,,,,,"Investing.com – The pound retreated further on Thursday on fears the ruling Conservative party is set to secure a narrower parliamentary majority than expected after the latest polls showed its lead had shrunk ahead of election results due later.
The YouGov MRP constituency-by-constituency poll predicts the Tories would win 339 seats, giving the governing party a majority of 28. That was well below the 68-seat majority the same YouGov MRP poll predicted that Johnson would end up with only two weeks ago.
GBP/USD fell 0.8% to $1.3085 at 1:14 p.m. ET (18:15 GMT).
A conservative victory would boost hopes of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson getting his Brexit deal approved, ending a long-standing deadlock in Parliament and likely leading to a ramp-up in business investment, which has come under pressure amid Brexit uncertainty.
Johnson has pledged to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union.
Gains in the pound, however, will be determined by the size of the parliamentary majority the Conservative party is able to secure.
""The immediate price action in sterling will obviously be driven by the election outcome, but the magnitude of the majority will also be important,"" said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.
An unlikely majority for Labour, however, would see the U.K. head toward another referendum that could ultimately reverse the decision to leave the European Union.
An exit poll on the election is expected a little after voting closes at 5 PM ET (22:00 GMT), with the final results expected in early hours Friday.
Thursday's decline n the pound was also exacerbated by sharp upturn in the dollar on easing fears that the U.S. and China are heading for another collision on trade after President Donald Trump tweeted that a deal with China is ""very close.""
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.4% to 97.48. 
Gains in the dollar, however, were kept in check by data showing wholesale inflation slowed last month.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its producer price index for final demand was flat last month, below economists' forecasts for a 0.2% rise. In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 1.1%, undershooting forecasts of 1.2%. 
EUR/USD, meanwhile, fell 0.12% to $1.115 as traders digested comments from European Central Bank Governor Christine Lagarde following an unchanged decision on monetary policy from the central bank.
USD/JPY rose 0.61% to Y109.20 and USD/CAD rose 0.07% to C$1.3178."
633,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Christine Lagarde started her first press conference as president of the European Central Bank by warning that she was different from her predecessor, Mario Draghi. It took reporters just a few minutes to realize that she was indeed.
Lagarde is ushering in an era of democratic central banking at the ECB, or so she wants you to believe. But questions remain about whether she’ll stray too far into politics or if she’ll be able to effectively steward a divided and riotous governing council.
For years, the ECB has been led in a deeply technocratic manner, as Draghi maintained a rigid focus on the narrow message he wanted to send. Lagarde on Thursday was much more colorful in her metaphors: She called herself “neither a dove, nor a hawk, but an owl”; referred to an upcoming strategy review as “a house we will build stone by stone”; and justified the need for a better policy mix in the euro area by saying “it takes many to dance the economic ballet that delivers on price stability and growth.” For better or worse, it was hard to imagine Draghi using that kind of language.
Lagarde is also keen to show that the ECB will be more open to the voices of all the national central banks and to the general public than in the past. She pledged to “include members of the governing council and seek their view” before making a decision, something Draghi was accused of not doing enough of. And she made clear that the strategic review — which will start in January, and is expected to “turn each and every stone” — will be open not just to the “usual suspects” but to civil society. In the ivory tower of central banking, this is a small revolution.
As Lagarde has acknowledged, there will be a tension between communicating rigorously and talking to a broader public. She asked reporters not to over-interpret her messages when she talks to people who lack technical expertise. But will this really be possible? She’s the president of the ECB, after all, and investors will be listening for hints of the central bank’s next moves every time she speaks. There’s a risk that she could create confusion, or even that market players could stop paying so much attention to her.
There’s also the question of what kind of relationship she’ll build with politicians and the public. It’s all well and good to say that she doesn’t want the ECB to “preach the Gospel but listen.” Yet politicians could interpret this message as an open invitation to meddle with central bank independence — something Lagarde considers “critically important.” The new president is adamant that the ECB should “take up the fight” against climate change, for instance; that position would put the bank squarely into the political arena, and expose it to the attacks of those who fear it has exceeded its mandate.
Finally, will the new age of democratic central banking produce effective policies? Lagarde did an impressive job on Thursday in sticking to the path the ECB had set in September. She said clearly that she wouldn’t reopen those decisions, including the controversial step of restarting asset purchases. She also made clear that she doesn’t see negative interest rates as a problem at their current level, emphasizing how lending is increasing. And she stressed that the ECB’s monetary-policy stance should be seen as a package, with different instruments acting on slightly different objectives.
Disagreements are still inevitable, however, and the question is whether this consensus-seeking president will be able to make her own voice heard, as her predecessor famously did. Lagarde is aware of the challenge: She said she knows that the strategic review will lead to controversies, but added that once a decision has been made, it should stand. As the divisions at the end of Draghi’s era show, though, keeping everyone on board can be a painful and occasionally hopeless pursuit.
With Lagarde, the era of omniscient central bankers appears to be over. “When I will not know, I will tell you that I don’t know,” she told reporters. The new president wants to be seen as a woman of the people. The euro area will soon find out exactly what that means."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar nursed its steepest losses in weeks on Thursday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve's benign inflation outlook hosed down expectations for a rate hike any time soon, pushing Treasury yields lower.
Investors also remained on edge as Sunday's deadline for the next round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods looms, and ahead of a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting and the UK election later on Thursday.
The greenback hit its lowest in more than a month against the euro (EUR=) after the Fed meeting, and sat just above that level at $1.1133 in early Asian trade. Against a basket of currencies (DXY) the dollar recovered somewhat from an overnight four-month low, but remained subdued at 97.413.
The yen crept higher to 108.47 per dollar.
The biggest winners were the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which soared as shorts scrambled to exit their positions. Traders said some had bet on a more hawkish Fed outlook.

638,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- The last time Turkey’s lira was so out of step with other emerging-market currencies, Recep Tayyip Erdogan had just come out of prison and was trying to gain a foothold in national politics.
That was 1999. After two decades of the kind of fast-paced growth typical of developing nations, the risks from President Erdogan’s stewardship have set the currency on a divergent path to its peers. Issues including central-bank independence and potential U.S. sanctions are eclipsing global themes such as Federal Reserve policy that dictate the route for other emerging markets.
“Domestic and international factors suggest this divergence between average emerging-market performance and the specific performance of the lira will continue,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets at TD Securities in London. “Perhaps one of these factors can be overlooked. But when you have many such factors together, lasting for a long time, then it weakens the general understanding of Turkey as a fairly resilient economy.”
The 30-day rolling correlation between the lira and the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index is the most negative in 20 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s not all: while the correlation shows the frequency with which the two assets move in the same direction is declining, the magnitude of shared moves is also changing.
The Turkish currency is showing a beta of minus 0.173 with the MSCI gauge this quarter, compared with 1.05 over the past 10 years. That means a one-percent gain in the index results in a slight loss for the lira. In the past decade, both moved in lockstep.
Unique Risk
Stress in the Turkish economy built up between 2016 and 2018 when the central bank was seen as too slow to raise interest rates given a deepening of the current-account deficit. The demand for dollar funding from the government, companies and citizens added to the stress on the lira.
According to Maggio at TD Securities, the proliferation of political tension -- from geopolitical skirmishes in the region to a controversial purchase of Russian missiles -- sets Turkey apart as a unique risk in emerging markets, justifying the negative correlation.
The concerns driving other developing currencies are more global. The U.S.-China trade war has undermined growth and contributed to persistent strength in the U.S. currency. Central banks are reaching the limits of accommodation as interest-rate cuts prove ineffective in reviving growth.
Another factor that has helped separate the lira from the rest of the EM herd is its recent period of unusual calm.
After the last bouts of turbulence, authorities took steps such as tightening liquidity in offshore money markets to curb the currency’s swings. The result is that the lira has traded in a narrow range since June, despite 1,000 basis points of cuts in the benchmark interest rates, the ouster of a central-bank governor and a military incursion into northern Syria that worsened Turkey’s relationship with the U.S.
The MSCI EM currency gauge has risen 1.3% this year, while the lira has declined 9%.

Economic uncertainty stemming from the U.S.-China trade war has prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times this year. It is almost unanimously expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday.
Fed Policymakers' updated projections for the U.S. economy and interest rates will be the main focus to assess whether they think the rate cuts so far are enough to keep the economy rolling for another year.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar and yen held the safe-haven high ground on Tuesday, with investors on edge ahead of a looming tariff deadline, the UK election and upcoming central bank meetings in Europe and the United States.
Front of mind is whether Washington will go ahead with a fresh round of tariffs on Sunday, or whether a deal with China can be reached before then.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that the Dec. 15 deadline is still in place, but Bloomberg reported Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue saying the tariffs are unlikely to take effect.
""There's risks both ways,"" said Westpac FX analyst Imre Speizer.
""Trade's still the flip-floppy factor, but I think markets are still reasonably upbeat about risk-seeking. All these little movements are only smoke and noise and don't really tell you what's going on. Cautiously positive would be the overall mood.""
Against the Japanese yen and the euro (EUR=) the greenback found support after last week's declines, steadying at 108.56 yen and $1.1064 per euro. Against a basket of currencies, (DXY) the dollar last traded at 97.644.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were marginally stronger at $0.6824 and $0.6548 , respectively.
The U.S. dollar's recovery after weakness last week has been supported by a surge in hiring in November.
That has investors almost certain that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold rates steady on Wednesday, which has increased investors' focus on finding a trade-war truce.
China said on Monday it hoped to make a trade deal with the United States as soon as possible, though gave no new details or insight into talks' progress.
""Market risk is becoming binary,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. ""A deal could see further pro-growth trading, new tariffs could see sentiment collapse in a heap.""
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank is likewise expected to keep interest rates steady, while the pound's fate is in the hands of voters at Thursday's British election.
Sterling sat at $1.3144, just below a seven-month high hit last week, as polls pointed to a Conservative victory decisive enough to secure a parliamentary majority.
A YouGov poll due at 2200 GMT will offer the latest guide.
""If the UK bookies' prices are a reasonable guide to market expectations for Thursday's election, it is hard to see much more upside for GBP on the outcome,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""Despite the confidence with which markets predict a Conservative victory, there are still several major uncertainties,"" he added, pointing to unpredictable turnout and polling showing a sizeable chunk of undecided voters."

Latin America’s most-traded currency rose 0.4% to a three-week high of 19.23 to the dollar after President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the trade pact can be approved soon and people familiar with the negotiations said the Trump administration and House Democrats are on the verge of announcing a handshake deal. It has key support from AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, the Washington Post said.
“A ratification of the USMCA in the United States can allow an appreciation of the Mexican peso to levels between 19.00 and 19.10 per dollar,” said Jesus Lopez, a strategist at Banco Base in Monterrey. The peso hasn’t reached 19 since July, and a gain to that level would represent a 1.2% increase.
The USMCA deal, which was negotiated under President Donald Trump, had run into opposition in the U.S. over Democrats’ demands for stronger labor protection. In Mexico, the Senate is ready to approve the needed changes, according to majority leader Ricardo Monreal.
“Union leadership has been the main obstacle to passage on the U.S. side,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, a strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) in New York, who says an agreement is largely priced in already. “Trumka sounding a more positive tone suggests that the sides are indeed very close at this point.”"

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the green against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.04% to 97.62.
Ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline – when the U.S. is slated to impose tariffs on another $156 billion on Chinese goods -- China said that it hoped to make a trade deal as soon as possible.
The phase one trade deal has been held back as both the U.S. and China have been unwilling to give into each others' demands.
Beijing wants Washington to agree to roll back the previously imposed tariffs on China goods. Washington has demanded that China agreed to purchase a specific minimum amount of U.S. agricultural goods.
Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said on Friday that a deal was ""close,"" but also urged President Donald Trump to walk away if China did not meet certain conditions.
The rise in the pound also weighed on the dollar as polls over the weekend continued to signal that the Conservative party, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, would likely win a majority of the seats in the General Election.
Britain Elects' poll tracker showed a gap of 11.9 points, 42.9% against 33%, up 0.5 in favor of the Tories.

The pound strengthened Monday to a fresh two-and-a-half year high against the euro, as weekend opinion polls continued to point to a win for the ruling Conservatives in this week’s general election.
The currency also rose against the dollar after polls in Britain’s Sunday newspapers all putting Boris Johnson’s party in the lead. Though the gap between the parties has narrowed throughout the campaign, it is not enough to keep the Conservatives from returning to power this week. The weekend surveys spurred buying by European investors, according to traders.
“The pound is rallying again after markets all but fully discount a good Tory majority,” wrote Elsa Lignos, global head of currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, in a research note. “Friday will show whether that was a good strategy or not.”
As well as gaining 0.3% to 83.93 pence per euro, it also added as much as 0.3% against the dollar to $1.3181 Monday. The pound has strengthened 3% against the U.S. currency over the past month, as investors grow increasingly confident of a win for Johnson in the December vote. Still, the cost of hedging against a fall in the pound has also surged as the election looms, showing lingering caution following the failure of most opinion polls to accurately predict prior votes such as the 2016 Brexit referendum.
The spot rate for the pound-dollar pair continues to diverge with options, as two-week risk reversals show increased demand to hedge an unexpected outcome from Thursday’s voting. A Bloomberg survey last month found the pound would fall to $1.27 on a Labour-led coalition outcome, a more than 3% drop from current levels.
Positioning on the currency also remains mixed, with leveraged funds slashing short positions to the lowest since May while asset managers have turned more bearish on the currency, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
“The scope for surprise at this week’s general election is sizeable,” wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists including Alain Durre in a research note. “The share of voters that are still undecided- so late in the campaign- means that even a small swing in that slice of the electorate would lead to a hung parliament.”"

The euro touched a low of 0.8406 against sterling by 04:03 AM ET (09:03 GMT), the weakest level since May 2017.
The pound was boosted as fears over the prospect of a hung parliament receded after an opinion poll on Monday showed that the Conservative Party extended its lead over the Labor Party to 14 percentage points, up from 9 percentage points a week ago.

Demand for the dollar was underpinned on Monday after Friday’s blockbuster jobs report, but the currency struggled to make headway amid worries about an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
The U.S. dollar index edged down to 97.59 after rising 0.3% on Friday. The euro traded at 1.1065 after hitting a one-week low of 1.1039 on Friday.

U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain in 10 months, while the unemployment rate ticked back down to 3.5%, its lowest level in nearly half a century.
Those figures suggested the Trump administration's 17-month trade war with China, which has plunged manufacturing into recession, has not yet spilled over to the broader U.S. economy.
Still, investors think that could change if trade tensions escalate further, especially if Trump goes ahead with planned tariffs on some $156 billion worth of products from China from Dec. 15.
The market has been largely working on the assumption that those tariffs, which cover several consumer products such as cellphones and toys, will be dropped or at least postponed, given that Washington and Beijing agreed in October to work on a trade deal.
""Markets are sensing that both sides want to avoid a collapse of their negotiation, judging from various news headlines,"" said Kazushige Kaida, chief of forex at State Street. ""So the main scenario is for the dollar/yen to test mid-109 yen levels.""
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow confirmed on Friday that the Dec. 15 deadline to impose the new tariffs remains in place, but added that Trump likes where trade talks with China are going.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Monday after data showed surprise strength in the U.S. jobs market, but the currency was restrained from moving higher by worries about an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
The dollar index (=USD) stood almost flat at 97.706 in mid-Asian trade, after rising 0.3% on Friday. The euro traded at $1.10575 (EUR=), after hitting a one-week low of $1.10395 on Friday.
The dollar changed hands at 108.58 yen . It had lifted to 108.92 yen on the U.S. jobs data before losing momentum.

Markets will also be watching for headlines from U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war ahead of the looming Dec. 15 deadline for a fresh tranche of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.
The U.S. dollar rose on Friday, snapping five straight days of losses, as data showing the U.S. economy created far more jobs than forecast in November underlined expectations for the Fed to hold steady after cutting rates three times this year.
“We suspect the large majority of the (Federal Open Market) Committee will be comfortable projecting no change for policy rates in the year ahead,” Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a research note.
Gains in the dollar remained modest despite the robust jobs number, however. The greenback had been pummeled earlier in the week due to a slew of dismal figures on private payrolls, services, manufacturing, and construction spending, all of which indicated that the economy is slowing.
Friday’s jobs report provided a respite from all the pessimism and from the continuing uncertainty over the status of U.S.-China trade negotiations.
The dollar still posted its worst weekly percentage loss in more than a month despite Friday’s gains.
“No question today’s jobs report is strong but is it strong enough for people to change their views about the economy?” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.

651,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The next week could set the tone for the $6.6 trillion-a-day currency market in 2020.
The geopolitical risks that have shaped foreign exchange this year -- Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war -- are approaching a critical point, according to  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA. The U.K. will vote for a government on Thursday to negotiate the next phase of Brexit, while Washington will impose further tariffs on Beijing on Dec. 15 unless a phase-one deal is reached before then.
It’s also looking busy on the central bank front, with the Federal Reserve, Swiss National Bank and the European Central Bank all set to deliver their latest monetary policy decisions. With the ECB expected to signal a more balanced policy outlook, strategists are betting on the euro to rally in 2020. On the other hand, the Fed may acknowledge the persistence of geopolitical risks, weighing on the dollar.
“The ‘good’ outcome would encompass a U.S.-China trade deal that includes a rollback of any planned and, potentially, some existing tariffs,” wrote Credit Agricole strategists including head of Group-of-10 currency strategy Valentin Marinov in a research note. “In addition, we would have a victory and a parliamentary majority for the Conservative party. We see the dollar and pound as well as G-10 risk-correlated and commodity currencies as the biggest winners under this outcome.”
For Investec Asset Management, it’s a good time to bet on riskier assets while buying haven currency the yen. Portfolio manager Russell Silberston is positive on the outlook as the scenario of a Conservative majority and clarity over trade “does not seem that unlikely.”
This year has seen the dollar continue its dominance in global markets by outperforming many of its G-10 peers, flouting calls by major banks for a downtrend in 2019. Meanwhile, the U.K. currency has had a tumultuous ride. The pound fell to an almost three-year low in September before recovering almost 10% after Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured a Brexit deal and called a snap election in the hope of securing a majority and exiting the European Union next month.
The polls into the vote have consistently showed a Conservative majority but investors remain wary of previous polling failures, and the party’s lead has narrowed as the vote draws closer. The market prefers the Conservatives to Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, with its pledges to nationalize industries, tax the wealthy and overhaul the economy.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was prepared to wait for another year to reach a deal with China.
The uncertainty involved in predicting geopolitics mean “a bad and an ugly outcome are also possible,” according to Credit Agricole. The former would involve a Conservative majority but no U.S.-China trade deal plus fresh tariffs on China, benefiting the pound and funding currencies.
The ugly outcome “would represent the sum of all market fears at present -- a hung Parliament in the U.K. and further escalation of the trade war.” In this scenario, the yen, gold and the franc would be the biggest beneficiaries.
For Investec’s Silberston, things could get even more ugly if the U.K. election failed to return a decisive majority and trade tensions flared. He sees the potential for global slowdown fears to return to the market if everything goes badly. Bond markets surged in 2019 on fears of a global recession.
“Tariff imposition and another hung Parliament are the two big worst-case scenarios as these will combine to raise the twin fears that were haunting markets earlier this year,” he said. “More uncertainty spilling over from the manufacturing sector into services, and triggering a recession.”"

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar nursed a week of losses on Friday, hit by nervousness on trade and mixed signals about the U.S. economy, while the British pound stood tall as bets firmed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson can win a commanding electoral victory.
The safe havens of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc were in demand as a hedge against Sino-U.S. trade talks collapsing, and as investors fretted that U.S. jobs figures due later in the day may fail to deliver an expected rebound.
""Markets are in a highly fragile condition at the moment,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""So there is a greater potential for an exaggerated move if we see a big divergence from expectations on non-farm payrolls - but the risk is in both directions, particularly with the lack of trade news.""

Against a basket of currencies (DXY) the dollar has dropped every day this week for a cumulative loss of almost 1%.
The best gains have been won by the soaring kiwi and British pound. The kiwi sat just below a four-month high touched on Thursday at $0.6541, having gained 1.8% this week as expectations for deep monetary easing have ebbed.
Sterling climbed to a 2-1/2 year high of 84.28 pence against the euro (EURGBP=) overnight - holding near there on Friday - and has advanced 1.7% against the dollar this week, last trading at $1.3158 .
Opinion polls suggest the ruling Conservatives will win an outright majority in the Dec. 12 election, removing some of the uncertainty around Britain's exit from the European Union that has weighed on the currency for years. Cable has rallied 10% since September lows.
""There's still a bit of nervousness about being too convinced,"" said Jim Leaviss, head of fixed income at fund manager M&G Investments. ""But nevertheless cable seems to think that we do get a clear majority for Boris Johnson,"" he said.
""That means that we leave the EU on the 31st of January...I think the options market was pricing in another 7% upside on a Conservative victory, and I think that's justified fundamentally.""
On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump remained upbeat overnight and said talks are ""moving right along"".
Worries stem from a lack of similar enthusiasm from the Chinese side, after Chinese officials reiterated their stance that some U.S. tariffs must be rolled back for a deal.
The focus on U.S. non-farm payrolls, due at 1330 GMT, comes after dismal data through the week that showed weak private payrolls, soft services activity and a shrinking manufacturing sector.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts have nudged up their forecasts for the Australian dollar as the currency proves resilient to global trade uncertainty and poor economic news at home, though the risk of radical policy easing looms for next year.
Analysts polled by Reuters see the Aussie at $0.6800 in one and three months, up a cent from last month's poll and in line with its current $0.6830 reading.
The currency was then seen rising to $0.6900 in six months and $0.7000 on a one-year horizon, again a cent higher than in November.
This time last year, the call was for the Aussie to end 2019 at $0.7500, a seven cent miss due largely to the endless Sino-U.S. trade dispute and three rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
The outlook for rates remains a big unknown for next year with markets wagering it will cut at least once more to 0.5% and even take the plunge into quantitative easing by buying government debt.
A run of recent data showed the economy disappointed in the third quarter and looks little better for this quarter, putting the RBA in a bind.
""We now expect a rate cut to 0.5% in February and a further cut to 0.25% in August,"" said Stephen Halmarick, head of global markets research at CBA. ""Those cuts and a small risk of QE in late 2020 will limit the Aussie's upside.""
However, he also noted there had been a structural improvement in Australia's external balances as it ran current account surpluses in both the second and third quarters, the first since 1975.
""That provides valuation support for the Aussie,"" said Halmarick, tipping the currency to reach $0.7000 by end of 2020.
Forecasts for the New Zealand dollar also edged higher, with the currency seen at $0.6400 in three months and $0.6430 on a six-month horizon - both up from $0.6300 in the previous poll.
It was seen at $0.6550 in one year, compared to $0.6500 back in November. The currency was way ahead of analysts, however, having rallied sharply this week to reach $0.6542.
The kiwi has benefited from a marked improvement in recent economic data at home, a divergence that has seen it jump on the Australian dollar.
It also got a fillip when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) announced bank capital requirements that were less harsh than many feared, removing one source of risk.
That was meaningful enough for ANZ to change its New Zealand rate forecast to only one cut next year instead of two.
""Contributing to our change of call is the fact that a new tailwind is on the way, with the Government signaling that a 'significant' increase in infrastructure spending will be announced on Dec. 11,"" wrote analysts at ANZ.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar will add to this year's gains over the coming 12 months as a potential easing of global economic risk reduces pressure on the Bank of Canada to provide support for Canada's commodity-linked economy, a Reuters poll showed.
The poll of nearly 40 currency analysts showed they expect the loonie to strengthen 1.5% to 1.30 per U.S. dollar, or 76.92 U.S. cents, in one year, from about 1.32 on Thursday. That matches the projection in November's poll.
""We are seeing global growth headwinds start to subside,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of FX strategy at TD Securities.
If that were to transition into a better outlook for the global economy then ""that environment would pull the Canadian dollar along"", McCormick said.
Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so its economy could benefit from a pickup in global growth.
Developments that could spur an improved outlook include greater clarity around Brexit and calming of the trade war between the United States and China, strategists said.
""We assume a narrow (U.S.-China) trade deal in 2020 prior to the federal election in the U.S.,"" said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada. ""That will prompt a risk rally impacting crude markets, a marginal weakening of the U.S. dollar and a reduction in the external headwinds that face the Bank of Canada's current outlook on the economy.""
On Wednesday, Canada's central bank said trade conflicts remained the biggest source of risk to the outlook but cited signs of global economic stabilization as it left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.75%.
The bank has stayed on hold this year even as many of its global peers, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have eased. Its relatively hawkish stance has helped support the Canadian dollar, which has been the top-performing G10 currency this year with a gain of more than 3% against the greenback.
Last week, a slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll expected Canada's central bank to leave interest rates on hold through to the end of next year. [CA/POLL]
Over the same period, money markets see about a 50% chance the central bank would cut rates. In September, the market was bracing for as many as three rate cuts.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Central Europe's main currencies will struggle to appreciate in the next year, with the Hungarian forint seen sticking near record lows and only the Czech crown expected to eke out small gains, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Slowing growth is a large factor taking the shine off the region's currencies, which have already been battered much of the year by rising global risks like a hotter trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as Britain's still unclear departure from the European Union.
While Central European economies have held up well so far, they are starting to show the effects of a slowdown in western trading partners, notably Europe's main engine Germany.
Hungary's forint (EURHUF=) has also been hurt by the central bank's loose monetary policy stance as its interest rates are the lowest in the region.
The currency has lost over 3% since the start of the year and hit a record low to the euro in November.
Most analysts in a Reuters poll predicted the forint would cling to these levels over the next 12 months, avoiding the same depreciation trend seen this year.
The median poll forecast showed the currency losing around 1.1% from Wednesday's level to trade around 335 to the euro over the next 12 months.
""The currency which we are underweight on is the Hungarian forint...largely because we think the monetary policy is too loose for the deteriorating current account dynamics,"" ING chief FX strategist Petr Krpata said.
For a graphic on Hungarian forint, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9508/9420/Forint.png
Romania's leu (EURRON=) was also forecast to drop 1.5% to 4.85 per euro due to concerns over deficits in the country.
The Polish zloty (EURPLN=), the region's most liquid currency, was seen nudging 0.5% lower to 4.30 to the euro, unchanged from the 12-month outlook in a poll a month ago.
Caution is still seen around the fate of Swiss franc mortgage loans and their impact on the banking sector.
The zloty weakened last week after a Polish Supreme Court verdict that investors fear raises the risk that Swiss franc mortgage loans will be converted into the local currency on terms unfavorable to banks.
""Macro data continue to point to a weakening of activity,"" Raiffeisen Bank wrote in a Dec. 3 FX outlook report.
""Another set of news regarding the CHF mortgage issue increased concerns about the negative impact on the banking sector... Given all of the above, EUR/PLN is likely to fluctuate above 4.30 in the near term.""
For a graphic on Polish zloty, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9509/9421/Zloty.png
Natixis strategist Nordine Naam said the current economic backdrop was negative short term but that slow recovery in growth starting next year could also boost currencies later.
Analysts also said the Czech crown still stood out. It was forecast, though, to gain 0.5% to 25.43 per euro in the next 12 months.
The Czech central bank remains one of the few in Europe still debating whether interest rates should rise further to battle inflationary pressures.
""Given the carry advantage, being short euro-long crown should give positive returns,"" said Krpata of ING, which has made the crown its top pick in the region.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Emerging market currency gains will probably be dominated by high-yielding currencies rather than low-risk bets next year as economic growth finally recovers in response to lower interest rates, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.
Three-quarters of 40 strategists and analysts polled by Reuters said next year would be dominated by high yielding emerging market currencies.
ING Financial Markets wrote that while it sees a modest slowdown in Chinese growth, it expects recoveries in the likes of Brazil, Russia, Mexico, India and several other Asian countries, meaning the growth outlook favors emerging versus developed market currencies.
The Brazilian real is expected to be one of the notable gainers in emerging markets against the dollar, firming to 3.97/$.
In a difficult year so far for emerging market investors, currency markets looked to safer bets in general, shunning high-risk-reward pairs such as the South African rand against a very strong dollar.
The high-yielding rand might not even be part of that theme next year as official data this week confirmed the economy contracted 0.6% last quarter, raising concerns that a recession is currently in play.
But the currency will likely remain fairly resilient in the face of many challenges, slipping 3% to 15 per dollar in three months and then stay there.
""After all, some of these large emerging market monetary easing cycles and big currency declines should be providing some support,"" the ING note added.
South Africa's Reserve Bank is probably one of the few major emerging market central banks that, unlike peers such as Mexico and India, has not taken part in easing rates this year.
LOW VOLATILITY
Citi analysts wrote that notwithstanding the Central Bank of Turkey's cumulative easing of 1,000 basis points since July, the lira has been holding up relatively well.
""To be sure, the strong current account adjustment —underpinned by the unprecedented import compression — and the Fed's dovish pivot have played an important role in supporting the currency,"" wrote analysts at Citi.
However, the Reuters poll suggests the lira - which was considered very cheap earlier this year - will be tested next year, to the tune of about 10% losses to 6.34 per dollar.
Low volatility is expected to be part of next year's theme that supports ""carry trades"" as investors currently do not expect another reduction in U.S. rates until at least the middle of 2020, probably pushing out any possibility of hikes capable of sending markets into a frenzy.
""Carry trades"" comprise a strategy where investors benefit from holding a higher-yielding currency borrowed in a lower-yielding one.
In Latin America, an outburst of protests is adding pressure on the central banks of the region's two main economies, Brazil and Mexico, to keep easing in order to accelerate tepid growth and avoid an ugly social outcome as in Chile, Ecuador and, to a lesser degree, Colombia. Both currencies are entering the new year on the defensive, on worries about the effectiveness of reforms and outstanding trade issues with the United States.
Still, Mexico's peso fared better than other major Latin American currencies this year, helped by recent positive developments on the U.S.-China issue.
""Local monetary policy should also be supportive of peso behavior, as the easing bias of Banxico is likely to remain cautious, with rate cuts of 25 basis points more likely than the 50bp cuts advocated by a minority of Board members,"" wrote Citi."

Negotiators may be closers to an agreement on tariff relief that could help stave off the next round of US tariffs on Chinese goods that is due to take effect Dec. 15, Bloomberg reported. These tariff relief measures would be part of a phase one deal. 
Trump’s comments came just a day after saying he has no deadline for a deal and would not be opposed to waiting until after the elections in November 2020.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar and export-oriented currencies found support on Thursday as upbeat trade comments from U.S. President Donald Trump cheered the market, while New Zealand's softer-than-expected banking reforms pushed the kiwi to a four-month high.
The flight to safety seen on Wednesday reversed after Trump said trade talks with China were going ""very well,"" a day after floating the idea that a deal might have to wait until after the 2020 presidential election.
Bloomberg also reported that the two sides are moving closer to an agreement, citing people familiar with the talks.
That took the shine off the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc, which nursed losses on Thursday.
""Another day, another reversal of what happened the previous day,"" said National Australia Bank's head FX strategist, Ray Attrill.
""I thought the markets had stopped playing headline ping- pong on trade, but evidently not.""
Despite the swing, prevailing caution about high level comments on trade kept market moves modest. The U.S. dollar held overnight gains against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc to sit at 108.79 yen and 0.9877 francs . It was steady on the euro at $1.1082 (EUR=).
Against a basket of currencies (DXY) the greenback held at 97.588.
The British pound crossed the $1.31 mark for the first time since May overnight as expectations that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would win a majority at next week's election firmed.
Sterling last traded at $1.3108. The Australian dollar slipped 0.2% to $0.6838 after softer-than-expected retail sales data.
The standout was the kiwi , which rose 0.4% to $0.6555, its highest since August, and has put on more than a cent this week as business sentiment there has rebounded and expectations for monetary loosening have fallen.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted bank capital requirements, but not as much as some investors had feared, and with a long lead time, reducing expectations that monetary easing might be needed to offset the hike's tightening effects.
Against the Aussie, the kiwi has gained more than 3% in a month to stand at a four-month high of NZ$1.0457 per A$1 (AUDNZD=).
The long, seven-year phase-in and modest scale of hiked bank capital rules were seen having a softer impact on lending and growth than expected, reducing the likelihood of deeper monetary easing.
The country's biggest lender, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, trimmed its expectations for cuts to the country's Official Cash Rate (OCR) next year from two reductions to one after the capital requirements were announced.
""A softening in the proposals, combined with a more positive domestic outlook...mean we are changing our OCR call to only one further 25bp OCR cut, in May next year, taking the OCR to 0.75%,"" ANZ analysts said in an emailed note.
The Canadian dollar hit a one-month high of $1.3203 per greenback after the country's central bank held interest rates steady and said there were signs the global economy was stabilizing.
A rise in oil prices also supported the exporter's currency, and lifted the Norwegian krone slightly to 9.1622 per dollar. [O/R]"

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar, which has dominated the currency market for the past couple of years, is likely to maintain its position of strength despite diminishing returns from the most overcrowded trade of the year, a Reuters poll of strategists found.
The foreign exchange market will step into a brand new decade with no fresh sense of direction, in part because of little progress by Washington and Beijing in brokering a truce in their prolonged trade spat.
""Fundamentally the dollar will remain strong against a whole basket of currencies because of the need for liquidity and safe haven...the promise of some yield from the U.S. dollar is arguably better than no yield from Germany or the euro,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
""I think the dollar might slip, but I don't see it plunging at all next year.""
After months of collective optimism in the markets over a pending reprieve in trade tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was willing to wait until after the next U.S. presidential election in November 2020 to ink a deal with China.
While global equity markets initially reacted sharply to the news, the dollar index (DXY), measuring the unit against a basket of six currencies, has barely moved.
Much of the limited reaction is likely down to still-widespread expectations the U.S. will walk back from its planned imposition on Dec. 15 of fresh tariffs on Chinese goods.
""I would suggest it's more that the markets are basically adjusting to the rhetoric of Trump ... markets will only get upset if the negotiators say we're stopping again,"" said Tim Riddell, macro strategist at Westpac.
""We've always felt that the deal, especially 'Phase Two' or beyond, was going to be particularly difficult to achieve before the election. So getting a push back like this is not a massive shock to us.""
Yet volatility, which traders thrive on and is currently at low levels for most major currencies, is not expected in the market any time soon. The dollar and the euro have traded in the tightest range in decades this year.
Indeed, a majority of analysts - 38 of 64 - who answered an additional question said current low volatility in most major currencies would last at least another three months. Seven said volatility would return in one month; 19 said it would take up to three months.
The U.S. dollar, which has dominated currency markets and provided a sense of direction over the past couple of years, is also showing some signs of slowing down.
After gaining over 4% last year, the greenback has only eked gains of less than 2% so far in 2019, suggesting much of the trade deal news has already been baked into the currency and any further gains will be hard to come by.
While that is not to say the dollar is bound to weaken, there was no clear consensus among analysts on where the next boost to the world's top reserve currency was going to come from.
Currency speculators increased their net long dollar positions, taking the total value of bets to $20.11 billion from the previous week's $18.36 billion, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
Among the 62 analysts who answered another question in the Reuters poll on what was most likely to dictate the U.S. dollar's moves from here, 26 said developments in the U.S.-China trade war with a similar number choosing U.S. economic performance.
Seven chose economic performance of other major economies and the remaining three gave varied reasons.
But with no other currency expected to challenge the greenback's strength, it is expected to stay relatively unscathed in the near future.
The euro, which has lost nearly 4% for the year until now, is expected to recover those losses over the next 12 months.
The common currency is expected to end 2019 at $1.10, a level only a handful of analysts had predicted it would trade at in the January poll. The euro is then forecast to rise to $1.12 and $1.15 in the next six and 12 months.
After a broad decline in 12-month euro forecasts collected in Reuters polls over the last year and a half, they have steadily risen since October's poll.
""I would say the story is more of the dollar kind of losing some of its attraction rather than the euro becoming much more attractive,"" said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFG in London.

If there is no deal or substantial progress in talks before Dec. 15, tariffs on remaining Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys, will take effect, Ross said.
""Expectations for a U.S.-China trade deal are fading, and dollar/yen has broken its support levels, so the bias is tilted to the downside,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of research at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen and Swiss franc held gains against the dollar on Wednesday as appetite for safe-havens spiked after U.S. President Donald Trump warned a trade deal with China might not come until after the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
In offshore trade, China's yuan traded near its weakest versus the dollar since October due to waning hopes for a truce in trade war between the world's two-largest economies.
The dollar was broadly sold against major currencies, which helped sterling climb to its highest level in more that six months against the greenback.
Trump's statement that he had ""no deadline"" for an agreement with China weakened sentiment and roiled financial markets, because trade friction could drag on global growth longer than many investors had anticipated.
The diminishing prospects for an agreement also reinforced expectations the United States could carry out its plan to raise tariffs even further on Chinese goods on Dec. 15.
""Expectations for a U.S.-China trade deal are fading, and dollar/yen has broken its support levels, so the bias is tilted to the downside,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of research at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
""More tariffs would push dollar/yen lower still.""
The yen stood at 108.54 versus the dollar on Wednesday, close to its strongest since Nov. 22.
The Swiss franc was quoted at 0.9875 versus the dollar, near its highest level since Nov. 4.
Both the Japanese and Swiss currencies tend to be bought as safe-havens during times of uncertainty.
The offshore yuan stood at 7.0691 per dollar, close to its weakest level since Oct. 18.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday said that while staff-level talks are continuing with Chinese officials, no high-level meetings are scheduled.
If there is no deal or substantial progress in talks before Dec. 15, tariffs on remaining Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys, will take effect, Ross told CNBC on Tuesday.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies was quoted at 97.737, having skidded to a one-month low.
Sterling , meanwhile, benefited from the dollar's slide and rose to $1.3014, the highest since mid-May this year.
Trump's comments on trade so far this week have already caused a major stir.
On Monday, he said he would hit Brazil and Argentina with trade tariffs for ""massive devaluation of their currencies"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar traded near a one-week low versus the yen on Tuesday and near the lowest in almost two weeks against the euro, on concern about weak U.S. manufacturing data and signs of new fronts in the U.S. trade war.
Sentiment also took a hit after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on metal imports from Brazil and Argentina.
Recent U.S. economic data had shown signs of improvement, so a fourth consecutive month of shrinking manufacturing activity as well as an unexpected decline in construction spending put a big dent in hopes that the world's largest economy had stabilized.
Investors are also worried about how the United States will scale back a 16 month-long trade war with China, while more tariffs on other countries' goods would pose an additional risk to the global economic outlook.
""The weak data forced a lot of people to give up dollar longs and cut losses,"" said Daiwa Securities' foreign exchange strategist Yukio Ishizuki in Tokyo.
""This may have run its course, but there's no reason to chase the dollar's upside from here. Trade friction remains a lingering threat, which is not good for market sentiment.""
The dollar traded at 109.00 yen on Tuesday in Asia, close to its lowest in a week. It was quoted at $1.1076 versus the euro (EUR=EBS) after falling 0.56% on Monday, its biggest decline against the single currency since Sept. 17.
Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar index (DXY) stood at 97.887, having fallen on Monday by the most in six weeks.
On Monday, the U.S. Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell 0.2 point to 48.1 in November. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rise to 49.2 from 48.3 a month prior.
Separate data showed construction spending fell in October as investment in private projects tumbled to the lowest level in three years.
The data surprised economists who had recently raised U.S. growth forecasts for the forth quarter due to positive data on trade, housing and manufacturing.
Meanwhile, Trump surprised policymakers in Brazil and Argentina with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
In a Monday tweet, Trump said the tariffs, ""effective immediately"", were necessary because ""Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies, which is not good for our farmers.""
The comment came despite both countries actively trying to strengthen their currencies against the dollar.
The Brazilian real rose 0.3% to 4.2230 on Monday after Brazil's central bank conducted a spot auction to support the currency. The Argentine peso was largely unchanged at 59.88.

674,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- What a difference a decade makes. Back in September 2010, Guido Mantega, Brazil’s then-finance minister, was complaining bitterly about “currency wars,” and claiming the Federal Reserve’s ultra-loose monetary policy of the time was unfairly hurting his economy. “We’re in the midst of an international currency war, a general weakening of currency,” he said then. “This threatens us because it takes away our competitiveness.” 
Fast forward to December 2019, and we have President Donald Trump’s latest furious denunciation of exactly the same thing — only this time, he says that Brazil (as well as Argentina) is being unfair. In his latest tweet heard around the world, he said: “Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers.”
After announcing the imposition of tariffs on Brazilian and Argentine steel, he went on to attack the Fed. He wants the central bank to return to the behavior that so annoyed Mantega a decade ago: “The Federal Reserve should likewise act so that countries, of which there are many, no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies. This makes it very hard for our manufactures & farmers to fairly export their goods. Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!”
If Mantega’s complaints look dumb in retrospect, Trump’s latest broadside looks even dumber. Mantega’s complaint came when Brazil’s economy was surging on the back of strong commodity prices (which themselves were driven by the voracious manufacturing appetite of China). The strong Brazilian real hadn’t stopped the country’s economy from going on a great run. In the subsequent decade, the U.S. far outstripped Brazil’s growth, despite a steadily strengthening dollar:
Currency values matter greatly to competitiveness, of course, and central banks can use interest rates to manipulate them. But the arrow of causation also works in the other direction. A weak economy will lead to a weak currency, and vice versa. That is the story of the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real over the last decade.
The weak dollar in 2010 was a product of the weakness of the U.S. economy. Low rates and quantitative easing were deemed necessary to keep the economy ticking over, and allow the country to clear its debts. Outright deflation appeared a real risk. Higher rates from the Fed at that point might have weakened the real, but they might also have stopped U.S. economic growth in its tracks — which would have been very bad news for Brazil. 
Is Brazil manipulating its currency lower? Not at all. Its central bank’s target rate, the Selic, is very low at present, by Brazilian standards, but only because inflation is at its lowest this century:
Further, as the country’s use of dollar-denominated debt has increased over the last decade, a weak real makes interest payments more expensive and increases the risk of a crisis.
No country knows this better than Argentina, which has suffered several epic crises of devaluation and default in living memory, and where voters have just kicked out a president, Mauricio Macri, in large part for failing to tame inflation. Macri failed to stop further sharp devaluations of the Argentine peso, despite massive overnight rates of more than 50%. Another disadvantage of a weak currency is inflation, and Argentines know all about that. It too is currently running at more than 50%. Any implication that Argentina is deliberately weakening its currency for competitive advantage is beyond absurdity. 
In the long run, the currency war has had only one winner. GDP per capita in both Brazil and Argentina is less than a quarter that of the U.S. And both countries have fallen further behind, even as their currencies have weakened. 
Why, then, is Trump choosing to open a new front in the trade war, on two countries that currently have little or no ability to harm the U.S.? It is possible that he is being “crazy like a fox,” and trying to convince people that he is capable of anything. Such a strategy, the argument goes, might convince China of the need to do what he wants. The risk with such a strategy is to give the appearance that he has no understanding of how the economy works. And thus the more likely explanation for his behavior is that he truly doesn’t understand what he is doing. 
Meanwhile, Brazil and Argentina have shown the U.S. the best way to weaken a currency. If your economy slows down, the chances are that your currency will get cheaper. That is what has happened over the last decade to the big economies of South America. And in the much shorter term, the sharp sell-off in the dollar on Monday in response to disappointing data on manufacturing suggests that the president should be careful what he wishes for. Today’s weak Brazilian real appears to be exactly what Guido Mantega wished for back in 2010 — but nobody in Brazil could possibly have wished for the disastrous decade that made that weak currency possible. "

HAVANA (Reuters) - Two Havana department stores began on Monday to give change only in pesos, instead of the local dollar equivalent known as the convertible peso, in another step toward ending Cuba's dual monetary system.
The Central Bank, in a brief note published by state-run media, termed the measure an experiment that could be extended to other establishments in the future.
“Depending on the results and effectiveness of the experiment, its gradual extension to other commercial establishments in Havana and the rest of the provinces will be evaluated,” the Central Bank said.
There are currently two currencies circulating in Cuba, the peso and the convertible peso, which is valued at 24 pesos.
The exchange rate has not changed in more than a decade and the government claims the convertible peso is equal to the dollar, but imported appliances and other goods, when available, often have huge markups as they are purchased in tradable currencies while the peso and convertible peso have no value abroad.
Cubans are largely paid the equivalent of less than 100 dollars per month in pesos, irritating the population, which is often charged convertible pesos at retail outlets.
The government has pledged to eliminate the convertible peso and currently most retail establishments charge in either currency.
Larger peso notes began circulating a few years ago in preparation for unification.
Possession of the dollar and other tradable currencies is legal, but until October they had not been deemed legal tender for purchases.
The Communist-run country, which controls most retail sales, began opening stores in October that sell appliances, car parts and other items for dollars, though only electronically with a bank card.
In November, Cuba banned the import and export of convertible pesos and began charging travelers in tradable currencies at airports once past the gate.
Cuba's inefficient state-run economy is facing a crisis because of the implosion of ally Venezuela’s economy and the tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo under President Donald Trump.
Local economists and foreign analysts say the crisis is forcing the government to move more quickly with reforms promised nearly a decade ago, such as elimination of the dual currency system.
“These days 2020 seems to be everybody’s bet unification and other structural reforms,” said a western banker with years of experience in Cuba, requesting his name not be used.
""It looks like they are finally moving off the dime,"" he said."

One-month at-the-money options volatility for the rand versus the dollar has plunged to the lowest since November 2014 and its 373 basis points drop since the beginning of last month is the biggest among emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg. That suggests traders are anticipating price swings will moderate in coming weeks, as many markets move into the holiday period and volumes decline.
But the spread of six-month implied volatility over the one-month measure widened by almost three percentage points in the same period, and is now the most in two years, indicating that investors are adding protection against currency moves further out along the curve.
The next six months are crucial for South Africa’s economy, with the government fighting crises at state-owned companies including the national airline and power producer. The budget in February will be watched for signs of further fiscal slippage as Moody’s Investors Service prepares to review the country’s credit rating in March.
All the while, investors will have to weigh monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the state of trade negotiations between the world’s two biggest economies and how that will affect global growth. Those risk factors could move the rand either way.
“We expect a very strong move once the market has made up its mind whether the global economy will recover or not,” said Neels Heyneke, a strategist at Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg. He suggests now is the time to hedge against price swings. “The direction is always important, but with volatilities this low, we think it is not worth the risk to put all your eggs in one basket, as hedging is cheap.”"
678,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"America's industrial heartbeat remained faint inNovember as a measure of manufacturing contracted for a fourth straight month against a backdrop of weaker orders and subdued production. (Bloomberg) -- The Institute for Supply Management data on Monday showed the factory purchasing managers' index unexpectedly declined to 48.1, near the expansion's low point, from 48.3. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for an improvement to 49.2. Readings below 50 indicate activity is shrinking.
The figures show the manufacturing sector, while no longer in freefall, lacks upward momentum in an environment of corporate investment cutbacks, subdued global demand and a still-simmering U.S.-China trade war. At the same time, factory gauges in China and Germany suggested the worst may be over for the sector.
Consumer spending continues to keep the U.S. expansion going, and other reports indicate American factory activity is gradually firming. A similar PMI issued Monday by IHS Markit rose to a seven-month high of 52.6 in November, after the government reported last week that business-equipment demand climbed in October by the most in nine months.
Still, the ISM's measure of factory orders declined in November after consecutive gains and, at 47.2, matches the lowest readings of the expansion. That figure signals that the surprise jump in the government's October reading for capital goods orders and shipments may not be sustained.
The ISM's survey indicated a deeper decline in factory employment, while the gauge of order backlogs dropped to its lowest level since January 2016. That helps explain why factories can operate with leaner staffing. The group's gauge of production, while rising for the first time since June, contracted for a fourth month.
An ISM measure of exports, after expanding in October for the first time in four months, fell back into contraction. The imports gauge also signaled a contraction, albeit a milder one than a month earlier.
The gauge of supplier deliveries was the only component above 50, indicating shipments of inputs are slowing.
An index of prices paid contracted for a sixth straight month, a sign that weak demand is holding down inflation.

Although the prospect of a Conservative win has been seen as positive for the pound, the case for more gains is not clear-cut, according to the currency derivative markets.
That's partly because Brexit in January does not remove all the uncertainty pressuring the UK economy as it merely fires the starting gun for potentially protracted negotiations on a future free trade deal between Britain and the EU.
Demand for 'put' options to sell the pound in the future now outstrips demand for 'call' options to buy sterling, and this is reflected in the put premium contained in one-month ""risk reversals"" that straddle the election date."

The pound headed for a fourth month of gains against the euro, reflecting growing confidence in the market that the Conservative Party will be able to secure a majority in the U.K.’s December election.
Sterling outperformed all major currencies after a much-anticipated poll released Wednesday evening suggested that Boris Johnson’s party is on track to win its biggest mandate since the 1980s. That is the best scenario for investors betting on the pound as it could end the political impasse over Brexit.
The Conservatives are on course to win a large majority of 68 seats in the Dec. 12 vote, according to the YouGov poll, which used a technique that more closely predicted the 2017 election than standard surveys. This would allow Johnson to get his Brexit deal through Parliament by Jan. 31 and avoid the political deadlock Britain has suffered since his predecessor Theresa May lost her majority in 2017.
“We expect the currency to remain supported given the credibility of the YouGov MRP poll and especially given the considerable lead that it gives to the Conservatives,” wrote Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA, in a research note. “This could mean that, even taking into account the inevitable polling errors, the Tory party should be still able to gain a comfortable majority.”
The pound pared gains after touching a six-month against the euro, to trade at 85.11 pence by 9:00 a.m. in London. It is heading for monthly gains of 1.2%, in the longest winning streak against the common currency since 2015. Against the dollar, the pound gained 0.2% Thursday to $1.2943.
Sterling has been tracking opinion polls closely ahead of the election, and had slipped earlier in the week as surveys of voter intention suggested the Conservative lead was narrowing. Markets prefer the certainty offered by a majority government, according to a recent Bloomberg survey.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen rose and risk-sensitive currencies fell on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump's formal endorsement of Hong Kong's anti-government protesters, seen as potentially derailing recent Sino-U.S. progress on trade.
On Wednesday, Trump signed into law congressional legislation that supported the protesters despite angry objections from Beijing. That pushed the offshore yuan lower on worries it would worsen already fractious relations between the United States and China.
The Swiss franc and gold also rose on Thursday as investors sought other safe harbors due to concerns about a potential increase in geopolitical risk.
In response to the U.S. move, China's foreign ministry said it resolutely opposed the law and threatened to take firm counter-measures, complicating efforts to scale back a 16-month long trade war between the world's two-largest economies.
""The yen is being bought because of the news about Trump signing the Hong Kong bill,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""Algorithmic trading could push the yen up further, but the dollar's losses will be limited because we've had positive U.S. economic data, which has lifted sentiment.""
The yen rose 0.12% to 109.42 versus the dollar on Thursday, rebounding from a six-month low reached Wednesday after U.S. economic growth was revised up in the third quarter.
The Australian dollar , which is often traded as a proxy for global commodity demand, fell to a six-week low of $0.6764.
In the offshore market, the yuan fell 0.18% to 7.0269 per dollar. In the onshore market, the yuan was little changed at 7.0280 versus the greenback.
China's foreign ministry also said on Thursday that U.S. attempts to interfere in Hong Kong are ""doomed to fail.""
The U.S. bill signed on Wednesday requires the State Department to certify, at least annually, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favorable U.S. trading terms, which have helped it maintain its position as a global financial hub.
The law also threatens sanctions for human rights violations in Hong Kong, which has been rocked by months of civil unrest in response to what protesters say is an erosion of freedoms since reverting to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing has denied any undue influence and has blamed foreign governments for meddling in Hong Kong's affairs.
Many see the U.S. legislation as symbolic, but it has the potential, if implemented, to further rock relations between the United States and China.
Washington's rebuke also comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators are trying to reach an agreement to de-escalate a trade war, which would remove a huge headwind from the global economic outlook.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a prolonged dispute over Chinese trade practices that the U.S. government says is unfair.
Investor uncertainty benefited the Swiss franc , which pulled back from a two-month low to trade at 0.9990 against the greenback.
Gold, another safe haven bought in times of uncertainty, rose 0.16% to $1,456.66 per ounce.
The rise in safe havens undermined the dollar, which came into Asian trade on a high after revised data showed U.S. economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter.
Separate data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased by the most in nine months in October and shipments rebounded."

In response to the U.S. move, China's foreign ministry said it resolutely opposed the law and threatened to take firm counter-measures, calling any attempts to interfere in Hong Kong are “doomed to fail.”
Chinese and Hong Kong stocks fell today following the news, while the yen traded modestly higher.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera warned on Wednesday of the potential ""irreparable harm"" of a resurgence in violence that saw arson and looting attacks spike nationwide and the peso plunge to a new historic low.
Pinera urged Congress to push forward with bills he introduced weeks ago to beef up security and toughen penalties against looting and destruction committed alongside more than five weeks of protests over inequality and shabby social services.
The unrest has left at least 26 dead and more than 13,500 injured, prosecutors said. Riots have hobbled the capital's public transport system, once the envy of Latin America, and caused billions in losses for private business.
""Violence is causing harm that may become irreparable to the body and soul of our society,"" Pinera said from the La Moneda presidential palace.
Jaime Quintana, the center-left head of Chile's Senate, said on Twitter the conservative Pinera needed to take responsibility for the violence.
""The government is far from having done everything it could, and should, have done,"" he said.
Riots have also erupted in countries across Latin America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia in recent months as unrest has spiraled into violence and demands for political, social and economic reforms.
The interior ministry reported that police arrested 915 people Tuesday, while the number of ""serious incidents"" overnight had nearly doubled from the previous day.
Chile's peso plummeted to a new low at market close on Wednesday amid the resurgence of violence.
Vandals looted a major hotel in the seaside tourist city of La Serena, turning over tables, ripping paintings off walls and breaking windows.
Protesters also targeted upscale areas of Santiago, marching through a shopping mall in the ritzy mountainside suburb of La Dehesa earlier in the week and another in Las Condes on Wednesday.
Officials had shut key commuter metro stations by mid-afternoon Wednesday throughout the capital's business area, known as Sanhattan for its gleaming skyscrapers and designer stores, as protests grew.
Pinera's efforts to quell the violence have so far come up short, despite promises to beef up pensions, the minimum wage and healthcare benefits. The country's normally fractious political parties have also agreed to work together on a new constitution.
Protests appear driven by mistrust that politicians will keep their promises to bring significant change, and enduring fury over police handling of demonstrators."
689,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 04:57PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A decline in Latin American currencies turned into a rout Wednesday, with three of the region’s most-traded currencies hitting record lows.
The Colombian peso headed for its fourth day of declines as President Ivan Duque failed to quell anti-government demonstrations, while Chile’s peso weakened after another night of disturbances across the country. Brazil, which has avoided such extreme political turbulence, also saw its currency reach a record low, forcing the central bank to intervene for the third time in two days.
Chile’s currency is down 11% in the past month after the worst social unrest since the restoration of democracy in 1990 threatened to stall economic growth. Now Colombia is following suit, with protests convulsing the nation for the past week.
“There’s a reason this has been dubbed the Latin American equivalent to the Arab Spring,” said Omotunde Lawal, a London-based money manager at Barings. “Currencies are adjusting for idiosyncratic events in each country.”
While it’s not on the radar of as many investors, Uruguay’s peso fell for a sixth day and trades at its weakest level ever against the dollar. The currency tends to closely track the Argentine peso, which is close to its own record low.
Latin America is now home to the three worst-performing emerging-market currencies this year: Argentina’s peso (-37%), Chile’s peso (-15%) and Brazil’s real (-9.1%). Only the Mexican peso (+0.4%) has edged higher against the dollar during that span."

There were record lows for one- and three-month volatility in the common currency Wednesday, following similar moves in longer tenors at previous sessions. While the expected calm of Christmas holidays may explain the move over the one-month horizon, the trend runs further out and may be becoming the new norm.
The main risk ahead is arguably the U.K. December election, yet demand for protection against price swings created by a market-adverse outcome may be confined to pound crosses only, just as happened with Brexit talks. Globally, fatigue over trade-related headlines may keep ranges tight, even if current optimism over the progress in U.S.-China talks wanes. And data out of the euro area suggest the worst may be behind for the region’s economy.
Explanations vary as to why investors are refraining from taking advantage of record-low hedging costs. They include a range of soothing geopolitical and policy factors, including easing trade tensions, an outlook for steady monetary policy at the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve as well as fading fears of a global recession. There is also the rising importance of China’s yuan to the global financial system.
Hedge funds that were betting against the move lower in euro volatility last week have lost heart, closing their positions following a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday, according to a Europe-based trader who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly. Powell repeated his expectation that interest rates will remain on hold for now.
Risks will return, and with them will come volatility in the major currencies. But as investors look ahead, many of the most likely flashpoints are further out. That includes the U.S. elections in November next year, the December 2020 deadline for the U.K. to strike a trade deal with the European Union. It will also take time for any complete trade deal between U.S. and China to emerge.
In the meantime, the smart money seems to expect a prolonged period of calm.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank has instructed two major foreign exchange banks on the island to bring in more U.S. dollars before the end of the year to prepare for increased demand in case of political uncertainty in January elections, two sources told Reuters.
Taiwan holds presidential and legislative votes on Jan. 11.
Opinion polls put President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party far ahead of her main opponent Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party, which favors close ties with China.
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary, and pays close attention to elections on the island.
Beijing has in the past menaced Taiwan with war games to try and influence people not to vote for candidates viewed as pro-Taiwan independence, though such efforts have tended to backfire.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters that Taiwan's central bank has instructed Mega Commercial Bank and Bank of Taiwan to import physical dollar bills - $30 million for Mega and $25 million for Bank of Taiwan.
The two banks declined to comment.
A Taiwan central bank official said it was normal to ask banks to ensure they had ample U.S. dollars ahead of elections.
The sources added that the import volume was less than the last presidential election in 2016, as the central bank assessed that the banks' dollar cash reserves were still abundant.
Taiwan usually stocks sufficient dollars ahead of elections to ensure it can meet demand if there is tension or political uncertainty with China, in case Taiwanese have to leave the island fast or the currency plunges in the event of a crisis.
Ahead of the 1996 elections, when China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait, some Taiwanese rushed to buy gold.
China sailed an aircraft carrier group through the Taiwan Strait earlier this month, a move Taiwan denounced as attempted intimidation. China has made little secret of its dislike of Tsai.
Taiwan has a large current account surplus and substantial foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $472.48 billion at the end of October, the sixth largest in the world. "

However, Trump also reiterated Washington's support for protesters in Hong Kong, a potential huge sore point with China.
“I’m holding it up because it’s got to be a good deal,” he said in an interview with Fox News. “We can’t make a deal that’s like, even. We have to make a deal where we do much better, because we have to catch up.”
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday that the two countries had phone calls this week and had “reached consensus on properly resolving relevant issues”, but did not provide any further details. 
The call was later confirmed by U.S. officials. But they also said that obstacles still remain.
The U.S. Dollar Index Futures inched up 0.1% to 98.270 by 12:40 AM ET (04:40 GMT). 
On the data front, U.S. consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November despite expectations of a small rebound.
U.S. consumer spending data is due later in the day, along with GDP, jobless claims and durable goods.
The U.S. equity and bond markets will be shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Major currencies hardly budged on Wednesday as traders looked ahead to the final outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and a shortened holiday week in the United States.
Against the yen the dollar was traded at 109.05 yen , off two-week high of 109.205 touched on Tuesday amid mild optimism that Washington and Beijing could soon sign a deal to put a hold on their 16-month trade spat.
The euro stood at $1.1023 (EUR=), little changed so far this week. Trade is slowing down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday in the U.S., before which some major players will have wind down most of their trade for the year.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Washington was in the ""final throes"" of work on a deal that would defuse a 16-month trade war with Beijing.
But he also underscored Washington's support for protesters in Hong Kong, a potential huge sore point with China.
His remarks followed a telephone call on Tuesday by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with Chinese Vice Premier Liu that was disclosed by China's Commerce Ministry.
Although Trump's comments kept the bullish mood in the U.S. stock market alive, major currencies were on hold, with many market participants now hesitant to make big bets before they see the actual deal.
""Judging from Trump's comments, an agreement will have to wait at least until the weekend,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Tokyo.
One major sticking point has been the rollback of tariffs Trump has imposed, with Beijing demanding they be scrapped as a part of the deal.
The United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in a dispute over trade practices that the U.S. government says are unfair. China has responded in kind with its own tariffs on U.S. goods.
""I think markets are betting that a likely compromise will be to continue to negotiate on tariffs. If that turns out to be the case, we could see buy-on-rumor-sell-on-fact type of selling in the dollar/yen,"" he added.
If both sides cannot reach an agreement soon, the next important date to watch is Dec. 15, when Washington is scheduled to impose even more tariffs on Chinese goods.
""The market is believing that the December tariffs won't be activated,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
With markets preoccupied with the trade issues, soft U.S. consumer sentiment data hardly made any dent in the dollar.
U.S. consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November despite expectations of a small rebound, amid worries about current business conditions and employment prospects.
Another report on Tuesday showed an unexpected drop in new home sales last month, but data for September was revised higher to show purchases hitting their highest level in over 12 years."
695,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s central bank shocked traders by intervening in the foreign exchange market for the first time in three months, selling dollars in two surprise auctions to prop up the real after it slumped to a record low.
The currency pared losses after the second intervention and was down 0.3% on the day as of 4 p.m. in New York. It had weakened as much as 1.2% to a record 4.2765 per dollar after the first auction failed to establish a floor for the currency, which has dropped 9% this year. The central bank didn’t say how much it sold.
Policy makers’ concern that a weak real could fuel price increases in a nation with a long history of out-of-control inflation may have been the driver for the moves, which came just hours after officials had signaled they were comfortable allowing markets to set the exchange rate. Pressure on consumer prices makes it more difficult for the central bank to cut borrowing costs to boost economic growth.
“Pretty ironic of the central bank to jump back in the market,” said Alvise Marino, a currency strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York, who has been bearish on the real since September. He said authorities may have been driven to act by the severity of the recent drop, rather than the specific level. The real is down 5.5% this month.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said Monday that a weaker real isn’t a problem -- in line with comments last week by central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto. Tuesday morning, President Jair Bolsonaro said he’d like a stronger real, but signaled he would defer to his finance chief.
Marino said while the intervention might provide some short-term support, the real has further room to weaken given the state of the economy and investors’ concern about regional stability. The ongoing political turmoil in Latin America, the lower carry-trade appeal and the fact that the real is being used by investors as a hedge for long positions in equities and other local assets will keep pressuring the currency, he said.
“There’s some spillover from what’s been going on in Chile and now Colombia,” said Brendan McKenna, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York, referring to widespread protests across the region.
The real’s recent slide has put a cap on predictions for more cuts to the benchmark Selic rate. In December, the central bank is expected to deliver its fourth straight reduction of 50 basis points, which would lower borrowing costs to a fresh record of 4.5%. Brazil’s swap rate traders have trimmed bets on a February rate cut that would take the rate to 4%.
The new reality of low Brazil rates -- just three years ago the Selic stood at 14% -- has eroded the appeal of using the real for a carry trade, in which investors borrow in dollars and invest the money in higher yielding currencies.
Campos Neto has said that the weaker exchange rate has coincided with an improvement in Brazil’s perceived risk -- which investors interpreted as a signal that there wasn’t any plan to intervene to stop its slide.
But intervention often works best when it’s unexpected, so policy makers may have seen value in keeping their plans secret. And there’s precedent from earlier this year for doing that.
The last time Brazil intervened, on Aug. 27, it came minutes after Campos Neto said policy makers would only act when there is a liquidity gap. There wasn’t an obvious issue with liquidity today, with the real’s decline in line with the performance of other emerging-market currencies.

The pound slipped as polls showed the ruling Conservative party’s lead narrowing into a December election, with the tightening race raising investor fears about an inconclusive result.
The U.K. currency weakened versus all of its Group-of-10 peers as the latest surveys of voting intention showed the opposition Labour party making up some ground following the release of its manifesto last week. The most positive outcome for investors betting the pound will rise is a Conservative win, whereas if no party gains a majority it raises the prospect that an impasse over Brexit will drag on into next year.
The pound has acted as a barometer of political risk throughout the Brexit process and has recovered nearly 8% since hitting an almost three-year low in September, on hopes of an end to the uncertainty. Markets favor a clear win for Conservative leader Boris Johnson, which would make it easier to get his existing Brexit deal through Parliament, allowing the country to move on to trade talks with the European Union.
The currency’s drop “highlights somewhat complacent pricing of political risk in the U.K.,” wrote Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada, in a research note. “It is hard to reconcile this degree of confidence with current polling results.”
A Kantar poll on Tuesday showed the Conservatives at 43% and Labour at 32%, while an ICM/Reuters poll released Monday put the Conservatives at 41% and Labour at 34%, narrower margins than the double-digit lead of previous surveys in the past 10 days. Pollsters say this election is a tough one with voters prone to switching parties as Brexit disrupts traditional allegiances. Surprise results in the Brexit vote and the last election also mean such surveys are seen as less reliable.
Sterling pared its drop to 0.2% at $1.2879 by 11:55 a.m. in London, after gaining 0.5% Monday. The currency also weakened 0.2% versus the euro to 85.57 pence per euro. U.K. government bonds, which have acted as a haven from Brexit risk, gained to send 10-year yields down four basis points to 0.65%.
Cole sees a risk of a repeat of the 2017 election, where Labour performed much better than initially expected, leading the Conservatives under Theresa May to lose their majority in Parliament. He favors betting on the pound to fall from here, but “that may change multiple times between now and Dec. 12,” he said."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar and export-focused currencies found support on Monday as positive signs for the U.S. economy and upbeat headlines on U.S.-China trade talks boosted investor confidence.
The pound climbed, too, on hopes for an imminent Brexit and an end to years of political paralysis.
The day's mood - tempered with weariness at the flow of trade news - was best illustrated by the New Zealand dollar. It rose 0.4% against the safe-haven Japanese yen (NZDJPY=) to 69.83 yen.
""Even if the numbers are small, there's a message in there that risk appetite has improved,"" said Westpac FX strategist Sean Callow.
The dollar added 0.1% on the yen to 108.76 yen and touched its highest level since Nov. 14 against the euro (EUR=) at $1.1012. It sat at 98.278 against a basket of currencies, just below a two-week high (DXY).

Keeping hopes for a breakthrough in trade talks alive was the weekend announcement of Chinese plans for improving protection of intellectual property rights - seen as a move to address a sticking point between the parties.
U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien also said on Saturday a deal was possible by year's end.
On the economic front, the greenback was buttressed by better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data on Friday, seen as staving off the need for a rate cut. The main check on confidence has been rising tensions over Hong Kong.
The city has been rocked by more than five months of anti-government protests, and Beijing has already reacted angrily to the passage of U.S. legislation backing protesters, which has cleared Congress but not been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
""The price of the 'Hong Kong bill' will be increased underlying U.S.-China tensions,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore, adding that means greater uncertainty around the trade deal.
Nevertheless, the day's optimistic sentiment was enough to lift the trade-exposed Australian dollar 0.2% higher on the greenback to $0.6796, and for the New Zealand dollar to gain 0.3% to $0.6421.

Reuters cited sources from the U.S. and China and reported that a phase two trade agreement is looking less likely as China and the U.S. are struggling to even reach a preliminary phase one deal. Reuters previously reported that the signing of a partial trade deal might slide into next year.
 
The news came after Chinese President Xi Jinping said last week that Beijing wants to work out an interim or 'phase one' trade pact but is not afraid to retaliate when necessary.
 
U.S. President Donald Trump also said on Friday a trade accord with China is ""potentially very close,"" before adding, ""The question is whether or not I want to make it.""

Despite the shorter week, the U.S. economic calendar indicates that both manufacturing and consumption will be in the spotlight. Investors will be monitoring regional manufacturing PMIs for any signs of a slowdown in the factory sector. Consumer confidence data on Tuesday will precede Black Friday, both of which will give insights into the strength of consumer spending. Durable goods orders and a second reading on third quarter GDP will also be closely watched and in the euro zone, Friday’s preliminary inflation data will top the much-watch list.
The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Friday, after data showed U.S. factory and services activity accelerated in November, bolstering the outlook for the economy.
IHS Markit said its “flash” purchasing managers index for manufacturing rose to 52.2 in November from a final reading of 51.3 in October, while its preliminary services PMI increased to 51.6 this month from 50.6 last month.
The U.S. dollar index which compares the dollar against six major currencies, was up 0.28% at 98.17 in late trade.
The greenback received an additional boost from data showing that euro zone business growth almost stalled this month as activity in the bloc’s dominant services industry increased at a much weaker pace than expected and among manufacturers it contracted again.
The euro was down 0.3% against the greenback at 1.1021 late Friday.
“That combination is what is pulling the dollar a little higher,” said Vassili Serebriakov, an FX strategist at UBS in New York.
Despite Friday’s gains, the dollar has remained largely range-bound over the last few sessions. For the week, the dollar index was up 0.3%.
The dollar was little changed against the yen late Friday at 108.64.
“The dollar is relatively expensive but I think the market is really looking for signs of a stronger global growth rebound to revive interest in some of the currencies outside of the U.S. but the messages that we are getting are still a bit mixed, both in terms of the PMIs and the news on trade,” said Serebriakov.
The leaders of the U.S and China on Friday both underscored their desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16-month tariff war that has roiled financial markets and acted as a drag on global growth.
But trade talks could flounder if U.S. President Donald Trump signs into law a bill supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters or if U.S. warships keep sailing near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea.
Elsewhere, the British pound weakened on Friday, recording its biggest daily loss in nearly three weeks after PMI data showing British business suffering their deepest downturn since mid-2016, with caution rising before a Dec. 12 general election.

706,"<span>Nov 23, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) --   Goldman Sachs Group   Inc (NYSE:GS). is the latest Wall Street bank to bet on a pound rally in 2020 as it sees next month’s U.K. elections as a pathway to resolving Brexit.
Sterling will likely appreciate against the euro while U.K. government bonds slide as progress on Brexit after the Dec. 12 vote could remove investment uncertainty and also unleash more public spending, strategists at Goldman said in its ‘Best Trade Ideas Across Assets’ note. That view echoes peers such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
“Our economists think a victory for the Conservative Party in next month’s election would likely result in a fairly swift resolution of the Brexit process, as well as more expansionary fiscal policy,” strategists, including Zach Pandl and George Cole, wrote in a note dated Nov. 21. Clarity on Brexit makes sterling “our preferred G-10 FX long” for the first quarter of 2020, they said.
Goldman predicts the pound will rally more than 4% from current levels and targets 82 pence per euro, seeing all of this move happening in the first three months of 2020. Since there will still be doubt on the next stages of Brexit, given the risk of protracted talks on the future trade relationship between the U.K. and European Union, it recommends making the bet in the options market.
The pound traded around 85.90 pence to the euro on Friday, having gained more than 3% against the common currency this quarter to be the best-performing major currency. Against the dollar, it has climbed nearly 5% since the end of September to trade around $1.29.
The New York-based bank is also expecting U.K. sovereign bonds, which have acted as a haven from Brexit risk, to weaken. That will take 10-year gilt yields “sharply higher” with its target at 1%, a level not seen since May 2019 and about 30 basis points above current levels.

""We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi [Jinping], he’s a friend of mine,"" Trump said. ""He’s an incredible guy, but we have to stand…I’d like to see them work it out, ok?”

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was marginally down on Friday and risk appetite boosted by statements from China on the need to find a solution to the tit-for-tat tariff war with the United States, raising hopes that a ""phase one"" deal could be reached.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing wants to work out a deal with Washington and has been trying to avoid a trade war - but is not afraid to retaliate when necessary.
A senior Chinese diplomat urged the United States to compromise in order to develop stable relations between the countries.
But after a week of mixed signals over the likelihood of a preliminary trade deal, the developments did little to move markets. Currencies continued to trade in tight ranges.

711,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 06:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s tightest yearly trading range in more than four decades risks lulling corporate treasurers into a dangerous state of complacency.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s U.S. Dollar Index is on track for its narrowest annual trading band since 1976, with its 2019 high less than 5% above its low. A JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. gauge of foreign-exchange volatility lingers near all-time low levels reached in July.
The subdued moves in the currency market have created an environment where corporations are becoming less willing to pay up for hedging protection they haven’t needed, according to Cambridge Global Payments, which advises companies on cross-border transactions. For multinational companies looking to trim hedging costs, the risk is that volatility erupts again and the subsequent currency moves “destroy profits,” said Cambridge’s Karl Schamotta.
‘Asleep at the Switch’
“As the old metaphor goes, what we’re looking at is nickels being picked up in front of steamrollers,” said Schamotta, the firm’s Toronto-based director of FX research and strategy. “I think many corporates are asleep at the switch right now.”
There are no exact numbers reflecting currency effects on profits, and the benefits of hedging, since not every company reports detailed figures. North American corporations reported $21 billion in quantified negative currency impacts in the second quarter of 2019, according to a report from FiREapps, a foreign-exchange management firm. In Europe, the effect was only $1.55 billion.
The U.S. Dollar Index is currently trading near the middle of its 2019 trading range. Much of the calm can be attributed to the euro-dollar cross, which makes up roughly 60% of the gauge’s weighting and is locked in its tightest range on record. The common currency has plied in a 6% band between $1.0879 and $1.1570 since Jan. 1, and is currently trading at $1.1059.
Accurate market expectations for U.S. economic outperformance relative to Europe may explain the torpor, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes.
“At a really simple level, the market is priced for good things in the U.S. and bad things in Europe, and we go on getting exactly that,” Juckes said.
While hedging costs have ebbed in recent months, muted volatility has clients of foreign-exchange consultancy Tempus Inc. in Washington taking on more currency risk heading into 2020.
“It’s kind of selling insurance; it’s expensive,” said Tempus currency strategist John Doyle. “If FX volatility is low and there’s no urgency, that can fall down their list of day-to-day priorities. That’s what we kind of see with our clients.”
Among the clients stepping away from hedging are small and medium-sized multinational corporations, according to Doyle. Those companies tend to have thinly staffed treasury or accounting departments with employees “wearing different hats” rather than a dedicated currency specialist, he said.
Not everyone is swayed by the low volatility. While corporations may approach hedging decisions on a more tactical basis, long-term investors, such as pension funds, aren’t as quick to abandon protection, according to Record Currency Management Chief Executive Officer James Wood-Collins.
“Pension funds tend to view hedging as a long-term strategic decision,” said, Wood-Collins, whose Windsor, U.K.-based company oversees roughly $60 billion of currency exposures for pensions and other investors. “They’ll put a hedge protocol in place and renew that program on a multi-year cycle.”
It’s unclear where the next bout of turbulence may come from, or when it will erupt. Schamotta thinks a surprise stabilization in China or Europe’s economies could upset the dollar’s resilience. Doyle is keeping an eye on possible catalysts such as Brexit and the upcoming U.S. presidential election.
In the meantime -- as currency volatility flirts with record lows -- Doyle is advising clients to keep hedges on, despite the somnolent state the market has been in this year.
“It’s what we don’t see and don’t talk about that might sneak up on us very quickly,” Doyle said. “The point is to protect your bottom line, not to speculate.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen firmed against the dollar on Thursday after sources close to the White House told Reuters that a U.S.-China trade deal is unlikely this year, shattering investor hopes of a partial agreement soon and boosting safe-haven assets.
The Chinese yuan fell to a three-week low in onshore trade on concern that a failure to reach a deal to roll back U.S. tariffs could deal a fresh blow to China's stuttering economy.
Political tensions between Beijing and Washington also kept investors on edge after a source told Reuters that U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law two bills intended to support anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has been rocked by months of increasingly violent protest against Chinese rule of the former British colony. The passage of a U.S. law supporting the protesters could undermine efforts to secure a trade deal.
""The report from Reuters indicating that we might only see a trade deal next year has been driving some of the yen strength and that can also be seen as a source of some dollar strength,"" said Fritz Louw, a currency strategist at MUFG in London.
""If you see more negative trade headlines, and with the potential signing in the U.S. of the HK human rights bill, the yen should strengthen some more.""
At 0825 GMT, the dollar was a tad weaker on the day at 108.54 yen . Japan's currency has rallied almost 1% from more than five-month lows hit against the greenback earlier this month.
The dollar was little changed at $1.1077 versus the euro (EUR=EBS) and a touch weaker against the British pound at $1.2934 .
Completion of a ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House told Reuters on Wednesday, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.
The next date to watch is Dec. 15, when U.S. tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect.
Analysts said that while trade war headlines have tended to hurt the U.S. dollar in the past by boosting expectations for interest rates cuts, the dollar was now likely to benefit from any trade-related jitters in world markets given the Federal Reserve is seen on pause.
Minutes released on Wednesday showed that the Fed, which hit pause in its easing cycle following a rate cut in October, is in no hurry to reassess the path of interest rates.
The European Central Bank releases the minutes from its October meeting later this session but this was not expected to have a significant impact on the euro.
Elsewhere, China's yuan fell in the onshore market to 7.0450 versus the dollar, the weakest since Nov. 1, before steadying at 7.0372. Offshore, the yuan slipped to 7.0533 per dollar, the lowest since Nov. 5, and then pared its losses."

China's foreign ministry spokesman called the decision a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and said the U.S. faced ""negative consequences"" if it persisted.
The news added to jitters after Trump reiterated that he would raise tariffs if phase one of a trade deal with China is not signed.

The outcome of Britain’s election next month poses a binary choice for the nation’s currency, according to the largest U.K. bank.
“Nothing is priced in,” said David Bloom, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), in an interview with Bloomberg Television from Doha. “The political outcome will determine the future of the currency.”
An election result that paves the way to a U.K.-European Union deal on Brexit could send the pound up to $1.45 by the end of next year. Or a no-deal Brexit could see it tumble to $1.10, from just below $1.30 now.
Any resolution is good, Bloom said, either it be another referendum or a Brexit deal. Political wrangling will start to ebb away, the economy could get a fiscal boost and the Bank of England could start considering rate increases. The reverse could see recession fears flare.
Among three election scenarios, a hung parliament -- where neither Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives nor opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party gets a majority -- would be the worst for the currency, Bloom said.
In that case, there would be no majority of lawmakers in favor of a fresh referendum on Brexit, nor favoring any specific Brexit deal. “We could be back in the mud” and “lost in the wilderness.”
While polls suggest a Conservative majority now, the voting scenarios for the Dec. 12 elections are complex, according to Bloom.
“It’s still completely open -- anything can happen,” the strategist said."

There’s a rising tide of supply as the Federal Reserve pumps dollars into bank-funding markets in the wake of September’s upheaval. That has the potential to dent the yield advantage that U.S. markets offer just as a change of management at the European Central Bank could draw a line under monetary easing in the euro’s home region.
“So far, the Fed’s liquidity-add has been absorbed by commercial banks’ year-end-related liquidity demand,” say Morgan Stanley strategists including Hans Redeker. “Once the year-end turn has passed, dollar scarcity may turn into a dollar glut.”
That, coupled with stronger global growth outside of the U.S. and dwindling portfolio inflows, makes a decline in the value of the dollar one of Morgan Stanley’s top trends to watch next year. While the world’s gross domestic product growth may slow to 3.1% this year, that’s around a percentage point higher than the U.S., according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Research from Standard Chartered analysts including Steve Englander shows that since 2011, a rapidly growing U.S. monetary base has been a good indicator of euro strength.
Meanwhile, the uncertainty posed by a public impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions involving Ukraine and the 2020 American elections could hurt the dollar’s appeal, which may dim relative to the euro. The White House’s criticism of the Fed’s monetary policy returned to the fore in Washington, when Trump said he “protested” to Chairman Jerome Powell about interest rates, which the president considers to be too high relative to other developed countries. The shared currency held steady at $1.1070 Tuesday, after Monday’s gain of 0.2% trimmed its 2019 decline to 3.5%.
 Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA says the worst may be over for the euro-dollar cross because the economic downturn in the euro area may have bottomed out. Morgan Stanley sees the euro rallying in the first quarter because of “narrowing U.S.-Europe growth differentials” and improving political factors, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s euro-area data-surprise indicator turned positive for the first time in 20 months.
That makes euro-area purchasing managers’ indexes due Friday all the more important. A confirmation that the region’s economies aren’t as pressured as previously feared could boost the common currency.
The caveat that most analysts point to is potential progress in trade talks between the U.S. and China. If there’s no deal, and more tariffs are imposed, then the dollar could win out and risks to global economic growth may ramp up.
Questions over possible fiscal stimulus from Germany and uncertainty over the ECB’s path are also wild cards for the euro. Growth that continues to muddle along risks keeping calls for a fiscal boost in check and ECB accommodation in limbo, sapping support for the currency.
“With the ECB racked by internal disagreement on monetary policy as the Christine Lagarde era commences, policy in the euro zone is as stalled and unclear as ever,” according to John Velis, a foreign exchange and macro strategist at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp.

Expectations had grown that Washington and Beijing would sign a so-called ""phase one"" deal this month to scale back their 16-month-long trade war but those hopes received a setback on Monday after CNBC reported China is pessimistic about agreeing to a deal, which suggests a resolution to perhaps the biggest risk to the global economy remains elusive.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro enjoyed a small respite on Monday, jumping to an 11-day high versus the U.S. dollar, on expectations that Washington and Beijing can soon sign off on a deal to end a trade war that has been a drag on global economic growth.
Faint optimism for a breakthrough was supported by a report on Sunday from Chinese state news wire Xinhua, which said the two sides had ""constructive talks"" over the weekend.
The export-oriented European economy has suffered from the 16 month long trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The tariff war has taken a toll on the world's manufacturing.
Investors injected $3 billion of inflows into European equities over the past two weeks, ending a record run of 85 weeks of persistent outflows, EPFR data showed last week.
""Market participants remain optimistic that a partial U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and have welcomed tentative signs of economic improvement outside of the U.S., especially in the euro zone, both of which are eroding the relative appeal of the U.S. dollar,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.
The euro was last up 0.1% at $1.1068 (EUR=EBS), its highest since Nov. 7, and the index which tracks the greenback against six major currencies was down 0.1% at 97.90 (DXY).
The offshore Chinese yuan, however, remained below 7 per dollar, last falling 0.1% to 7.0142 . The yuan is the most sensitive currency to the trade dispute.
""USD/CNY above 7.0 suggests that the market is not yet convinced a solution is near,"" said Marshall Gittler Chief Strategist at FX analysis firm ACLS Global. 
The liveliest mover, however, was the pound, creeping up 0.3% against the dollar to $1.2945  and against the euro to 85.41 pence (EURGBP=D3). It has surged to a 17-day high versus the dollar and a six-month high versus the common currency.
Sterling was boosted by expectations that the Conservative Party could win a majority in the Dec. 12 election, as well as by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying that all Tory candidates in the election have pledged to back his Brexit deal. This could open the door to getting the Brexit deal agreement passed through parliament.
Johnson's Conservatives have a 14 point lead over the opposition Labour Party, a poll published by Good Morning Britain showed on Monday.

The dollar and bonds are likely to be sensitive to minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, set to be released on Wednesday.

However, he noted the soft report on October U.S. retail sales released on Friday suggested previously strong consumption was showing some cracks.
""Any further weakness in consumption could warrant a material reassessment of the outlook by the FOMC. Under our baseline, the FOMC would most likely start cutting interest rates again in 2020,"" said Capurso.

The official currency, the bolivar, has depreciated more than 90% this year, while hyperinflation in the first nine months of the year clocked in at 4,680%, according to the central bank. 
The inflationary spiral has slashed the purchasing power of the South American country's minimum wage, which together with food assistance, is equivalent to about $10 per month.
""I don't see it as a bad thing ... this process that they call 'dollarization,'"" Maduro said in an interview broadcast on the television channel Televen.
""It can help the recovery of the country, the spread of productive forces in the country, and the economy ... Thank God it exists,"" the socialist leader said.
Maduro, who at least until 2018 forbid the use of the dollar, added that while he is still evaluating transactions in U.S. currency, which have been growing in recent months, the bolivar will continue to circulate as the official currency.
Since 2003 the official exchange rate has been set by Venezuela's central bank but the rate has become increasingly flexible. 
""Venezuela will always have its currency ... we will always have the bolivar and we will recover it and we will defend it,"" Maduro said in an interview with José Vicente Rangel, a leftist politician and vice president during the government of Hugo Chávez.
Under increasingly severe U.S. sanctions, the central bank has started injecting euros into the economy. The government and state oil company PDVSA have even begun to pay contractors with the European currency.
Foreign currencies enter the economy of the OPEC member largely from the sale of some shipments of crude oil and gold. 
Opposition leader Juan Guaidó responded to Maduro's dollarization comments at a news conference later Sunday, saying Maduro had admitted another defeat.
""The failure in Miraflores, acknowledged today, is that the country is dollarized ... he recognizes that our currency cannot even hold value,"" Guaidó said. 
Guaidó, who heads the National Assembly, invoked articles of the Constitution in January to proclaim himself interim president, claiming that Maduro's re-election was fraudulent. Maduro calls the opposition leader a U.S.-backed ""puppet.""
Recently, Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica estimated 53.8% of transactions in the first 15 days of October were carried out in dollars, according to a sampling of the country's seven main cities. That number reached 86% in the oil-rich city of Maracaibo, which has been badly hit by power cuts.

728,"<span>Nov 17, 2019 07:47AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Investing.com - Monetary policy meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will be in focus this week as investors continue to monitor the effects of recent central bank easing against a background of trade uncertainty and slowing global growth.
Appearances by several Fed speakers and a speech by ECB President Christine Lagarde will also be closely watched for any monetary policy insights as trade discussions between the U.S. and China drag on. Meanwhile, a blast of global PMI data on Friday will be scrutinized for any fresh signs of fallout from the trade war.
The dollar was lower late Friday as some optimism for the ongoing trade talks with China buoyed trade-linked currencies like the euro and the British pound.
Against a basket of six major currencies the U.S. dollar index was down 0.17% at 97.85 in late trade.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said progress was being made on the agreement’s details, which helped lift trade-exposed currencies at the expense of safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen.
The dollar fell 0.3% against the euro and 0.2% against the British pound, at 1.1051 and 1.2905 respectively. It rose 0.3% versus the yen, last at 108.73, after the safe-haven currency had gained earlier in the week as political unrest in Hong Kong and trade uncertainty reduced appetite for risk. The Swiss franc also weakened 0.2% versus the dollar.
""It may not be a game-changer,"" said Terence Wu, a treasury strategist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. ""Thus, we think any reversal in the risk-off trades may not see a good shelf-life.""
Mixed signals on trade negotiations have abounded in recent days while evidence of the damage the dispute is wreaking on the global economy has mounted.
On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, but consumers cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items and clothing, raising questions about the consumer strength currently underpinning the U.S. economy.
That may have also contributed to the rise in the euro and the pound.
“When we were looking at second-quarter numbers for Europe and the United Kingdom, those numbers were very worrisome, but now that we’re looking at the third-quarter numbers, their progress has been a little bit better and their pace has been at expectation or beyond, whereas the United States has actually slowed down,” said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc.
“The dollar is finally today reacting to those numbers and saying the economic pace of the United States is not that great.”

729,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 11:09AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, after data showed that manufacturing woes in the country have deepened. 
Manufacturing output fell to 0.6% in October, the most since May 2018. Excluding autos, output was down 0.1% last month, the Federal Reserve data showed. Industrial production slipped 0.8%, while the Empire State Manufacturing Index tumbled to 2.9 from 5.0 expected. 
Diminishing concerns over U.S. trade did nothing to ease forex traders. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2% to 97.863 as of 11:08 AM ET (16:08 GMT).
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that the U.S. and China were close to securing a trade deal. His comments come after a week of volatility after reports that the two sides had hit a snag over trade talks. Chinese media on Friday fleshed out arguments that Chinese demand for U.S. farm products is nowhere near the level of purchases that Washington is insisting on in order to seal a partial phase one deal.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that U.S. and Chinese officials would hold a call later in the day, but added that the U.S. could still impose tariffs on Chinese goods, which are scheduled for Dec. 15. 
The safe-haven Japanese yen was lower with USD/JPY up 0.3% to 108.75. 
Elsewhere, the euro was higher, with EUR/USD up 0.3% to 1.1051 while GBP/USD rose 0.2% to 1.2901. "
730,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 10:29AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors awaiting signs whether the euro is ready to stage a comeback will be closely watching next week’s regional manufacturing report.
The preliminary data, due next Friday, will help investors bet whether Europe is heading for a more robust recovery, or conclude that recent positive signals were short of the mark. The manufacturing PMI is forecast to reveal a stabilizing economy, with Nomura International Plc reporting wider signs of a recovery that could strengthen the common currency into next year.
The euro is currently hovering near a one-month low at $1.1029, while benchmark German bond yields are edging up again after a huge bond rally in the first eight months of the year. Nomura sees the euro trading at $1.10 by year-end before rising about 5% to $1.16 by the end of December 2020.
“In a recovery the euro tends to outperform,” Nomura strategists including Jordan Rochester said in a note. “The good news is that our broad measure of risk sentiment remains in risk-on territory and leading indicators suggest the slowdown could turn into a recovery.”
To be sure, European bond markets are yet to see a decisive turning point in the economic data and recent moves are being driven by sentiment rather than a definitive trend in fundamentals. The same may be said about the euro, which has largely ignored recent developments, including the news that Germany avoided its first recession in six years.
Bloomberg economists see a brighter outlook for the euro-zone next year, and optimism grew on Tuesday when German investor confidence rose to the highest level in six months. This follows continued positive signs from China, where manufacturing continued to pick up in October with new orders rising at the quickest pace in more than six years.
For further clues about the future in Europe, traders will be tuning in to a speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde next Friday. With markets largely pricing out further easing this year, any dovish signals could encourage bets against the euro. But chances appear low that she will signal any significant deviation from current policy at such an early stage in her tenure. Meanwhile, other members of the governing council have this week signaled the ECB is in no rush to further expand monetary stimulus.

The greenback is on course for a modest loss of around 0.2% this week, drifting as the world waits for China and the U.S. tie up an elusive trade truce.
The threat of a Chinese crackdown on unrest in Hong Kong is also keeping markets on edge. President Xi Jinping urged the city’s chief executive Carrie Lam to clamp down on protests on late on Thursday, urging “forceful actions . . . to punish those who have committed violent crimes,” according to the Financial Times.
However, the FT also cited people familiar with the matter as saying that China’s top official overseeing the territories of Hong Kong and Macau had delayed a visit to the city for fear of inflaming the situation further.
By 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the buck against a basket of developed market currencies, was at 98.050, little changed from late Friday. EUR/USD and GBP/USD were both effectively unchanged at $1.1025 and $1.2880, respectively.
The dollar had received some support from two days of Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell who made clear that there would be no further cuts to U.S. interest rates barring a major deterioration in the economy.
The modest uptick in jobless claims last week along with weakening producer price inflation on Thursday clearly didn’t meet that requirement, but there is the chance that U.S. retail sales and industrial production data, both due later Friday, may send stronger signals of a slowdown.
Elsewhere, the global trend towards lower interest rates continued, with cuts by the central banks of both Mexico and Egypt. Both the peso and Egyptian pound took the moves in their stride."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar and riskier trade-exposed currencies found some support on Friday as fresh hopes for a breakthrough in Sino-U.S. trade talks were tempered with caution.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Thursday that the two parties were getting close to a deal and the ""mood music is pretty good"".
He offered no new details, but the sentiment was enough to reverse a little of the safe-haven Japanese yen's overnight gain and to buoy the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
The yen fell 0.2% to 108.57 per dollar and dropped 0.3% on the rising Aussie.
The Australian dollar , which had tumbled on Thursday after an unexpected rise in the national unemployment rate, added 0.2% to $0.6795.
The New Zealand dollar rose 0.1% to $0.6388. China's yuan rose 0.2% but remained just shy of strengthening past the 7-per-dollar level at 7.0076.
Against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) the greenback was steady at 98.140 as caution and the lack of concrete news in Kudlow's remarks kept a lid on risk appetite.
""It may not be a game-changer,"" said Terence Wu, a treasury strategist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. ""Thus, we think any reversal in the risk-off trades may not see a good shelf-life.""
Mixed signals on trade negotiations have abounded in recent days while evidence of the damage the dispute is wreaking on the global economy has mounted.
The next scheduled economic updates are Eurozone trade and inflation data due at 1000 GMT and the New York Fed manufacturing survey due at 1330 GMT.
On Thursday, China's commerce ministry said the two countries are holding ""in-depth"" discussions, while U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday a deal was close.
But the Financial Times, citing unidentified people close to the talks, said an agreement may not be reached in time to avoid a new round of U.S. tariffs taking effect on Dec. 15.
Sub-par growth figures on Thursday from China and Japan, followed by lackluster updates in Britain and Europe underlined the potential downside if a deal falters.
Few are game to make a decisive call either way.
""Until we've got the word from Donald Trump, no-one's really willing to get in front of it,"" said Jason Wong, senior market strategist at BNZ in Wellington.
The British pound, meanwhile, sat near peaks scaled overnight.
Sterling touched a six-month high against the euro and gained on the dollar as expectations that Britain's ruling Conservative Party might win a majority in a Dec. 12 election fueled optimism the Brexit impasse will finally end.
The pound stood at $1.2880 and at 0.8559 pence per euro in Asian trade. ""Markets now appear to be priced for a high likelihood of a majority Conservative government,"" RBC Chief Currency Strategist Adam Cole said in a note."

Gao Feng, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson, insisted again at a weekly press conference that the U.S. should roll back tariffs as part of a “phase one” agreement. 
“The trade war was begun with adding tariffs, and should be ended by canceling these additional tariffs. This is an important condition for both sides to reach an agreement,” Gao said.
“If both sides reach a phase one agreement, the level of tariff rollback will fully reflect the importance of the phase one agreement,” Gao said, noting the two countries’ trade delegations are in deep consultations on this topic.
Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington is “getting close” to a trade deal with Beijing.
Citing unnamed people close to the talks, the Financial Times said an agreement may not be reached in time to avoid a new round of U.S. tariffs taking effect on Dec. 15. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping were widely expected to sign the deal at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Santiago, but Chile canceled the event in late October due to domestic unrest.
The U.S. dollar index was unchanged at 98.020 by 11:13 PM ET (03:13 GMT). 
The USD/CNY pair slipped 0.2% to 7.0076. 
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly extended loans through its medium-term lending facility (MLF) on Friday, while keeping the interest rate on one-year MLF loans unchanged at 3.25%.
The PBOC also said it has injected 200 billion yuan ($28.60 billion) into financial institutions via the liquidity tool.
The NZD/USD pair gained 0.1% to 0.6387. The New Zealand dollar had jumped on Wednesday when the country’s central bank unexpectedly left interest rates steady.

734,"<span>Nov 14, 2019 10:51AM ET</span>",,,,,," Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was unmoved on Thursday as the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose to an unexpected five-month high and there were no new comments on monetary policy from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 225,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, the highest reading since June 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Meanwhile Powell is testifying before Congress for the second day this week. 
Powell said in written testimony on Wednesday that the U.S. economy is on track, but that the Fed was watching out for broader risks. He also indicated that the central bank is unlikely to keep cutting rates, after easing monetary policy three times this year. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 98.210 as of 10:50 AM ET (15:50 GMT). The biggest move within the basket was against the Aussie dollar, which fell 1% to its lowest in nearly a month after an abrupt weakening of the Australian labor market. That comes against the background of devastating bush fires that have also dented sentiment toward the Aussie in recent days, casting doubt over the country's long-term dependence on exports of natural resources such as coal that are widely linked to climate change.
The safe haven Japanese yen was higher with USD/JPY down 0.2% to 108.61.

Pound traders are bracing for swings of as much of 3% on the result of December’s election that will set the course of Brexit.
A gauge of volatility in the currency over the next month, which now covers trading on the day after the Dec. 12 vote, has awoken from a recent slumber to climb the most since the 2016 Brexit referendum. That implies the currency could either rally to about $1.32 or slide to $1.25, according to pricing in options markets.
The U.K. currency, a barometer for Brexit risk, has remained largely unmoved this week to trade around $1.2850 even after a series of disappointing economic data releases. The key for the pound is the election, given potential outcomes include a government backed by the Brexit Party and its no-deal strategy, a left-wing coalition that could seek to radically overhaul the economy or a hung Parliament that risks prolonging a stalemate in Westminster.
“Things could get a bit livelier around the pound as the election comes into view,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency research and strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA.
Polling currently shows the ruling Conservative Party in the lead, but the election remains difficult to predict, with smaller parties in focus and Brexit throwing up the possibility people will vote differently.
Investors have been opting to sell short-dated volatility and buy the potential for longer term swings, Marinov said. That has pushed the spread between two-week and one-month contracts also to the widest since June 2016. As buying protection against swings becomes more expensive, bets targeting an even bigger rally to $1.36 within three months may make sense, Marinov said.
“The wide spread highlights that selling short-dated vol may have reached a limit,” he said. “Everyone is still focusing on the polls where support for both Tory and Labour is growing.”
A Bloomberg survey of strategists and investors last week found the pound could climb more than 4% to $1.34 after the December vote if the Conservatives win. A Labour majority win, though seen as highly unlikely, would send it slumping more than 4% to $1.23."

LONDON (Reuters) - As dollars dry up, global finance is growing increasingly dependent on opaque currency trading to keep cash flowing.
Banks and other short-term dollar borrowers are becoming ever more reliant on the $3.2 trillion-a-day foreign exchange swap market, data shows, leaving them dangerously exposed should U.S. lenders stop feeding the system, even if only temporarily.
Swaps users had a scare in September, when the U.S. Federal Reserve had to pump cash into markets as rates in the $2.2 trillion U.S. ""repo"" market spiked and spilled into FX swap markets, sending the premium to borrow dollars shooting higher.
""It affected us in the FX swaps market a great deal. There was a lot of panic around, spreads widening, increased volatility,"" said James Topham, a forex forwards trader at Canadian bank BMO, adding that on Sept. 16 ""unusually large and persistent"" dollar borrowing was evident from clients.
Such reminders of potential disruptions to the ""plumbing"" of money markets, best exemplified during the 2008 financial crisis, have regulators on guard for anything that could trigger a repeat.
Some now fear that swaps could be that catalyst, possibly as soon as the end of 2019, if U.S. banks, the main conduit for dollars, cut back lending to meet cash reserve rules.
""Around year-end ... the normal supply dynamics will be thrown out,"" said Topham.
Tighter regulations stipulating lenders must hold at least 8% of capital as reserves, rising U.S. protectionism and corporate cash repatriation are all shrinking dollar supply.
Reflecting the increased reliance on currency markets to borrow dollars, FX swap volumes have grown to represent 49% of total currency trading, from 42% in 2013, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) figures from August show.
For a graphic on OTC foreign exchange turnover, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-FOREX-BIS/0H001QX6T8EJ/eikon.png
This has led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the BIS, as well as monetary policymakers such as the European Central Bank, to keep a wary eye as the cost of borrowing dollars has inched higher in the past decade, making it more costly for global banks and companies to fund investments.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET
Unlike regular 'spot' currency transactions, swaps involve two parties swapping one currency for another. Repayment is after a set period and fixed at a forward exchange rate determined by the gap in interest rates on the two currencies.
Many central bankers say bank borrowing and funding via swaps, which are typically used for hedging, day-to-day liquidity management or even speculation, is driving the increase in FX swaps as they are ""off-balance sheet"".
This is favorable for banks and companies because the lower their debt, the higher their credit rating. It is also cheaper to hold a smaller amount of debt on the balance sheet.
One central bank official said that authorities were keeping an eye on the end-2019 period but they are also concerned about borrowers' ability to refinance.
""A lot of FX trading activity is very short term. That could expose banks to significant rollover risks,"" the official added.
Borrowing via swaps could amount to $14 trillion or more, Claudio Borio, head of the BIS monetary and economic department estimated.
And the dollar funding gap, the difference between non-U.S.-banks' dollar assets and liabilities, may be up to $1.5 trillion, said Tobias Adrian, director of monetary and capital markets department at the IMF.
""Much of that has to be funded in FX swap markets, and those markets can be fragile,"" Adrian told Reuters.
While the IMF has ""a very granular breakdown"" of FX swap borrowing and risk managers typically perform stress tests on banks, Adrian said it remains a ""worry"".
The central bank official said stress tests implied some banks use swaps for more than 10% of their funding, while the BIS says dollars are on one side of 90% of all currency trades.
Because dollar demand is so high, lenders ask for a price premium known as the cross-currency basis, which tends to become more negative as dollar shortages deepen.
This is increasingly costly for non-U.S. banks without dollar deposits and dollar-denominated collateral and these must turn to swaps to finance trade and hedge investments.
Other dollar-dependent borrowers, particularly in emerging markets, are also suffering.
Aside from U.S. banks, potential winners could include suppliers of petro-dollar liquidity such as major oil firms.
BACK TO BASIS
Money market traders and regulators do not expect a re-run of the 2008 and 2011 crises, when dollar borrowing dried up outside the United States as U.S. banks hoarded it at home.
The September repo rate spike abated as the Fed pumped cash into money markets and swap rates also eased.
While the global dollar swap market lacks such a backstop, central banks outside of the United States can provide dollars via ""emergency liquidity assistance"", aimed at financial institutions that are facing temporary liquidity problems.
""We have dollar liquidity that partly depends on (the) forex swap market, as we don't have dollar deposits. But we regularly test the ability of the ECB to provide us with dollar liquidity via forex swaps. We don't have any problems with that, this is not a concern,"" a French banking executive said.
Nonetheless, as year-end nears, traders are on edge because big U.S. banks often reduce cash on deposit at the Fed to comply with rules requiring them to show sufficient cash buffers, meaning they lend out fewer dollars.
This causes periodic spikes in dollar funding premia ""in FX swaps and repo"", said Olek Gajowniczek, a trader at Japanese bank Nomura, adding that regulation had made it harder for the market ""to absorb unlimited quantities of FX swaps"".
Before the 2008 financial crisis, the basis swap between the dollar and major currencies was negligible but has since ranged between minus 20-50 basis points, while in some countries it has moved beyond minus 100 bps, Adrian said.
The three-month euro-dollar basis swap for instance is at around minus 22 bps but spiked beyond minus 300 bps in October 2008. It touched minus 42 bps a month ago when a money market squeeze sent overnight repo rates to 10% in New York.
""We estimate that when the basis widens by 50 bps, then financial stability risks in the home country of the institutions are increasing and they're cutting down lending,"" Adrian added.
For a graphic on dollar funding markets, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8063/7994/Dollar%20funding%20markets.png
Traders such as BMO's Topham have become used to swap market volatility in December -- since 2008 it is the norm that the basis swap premium increases towards year-end only to re-adjust back shortly afterwards, he said.
However, he remains vigilant.
""It seems that dollar liquidity is still there, but is obviously close to a level where small things can cause big price changes,"" he said. ""We've kinda learnt that in September."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Doubts over whether the United States and China will be able to reach a preliminary trade deal helped to lift safe-haven currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc on Thursday, while pulling the yuan lower.
Adding to pressure, Chinese retail sales, industrial output and investment data were weaker than expected, sending the Australian dollar, already knocked by soft local employment data, to a one-month low.
U.S.-China trade negotiations have 'hit a snag' over farm purchases, with Beijing not wanting a deal that looks one-sided in favor of the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The report came after President Donald Trump said a trade deal with China was ""close,"" but offered no details and warned that he would raise tariffs ""substantially"" on Chinese goods if there was no deal.
An agreement last month between the two economic powers to sign a ""phase one"" pact to end their trade war boosted optimism in global financial markets, lifting the yuan and other risk-sensitive currencies.
""If Trump takes a hard line, emboldened by the latest strength in stock markets, and refuses to make some concessions to China, there will be risk an agreement cannot be reached at the last minute,"" said Makoto Noji, chief currency and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
A new Reuters poll showed most economists do not expect Washington and Beijing to reach a permanent trade truce over the coming year.
The yen firmed to 108.77 yen per dollar , having risen to as high as 108.66 in previous U.S. trade.
The Japanese currency, often used as a safe-haven asset because of Japan's status as the world's largest net creditor nation, has hit a five-month low of 109.49 a week ago.
Against the euro, the yen was firm at 119.60 per euro (EURJPY=), near one-month high touched the previous day.
The yen hardly budged after Japan's GDP data showed the economy grew an annualized 0.2% in July-September, much below economists' forecast of 0.8%.
The Swiss franc has been firm, having risen almost 0.6% over the last two days against the euro, to hit its highest level in more than a month.
The franc traded at 1.0895 per euro (EURCHF=), near Wednesday's peak of 1.0879. Against the dollar, the franc stood at 0.9898 per dollar .
The unexpectedly downbeat China data highlighted continued pressure on the world's second-largest economy and subsequent risks to global growth.
The yuan took the data in its stride, though, staying little changed at 7.0223 yuan per dollar in onshore trade . But it stood off its three-month high of 6.9650 touched on Friday.
The Australian dollar was down more than a half percentage point to a one-month low of $0.6798 after the data.

The index last stood at 98.38 (=USD).
U.S. consumer prices jumped by the most in seven months in October, which together with abating fears of a recession, support the Federal Reserve's signal for no further interest rate cuts in the near term.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday told Congress that the negative interest rates sought by Trump aren't appropriate for a U.S. economy with ongoing growth, a strong labor market and steady inflation.
Sterling was little moved at $1.2857 , stuck in a tight range this week, in a limbo ahead of a Dec. 12 election.
A poll carried out for the Daily Telegraph newspaper showed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a healthy 10-point lead over main opposition Labour.
One-month implied volatilities of sterling options jumped to 11.4/12.1% from 7.25/7.95% on Wednesday as the instruments start to cover a period after the election.

SATARA, India (Reuters) - India's dependency on cash may slow the country's transition to digital payments despite large numbers of internet and mobile phone users.
For many citizens living in rural areas, cash is still the bedrock of daily existence because of a lack of facilities.
Sudhir Shinde, a farmer from Satara district in India's western state of Maharashtra says he withdraws more money from his bank than required as the money vending machine in his village has not been operational for months.
""If I need money urgently, I must make a 32 kilometre (20 mile) trip to Satara town, which is not always possible,"" said the 37-year-old sugarcane farmer Shinde, while buying fertilisers for his winter-sown crops.
""I always keep money in hand assuming family emergencies like hospitalization or any other such urgent requirements"".
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi backed a shock ruling in November 2016 to outlaw 86% of cash in circulation to target undeclared ""black money"" and fight corruption.
The demonetization got rid of old 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes and Modi said that would boost the country's digital economy, unearth unaccounted wealth and reduce the use of cash.
But 99.3% of the junked currency is back in the banking system, suggesting that only a miniscule portion was unaccounted illicit money or fake currency notes, and India's addiction to cash is now, perhaps stronger than ever.
CASH WANTED
One of the key objectives of the note ban was to discourage the use of cash, but India continues to see a surge in currency in circulation even as economic growth has slowed to a six-year low.
Central bank data shows that since the controversial demonetization gambit, currency in circulation has grown, rising 17% to 21.1 trillion rupees ($295.7 billion) as of the end of March 2019.
Graphic: India currency in circulation , https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8509/8434/Pasted%20Image.jpg
The ratio of currency in circulation to GDP has risen to 11.23% as of March 2019 up from 8.69% at the end of March 2017.
To be sure, digital transactions have grown, rising 19.5% in value in 2018/19 and 22.2% in 2017/18, the Reserve Bank of India said in a report.
On whether India's efforts to move to electronic payments has been slow, the central bank noted what it said in a statement last week.
To promote digital payment, the RBI has established ""state of the art payment systems that are efficient, convenient, safe, secure and affordable"" that has resulted in a rapid growth in retail digital payment systems.
Meanwhile, it will promote the use of e-payments for parking, fuel and toll collection, and has ordered banks not to charge bank customers for online transactions in the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system from January 2020.

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests people in Asia's third-largest economy prefer cash for various reasons, including to avoid paying higher taxes after a national sales tax was implemented in mid-2017 and higher charges from retailers.
Smaller stores who don't enjoy high volume sales often charge customers extra, to make up for what they must pay the service partners for electronic transactions. 
Higher operating costs have also led to a slowdown in opening of new ATMs, which has led to cash hoarding.
India has the fewest ATMs per 100,000 people among BRICS nations, according to the International Monetary Fund. Banks hobbled with bad debts have struggled to absorb the cost of software and equipment upgrades mandated by the central bank last year, along with higher land costs in the cities.
Graphic: India's ATM penetration, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8512/8437/Pasted%20Image.jpg
Other factors such as the country's rural-urban divide have also affected the migration to electronic payments.
""Digital economy has certainly gained momentum in metros, cities and to some extent in semi-urban belts. But it has not spread to rural belts or the informal sector where financial illiteracy is the issue,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings.
""It is difficult to predict when the shift would happen because general education and financial education are different things,"" she added. 
India is the world's second-largest internet and mobile phone market by number of users, trailing only China. However, a survey conducted by social media firm LocalCircles shows a large number of people still prefer cash transactions over digital with an average of 27% people having paid for 50-100% of purchases over the last 12 months without a receipt.
With the start of the goods and services tax (GST), tax on goods such as gold and silver was raised, prompting buyers and sellers to opt for cash transactions.
""Many small jewelers sell gold without receipts and consumers are also happy as they avoid paying 3% GST, which is a huge amount in the case of gold,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.

India raised import taxes on gold to 12.5% in July from 10%, which increased margins for gold smugglers. Many small jewelers sell smuggled gold in cash at a discount and pocket the profits, the jeweler said.

741,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 05:52PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Chile’s central bank will offer $4 billion of currency swaps after the peso weakened 6% in three days amid a wave of social unrest and investor concern about a new constitution.
The currency fell to a record low against the dollar this week, triggering a verbal intervention from the central bank on Tuesday. At the same time, the implied volatility in the peso spiked to the highest levels since 2006. The measures announced today will come into affect Thursday and continue until Jan. 9, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.
“I wouldn’t take this as something that will turn the market around,” said Alejandro Cuadrado, a currency strategist at BBVA (MC:BBVA) SA in New York. “It will accommodate any liquidity squeeze, but it’s not fighting the depreciation. I don’t think it’s a game-changer.”
Chile has been wracked by a wave of protests and riots since Oct. 18. The peso only edged lower at first before collapsing this week after the government on Sunday backed plans to rewrite the constitution, spooking traders concerned about extended uncertainty. President Sebastian Pinera in a speech to the nation last night failed to announce new measures or reassure the market.
“What it’s doing with the swaps is to increase the availability of foreign currency,” said Nathan Pincheira, an economist at Fynsa SA in Chile. “Whoever asks for the dollars will have to return them. It’s trying to relieve the short-term drought.”
The peso declined Wednesday after the government said yesterday that it would pull $1 billion from its sovereign wealth fund in the next few days and another $1.4 billion in early 2020. That money will end up being exchanged into pesos.
The swaps will provide liquidity in dollars without draining central bank reserves, since they will have to be repaid. Brazil’s central bank uses a similar system of swaps, which it either rolls over or allows to mature.
The central bank intervened in 2008 and 2011 to prevent the peso from strengthening, both times through programs of dollar buying. More recently in 2017, Mexico’s central bank offered a program of currency forwards to help prop up its peso.
On this occasion, strengthening the peso may counteract the bank’s monetary policy, which has an easing bias. On the other hand, a weaker peso tends to push prices higher.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell the most in more than a week, while the dollar rose for the seventh time in eight sessions to the highest in a month. The yen advanced along with gold. West Texas crude rose to $57 a barrel.
“A couple of weeks ago, it looked like that phase one deal looked all but certain. I think the market started to price in a really positive outcome on the trade side,” said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. “Although I do think that progress is moving in a positive direction, I think it would be foolish for us to assume that we’re going to move completely in a positive direction in trade without any type of intermittent setbacks.”
The prospect of a deal between the world’s two biggest economies has become key to sustaining a rally that drove American stocks to records, as it appears the Fed will be on the sidelines for a long time. The U.S. and China have yet to announce a new location or time to seal the agreement after an international gathering in Chile was canceled, and it’s unclear whether Trump’s renewed threats will move things forward.

Hedge funds and banks had built up massive short positions in the kiwi  as the local dollar is known before the rate decision on bets that a protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing would hurt the export-oriented economy's prospects.
But after two rate cuts this year, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it saw no urgency to ease policy again, sending the dollar up by more than 1% and short-dated bond yields and swap rates surging higher.

Against a broadly firm greenback, the kiwi was up 1.3% at $0.6407, comfortably on track for its biggest daily jump since end-October 2018.
Almost all analysts had forecast a cut in the 1% benchmark rate to a record-low 0.75%. Futures markets had priced in a better-than-75% chance of a cut as slack spending and a global slowdown held New Zealand's economic growth at a six-year low.

The U.K. currency has rallied more than 1% in the past month after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and as his Conservative party retains a lead in opinion polls. While it gained further ground this week on Nigel Farage’s pledge to avoid competition, in options markets investors remain cautious and continuing to expect weakness.
“That probably still tells us the market is yet to be convinced that the Conservatives are on course for a solid majority next month,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “Despite the opinion poll lead, the scale of voter switching over the last two elections, allied to the prospect of tactical voting, means that the electoral outcome is very hard to predict at this point with any degree of certainty.”
The pound has acted as a barometer for risk in the three-year Brexit process and the result of the election will determine the path for the U.K.’s exit from the European Union. Markets are still cautious of the vote ending in no clear majority or a coalition led by the opposition Labour party, which could lead to further Brexit negotiations with Brussels or another referendum.
Risk reversals, a measure of options market sentiment and positioning, favor selling the pound at contracts from one month to one year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sterling held gains in Asian trade on Tuesday, having hit a six-month high versus the euro and rising as much as 1% against the dollar overnight, as the risk of a hung parliament in UK elections eased slightly.
In a significant boost for Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the Dec. 12 election, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said his party was standing down candidates in seats won by the Conservatives in 2017 and would instead focus on challenging anti-Brexit politicians.
The pound rallied to as high as $1.2896 on the news, which the market had interpreted as reducing the probability of a hung- or Labour led- government that would further complicate Britain's exit from the European Union.
Cable gave up some of its overnight gains and was last at $1.2858 .
Sterling had already risen above $1.28 before Farage's announcement, after data showed the UK economy had narrowly missed a recession in the third quarter of 2019, expanding 0.3%.
Against the euro, the sterling strengthened to its highest level since May 8, at 85.62 pence (EURGBP=D4). The pair last stood at 85.79 pence.
Currency analysts said the Brexit Party standing down candidates could clear the way for the Conservatives to pass their Brexit withdrawal deal.
""The sterling's move was notable while other currencies were quiet, mainly because the U.S. market was closed,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The U.S. financial markets were partially closed on Monday for Veterans Day.
""It certainly is positive that the Conservatives got greater support. But with a month to go ahead of the Dec. 12 election, I'm not all that optimistic because I think anything can still happen,"" Sera said.

""The dollar's recent rally on the back of rising Treasury yields paused yesterday as the U.S. cash bond market was closed for Veterans Day,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Also weighing on the U.S. currency were doubts about whether Beijing and Washington can reach a potential trade agreement and roll back tariffs, and concerns over rising Hong Kong tensions.

The Conservatives currently hold 317 of the 655 seats in the House of Commons. Although they hold a commanding lead in national opinion polls, the first-past-the-post electoral system means that that lead might still not be enough to guarantee a majority. While the major opposition parties all have differing views and policies on Brexit, they all want either to revoke the initial decision to leave, or to hold a second referendum.
The pound jumped around half a cent against both the euro and dollar on the comments, while the yield on the 10-year Gilt rose some three basis points to 0.80%.
By increasing the likelihood of a clear victory for the Conservatives, Farage's comments remove some of the political uncertainty discount on U.K. assets, even though a Conservative victory would do little if anything to settle the U.K.'s long-term relationship with the EU, its biggest trading partner.
The effects of chronic uncertainty over Brexit were visible earlier Monday when the Office for National Statistics announced that the U.K. economy grew at its slowest annual rate since 2010 in the third quarter of this year, with business investment faring particularly badly.
By refusing to stand candidates against the Tories, Farage’s party makes it easier for sitting members of parliament to resist challenges from the pro-Remain Liberal Democrats in areas such as southwest England and London.
“There were huge numbers of Brexit supporters out in the country who feared that if Nigel Farage and The Brexit Party did stand in every single seat, that they could well be the Party that caused Brexit not to happen at all,” Jonathan Isaby, editor of the website Brexit Central, told Sky News.
However, it also makes it easier for opposition parties to define their enemy as they go campaigning, underlining that a vote aimed at delivering Brexit will also be a vote for a range of Conservative policies that are less popular.
“A vote for Boris Johnson’s Conservatives is a vote for Nigel Farage’s politics,” tweeted Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman.
Aside from Brexit, Farage has in the past argued for the U.K. to reform its healthcare system along insurance-based lines. Such suggestions have previously generated intense resistance."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held near multi-week highs on Monday amid optimism that the United States and China would roll back tariffs that have hurt global growth.
Against the Australian dollar the greenback stood just below a two-week peak at $0.6857. Against the New Zealand dollar , it was close to a month high at $0.6336, and likewise against a basket of currencies (DXY) at 98.358.
Moves were slight as traders kept a wary eye for further news on the U.S.-China trade war.
Officials from both countries said late last week that a rollback of some tit-for-tat tariffs had been agreed.
Even though that was subsequently denied by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday, he did not completely rule out a deal and U.S. benchmark treasuries held above a key support level at 1.9%, buoying the currency.
""He's left the door open to some (tariff) rollbacks,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney.
""The market has latched on to the idea that there's definitely the prospect that some will be done,"" he said.
""Everyone is looking to price in the improvement in the global growth outlook,"" he added, pointing out that future improvement was further supported by an altogether positive earnings season from U.S. companies.
The dollar was marginally weaker against the euro (EUR=) and Japanese yen , reflecting some investor caution that the deal could still unwind.
The greenback stood at $1.1020 per euro and at 109.23 yen. The Chinese yuan was marginally weaker in offshore trade, but still on the strong side of 7-per-dollar at 6.9892 in offshore trade.
""The world wants to be long risk and short volatility into any impending meeting between Trump and (Chinese President) Xi, but will they get what they want?"" said Chris Weston, strategist at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.
""Tactically if we get an agreement, do we then see a classic buy the rumour, sell the fact scenario play out? I see this as a material risk.""

Britain's economy has lost momentum this year, hurt by a global downturn due to the U.S.-China trade war as well as increased uncertainty over its exit from the European Union.

The U.S. is to release inflation data on Wednesday, while retail sales and industrial production data on Friday will shed light on whether the consumer can continue to drive growth in the face of a struggling manufacturing sector and months of trade tensions.
The U.S. dollar rallied to a three-week high on Friday, getting some safe-haven bids, as risk appetite for higher-yielding currencies waned with renewed uncertainty about the rollback of existing tariffs, a major component of a preliminary U.S.-China trade deal.
Trump said he had not agreed to a tariff rollback, a day after officials from both countries reportedly agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods in a “phase one” trade deal if it is completed.
The U.S. dollar index rose 0.2% to 98.21 in late trade after hitting a three-week high, led by gains against the euro, which dipped 0.3% to 1.1017.
The dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen at 109.27.
Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics in London, believes as trade tensions persist, the dollar is likely to stay strong.
“While we don’t expect relative interest rates to boost the dollar much further in the near term, we think that continued trade tensions and a slowing global economy mean that the greenback will rise a bit further in 2020 despite the fact that on a trade-weighted basis it is already near its highest level since the early 2000s,” Goltermann said.
The British pound was weaker, down 0.3% at 1.2771 amid ongoing political uncertainty in the U.K. and indications from the Bank of England that it's ready to cut rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The Japanese yen, a haven currency that has suffered particularly badly as hopes for a trade settlement have grown staged a modest comeback overnight after stronger-than-expected household spending numbers for September overnight.
Elsewhere in Asia, the Indian rupee weakened after Moody’s cut India’s sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable, citing rising public deficits and debt levels.
The pound, meanwhile, was opening flat. It hit a two-week low on Thursday, dipping briefly below $1.2800 after the Bank of England adopted a more dovish outlook about the possible need for interest rate cuts, given the weakening of global growth this year and the hit to domestic growth from the prolonged uncertainty over Brexit. That uncertainty is set to extended well into next year by the general election on Dec. 12.
For the first time in over a year, two members of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee dissented from the overall view, calling for an immediate rate cut.
“All told, the MPC is demonstrating a clear easing bias, and given the downside risks to growth, looks increasingly minded to ease policy early next year,” said ABN Amro Bill Diviney in a morning note.

The reduction comes at a time when investors have been skeptical about the government meeting its budget targets amid a slowdown in tax revenues and September’s surprise $20 billion tax giveaway for companies.
The rupee weakened 0.4% to 71.2525 per dollar as of 9:55 a.m in Mumbai after falling to 71.2750, the lowest since Oct. 18. The yield on benchmark 10-year bonds rose three basis points and the S&P BSE Sensex index of shares fell 0.2%, halting its record-setting rally.

Indian assets have got a boost in recent weeks from strong overseas inflows. That’s after better-than-expected earnings in the September quarter stoked optimism that companies have weathered the worst of an economic slowdown following a series of government stimulus measures and five back-to-back rate cuts so far this year.
Foreigners have bought stocks worth $501 million in November, after pumping in more than $2 billion in October, and have been buyers of sovereign debt for nine straight sessions. Twenty-four of the 38 Nifty 50 firms that have posted earnings so far this season have beaten or matched the average analyst estimate.

The Sensex is still on course to mark its fourth weekly climb in five. The gauge’s 14-day relative strength index reached 74 on Thursday, above the level of 70 that some investors read as a signal to sell.
Not everyone expects the change in outlook to raise overseas borrowing costs for local companies. Indian firms may raise another $20 billion via offshore debt in the six months through March after seeking $25 billion in the six months ended September, Care Ratings said in a note Thursday.
“I don’t expect it to lead to any significant rise in borrowing costs as Moody’s is currently rating India a notch higher than Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings,” which still hold the nation’s outlook at stable, said Ajeet Choudhary, executive director for fixed income at J.P.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held on to its gains versus the yen and the Swiss franc on Friday as a China-U.S. agreement to roll back tariffs on each others' goods supported riskier assets, even as some reports suggest a preliminary trade pact is far from a done deal.
The yen also nursed losses against the euro and the Australian dollar as progress in resolving a 16-month long trade war between the world's two largest economies weakened demand for safe havens.
China and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others' goods in a ""phase one"" trade deal if it is completed, officials from both sides said on Thursday.
However, there is still some scepticism about a trade deal as officials inside and outside the White House have bristled at the notion of giving up punitive tariffs.
Muddying the water further, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told Fox News Channel in an interview on Thursday that the United States is ""very, very optimistic"" about reaching a trade deal with China soon.
Sterling traded near a two-week low after two Bank of England unexpectedly voted to cut interest rates due to uncertainties posed by Britain's fraught exit from the European Union.
The remaining seven policy makers on the board voted to keep policy unchanged, but Governor Mark Carney and others said they would consider a cut in the future.
On the whole, sentiment is likely to remain supportive for the dollar, equities and other risky assets as a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war removes a huge risk to the global economic outlook.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies stood at 98.136, up 1% this week.
""The overall tone is risk-on, which is a positive for the dollar and a negative for the yen,"" said Tsutomu Soma, general manager of fixed income business solutions at SBI Securities Co in Tokyo.
""We can see this in other markets, which is why stocks are so strong. We still need to figure out when the United States and China will sign this deal, but the mood so far is supportive for markets.""
Trump has used tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods as his primary weapon in a trade war that has hurt global growth and rattled financial markets in the past year.
The dollar held steady at 109.34 yen in Asia on Friday, close to a five-month high, and is headed for a 1.1% gain for the week.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar, this year's G10 pacesetter, will edge higher over the coming 12 months, supported by the solid performance of Canada's economy and its high yield relative to other major currencies, a Reuters poll showed.
The Oct. 31-Nov 6 poll of more than 40 currency analysts showed they expect the loonie to dip slightly to 1.32 per U.S. dollar, or 75.76 U.S. cents, in three months but to then head higher.
Strategists see the Canadian dollar climbing to 1.30 per U.S. dollar in 12 months, stronger than the 1.3058 projection in October's survey.
The Bank of Canada turned more cautious last week, cutting its economic forecasts as it worried Canada's economy would be ""increasingly tested"" by trade uncertainty.
But the central bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1.75% last week, persevering with an unchanged rate this year even as many of its peers have eased.
The bank will wait until the first quarter of 2020 before easing, a separate Reuters poll of economists showed last month.
Last week's rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the third since July, has lowered the range for its policy rate to below the Bank of Canada's equivalent for the first time since December 2016.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan have set policy rates that are zero or negative.
""Canada yields are close to or at a premium against most of the other G10 currencies now and we think that warrants a break lower in dollar-Canada,"" said Daniel Katzive, head of FX strategy, North America at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in New York. ""We'll probably trade through 1.30 in the relatively near term, so we're constructive on the loonie.""
Investors appear to agree. They have raised bullish bets on the loonie to the highest level since December 2017, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations.
Since the start of the year, the Canadian dollar has climbed nearly 4% against the greenback, the biggest advance among G10 currencies.
""Our forecast for CAD strength mainly reflects ongoing sturdiness in the Canadian economy and our outlook for broad U.S. dollar weakness over the next year or so,"" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Canada's economy has added jobs this year at a robust pace and the rate of inflation has stayed near the Bank of Canada's target of 2%.
""If the global trade and manufacturing picture continues to improve, that would likely disproportionately benefit the higher beta currencies such as CAD,"" Nelson said.
Optimism the United States and China would reach a trade deal has helped push global shares to a record high this month.
The loonie is seen as sensitive to prospects for global growth because Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil (CLc1).
The prospect of increased fiscal spending next year could also support the loonie if it were to boost the outlook for Canada's economy.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Emerging-market currencies will need a reprieve from global trade tensions to strengthen as they head into a new year filled with uncertainty and a world economy showing signs of a synchronized slowdown, a Reuters poll of strategists showed.
U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion he may sign a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping set off a flurry of optimism that representatives from the world's two largest economies would might sign a preliminary agreement soon.
The two countries have agreed to cancel in phases tariffs imposed during their months-long trade war, the Chinese commerce minister said on Thursday. But no timetable was laid out.
""We retain our scepticism that over the mid-term horizon emerging markets will be able to hold to their gains (as) 2020 is likely to be a challenging year for the global economy,"" said Piotr Matys, senior emerging markets strategist at Rabobank.
""That said, the prospect of a short-term trade truce could fuel capital inflows to emerging markets over the short-term horizon, leading to further currency gains,"" he said.
But if nothing comes of trade talks or they are postponed once again, the U.S. dollar may remain resilient.
In Asia, the Chinese yuan is predicted to weaken against the dollar over the coming year despite recent gains. The Indian rupee is also unlikely to recoup this year's losses.
If current trends hold up, the Russian rouble , up about 8% year to date, will end the year as the best-performing key emerging market currency. The latest Reuters poll predicted it would be relatively steady at 65.00 per dollar in 12 months.
The Turkish lira , down about 8%, is set to finish 2019 as the second-weakest performer after Argentina's peso, which has been clobbered by a financial crisis.
Problems in Latin America's third-biggest economy have not spread to other currencies in the region, as some feared. But forecasts for Brazil's real (BRBY) and Mexico's peso reflect caution over a weak economic outlook.
Governments in both countries kept public finances in check this year, but officials have failed to deliver on promises of healthier growth as private investment remained muted.
Mexican businesses are reluctant to begin major projects, fearing conflict with an administration they consider too interventionist. Their Brazilian peers are still waiting for opportunities from much-vaunted reforms.
A turnaround in hopes for the global economy is a condition under which South Africa's rand usually shines. If it holds on to the 2%-plus gains it has made this week, it's likely to top the list of 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Reuters on Refinitiv data this month.
Medians from the latest Reuters FX poll forecast the rand will be relatively steady at 14.89/% in 12 months. But domestic challenges lie ahead.
Moody's left South Africa's credit rating on the brink of junk status on Friday, when it revised the outlook on the country's last investment-grade credit rating to ""negative"".
Moody's said it revised its ""Baa"" rating, the lowest rung of investment grade, because the outlook for economic growth deteriorated and debt rose.
""I think the rand forecast suggests limited upside in the South African economy in the next year -- a weak fundamental outlook has been priced in,"" said Elize Kruger, senior economist at NKC African Economics.
A separate Reuters poll expects South Africa's economy to grow 1.2% in 2020, compared with a forecast for just 0.6% growth this year.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The yuan will shed recent gains made amid hopes for a ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal, according to strategists in a Reuters poll who predicted a weakening domestic economy would likely dampen the currency in the year ahead.
Talk of a possible preliminary deal lifted the tightly-managed currency to a 2-1/2-month high on Tuesday despite weak domestic data and the People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowering its lending rate for the first time since early 2016.
The yuan broke through the key psychological 7 per dollar rate to touch 6.9876, its strongest since Aug. 2.
But a majority of strategists polled Nov. 1-6 cautioned that the recent strength won't last in the absence of a broader deal rolling back existing tariffs imposed on China.
That trade feud with the United States has already hurt the Chinese economy. The latest official data show a slowdown in third quarter GDP growth to a near three-decade low, as the bruising U.S. trade war hit factory production.
""This (strength) does not mean the yuan would stay under the 7-level for a sustained period of time,"" said Saktiandi Supaat, head of FX research for Maybank in Singapore.
""A shift of focus back to the reality of weakening growth momentum after the deal, as well as the realization subsequent phases of the deal could be harder to achieve, may check renminbi gains and see a return back to trades above the 7 (rate).""
The latest poll of over 50 currency strategists predicted the yuan weakening about 2% to 7.15 per dollar in six months and trading at 7.10 per dollar by this time next year from around 7 per dollar on Wednesday. Still, the 12-month ahead median for the yuan was the most optimistic outlook in Reuters polls since August, when the U.S. Treasury labeled China a currency manipulator.
Beijing and Washington have been locked in a trade feud for 16 months, but hopes have risen that an initial deal may be signed soon, despite the fact no talks have been scheduled. But doubts continue over the sustainability of any agreement.
If that fails, nearly all Chinese goods imported into the United States - worth more than $500 billion - could be subjected to tariffs, potentially weakening the yuan 1.4-3.0%, strategists who answered an additional question said.
""The effect of the deal will be more lasting if talks continue to make progress, but we are skeptical about whether a full resolution can be reached any time soon,"" said Irene Cheung, senior strategist for Asia at ANZ.
Respondents in the poll also said the yuan would gain 1-2% in the immediate aftermath if the United States and China sign a partial trade deal.
The PBOC has recently changed course by strengthening the yuan over 1% after in August allowing it to fall to its weakest rate since the 2008 global recession.
On Wednesday, the PBOC set the midpoint rate at 7.0080 per dollar - the strongest since Aug. 8.
That move by the central bank suggests Beijing is trying for a temporary freeze on the trade war, which is clearly hurting both economies. ""An early sign of good faith in that regard is obviously the PBOC keeping CNY strong,"" said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank.
Rabobank has the most pessimistic forecast for the yuan - 7.75 per dollar in 12 months - a view held since August.
""It doesn't hurt China to do that if it also sends a signal that all is well and there are no U.S. dollar shortage issues.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was shackled against its major rivals on Thursday as lingering doubts about when the United States and China will sign a preliminary trade deal discouraged traders from taking big positions.
Sterling traded near a one-week low before a Bank of England meeting later on Thursday. No change in policy is expected, but investors are focused on how the BoE will respond to uncertainties posed by Britain's fraught exit from the European Union.

Many investors remain nervous about the risks to the global outlook given the Sino-U.S. trade war and Brexit show no signs of a quick resolution.

""The main catalyst for dollar buying was expectations that a U.S.-China trade deal is signed this month. If that is delayed by one month, that is not such a disappointment, but we need to see what the Chinese government has to say.""
The dollar held steady at 108.94 yen in Asia after a 0.17% decline on Wednesday.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a 16-month long trade war that rippled across financial markets, slowed global investments and growth.
Traders hope a preliminary trade agreement rolls back at least some of the tariffs, but negotiations between Washington and Beijing have been fractious, making an agreement far from certain.
The euro (EUR=D3) was quoted at $1.1070, little changed on the day following a mild 0.07% decline on Wednesday.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 97.952.
The pound traded a $1.2854, close to the lowest since Oct. 29. Against the euro (EURGBP=D3), sterling was quoted at 86.11 pence, hemmed into a narrow range.
The consensus view among economists in a Reuters poll is for the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee to vote 9-0 to keep the Bank Rate at 0.75%.
British inflation is near the BoE's 2% target and the central bank's updated forecasts on Thursday are likely to show it is expected to go higher over the next two to three years, normally a sign that the BoE thinks rate rises will be needed.
With a snap election due on Dec. 12 and a new Brexit deadline on Jan. 31, expectations are that Governor Mark Carney will steer away from giving an explicit steer on where interest rates are heading.
However, a minority of economists are betting one policymaker will cast the first vote for a rate cut since borrowing costs were lowered in August 2016, shortly after Britain voted to leave the EU, as uncertainty about Brexit poses risks to growth."

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling would receive a post-election bounce of around 3% if British voters give the ruling Conservative Party a majority in parliament on Dec. 12 but will fall 2% if the opposition Labour Party wins a majority, a Reuters poll found.
The pound has gyrated wildly since Britain decided in a June 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, see-sawing on any news about how the two sides would part ways after more than four decades together.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to live up to his promise that the country would leave the EU on Oct. 31 ""do or die"" and he instead passed legislation for a national election in an attempt to strengthen his power base.
But the December election could result in another hung parliament, and threaten to drag the Brexit debate past the latest deadline of Jan. 31.
Still, if voters return Johnson's party with a majority, raising the likelihood he will be able to get his Withdrawal Agreement ratified, sterling would immediately rise 3%, according to the poll conducted between Oct. 31 and Nov. 6.
Johnson is currently ahead in opinion polls.
The Labour Party plans to renegotiate Brexit and put the revised deal to a new referendum, something which could take months and lead to increased market uncertainty.
So if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who also has plans to nationalise key industries and is seen as less business-friendly, wins a majority the pound would fall 2%, the poll predicted.
""A Conservative majority would imply a quick approval of the Withdrawal Agreement, thus ending uncertainty about Brexit,"" said Asmara Jamaleh at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).
""A Labour majority on the contrary would add new uncertainty because they seem to want to negotiate a new Brexit divorce and then hold a referendum on whether to leave on these terms or remain, which would increase uncertainty further.""
Sterling has mostly focused on the twists and turns of Brexit, shrugging off economic data and any hints of future monetary policy from the Bank of England.
Britain's central bank looks set to sit out the global shift towards lower interest rates on Thursday, though investors will watch for any policymaker who might break ranks and vote to give the country's slowing economy more help.
That is at odds with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank who have already begun loosening policy to support growth in response to a global slowdown largely caused by the trade war between the United States and China. That policy should sap some strength from the dollar and euro.
Median forecasts in the wider poll of almost 70 foreign exchange strategists said one pound would be worth $1.28 in a month, $1.26 at the end of January and $1.32 in a year.
It was close to $1.29 on Wednesday and the forecasts give a better outlook for sterling than given in October.
Predictions of long-term strengthening suggest a deal is most forecasters' base-case scenario, but is still a long way from where sterling was trading before the 2016 referendum.
Highlighting the uncertainty, 12-month forecasts ranged from $1.10 to $1.50.
Against the euro (EURGBP=) the one-, three- and 12-month forecasts were for 87.0 pence, 88.0p and 86.0p. Those medians were stronger for sterling than in October's poll.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's persistent and confounding strength will continue well into next year, and even if a partial U.S.-China trade deal is signed it will at most knock the currency by 1-2% in the immediate aftermath, a Reuters poll found.
Renewed hopes the world's two largest economies were taking steps towards ending their 16-month trade war have pushed global stocks close to record peaks and Wall Street to all-time highs.
That risk-on attitude has led the U.S. dollar index - which measures the greenback's value against other major currencies (DXY) - to post its first monthly loss since June. But it is still up nearly 2% year-to-date.
Currency speculators have bought into the optimism and pared their bullish bets on the greenback, taking the total value of net dollar long positions to the lowest in over two months.
But that sell-the-dollar trend was not expected to continue, according to analysts in the Oct. 31-Nov. 6 Reuters poll.
""We are fearful this optimism about trade won't last. I think you've got to ask the question about phase two of the trade deal and how difficult it really will be to try and get through some of the more controversial parts of the disagreements,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.
""We do anticipate we will have more risk aversion and we could have another round of movement out of emerging markets and back into the dollar, say in the 3-6 month horizon.""
Nearly two-thirds of 56 analysts who answered an additional question said the dollar's dominance would run for at least another six months, and a quarter expected the currency to remain strong for more than two years.
That stands in stark contrast to the start of the year when a majority of analysts were confident the dollar rally was over.
Reuters Poll: U.S. dollar's dominance - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/631/627/Dollar%20dominance.png
What has probably helped the world's reserve currency - and continues to do so - is a U.S. economy that has mostly performed better than its peers and given investors good returns from dollar-denominated assets.
""In a low-volatility, low-yield world, investors are almost compelled to hold assets they get paid to hold – and the dollar is still the highest-yielding currency in the developed world,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""That's what I think has prevented the dollar selling off over the last two years in the way the consensus had expected.""
Over 40% of 63 analysts said the dollar index would weaken around 1-2% in the immediate aftermath, if a ""phase one"" trade agreement is signed by the United States and China. Only five respondents predicted a more than 2% loss.
Fifteen analysts said there would be no material change to dollar exchange rates, while 16 said the currency would strengthen 1-2%. Just one respondent expected the greenback to gain over 2%.
The dollar's better performance has led to investors piling on even more bets in favor of the greenback, making it one of the most overcrowded trades this year.
Nearly two-thirds, or 40 of 62 analysts who answered another question said that has pushed the dollar to be overvalued.
When asked by how much, 17 respondents said it was up to 5% overvalued, and another 17 said 5-10%. The remaining six said over 10%.
But dollar-denominated assets were still favoured compared to European ones, which have been underperforming.
While the year-ahead euro/dollar forecasts have gone up a sliver to $1.14 from $1.13 predicted last month, they are considerably lower than predictions made at the beginning of the year.
In January, the euro was forecast to trade around $1.20 by end-2019, over 8% higher from where it is currently trading and a level not in any analyst forecast for the next 6 months.
""We are agnostic about the prospects for an immediate or aggressive cyclical turn higher in EUR/USD, as we are not persuaded that the near-term positive factors argued by some are sufficient,"" noted analysts at JP Morgan."

777,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 11:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s yuan rallied past 7 per dollar only yesterday and analysts are already warning the strength won’t last.
The currency jumped as much as 0.60% to 6.9880 a dollar Tuesday, trading stronger than the key level for the first time since August. The offshore rate rose as much 0.66%. The level had been a key support for the currency for years until August, when the central bank allowed it to weaken past 7 for the first time in more than a decade.
China’s yuan has proven to be a good barometer of progress in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Its surge in the past month came as the two sides inched toward a deal and the greenback weakened. Still, the latest gains coincide with China’s slowest economic growth since the early 1990s -- a factor that prompted the central bank to lower one of its many interest rates on Tuesday.
“The yuan’s rally above 7 will only be temporary,” said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) AG’s Zhou Hao, the top yuan forecaster. “The MLF cut shows the Chinese central bank may see a strong currency as harmful to the economy.”
Zhou also pointed to the People’s Bank of China’s daily reference rate -- which was set weaker-than-expected in the four sessions through Tuesday -- as a factor limiting more gains. The fixing has been closely watched after the PBOC set it weaker than 7 per dollar in August, shattering a psychological barrier that officials had spent years defending.
The central bank set the daily reference rate at 7.0080 on Wednesday, slightly stronger than predicted. The offshore yuan gained 0.05% to 6.9989 after the fixing.
The Chinese currency has now rebounded 2.4% since it fell to the weakest level since 2008 in early September. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday that reaching a phase-one deal will help rebuild trust between the two sides and could serve as a precursor to more talks.
“The easing trade tensions helped to override the downside surprises seen in the dreary China domestic economic data and have contributed to a convincing rally on the yuan,” said Stephen Innes, a strategist at AxiTrader Ltd.
While  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists say the yuan might strengthen toward 6.9 if Washington agrees to roll back tariffs imposed on Chinese goods in September, Li Liuyang, an analyst at China Merchants Bank Co. said doubts will remain until a deal has been finalized.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA’s Jason Daw says the yuan is more likely to weaken to 7.2 in the coming months, rather than strengthen to 6.8. That means there’s no point chasing the rally now, he wrote in a Wednesday note.

780,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 05:45PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The yen has been the worst-performing major currency in the past month as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit sapped demand for havens. Another reason it is declining is more curious: increased trading of Japanese stocks by overseas investors.
The dynamics work like this: foreign funds have boosted trading of Japanese shares but they are unwilling to take on currency risk at the same time. For that reason they choose to hedge purchases for foreign-exchange movements, which typically involve selling yen via forward contracts that roll over periodically. This constant renewal of hedging creates a steady drip-feed of negative pressure on the yen.
“Most foreign investors in Japan’s stock market are hedge funds and their pairing of equities trading with the yen is a significant factor,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The Japanese stock market is a great place for short-term dealing with its deep liquidity and well-established infrastructure for high-frequency trades.”
The proportion of Japanese share trading by overseas funds has climbed to the highest in almost a decade and they now account for more than 60% of transactions, according to data from Japan Exchange Group Inc. The dominance of overseas funds is even more pronounced in derivatives, where they are responsible for almost 80% equity futures transactions.
“Overseas speculators usually try to avoid taking both equity and currency risks,” said Takahiro Sekido, a former Bank of Japan official who is now a strategist at MUFG Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “Their currency hedging supports the inverse correlation between the yen and Japanese stocks.”
Hedging is typically done by selling currency forwards or combining purchases of a currency in the spot market with a simultaneous sale in the forward market, known as a foreign-exchange swap. Such transactions between Tokyo-based banks and offshore market participants have more than doubled since 2006, data from the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market Committee show.
The increase in hedging -- along with the waning of haven demand and the Bank of Japan’s accommodative monetary policy -- has seen the yen weaken 1.8% against the dollar in the past month. The currency dropped to 109.29 per dollar last week, the lowest since Aug. 1, before trading at 108.87 late on Tuesday in Tokyo.
The increase in overseas trading of Japanese stocks and the related currency hedging is playing into another long-running theme: an inverse correlation between the yen and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.
The inverse correlation, which has prevailed almost continuously since 2006, is now close to the highest since November 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."
781,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 05:43PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand’s battle to keep its surging currency at bay is increasing the odds of a second interest-rate cut this year.
The Bank of Thailand is set to reduce its benchmark policy rate Wednesday by 25 basis points to 1.25%, matching a record low, according to 16 of 26 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The rest expect the rate to stay at 1.5%.
In the spotlight is the baht’s 9.2% climb against the dollar in the past year -- the strongest in emerging markets, and in defiance of periodic foreign exchange intervention by the Bank of Thailand, an August interest-rate cut and efforts to stem short-term inflows.
“The urgency seems to be more now,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, who changed her view for the rate cut timing to Wednesday from December. She sees such a policy easing as “tantamount to the central bank’s signaling its discomfort with a strong baht.”
Still, Rao says, a cut “might lower the baht’s yield appeal, but it will be no panacea.”
Sluggish growth and inflation also have tipped the scales for some analysts now eyeing a rate cut at Wednesday’s meeting.
“With growth significantly disappointing the BOT’s latest forecasts, and inflation further undershooting its target, we now expect the BOT to deliver a 25 basis-point policy rate cut” this week versus an earlier forecast of December, Charnon Boonnuch and Euben Paracuelles, economists at Nomura Singapore Ltd., wrote in a Nov. 1 research note.
Here’s what to watch for in the statement:
Currency Gains
The hit to exports and tourism from currency strength has put the economy on course for the slowest growth in five years. The central bank has said it’s planning to ease rules on capital outflows in a further effort to restrain the baht’s surge.
At the same time, speculation is growing that the country could be added to a watchlist of potential currency manipulators in a forthcoming U.S. report on the foreign-exchange policies of key trading partners.
Such a step would complicate currency and monetary policy, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). The U.S. on Oct. 25 said it will suspend $1.3 billion in trade benefits for the Asian nation, which some analysts interpreted as a warning shot.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Nov. 4 the planned suspension had been blown out of proportion, with the Thai government adding that the U.S. agreed to reconsider the step.
Thailand, which ran a $19.6 billion goods surplus with the U.S. in the 12 months through August, denies intervening in the foreign-exchange market for an unfair advantage in trade. The central bank has said it only acts against excessive baht swings.
Low Inflation
Coinciding with the baht strength is a consistent dip in inflation, with the consumer price index remaining stubbornly below the 1% to 4% goal for five months.
The monetary authority intends to narrow the target but has yet to reveal the proposed new range.
Financial Stability
The Bank of Thailand has continued to flag financial stability risks, with lingering concern that consumer debt could be bubbling, including for homes and automobiles.
Bangkok Bank Pcl Chief Economist Burin Adulwattana said the economic slowdown is overshadowing these fears.
“Financial stability risks aren’t a key concern for the economy now,” said Burin, who expects a reduction in borrowing costs sometime in the fourth quarter. “Cutting rates won’t significantly boost household debt.”"

China President Xi Jinping stressed on Tuesday China’s commitment to global trade and said that the country would “open its doors only wider” to the world, but did not make any mention of ending the trade war with the U.S., which has dragged on for more than 16 months. 
China is pushing the U.S. to remove some of the tariffs imposed in September as part of the phase one trade deal that the two nations are hoping to sign before the end of the year, according to various reports. It's unclear how much it would give up in return.

Reuters reported that China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September as part of a ""phase one"" trade deal expected to be signed later this month at a yet-to-be determined location.
Both countries have slapped tariffs on each other's goods in a trade war that has dragged on for 16 months.
""There may have been some expectations that the U.S. may postpone the remaining tariffs, which are due to kick in on Dec. 15. But if it goes further by rolling back existing tariffs, that would not only benefit the economy but would also make the truce seem more permanent,"" said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.

The official interest rate was kept on hold at 0.75%. “The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending,” RBA governor Philip Lowe said. “Other sources of uncertainty include the effects of the drought and the evolution of the housing construction cycle.”

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) slipped to 51.1 last month, matching February’s low and edging down from September’s 51.3. 
Separately, the People’s Bank of China slashed the interest rate on its medium-term lending facility on Tuesday for the first time since early 2016.
The rate was lowered by 5 basis points to 3.25% from 3.30% previously. 
The USD/JPY pair gained 0.2% to 108.80. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept policy steady but tweaked its forward guidance to say the central bank will maintain ultra-low rates or even cutting them for as long as needed.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said “(The new forward guidance) does not limit additional monetary easing measures to rate cuts.”
“There is no change to our understanding that, besides lowering policy rates, there are various possible measures for additional easing,” he said in a speech.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, Washington and Beijing indicated late last week that progress had been made on agreeing to a trade deal, with U.S. officials suggesting that a deal could be signed this month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday thanks to growing optimism the United States and China are on the verge of reaching a preliminary agreement to scale back their bruising trade war.
The yen and the Swiss franc, two currencies that are often bought as safe havens during times of economic or political strife, nursed losses as investors became more comfortable taking on risk.
The Australian dollar traded near its lowest in about a week before a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting later on Tuesday. Monetary policy is likely to be kept steady, but an accompanying statement may provide clues to how much further rates could fall.
In recent days, Beijing and Washington have given encouraging signs of progress in trade talks. The U.S. government is considering dropping some tariffs on Chinese goods, the Financial Times reported on Monday.
Bloomberg also reported that China is reviewing locations in the United States where he could sign a so-called ""Phase 1"" trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Both countries have slapped tariffs on each other's goods in a trade war that has dragged on for 16 months and raised the specter of a global recession.
Any progress in resolving the row could potentially boost the dollar and riskier assets, ease concern about the economic outlook and reduce the need for aggressive monetary easing.
""The mood is very much risk on, so that's how investors will approach the market,"" said Minori Uchida, head of global market research at MUFG Bank in Tokyo.
""We're getting some positive news about trade talks. This is all supportive of the dollar, and this trend could continue.""
The dollar rose 0.12% to 108.70 yen in early trade in Asia, adding to a 0.4% gain on Monday.
The U.S. currency was a shade higher at 0.9886 Swiss Franc following a 0.2% gain in the previous session.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of six major currencies stood at 97.556, close to its highest in almost a week.
In the offshore market, the yuan edged slightly higher to 7.0255 per dollar underpinned by hopes for a trade deal.
Currency traders are also waiting for the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing report due later on Tuesday, which is forecast to show activity accelerated slightly in October.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year, but recent data suggest the U.S. economic outlook is not as bad as some had feared - another positive for the dollar.

Huawei had been blacklisted on national security grounds amid concerns from the White House over its connection to the Chinese government, a move that many linked to the broader trade war with China.

787,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s rand and bonds rose after the country clung to its last investment-grade credit rating.
The currency gained 1.7% to 14.7853 per dollar by 11:37 a.m. in Johannesburg, the most on a closing basis in more than three weeks, and paring its loss since the end of June to 4.7%. The yield on rand-denominated government bonds fell the most since early 2018 and stocks advanced.
Moody’s Investors Service on Friday held back from downgrading the government’s debt to junk, although it did lower the outlook to negative. This came even after the country released budget forecasts last week that showed its financial situation deteriorating rapidly.
Moody’s kept the nation’s foreign- and local-currency readings at Baa3, one step above speculative grade. South Africa is already rated junk by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, both of which shifted to non-investment grade in 2017.
The yield on bonds due December 2026 declined 15 basis points to 8.41% and the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index climbed 0.2%, with banking stocks among the biggest contributors to the move. The rand’s one-week implied volatility versus the dollar dropped 288 basis points to 12.9%, indicating that options traders are expecting price swings to moderate.
If Moody’s does cut, South Africa will be excluded for the FTSE World Government Bond Index. That would trigger outflows of as much as $15 billion from the rand-bond market, according to Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp., at a time when the nation needs portfolio investment to finance its current-account deficit, one of the largest among major emerging markets.
A downgrade would also raise borrowing costs and make it tougher for the government to balance the budget.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). expects a downgrade after a budget statement in February, though it says outflows from funds tracking the WGBI may total just $1.5 billion.
South Africa’s Finance Minister Tito Mboweni responded to the Moody’s announcement by saying the country needed tough reforms to fix its fiscal problems and debt-laden state companies such as Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.
“It is now or never,” he said. “Government, labor, business and civil society, we need each other more than ever before.”
Eskom Woes
The country is spending 138 billion rand ($9.2 billion) to bail out Eskom, the power utility that is saddled with 450 billion rand of debt. Regular blackouts caused economic output to contract the most in a decade in the first quarter and prompted the Treasury to slash its growth forecast for this year to 0.5%.
“South Africa has been a car crash in slow motion,” Cristian Maggio, London-based head of emerging-market strategy at TD Securities, said ahead of the market open. “We’re still at a point where that car has not hit that wall, but you can definitely see that’s where they’re going.”
Still, Moody’s decision to change South Africa’s outlook but not its rating was what most participants in a Bloomberg survey expected.
Against a global backdrop of negative yields, South Africa’s local-currency bonds “stand out for the still-elevated real rates being offered,” said Phoenix Kalen, an analyst at SocGen in London. “Over a short-time horizon, investors may be tempted into holding South African assets for the carry.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Major currencies started the week quietly with a holiday in Tokyo making for thin trading conditions and investors waiting to hear the first official speech from the new head of the European Central Bank later in the session.
The dollar had tried to rally on Friday after U.S. payrolls beat expectations, but was undone by a soft manufacturing survey which left it looking heavy.
The euro started the week firm at $1.1168 (EUR=) as bulls looked to test the October peak of $1.1179 and the 200‑day moving average at $1.1195.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was stuck at 97.218 (DXY) having touched a three-month low at 97.107 on Friday. It was now targeting the August trough of 97.033.
The dollar fared a little better on the yen as safe havens fell from fashion, edging up to 108.23 from Friday's low around 107.87.
Sterling remained well bid at $1.2935 , after last month's rally from $1.2200, as investors wagered there was less risk of a hard Brexit now that an election campaign was underway.
One of the few movers was the South African rand, which rose as investors were seemingly relieved that Moody's had only downgraded the ratings outlook for the country's debt on Friday and did not cut it to junk as some had feared.

Hungary, which has followed a go-it-alone mix of economic policies since Prime Minister Viktor Orban rose to power in 2010, is not member of the euro zone and does not have a target date for euro adoption.
The government and the central bank have said Hungary should not join the euro before its economy is sufficiently strong.
Now NBH Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said time has come for Europe to ""seek a way out of the euro trap"".
""There is a harmful dogma that the euro was the 'normal' next step towards unifying Western Europe. But the common European currency was not normal at all, because almost none of the preconditions were met,"" he said in the opinion piece published on Sunday.
""Two decades after the euro's launch, most of the necessary pillars of a successful global currency — a common state, a budget covering at least 15-20 percent of the euro zone's total gross domestic product, a euro zone finance minister and a ministry to go with the post — are still missing,"" he added.
Matolcsy, who was appointed for a second six-year term as head of the central bank earlier this year, said members should be allowed to leave the euro zone in the coming decades and those remaining should build a ""more sustainable global currency"".
He also said the 1992 Maastricht treaty, which sets out the conditions for joining the euro, one of which is keeping the budget deficit below 3% of economic output, should be rewritten.
Hungary has been running a budget deficit below the EU's 3% ceiling.
Orban's right-wing nationalist government has also gradually shifted Hungary's debt programme to forint-denominated paper, aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign currency debt."

Trade developments will also continue to remain in the spotlight, amid persistent concerns over the effect of trade tensions on the global economic outlook.
The dollar was lower in late trade on Friday after data showed a mixed view on the economy, and as optimism that the U.S. and China will reach a deal to end their trade war reduced safe-haven demand for the greenback.
The dollar initially gained after U.S. jobs growth slowed less than expected in October, while wages gained and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated.
The U.S. currency was unable to hold onto the gains, however, and was further dented after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said the manufacturing sector contracted for the third consecutive month in October.
The U.S. dollar index against a basket of six major currencies fell to 97.01, down 0.14% on the day. It earlier rose to 97.26 on the jobs data. For the week, the index was down 0.6%.
The dollar has weakened since the Fed on Wednesday cut interest rates for the third time this year, and indicated that further reductions may not be forthcoming.
Concerns about a slowing American economy is weighing on the greenback, however, with the U.S. central bank expected to resume rate cuts if the economic data worsens.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday that the rate cuts put into effect leave the U.S. economy better armed to withstand the risks of a global slowdown.
Safe-haven flows into the U.S. currency have also weakened on optimism that the U.S. and China are close to reaching a deal to end their trade war.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made progress on a variety of issues during a telephone call on Friday with China’s Vice Premier Liu He about an interim trade agreement, USTR said in a statement on Friday.
The euro was 0.14% higher against the greenback late Friday, for a weekly gain of 0.8%. The British pound was little changed late Friday, but still ended the week 0.9% higher.
The dollar was higher against the yen in late trade, paring the week’s losses to 0.43%.

A gauge of swings in the currency over the next two months is hovering near six-week lows, on receding fears of a no-deal Brexit and signs that a Conservative Party victory could help to stabilize British politics. Yet if the 2017 snap election is anything to go by, the rough and tumble of the campaign could still throw the pound off course.
Options currently show the market cooling off following the most turbulent month for the pound in nearly three years. Realized volatility surged as traders braced for a chaotic exit from the European Union in October, then saw the prospect vanish as Britain secured a third extension, this time until Jan. 31.
Despite the immediate calm, volatility could climb if polling points to a resurgent socialist Labour Party or a hung Parliament that could prolong the stalemate in Westminster. Two-month volatility jumped when then-Prime Minister Theresa May announced in April 2017 that a snap poll would be held in June the same year. Yet it quickly reversed course and hit fresh cycle lows, before rising again as the election loomed into view.
“All we can say at this point is, with the Tories no longer the party of no deal, Tories up in the polls is good and Labour up is bad,” said Adam Cole, head of currency strategy at RBC Europe. “We’re stuck in a $1.2750-$1.3000 range until we get a steer either from the polls starting to shift, or the major parties shifting policy.”
Concerns about a no-deal Brexit sent the U.K. currency briefly below $1.22 on Oct. 8, only for the pound to enjoy its best two-day run in a decade days later when the potential for a divorce deal sent sterling flying.
Short- and medium-term positioning turned more balanced after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson won lawmakers’ backing for his Brexit deal. Appetite for longer term volatility eased further when he secured an election for Dec. 12.
Demand for options trades that will pay off following a large swing in the pound before Nov. 31 currently stands near a two-month low. According to Bloomberg’s options-pricing model, there is a 70% probability that the pound will trade within a 1.2650-1.3250 range against the dollar in November.

Those hopes rested largely on a Chinese business survey by Caixin/IHS Markit, which showed the strongest improvement in operating conditions for Chinese manufacturers since February 2017. Output and new orders both expanded at steeper rates, with the latter supported by a renewed increase in export business.
That contrasted sharply with a more gloomy reading from the state-compiled PMI earlier in the week, which showed continued weakness.
Other purchasing manager indexes from around Asia showed the world’s manufacturing continuing to struggle, with Indonesia’s falling to a four-year low, Taiwan’s slipping into contraction territory and South Korea’s staying in negative territory despite a modest increase.
Japan’s showed manufacturing output falling for a 10th straight month. Even so, the yen strengthened to a three-week high of 107.95 against the dollar by 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT).
Among European currencies, EUR/USD and GBP/USD both benefited from dollar weakness ahead of what is expected to be a complicated set of U.S. labor market numbers at 8:30 AM ET. The headline nonfarm payrolls growth number is expected to fall to 89,000, due largely to the impact of the strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM). That will put more focus than usual on wage developments, where average hourly earnings and hours worked are expected to stay unchanged from September.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates this week for the third time this year and indicated that further monetary easing is unlikely, citing several pockets of strength in the U.S. economy.
However, the Fed's hawkish tone has failed to put a floor under the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields, which suggests some investors do not share the central bank's confidence in the economic outlook due to risks posed by the trade war.
""The Fed is expected to be on hold in December, but the markets are trying to price in a rate cut next year, because people doubt that talks to end the trade war will go smoothly,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.

The nation is on course to lose its position as the world’s second-biggest rice exporter if the situation doesn’t improve, Chookiat Ophaswongse, president of the Thai Rice Exporters Association, said in an interview.
“It’s killing us all,” he said Thursday in Bangkok. “We don’t know what else we can do. We tried reducing costs, but the baht keeps making our rice more expensive. We can only just sit and wait, and some might have to quit the business.”
The rice industry is a crucial one for Thailand because of the sheer number of people who depend on it for their livelihoods. The industry supports as much as 30% of the country’s 69 million population, according to Chookiat.
The baht has strengthened more than 9% against the dollar in the past year, the most in emerging markets, leaving rice exports exposed to more competition from large producers like India, Vietnam and China.
Thai white rice is selling at $425 per ton, but that figure would be about $380 per ton if the baht was at the same level now as this time last year, according to the association. The trade body includes 75% of all rice exporters in Thailand.
“The industry is heading toward a dead end,” Chookiat said. “We can’t compete anymore.”"

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is on course to get the general election he wants on his preferred date of December 12 after winning crucial votes in the House of Commons.
With Brexit on hold until the end of January, and Johnson unable to get his divorce deal through Parliament, the U.K.’s political leaders now believe a snap poll is the only way to resolve the crisis paralyzing the country. The vote is set to become a proxy referendum on European Union membership.
Key Developments:
Johnson won a vote in the House of Commons for a bill to set the date of the next election as Dec. 12 by 438 to 20. MPs voted 315 to 295 to reject a Labour bid for the election to be held on Dec. 9Election Bill now passes to the House of LordsTen Tories who were kicked out of the party for opposing Johnson’s Brexit strategy have been re-admittedMPs Approve Dec. 12 General Election (8:25 p.m.)
MPs agreed to hold a general election on Dec. 12, voting in favor of Boris Johnson’s bill by a margin of 438 to 20.
The prime minister earlier saw off an attempt by opposition parties to change the date to Dec. 9 (see 8 p.m.).
The bill now heads to the House of Lords, where it can still be amended. The unelected upper chamber typically yields to the view of the lower one – meaning that an early general election is now a near certainty.
MPs Reject Election Date of Dec. 9 (8 p.m.)
MPs rejected a bid by the opposition Labour Party to change the proposed election date to Dec. 9 from Dec. 12. The amendment to change the date was defeated by 315 votes to 295.
Opposition politicians had argued an earlier date would make it more likely that students would be able to vote, as many universities break up for the holiday in the week of Dec. 9.
But the government won the day with its argument that the earlier date would make it hard to pass vital legislation relating to Northern Ireland before Parliament dissolves (See 6 p.m.)
Johnson Flexible on Date, Official Says (6:40 p.m.)
The wrangling over the date of the election is continuing, but Boris Johnson is not tied to his preferred date of Dec. 12 at all costs.
MPs in the House of Commons are now discussing Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to move the election date to Dec. 9.
While it’s difficult to wrap up Parliamentary business in time for a Dec. 9 election, the premier would probably not abandon his plan if that date were forced on him by Parliament, a Tory official said.
This all points to an election being agreed to by Tuesday night.
Ten Expelled Tories Back in the Fold (6:30 p.m.)
Johnson met in private with 10 of the 21 MPs Conservative MPs who were thrown of the party for opposing his Brexit strategy and they have been re-admitted, a party spokesman said.
They include two former Cabinet ministers: Greg Clark and Caroline Nokes. Some of the other notable names are Alistair Burt, Nicholas Soames -- the grandson of Winston Churchill, Stephen Hammond and Margot James. The door has been left open for others to be brought back as well, the spokesman said.
The development is good news for Johnson as it points to some of the former rebels planning to vote with the government and may help to heal rifts in the party.
What does the EU make of all this? (6:15 p.m.)
Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said a prospective snap election in the U.K. won’t have a material effect on the concrete negotiations involving Brexit.
“The problems to be solved remain the same -- and the solutions would also be the same,” Barnier told Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
“We spent two years negotiating a 600-page treaty with Theresa May. With Boris Johnson we negotiated for a comparatively short amount of time,” he said. May was “courageous and tenacious,” and Johnson is “also tenacious and a strong character,” he said.
Govt. Rejects Changing Election Day (6 p.m.)
Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Dowden said if MPs opt for a Dec. 9 election, as proposed in an amendment, there’s a “real danger” nurses, teachers and police officers in Northern Ireland won’t get paid after the end of the month as there won’t be time to approve a budget for the province.
A Dec. 12 election “gives Parliament enough time to progress essential business, and specifically the Northern Ireland budget Bill,” Dowden said.
Asked twice whether it would be possible for the House of Commons to sit on Friday in order to ensure the Northern Ireland legislation goes through, he replied that the bill needed to be “properly” considered.
Early Election Bill Proceeds to Next Stage (5:45 p.m.)
The House of Commons just gave approval in principle to the government’s bill calling for an early general election. There was no need for a vote, and the bill passed its so-called second reading on the nod. It now goes to the committee stage, when it can be amended.
Parliament Won’t Vote on Expanding Electorate (5:20 p.m.)
Deputy House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rejected proposals to lower the voting age to 16 and to give EU nationals living in the U.K. a vote in the upcoming general election. The government said it would pull its election bill rather than accept either measure.
The only amendment Hoyle selected was Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to change the date of the election from Dec. 12 to Dec. 9. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party have indicated they would support such a move. The government said it wouldn’t rule out a vote on Dec. 9, but said it would be a rush.
Farewell and Good Luck from Tusk (4:30 p.m.)
EU Council President Donald Tusk warned that the Brexit extension to Jan. 31 ‘may be the last one,’ after announcing the bloc has formally adopted its decision to allow a delay.
“Please make the best use of this time,” Tusk said in a tweet. “I will keep my fingers crossed for you.”
Ex-Tories Add Backing to Votes at 16 (3:40 p.m.)
At least four former Conservative MPs have signed a proposed amendment that would expand the electoral roll to include 16 and 17 year olds.
Anna Soubry, who quit the party in February, and Guto Bebb, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve, who were expelled in September for rebelling against Johnson’s Brexit plans, have all put their name to an amendment by Labour backbencher Stephen Doughty calling for the change.
But the issue may not come to a vote. The list of amendments chosen for debate will be announced sometime after 5:45 p.m.
Johnson to Pull Bill If Franchise Amendments Pass (3:20 p.m.)
Boris Johnson would abandon his attempt to hold a general election next month if amendments are passed to allow EU nationals and 16-year-olds to vote, his spokesman told reporters in Westminster.
Expanding the franchise would be a bad idea and would force a six-month delay until there can be a national vote, the spokesman said.
But he said the prime minister may press on if MPs vote to hold the election on Dec. 9 instead of Dec. 12. A vote on Dec. 9 would be a rush but the government isn’t ruling it out, he said.
It’s unclear which amendments the speaker will select, so these issues may not come to a vote.
Lib Dems and SNP Back Votes at 16 (3:10 p.m.)
The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party will join Labour in backing any amendment to allow 16-year-olds and EU nationals with settled status in the U.K. to vote in the general election, according to a Lib Dem official.
The Liberal Democrat stance is a change from Monday, when party officials briefed they were likely to abstain on any such amendment. That’s because, while they want 16-year olds to have the vote, they think there isn’t time to change the electoral register in time for a December election.
Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, reminded lawmakers that EU citizens are already on the electoral roll for local elections so it would be easy to give them votes in a general election.
Corbyn Backs Expansion of Electorate (2:50 p.m.)
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he will back amendments to allow 16-year-olds and EU nationals with settled status in the U.K. to vote in the general election.
If the measures pass, it could torpedo the legislation, and therefore the early national poll.
Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, earlier told reporters that the Electoral Commission recommends changes to the electoral register shouldn’t be made less than 6 months before a vote, and that the government has no plans to expand the franchise.
Johnson Makes Case For Early Vote (2:35 p.m.)
Boris Johnson made his case for an early election in the House of Commons, saying the current crop of members wouldn’t vote through his Withdrawal Agreement Bill and accusing opposition MPs of not wanting to deliver Brexit.
“There is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism,” he told the chamber. “That is, Mr speaker, to refresh this Parliament and to give people a choice.”
MPs Vote to Allow Amendments to Election Bill (2:20 p.m.)
MPs backed the amendment by Labour backbencher Stella Creasy (see 2:10 p.m.) enabling them to add changes to Boris Johnson’s bill to force through a general election.
The government had sought to by bypass normal Parliamentary rules and limit the opportunity for rank-and-file lawmakers to change the proposed law.
It now opens up the bill to possible amendments, including from those who want to change the date of the election, or to add 16 and 17-year-olds and EU nationals to the electorate.
MPs Voting to Allow Election Bill Amendments (2:10 p.m.)
MPs are voting on an amendment to the government’s schedule for proceeding with the general election bill in the House of Commons.
In essence, the amendment, proposed by Labour backbencher Stella Creasy, would allow MPs to amend the legislation calling for an early general election. The government is trying to bypass normal Parliamentary rules to speed its passage through parliament.
Creasy said her amendment aims merely to put the concept of “fair play” back in the Commons. “What the government was trying to do, in simple terms, was rig today’s debate,” she told lawmakers. “Letting this program motion go through without the full list of rules, is like letting Lance Armstrong keep all his medals.”
Election Bill Presented to Parliament (1:45 p.m.)
The bill calling for an early general election has been presented in Parliament – what’s called its first reading. That’s just a formality. MPs have 6 hours to get it through all of its stages in the House of Commons.
That includes a vote on second reading – expected by about 6 p.m. and then debate on possible amendments at what’s called the committee stage of the bill. If it stays to schedule, the final vote should be no later than 7:45 p.m.
OBR Forecasts Still Due on Nov. 7 (12:45 p.m.)
The government’s fiscal watchdog said it will still publish its economic forecasts on Nov. 7, even though Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid’s Budget the day before has been canceled.
The forecasts, which were due to be presented in response to the Budget, will include updated assessments of the impact of the Brexit deal Boris Johnson agreed with the EU on Oct. 17. Javid has ruled out publishing any government impact assessments of the deal.
In a letter to the Treasury, Robert Chote, Chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said it is required by law to publish at least two forecasts per year and will go ahead with its plans.
Chote said in his letter that the new deal is unlikely to have made a ""significant quantitative difference” compared to the last forecast in March, which was based on Theresa May’s deal and assumed a transition period to Dec. 2020.
Johnson Will Consider Other Election Dates (12:30 p.m.)
Boris Johnson is open to considering other dates for a general election, but doesn’t consider a poll on Dec. 9 as logistically possible, his spokesman James Slack told reporters in Westminster.
That means Dec. 10 or 11 could emerge as the date for a pre-Christmas election, rather than the Dec. 12 vote proposed by the prime minister.
Slack also said that Johnson wouldn’t countenance the lowering of the voting age to 16, or the inclusion of EU nationals in the vote, both of which have been proposed by opposition parties. Even if he supported the changes, there would be practical issues with either happening in time for an election next month, Slack said.
Mixed Reaction to Election From Labour MPs (11:50 a.m.)
Not all Labour MPs seem happy about Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to back a general election.
Darren Jones, who represents a constituency in Bristol, tweeted a painting of the Charge of the Light Brigade – one of Britain’s best-known military disasters. Another, Ben Bradshaw said an election shouldn’t be a tool to resolve Brexit. “A general election is about everything about governing the country,” he told the BBC.
But others threw their support behind the plan. Laura Pidcock tweeted “BRING IT ON,” while Clive Lewis tweeted an abbreviated version of the same message: “bring it.”
‘It’s Time,’ Corbyn Says (11:30 a.m.)
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that his party will back a general election, confirming earlier statements from his office (see 10:50 a.m.). “It’s time,” he said.
Pound Erases Loss With Election Likely (11:10 a.m.)
The pound reversed an earlier decline as traders judged a vote in Parliament on an early election vote was likely to pass with the Labour Party’s backing (see 10:50 a.m.). The currency gained as much as 0.1% to $1.2873 before paring gains.
Market participants judge a snap poll could bring back a Conservative majority and end the Brexit deadlock, according to Nomura International Plc analyst Jordan Rochester.
Corbyn Backs December Election (10:50 a.m.)
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated his party will back a general election in December, meaning Johnson will be able to go to the polls by the end of the year.
Corbyn told his team: “For the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met,” according to a statement. “We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.”
The parties are haggling over the date of the election, with a day between Dec. 9 and Dec. 12 currently on the table. Amendments to Johnson’s bill are being written now.
Trust Is Key as SNP Deliberates Over Election (10:45 a.m.)
Scottish National Party MPs are scrutinizing the contents of the government’s election bill ahead of a debate later today, according to a spokesman.
The party wants an election, but its lawmakers don’t trust Boris Johnson to keep to his word, he said.
Government Offers Dec. 11 to Win Lib Dem Support (10 a.m.)
The negotiations have begun in Westminster ahead of the vote on Boris Johnson’s plan for a Dec. 12 general election. With the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party seeking a Dec. 9 poll, a U.K. official said the government has offered Dec. 11 as a compromise.
A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said the party is looking at the offer.
The government needs some opposition votes to reach a simple majority for its election bill to pass, but it also wants to avoid amendments being attached to the legislation.
Students’ Vacation Key to Election Date Battle (9 a.m.)
The biggest sticking point in Boris Johnson’s bid for a Dec. 12 general election is the date itself. Two smaller opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, whose support could be key to the government’s chances, want an earlier poll on Dec. 9 to ensure students are still at their universities to cast their ballots.
Liberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna told BBC radio on Tuesday his party would not accept Dec. 12. But Conservative minister Brandon Lewis said Dec. 12 is the “right date” and accused the opposition parties of seeking to stop Brexit altogether. The government has said it needs time before Parliament breaks up for an election to secure key Northern Ireland legislation.
Johnson lacks a majority in Parliament, so will need at least some opposition votes to secure an early election. But the Liberal Democrats and SNP, both staunchly pro-EU and anti-Brexit, regard students as a key constituency.
Meanwhile, even though the main opposition Labour Party abstained in Monday’s vote on a snap poll, their position appeared to be softening on Tuesday. Labour’s trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, hinted his party could back a Dec. 9 election, telling BBC radio: “The first thing is to make sure that students are not disenfranchised by the date of the election.”
Hammond: Election Will Usher in Tory Hardliners (8:30 a.m.)
Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who is still suspended from the party after defying Boris Johnson over Brexit, warned an election would usher in “hardliner” pro-Leave MPs to the Tory benches.
“I fear that the real narrative here is that the Vote Leave activists, the cohort that has seized control in Downing Street -- and to some extent in the headquarters of the Conservative Party -- wants this general election to change the shape of the Conservative Party in Parliament,” Hammond told BBC radio.
Hammond also disputed the government’s narrative that he and other expelled Tories, and MPs in general, are the ones blocking Brexit. The House of Commons voted in favor of the initial passage of Johnson’s Brexit bill before the government pulled the legislation over its failure to win backing for an accelerated timetable, Hammond said.
Rees-Mogg: No Plan to Bring Brexit Bill Back (Earlier)
In his business statement to Parliament late Tuesday, Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government wants to get the early election bill through all stages of the House of Commons on Tuesday.
He also said the government had no plan to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement Bill -- the legislation that puts the Brexit deal into U.K. law -- before Parliament breaks up for the election. That’s a key demand of the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, who opened up the legislative route to an early election when they expressed willingness to vote for a snap poll, subject to Brexit not being concluded beforehand.
According to Tuesday’s House of Commons order paper, debate on the election bill is due to begin at 12:30 p.m. -- subject to ministerial statements and urgent questions -- and can continue “until any hour.”

Pound traders are unlikely to find that the promise of a December U.K. election provides an escape from the Brexit maze.
The currency pared losses after the Labour Party backed government plans for an early poll, before lawmakers vote on the decision later Tuesday. An election is unlikely to send the pound plunging with the Conservatives ahead in the polls, strategists say, yet there is enough uncertainty around the result and the Brexit outcome that it also won’t prompt a huge rally.
“The most severe of the longer-term structural risks facing the U.K. -- a no-deal crash out -- have all but evaporated,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “There is a lot of good news in the price, and the balance of headlines may not be as constructive once we head into an election cycle.”
The pound is headed for its best month against the dollar since January 2018, with no-deal Brexit risk reduced after lawmakers voted to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline. The likely election now looks set to become a proxy vote on European Union membership.
The pound rose 0.1% to $1.2878 on Tuesday, and climbed 0.2% to 86.16 pence per euro. The yield on U.K.10-year government bonds held steady at 0.72%.
Wary Investors
Even as polls suggest a Tory-led government is the most likely outcome, the market will be mindful of risks around Jeremy Corbyn. Investors have long been wary of a government led by the left-wing Labour leader, who is seen nationalizing parts of the economy, boosting borrowing and redistributing income.
There is also the question of how the two main parties position themselves on Brexit. If Labour opts to campaign on a platform of no Brexit or an arrangement where Britain maintains close ties with the EU, while the Conservatives go for a departure at any cost, volatility will likely pick up into the vote, according to Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG).
“I wouldn’t expect a large market reaction in pound spot rates,” said Nguyen. “Rather, I think we will see a repricing on options markets, factoring in an increased political risk around the date of the elections.”
Option pricing has been subdued in recent days, with implied volatility in the pound staying low in the shorter and longer term. This suggests traders foresee smaller jumps in the currency, reflecting optimism about the fading risk of no-deal, contained by pessimism caused by simmering political uncertainty.
Persistent question marks over Brexit itself could also keep a lid on the pound. Traders may also shift their attention to the risk of the second phase of Brexit negotiations when Britain will have to decide its future relationship with the EU.
“The capacity for sterling to enjoy a major relief rally that ‘it’s over’ may be more constrained than others may think because, let’s face it, it’s not over,” said Toronto-Dominion’s Rumpeltin. “Not by a long shot.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Both the dollar and riskier Asian currencies held on to modest overnight gains on Tuesday, amid hopes for an easing in Sino-U.S. trade tensions and as investors waited for direction from this week's Federal Reserve meeting.
U.S. President Donald Trump said a trade agreement looked to be ahead of schedule on Monday, without detailing the timing, while the U.S. also said it was studying whether to extend tariff suspensions due to expire in December.
That followed remarks late last week from both U.S. and Chinese officials saying they were ""close to finalising"" a deal that lifted trade-exposed currencies such as the Australian dollar, while weighing on safe-havens such as the Japanese yen.
The mood cautiously held on Tuesday.
The Aussie kept its gains to stand just under a five-day peak at $0.6842, while the greenback held on to its progress against the yen to stand at 108.96 yen per dollar, just below a three-month high hit overnight.
""So far the soundings coming from both the U.S. and China point to the likelihood of significant progress,"" said Rodrigo Catril, National Australia Bank's senior FX strategist.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cubans flocked to a dozen shops that opened in Havana on Monday selling home appliances and spare parts for cars in dollars, as the cash-strapped government struggles to rake in tradable currency to purchase imports and pay its debts.
Washing machines, refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, TVs, electric motorcycles, car batteries, tires and other goods were priced well below similar offers at other state stores, when available for sale in the government's local dollar equivalent, the convertible peso.
Cuba's inefficient state-run economy is going through a liquidity crisis due to the implosion of ally Venezuela's economy and the tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo under President Donald Trump.
The country is dependent on fuel, food and other imports it must purchase for tradable international currencies it earns from exports of goods and services such as sugar, tourism and technical assistance, which are all in decline. 
Shortages of everything from fuel to food and medicines have plagued the country this year.
Joel Palomino, an education professor who rents out a room in his home to tourists, said he had been waiting in line at a store in the Vedado district since dawn to buy an air conditioner.
""Cubans very much need to purchase these products at a reasonable price. The government should have done this a long time ago,"" Palmino said.
""The prices are lower than in convertible pesos for the same products and better than those Cubans bring back from Mexico and Panama to sell on the black market,"" he said.
The dollar circulated freely in Cuba alongside the peso after the demise of former benefactor the Soviet Union in the early 1990s sparked a crisis in the Communist-run country. The dollar was taken out of circulation in 2004 and replaced by the convertible peso.
Two currencies, the peso and the convertible peso, which is valued at 24 pesos, circulate in Cuba. Possession of the dollar and other tradable currencies is legal, but they have previously not been deemed legal tender for purchases.
The government claims the convertible peso is equal to the dollar, but imported appliances and other goods, when available, have huge mark-ups as they must be purchased in tradable currencies while the peso and convertible peso have no value abroad.
The state has a monopoly on foreign trade and retail sales, but Cubans travel to places such as Haiti, Mexico, Panama and Russia, where they collectively spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase goods that they then resell in the Caribbean nation.
Local economist Omar Everleny said the stores would benefit the state and consumers alike.
""The prices are competitive with the international market as they have been reduced as much as 50% and the state is capturing internationally exchangeable money that was circulating in Cuba but then flowing abroad to purchase goods at lower prices,"" he said.
Everleny, like many other economists, said the stores were an admission that the convertible peso was worth less than a dollar and forecast that they marked the beginning of its end.
""We are going back to before 2004 when there was only the peso and certain products were priced in dollars,"" he said.
Cubans who buy from the specialist stores need a dollar-denominated bank card from an account opened with tradable currencies, such as the dollar or euro. People may obtain those tradable currencies through offshore remittances or by other means such as exchanging pesos on the street, the government said.

The government said a total of 77 outlets would open across the country in the coming days, but as of Monday just one had opened outside the capital, in eastern Santiago de Cuba.

815,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- When the Canadian and U.S. central banks announce policy decisions on Oct. 30, traders are betting that the divergent decisions will allow the loonie to blunt the dollar’s status as the highest yielding Group-of-10 currency.
Futures traders are pricing in almost no probability of a rate cut at the Bank of Canada meeting, while predicting a quarter point reduction from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank has already cut rates twice this year compared to the BOC, which has yet to cut rates since 2015.
The Fed’s easing is “chipping away at the key element that has provided underlying dollar support, which is that the U.S. has had a substantial carry advantage over pretty much all the G-10 currencies,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). He expects the BoC to hold rates steady at this meeting, helping maintain the loonie’s strength.
Rate cuts generally push yields lower as will likely be the case in the U.S. Wednesday and correspondingly make Canadian assets look more attractive.
Canada’s two-year yields climbed above U.S. equivalents earlier this month for the first time since 2017 and loonie bulls are betting that they may have more room to run. The yields are about four basis points higher than U.S. equivalents, amid a flurry of soft U.S. economic data, which pressured Treasury rates lower.
The U.S. has consistently had the highest yields among G-10 currencies in both shorter-term and longer-term government debt for much of the last two years.
And while the U.S. 10-year yields are still higher than their Canadian counterparts, that gap has narrowed rapidly over the past year. It has tightened to about 25 basis points, the narrowest spread in two years, from a high of 89 basis points in March.
The Canadian dollar is the best performer this year in the G-10 with a 4.3% gain against the greenback. Norway rounds out the top three highest-yielding currencies this year.
Wider Spreads
For Andrew Pyle, portfolio manager at Scotia Wealth Management, the Bank of Canada will remain on hold Wednesday and its policy language could turn hawkish, which is likely to pressure Canadian bond yields higher and widen their spread against U.S. equivalents.
The wider U.S.-Canada spreads will attract flows and may send the loonie toward the top end of its recent range, he said. Pyle is buying Canadian bonds and cutting back on U.S. notes.
Should the economic data turn, the strength of the loonie could be short lived, Pyle said.
Others are not convinced that the loonie will extend gains.
“Even though it’s been one of the best performing currencies to now, to be long the CAD and have a significant bullish view on it, has to have as an underlying assumption that the U.S. economy is going to remain very resilient,” said Francesca Fornasari, head of currency solutions at Insight Investment, which has $844 billion in assets under management.
“The direction of travel has been toward softer data, rather than stronger data” in the U.S., she added. She is neutral on the Canadian dollar despite the big jump this year.
The loonie touched a three month high after elections last week and posted a third straight weekly gain. Traders are wagering that while more spending under another term for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party will bring higher deficits, it will also support growth and likely strengthen the Canadian dollar’s resilience.
“If the Federal Reserve does bow to market expectations of a rate cut, the loonie would become the highest yielding G-10 currency,” said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd, referring to the two-year maturity. “The October 30th decision will be important for the USD/CAD cross. We expect the loonie to begin to make a sustained break below the $1.30 barrier just at the end of the month.”"

The bank said it would restrict dollar purchases to $200 per month via bank account and just $100 each month in cash, until December, a dramatic adjustment from the $10,000 restriction the bank imposed at the beginning of September along with other currency controls to stem a slide in the peso.
""Given the current degree of uncertainty, the board of the BCRA has decided to take a series of measures this Sunday that seek to preserve the reserves of the Central Bank,"" the entity said in a statement.
Guido Sandleris, the central bank chief, will hold a press conference at 8:30 am (1130 GMT) to explain the details of the measures, it added.
Argentina's Peronists earlier swept back into power on Sunday, ousting conservative Mauricio Macri in an election result that puts Latin America's third biggest economy back under the control of a more leftist government after it was battered by economic crisis.
The country has been grappling with frenzied markets since an August primary election vote where Peronist candidate Alberto Fernandez - now president-elect - soundly beat Macri, sparking a sell-off of the local peso currency, bonds and equities.
The sharp peso slide prompted the Macri's administration to roll out capital controls to protect the currency, including imposing caps on dollar purchases. Foreign reserves have nonetheless tumbled by over $20 billion since."

“How much?”
That was the greeting that bank tellers gave to clients at one teller window on Friday morning in downtown Buenos Aires.
In the last day that Argentines had to pull dollar deposits or buy greenbacks with their devalued pesos, lines were visible outside several branches and the interiors quickly filled once the doors opened. One institution, conscious of the long wait, even laid out breakfast pastries, juice and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) for clients.
It doesn’t matter if you’re going to vote for incumbent Mauricio Macri or front-runner Alberto Fernandez. Everyone has one thing clear, the coming months will be volatile -- even by Argentina standards -- and rather than risk having your money trapped or converted into pesos, it’s better to keep it in a safe at home ahead of Sunday’s vote.
Even though Macri imposed capital controls at the beginning of September to stem a run on the currency, Argentines are still allowed to buy $10,000 a month. Purchases and withdrawals have multiplied this week. The central bank’s reserves have sunk $2.2 billion this week alone, and while part of that is to pay government debt and comes from large corporations, the retail transactions have surged.
Argentines had already yanked $11.8 billion -- about 36.4% of the total -- from accounts since the fateful Aug. 11 primary election through Monday. Savers are also draining pesos from time deposits and local funds in order to buy more greenbacks, with more than a quarter of money in peso-denominated mutual funds exiting this week alone.
It’s not just crowds at the banks and nervous pedestrians on the streets trying to hide wads of cash where the hysteria can be seen. While discussing the different exchanges rates, a local TV network played roaring flames in the background with burnt bills flying through the air on Friday morning.
The peso has sunk 37% this year alone, most of that before capital controls were implemented. A variety of informal exchange rates used both by investors and people in the streets as part of a black market, trade well above the 60 pesos per dollar official rate. Those rates reached a new low on Friday.
On a popular late night talk show with economists and analysts on Thursday evening, the debate centered on how to defuse the economic “bomb” after the election and whether policymakers and Fernandez’s incoming economic team should cut the green or the red wire.
With Fernandez expected to win Sunday, focus is more on his initial comments than on the results. The indications he gives during his speech Sunday and whether he quickly assigns an economic team to negotiate a transition will be key.
The central bank is already preparing a menu of options to clamp down more on dollar purchases to bridge the gap to the inauguration on Dec. 10, according to person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Whether it was the late 80’s or the early aughts, many have already seen severe economic crises cripple their savings and are wily financiers when it comes to knowing when to buy or sell dollars.
Back at the banks this morning, as clients were handed numbers and realized there were as many as 100 people in front of them, more than one remarked “this is craziness.”

EUR/USD is finishing the weak on a low note, after outgoing European Central Bank President Mario Draghi repeated at his last press conference that the outlook for the economy is poor and that the risks remain skewed to the downside. The closely-watched Ifo business climate index gave a hint that the German economy is bottoming out after a rough year, the index staying unchanged at 94.6, slightly better than the 94.5 expected.
Draghi is making way for International Monetary Fund President Christine Lagarde, who has said she would like a strategic review of how the ECB conducts its monetary policy, against a backdrop of concerns that inflation is too low and that the effectiveness of tools such as interest rates and asset purchases (also known as quantitative easing) has weakened as the bank cut its benchmark rate well below zero.
""The bar for more ECB easing is higher,"" analysts at Nordea markets wrote in a research note. ""The opposition against the Asset Purchase Program was loud and clear after the September meeting and should make the Governing Council under President Lagarde think twice before doing more of that. At the same time, cutting interest rates deeper into negative may not be that effective despite tiering.
Attention is now likely to switch to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, where expectations - according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool - are for another 25 basis-point cut in the Fed Funds rate. Indonesia and Turkey both cut interest rates on Thursday, keeping the global trend of monetary easing intact.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The British pound fell on Friday versus the dollar and the euro after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call for an election cast yet more uncertainty over Britain's divorce from the European Union.
Sentiment for sterling is likely to remain fragile ahead of a meeting later on Friday where European Union officials may decide how long they will extend Britain's deadline to leave the EU beyond the current date of Oct. 31.
At this stage, an election looks unlikely because the main opposition Labour Party has withheld its support and other opposition parties have rejected the offer.
However, the twists and turns of the Brexit process have proved too complex to predict, which is likely to discourage some investors from taking on excessive risk before the EU agrees a new deadline for the UK's departure from the bloc.
""We're constructive on sterling in the mid-term, because we don't see a high chance for a general election,"" said Osamu Takashima, head of G10 FX strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Japan in Tokyo.
""My personal concern is once political uncertainty lifts, people will focus more on the UK's economy, which is weakening. This could be a negative for sterling.""
The pound fell 0.14% to $1.2841 in Asia on Friday. For the week, sterling was on course for a 1.18% decline versus the greenback, its biggest weekly decline since Sept. 27.
Sterling fell 0.1% to 86.49 pence per euro (EURGBP=D3), on course for a 0.45% weekly decline.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would wait to see what the EU decides on a Brexit delay before deciding on a general election.
However, Corbyn also repeated he could only back an election when the risk of Johnson taking Britain out of the EU without a deal to smooth the transition was off the table.
The euro (EUR=EBS) held steady at $1.1103 in Asia on Friday, on course for a 0.62% weekly decline.
The Ifo economic institute's closely-watched measure of German business sentiment due later on Friday is expected to weaken slightly in October, highlighting fears that Europe's largest economy is slipping into recession due to the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit.
The European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday after unveiling a big stimulus package last month, but there are concerns the ECB's firepower has largely been spent.

827,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 11:04AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- It almost feels as if Turkey’s lira can survive anything.
Since the end of June, the currency endured three bigger-than-expected interest-rate cuts, the ouster of the country’s former central bank governor by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and a military incursion into northern Syria that ran the danger of provoking American sanctions.
But the lira has come through it all more or less unscathed, eking out a 0.3% advance over the second half of the year. That’s pretty much in line with emerging-market currencies as a whole.
While it slipped 0.7% to just over 5.77 per dollar on Thursday, it was still close to its strongest level in more than two weeks despite another 250 basis-point interest-rate cut. That reduction took the total since July to 10 percentage points.
Erdogan can take credit for some of the currency’s resilience. He managed to persuade the White House to back down from imposing new sanctions on Syria and scrap ones that were already in place, removing a key drag on the currency.
But other fundamental factors have been instrumental in supporting the lira. The sharp slowdown in Turkish inflation and global investors’ hunger for higher-yielding assets have boosted the currency’s real return and helped it stand out amid the turmoil.
Turkey Surprises With a Big Rate Cut Again as Syria Storm Abates
That’s why the central bank’s future actions will be key. Thursday’s cut brings Turkey’s interest rate adjusted for inflation to 4.7%, still high relative to other emerging markets. But if it’s reduced much more -- either because of further easing by the central bank or a pickup in inflation -- the lira’s resilience might finally start to wane."

“The upturn in the Norwegian economy is continuing broadly in line with expectations in September. Underlying inflation has been as projected. Global uncertainty persists, and interest rates abroad are very low. At the same time, the weak krone may result in higher inflation ahead,” Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement on Thursday. The bank kept its benchmark deposit rate at 1.5%, as expected by all economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The announcement comes as Sweden’s Riksbank signaled it was committing to a December hike that would bring its main rate to 0%.
Norway’s October rate decision was a so-called interim meeting, and the bank didn’t provide new economic forecasts. Policy makers raised rates last month for a fourth time in a year, as Norway breaks away from the pack. In September, Olsen said the bank would keep interest rates “at this level in the coming period.”
Backed by the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, Norway’s central bank has avoided unconventional monetary policies, including negative rates. Norges Bank has instead adopted a policy of “leaning against the wind,” keeping rates a little higher than economic conditions warrant to prevent a buildup imbalances.

By 4 AM (0800 GMT), the krona was up half a percent against the euro and dollar, having earlier hit one-month and two-month highs against them, respectively. 
The Riksbank said that uncertainties remain high and it revised down its forecast for the repo rate next year to reflect that. All the same, the move will embolden those who think that the European Central Bank should abandon its monetary policy easing, the negative side effects of which are acknowledged even by its architect, ECB President Mario Draghi.
Draghi is due to preside over his last press conference at 08:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) before handing over to Christine Lagarde, the current managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Draghi was sharply criticised by current and former colleagues at the ECB since last month’s press conference, not least for effectively tying the hands of his successor by resuming outright bond purchases (quantitative easing), even though he softened the bank’s forward guidance by removing explicit references to the date of any future rate hike.
The press conference comes against the backdrop of continued weakness in the euro zone and global economy. Flash purchasing manager indexes announced by IHS Markit Thursday showed the biggest drop in Japanese manufacturing activity in three years, while the euro zone’s PMI fell to 45.7 from 46.1, its lowest in seven years.
The euro and the British pound were largely in a holding pattern against the dollar as the market waits to see what kind of extension of the Brexit deadline the EU will offer.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The British pound stabilized on Thursday as the Brexit project entered a fresh holding pattern, while the dollar held firm as traders took a breather from Sino-U.S. trade headlines.
Currency markets are also sticking to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the euro zone, Japan and United States due to review policy.
Sterling held at $1.2911 after Britain's parliament backed a withdrawal deal, but rejected the government's tight timetable, while European Union members delayed deciding whether to grant a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 leaving date.

""It looks like traders are weighing up the current parliamentary shenanigans versus the seeming inevitability of a Brexit,"" he said.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia analysts reckon the pound will stay rangebound between $1.3000 and $1.2800 until things become clearer. McCarthy added that other majors were stable without much news to move the greenback.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pound steadied on Wednesday after an overnight fall as Brexit hung in the balance, with the UK Parliament still divided on how, when or even if to engineer Britain's departure from the European Union.
The yen rose against the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar as some investors sought a safe haven amid doubts about efforts to scale back a bruising trade war between the United States and China.
On Tuesday, UK lawmakers voted by 329 to 299 in favor of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, but then opposed Johnson's extremely tight timetable to complete the legislative process in three days by 322 to 308 votes.
It is now up to the EU to decide whether to extend Britain's Oct. 31 deadline for its departure from the bloc, although there is hope Britain can avoid the worst case scenario, which is leaving the EU without any deal in place.
With no major economic data scheduled in Asia on Wednesday, traders will be left to ponder whether Britain will hold a general election to break the impasse.
Investors are also closely watching for signs of a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war, which has proven to be a big risk to financial markets and global economic growth.
""The pound will adjust in a narrow range for the time being,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.

Sterling initially rose on Tuesday after parliament approved a second reading of the Brexit deal, but then fell after lawmakers rejected the timetable.
It was the first time parliament has signaled support for a deal on how Britain would leave the EU, but Johnson had warned prior to the votes that he would push for an election if his timetable for Brexit were defeated.

After a rally of more than 8% since early September, currency strategists had predicted that only a win for the government would enable sterling to extend its gains. Many said losses would be limited in the event of a defeat, since the risks of a no-deal exit from the European Union had already been largely neutralized.
In the event, sterling slid as much as 0.8% against the dollar before recovering from its intra-day low. The decline was contained as the government won an initial vote on the deal and Johnson opened the door to a potential extension to an Oct. 31 deadline, after earlier threatening to throw out the deal if lawmakers rejected his plans.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts said the lower pound created a buying opportunity.
“For now it seems the market is still generally expecting this is a setback, but not a fatal setback, to a negotiated Brexit,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of G-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “There hasn’t been a rapid uptick in no-deal pricing at this point.”
Parliament’s vote to reject the planned schedule makes it virtually impossible for Johnson to get his agreement ratified by the end of the month. Still, the two votes taken together potentially move the U.K. even further from a no-deal scenario, while also raising the chances of an extension to the deadline. Another possibility is a general election to try to break a parliamentary deadlock.
“The market simply wants some degree of certainty at this stage, and if an election is part of that journey, it will accept that,” said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of foreign-exchange strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). “The alternative is that PM Johnson agrees to the delayed timetable for this bill, which is also unlikely to be upsetting to the market at this point.”
The U.K. currency had stayed in a tight range in Tuesday’s session before the vote, trading close to its average level since the Brexit referendum in 2016, based on Bloomberg’s British Pound Index. It was at $1.2897 at 9:21 p.m. London time, after touching $1.1959 on Sept. 3.
For strategists at Citigroup, there’s room for it to build on those gains.
“We would buy dips -- our view remains that Johnson is not a no-deal Brexiteer and that no-deal risk on Oct. 31, or indeed ever, remains relatively low,” said Adam Pickett, a foreign-exchange strategist at the bank. Even on an election, the two most likely outcomes are Johnson getting his deal through with a majority or that a coalition leads the U.K. to ultimately remain in the EU, and “both of those outcomes are sterling bullish in the medium term.”

The government was defeated by 322 to 308 votes. The second reading vote was on whether U.K. lawmakers would allow Johnson to get his deal through the House of Commons before the end of Thursday. U.K. lawmakers had earlier voted in favor of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would lead to Brexit becoming law – agreeing with it in principle. 


Ahead of voting, Johnson had threatened to abandon the bill and instead push for general election – even if the EU grants an extension – if lawmakers failed to back his deal. But U.K legislators argued that the three-day proposal – the timetable set by Johnson to get his deal through the Commons – to scrutinize the deal was not enough. 


Following the defeat, Johnson said he would pause the legislation and claimed ""our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave EU on Oct. 31.""


GBP/USD fell 0.5% to $1.2890, and was at $1.2900 just before the result of the vote. The currency spiked following the first vote that passed, but there was lots of selling into the announcemet of the results of the second vote.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso is headed for choppy waters in what remains of 2019 as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and the uncertain fate of the new North American trade deal could cause the currency to fluctuate between 18.80 and 21 per dollar, analysts say.
The peso's immediate future ultimately depends on whether the world's two largest economies can resolve their trade dispute and if U.S. lawmakers ratify the new U.S-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement before it gets bogged down in the U.S. electoral politics.
Market optimism over the future of these two issues lifted the peso on Tuesday to 19.0817 to the dollar, its strongest level in nearly three months.
If the USMCA is approved the peso could strengthen to around 18.80 per dollar, said Gabriela Siller, director of analysis at Banco Base.
The peso would, however, weaken if ""if they do not ratify it this year. That makes us think the approval would be pushed to 2021 because it's unlikely that will happen in an election year,"" said Siller.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticized House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not bringing USMCA up for a vote in Congress.
Meanwhile, if U.S.-China trade tensions escalate, the peso would weaken past 20 per dollar level, Siller added.
Trump on Friday said he thinks a trade deal between the United States and China will be signed by the time the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings take place in Chile on Nov. 16 and 17.
Additionally, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Mexico both expected to continue cutting borrowing costs, an attractive differential between U.S. and Mexican yields will be maintained, giving additional support to the peso.
""The real rate in Mexico is around 3.5%, which is still very high and that will give stability to the peso,"" said Marco Oviedo, chief economist for Latin America at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The Mexican central bank's most recent poll of analysts underscores the uncertainty surrounding the peso. The median forecast in the poll saw the peso ending the year at 19.75 to the dollar, but the range of answers was wide, going from 19.20 to 21 pesos.
So far this year the peso has gained around 3%, trading between 18.7570 and 20.1435 to the dollar, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback on Tuesday and its heavily weighted energy sector fell on the Toronto stock market, as investors worried that a minority government would make building of new oil pipelines more difficult. 
Canada's energy industry saw its worst-case election result materialize on Monday as the Liberals failed to secure a majority government, leaving them in need of support from left-leaning parties that are opposed to new oil pipelines.
Canada's energy sector declined 0.5% even as oil prices rose, with shares of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd falling 0.8 and pipeline company Encana Corp down 1.4%.
The energy sector has the second largest weighting on Toronto's benchmark stock index at about 16%, while oil is one of Canada's major exports.
""The market will be watching closely for signs on how a minority government will manage the resource sector and how energy companies will react to the results,"" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive. ""In the short term, there are some downside risks for the Canadian dollar but the rule of thumb on every election is to buy the dip and that will prove true again.""
At 10:08 a.m. (1408 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.3108 to the greenback, or 76.29 U.S. cents. Earlier in the session, the currency notched its strongest level since July 22 at 1.3071. 
The election outcome could also lead to increased fiscal spending. Trudeau has said he would nearly double the deficit from C$14 billion in the fiscal year that ended in March.
""To get support on Liberal bills, the government will need to include items supported by at least one of the other parties,"" said Craig Alexander, chief economist at Deloitte Canada. ""This is likely to lead to modestly more government spending and investment.""
Still, Canadian government bonds rallied after data from Statistics Canada showed that Canadian retail sales were down 0.1% in August from July. Analysts had forecast a 0.4% increase.
The two-year bond price rose 9.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.607% and the 10-year price was up 42 Canadian cents to yield 1.519%.
The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.6 basis points to narrow the spread in favor of Canada's bond to almost zero.

The Bank of Canada will release the autumn issue of the Business Outlook Survey at 10:30 a.m. ET (1430 GMT), which could help guide expectations for its policy outlook.

844,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 07:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- As currency traders gird for parliamentary votes on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, their opportunity to win big on the pound is fading fast.
The U.K. Prime Minister will find out Tuesday whether lawmakers are willing to back his plan, but if they reject it, the risk of a no-deal Brexit that would cause sterling to plummet is now minimal. On the other hand, after an 8% rally from September’s low, potential gains versus the dollar may also be limited.
In fact, for all the recent volatility, the pound is slap bang on its average level since the Brexit referendum in 2016. A crash-out scenario is unlikely even if an election is called to resolve a parliamentary deadlock because Johnson was obliged to ask for an extension to the Oct. 31 deadline. But there’s a long way to go before the U.K.’s departure from the EU is resolved, limiting the pound’s potential to climb far from its current $1.30 level.
“We think sterling could reach $1.32-$1.34 if the deal is passed in the second reading,” said Petr Krpata, a currency strategist at ING Bank, referring to the first vote Tuesday. “But even if passed there is still the risk that the whole thing won’t get eventually through. That’s why sterling at something like $1.40 on the back of the deal being passed this week looks aggressive.”
U.K. lawmakers will hold two votes on Johnson’s Brexit deal Tuesday evening, the first around 7 p.m. London time on whether they approve of the substance of the bill and the second at 7:15 p.m. on the timetable for pushing it through Parliament. Losing the 7 p.m. vote would kill the bill while losing the subsequent Program Motion would simply make it very hard to hit Johnson’s deadline for the end of the month.
Overnight volatility on the pound shows the risk of a sharp move is easing and options suggest the upper limit of gains for now could be around $1.3150. That’s below longer-term forecasts from banks including NatWest Markets and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). that see a potential rally to $1.35 on the Brexit deal being approved.
Future constraints
Beyond that, it may be hard to bet with conviction on sterling’s outlook, given a Brexit deal will only open the door for a new round of negotiations on the future trading relationship between the U.K. and EU.
Meanwhile, an election isn’t off the table if Johnson unexpectedly fails to win backing for his deal Tuesday, or his timeline is blocked and he pulls his plan in protest. He leads in polls and may be able to win with a larger majority to push his deal through -- although that’s by no means a certainty.
“Overall downside remains substantially smaller than a no-deal outcome,” according to Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. An election before year-end could send the currency toward $1.24, a 4% drop from current levels, according to Stretch.
That compares with a drop of 14% to $1.11 if there were a no-deal Brexit, based on a Bloomberg survey of analysts earlier this month."

The Japanese yen was little changed at 108.51, not far from the one-and-a-half month low it reached last week.
The traditional safe-haven currencies such as the yen, Swiss franc, and to a lesser extent the U.S. dollar, have given back gains this month as global investor risk sentiment improved on the back of building optimism over U.S.-China trade and Brexit deals.
""Until the recent improvement in risk sentiment is more seriously challenged, safe haven currencies should remain on the back foot in the near-term,"" MUFG analysts said in a note.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar steadied after jumping to a three-month high of 1.3104 against the U.S. dollar with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looking on track to retain power in a close-run election.

Canadian dollar has been the best performing major currency this year, rising by about 3.7% in the 10 months.

The trade exposed Australian and New Zealand dollars drifted higher, though remained marginally below one-month peaks that both currencies touched overnight. The Aussie last traded at $0.6867 and the kiwi at $0.6409.
The pound held steady at $1.2969, with Brexit developments set to determine its fate.
With just over a week before Britain is due to leave the European Union, Boris Johnson's push to re-run a parliamentary vote he lost on the weekend was rejected.
But he has resolved to press on with seeking to pass Brexit-related laws in parliament on Tuesday, with their progress to determine the timeline.
""While markets haven't seen fit to reverse last week's optimism that saw sterling smartly higher they aren't yet prepared to take the pound up to the next level,"" said National Australia Bank Head of FX Strategy Ray Attrill."

Perched behind the counter of a mid-range hotel in Riyadh, Bashayer admits she was reluctant to take a job as a receptionist.
But the position was “better than sitting at home,” the 23-year-old Saudi said, asking to withhold her last name so she could speak freely. “Before, some jobs were considered low-level, so Saudis didn’t want to apply for those. Now they’re more willing to try different jobs. The mindset has changed.”
Finding jobs for the likes of Bashayer in the private sector has been a key challenge for the oil-rich kingdom, where attempts to lower unemployment have run up against an economic slowdown and a job market long reliant on cheap foreign labor.
More Saudis are joining the hospitality sector, however, as Saudi Arabia rolls out an ambitious drive to draw millions of tourists, even as joblessness among nationals has held above 12% since 2016. Last month, the government unveiled plans to attract holidaymakers for the first time, showing it’s even willing to bend rules on how foreign women dress.
Behind the urgency is the realization that Saudi Arabia is racing against a demographic clock, unable to find employment for increasing numbers of its citizens -- especially young people.
New rules requiring companies in certain sectors to hire more nationals -- an initiative known as Saudization -- are helping to spur an exodus of foreigners already put off by new expatriate levies. The expats are leaving at a faster pace than Saudis can replace them.
Over 1 million nationals were seeking jobs at the end of the second quarter this year, of which a third were aged between 25 and 29, according to official data.
Alongside changes in industries including retail, the hope is that tourism will be Saudi Arabia’s ticket to a healthier employment future.
Under a blueprint drawn up by officials, the goal is to turn the kingdom into one of the world’s top five destinations, more than tripling the contribution of tourism to gross domestic product by 2030 to 10% -- matching its share last year in Singapore and Australia. The result is supposed to be an employment windfall that will generate an estimated 1 million jobs.
“Tourism is very fundamental to achieving the socioeconomic transformation,” Sultan Mufti, deputy governor for investment attraction and development at the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
Saudi Arabia has long been one of the hardest countries in the world to visit, issuing visas only for business trips, family visits or pilgrimage to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Religious tourism dominates the industry.
After years of talk about opening up to Western travelers to diversify the economy, the government is starting to deliver -- with a splash.
Officials organized an extravagant gala dinner to announce the tourist visas, inviting some of the world’s most popular Instagram “influencers” to post slick ads showing off the kingdom’s attractions. The social media campaign segued into an advertising blitz from Dubai to New York.
The challenges are plentiful, however, including competition from other destinations in the region and a conservative social environment that could deter potential visitors despite efforts to loosen up.
Still, even in a dour jobs market, the hospitality industry is already making a dent.
Before the visa announcement, a growing number of Saudis had already been taking hotel reception jobs and working as restaurant hostesses and baristas -- all relatively new fields for citizens in an economy dependent on cheaper foreign labor. The number of Saudis in accommodation and food service jobs rose between the first and the second quarters this year, even as the overall number of jobs in that sector fell.
Should some semblance of a tourism boom materialize, it could also help even out development across the country. Discrepancies are vast: the percentage of Saudi workers ranges from 0.8% in the Northern Borders Region to more than 39% in Riyadh province.
“It’s unclear how effective the Saudi government can actually be in boosting employment in these areas even with targeted support,” said Rory Fyfe, managing director of MENA Advisors in London. “Tourism activity requires sustained support from the government and considerable infrastructure investment, not to mention training and support of local tribes.”",,,,,

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces a potentially perilous ratification of his Brexit divorce deal in the British parliament after the speaker refused to allow a vote on it on Monday.
With just 10 days left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, the divorce is again in disarray as Britain's politicians argue over whether to leave with a deal, exit without a deal or hold another referendum.
The government is trying to force through the legislation needed for Britain to leave the bloc in the shortest time possible, drawing cries from opposition lawmakers that Johnson was trying to bully and rush lawmakers into passing the bill.
Earlier, House of Commons speaker John Bercow said a vote should not be allowed on Monday as the same issue had been discussed on Saturday when opponents turned Johnson's big Brexit day into a humiliation.
""In summary, today's motion is in substance the same as Saturday's motion and the House (of Commons) has decided the matter. Today's circumstances are in substance the same as Saturday's circumstances,"" Bercow told parliament.
""My ruling is therefore that the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so,"" Bercow said, provoking the ire of Brexit supporting lawmakers who said they had been refused a chance to vote on Johnson's deal.
Bercow said the government could still secure ratification for the Brexit deal by Oct. 31 if it had the numbers in parliament. Johnson was disappointed by the decision, a spokesman said. 
But the speaker's decision means that the government will have to try to push on with the legislation needed for ratification, a process opponents are plotting to wreck with amendments that would destroy Johnson's deal.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said the government wanted the lower house of parliament to finish voting on the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the upper house, which also has to approve it before the Brexit deadline.
""Trying to ram through legislation of this complexity, significance and long lasting consequences in just 3 days is an abomination of scrutiny and democracy,"" said Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party.
Sterling  traded at around $1.30, unaffected by the speaker's move.
AMBUSH
Johnson was ambushed in parliament on Saturday by opponents who demanded a change to the sequencing of the ratification of the deal, exposing the prime minister to a law which forced him to request a delay until Jan. 31.
He sent the note to the European Union unsigned - and added another signed letter arguing against what he said was a deeply corrosive delay.
Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said European Council President Donald Tusk had accepted the delay request as valid and was considering it.
The European Union, which has grappled with the Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52%-48% to leave in a 2016 referendum, decided on Sunday to play for time rather than rush to decide on Johnson's request for a delay.
From the bloc's point of view, extension options range from just an additional month until the end of November to half a year or longer.
The government insists Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31. Parliament will vote in the second reading on legislation known as the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Tuesday, after which amendments can be proposed to it.
Johnson's ministers said they were confident they had the numbers to push a deal through parliament, though there was concern that amendments could wreck Johnson's deal.
CRITICISM
The opposition Labour Party is planning changes to the legislation needed for Brexit that would make the deal unacceptable to swathes of Johnson's own party -- including a proposal for another referendum.
Bercow's decision provoked criticism from Brexit supporters.
""It is becoming remarkable how often you please one lot and not the other lot,"" Bernard Jenkin, a pro-Brexit Conservative Party lawmaker, told parliament.
Bercow dismissed such criticism, saying his decision was honorable and based on a long-standing convention in the House of Commons. 
""He is grumbling now because he doesn't like the judgment,"" Bercow said of Jenkin. ""If the government have got the numbers, the government can have their way.""
The Withdrawal Agreement Bill enshrines the Brexit deal, known as the Withdrawal Agreement in British law and must be passed before the treaty is considered to be ratified.
Previous bills to implement major European treaties have taken between 10 and 40 sitting days to get through parliament, according to the Institute of Government. 

A spokesman for Johnson said that if the legislation strayed too far from the deal then its ratification would be placed in question.

The deal was effected defeated over the weekend with the approval of an amendment and Bercow said voting on the matter on Monday would be ""repetitive and disorderly to do so"" as it is the same in substance as the vote on Saturday. 
GBP/USD inched up 0.1% to 1.2981 as of 10:55 AM ET (14:55 GMT) while EUR/USD was down 0.2% to 1.1147. 
Johnson had made a deal with the EU last week in the hopes of leaving the bloc on Oct. 31. But due to legislation passed on Saturday, he had to send a letter to the EU asking for yet another extension. That letter was followed by a second letter in which he said a delay would be a mistake. Johnson has previously said he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than ask for an extension. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was flat as trade developments were monitored. 
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that tariffs scheduled for December could be withdrawn if trade negotiations go well. His comments follow positive trade chatter over the weekend, with Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He saying on Saturday that ""substantial progress"" had been made in talks and argued that ending the trade war will benefit both the U.S., China and the world.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump said he hoped the deal would be signed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in mid-November, and that he was confident it would stop the introduction of more tariffs.

851,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 06:57AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank officials must bear in mind their previous premature interest-rate hikes and the market turmoil around the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tapering of bond purchases when they eventually start to tighten monetary policy, Bank of Finland Governor Olli Rehn warned.
“The core inflation rate remains low and clearly below the ECB’s price-stability target,” Rehn wrote in a book published in Helsinki on Monday. “Normalizing monetary policy awaits its turn, even though it would be important to increase the room for maneuver in monetary policy before the next recession.”
Rehn’s argument refers back to two rate hikes in 2011 under the then-president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, just before the euro zone tipped into a debt crisis and recession. The increases were immediately unwound at the end of the year by his successor, Mario Draghi. The Fed sent shockwaves through global markets two years later when then-Chair Ben Bernanke said bond purchases may be gradually phased out.
The Finnish governor was an early backer of monetary stimulus this year to overcome a euro-area slowdown driven by uncertainties over the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit. That stance highlighted his transition from a politician who earned a reputation for advocating austerity -- he spent much of the region’s crisis years the European Union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs.
The ECB ultimately agreed a rate cut and the resumption of asset purchases last month in a decision which split the Governing Council. It pledged not to end quantitative easing and start raising rates until inflation is solidly entrenched.
Draghi holds his final policy meeting this week before handing over to Christine Lagarde. Both have insisted that governments also need to step up with fiscal stimulus to revive growth and inflation.
Fiscal Rules
Rehn’s book largely addresses the euro zone’s failures during the debt crisis, arguing that politicians should have moved quickly to stem contagion and protect more risk-prone countries. The next step should have been to reinforce bank balance sheets and capital buffers, and then to push through a controlled restructuring of Greek debt.
His recommendations for the future include a focus on financial stability, including completing the banking union; a large joint fiscal capacity and lender of last resort; broader macroprudential tools to tackle shadow banking and pay-day loan companies; more-credible fiscal rules; and stronger coordination of fiscal policies.
“Europeans deserve better decisions than we were able to take during the euro crisis,” Rehn said in the book. “But first they need to wake up to see why euro-zone reform is important and how it should be done.”"

Sterling opened lower after U.K. politicians failed to deliver the decisive Brexit vote that had been promised at the weekend. Still, analysis of Saturday’s debate and the comments that lawmakers made during it, shows the U.K. prime minister still has a chance of getting his Brexit deal done. This hasn’t boosted the U.K. currency on Monday, in a sign that current pricing may already be reflecting optimism that the Brexit accord will eventually pass.
Options gauges also suggest that a level close to $1.30 in pound-dollar is incorporating a high probability that Johnson will get his way in the House of Commons. Overnight volatility rose to its strongest level since the U.K. elections in June 2017 on bets that Commons Speaker John Bercow may allow the vote to take place Monday. This at at time when traders acknowledge high risks that the pound may weaken in the short term, as risk reversals show.
Certainly, a vote in favor of the Brexit deal could see the pound rallying. This, however, may only amount to a knee-jerk reaction and investors may be looking to fade the move.
Russell Silberston, a portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management Ltd., estimates the Brexit deal is already 60%-to-70% priced in, and that the currency could gain to at least $1.33 on a deal passing through Parliament.
""On the negative side, however, is the relatively short transition - Dec 2020,” he said. ""It seems highly unlikely we can get a free trade deal with the EU by then, so I think this tempers the medium term view.”
Corporate names have already taken profit on long exposure through options. Real money accounts still prefer to sell rallies, while hedge funds’ flows run two-ways, according to three traders in Europe who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly.
Technically, the first key resistance comes around $1.3150 and may be where a knee-jerk rally will stall. The 200-weekly moving average stands at $1.3149, while the midpoint of sterling’s losses since April 2018 comes at $1.3168. Its May 6 high is at $1.3185."

Johnson’s minority government reportedly wants to present the same agreement to parliament again, but is likely to be stopped on procedural grounds by the House of Commons speaker, on the basis that the same motion can’t be debated twice in a session.
Another alternative is for Johnson to draft a bill enacting his deal formally in U.K. law. However, it is not clear that such a bill would pass in the House, given that Johnson has now lost the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party.

“Boris Johnson needs a stable working majority to get this over the finishing line ,” wrote Nordea market analysts in a weekly note. “Can he get a stable working majority? We are far from sure.”
Nordea’s base case is that the final Brexit deadline is pushed back from Oct. 31 to early 2020, to allow time for a general election.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Sterling fell over half a percent against the dollar on Monday, slipping from five-month highs after the British parliament delayed a crucial vote on a Brexit withdrawal agreement.
The move derailed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan for a decision on his withdrawal deal, but the pound held the bulk of its recent rally on confidence that a disorderly exit from the European Union would be avoided.
In Asian trade, the pound fell 0.61% to $1.2910, having hit a five-month peak of $1.2990 on Friday and closing the week just below the $1.30 mark, a 6.5% surge since Johnson struck an EU divorce deal on Oct. 10.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's lira firmed nearly 1% against the dollar on Friday, as the prospect of severe sanctions from the United States waned after Ankara agreed to a ceasefire in northern Syria, raising expectations of a rate cut by the central bank next week.
The currency had been under pressure due to a deterioration of ties between Ankara and Washington over Turkey's operation against the Kurdish YPG militia, which was a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State.
In meetings between the allies on Thursday, Ankara agreed to a ceasefire for five days while the YPG withdraws from Syrian border regions. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said sanctions would be removed after the deal is implemented and no further sanctions would be pursued.
The lira stood at 5.7805 against the dollar at 1238 GMT, firming some 0.75% from Thursday's close of 5.8250. It firmed to 5.7580 earlier.
It had weakened to 5.9395 this week in anticipation of the sanctions, which turned out to be softer than expected.
Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said while further sanctions were off the table for the moment, things could still go wrong with implementation of the ceasefire.
""After the five days, there could be an escalation of conflict in northern Syria,"" he said, adding that this could lead to another strain with Washington and bring sanctions back into play.
U.S. prosecutors this week charged Turkey's Halkbank (IS:HALKB) with evading sanctions on Iran, a move which Turkey said was also related to its operation in Syria. Pence said he told Turkish officials that the case was a matter for the New York court that charged the bank.
Halkbank shares, which had plummeted following the news earlier this week, surged at Friday's opening, rising some 7.16%. They were up 6.21% at 1221 GMT.
The main BIST100 share index (XU100) was up 3.82%, while the banking index (XBANK) was up 5.93%.
Despite the ceasefire agreement, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen will move ""full steam ahead"" with plans to impose stiff sanctions on Turkey.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives would vote on a bipartisan sanctions package against Turkey next week.
Trump may try to veto or delay implementation of those sanctions, despite strong bipartisan support, Tuvey said, adding: ""He seems to be taking a fairly soft line on sanctions against Turkey.""
RATE CUT AHEAD?
After the agreement between the allies eased pressure on the lira, expectations the central bank will cut interest rates at next week's meeting have risen again.
QNB Finansbank chief economist Erkin Isik said the recent volatility in the lira had lowered rate cut expectations.
""Considering the agreement reached about Syria and the appreciation of the lira, we expect a 100 basis point cut from the monetary policy committee next week,"" he said, citing improvements in inflation.
The central bank has already cut its policy rate by 750 basis points this year, after hiking it to 24% last year to halt a currency crisis. Governor Murat Uysal has said the rate cuts were front-loaded.
Inflation, which hit a 15-year high of more than 25% in October last year, declined to below 10% last month.
Ata Invest Director Cem Tozge said the bank could cut borrowing costs by between 100 and 200 basis points.
""When we look at both the swap pricings and the lira LIBOR pricings, we see that a 200 basis point cut in the next three months, starting with 100 basis points next week, is being priced in,"" he said.
Turkey's five-year credit default swaps, a gauge of the cost of insuring exposure to its sovereign debt, fell to 371 basis points on Friday, down from 385 basis points at Thursday's close, according to IHS Markit data.
Longer-dated government bonds chalked up gains, with the 2030 issue jumping 1.6 cents to 135.186 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb.
Dollar-denominated bonds issued by Turkey's second-largest bank Halkbank also gained, with the 2021 issue adding as much as 2.7 cents to 89.95 cents in the dollar.",,,,,
858,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 09:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro’s rally may have further to run with the shared currency likely to find support from a range of factors after uncertainty over Brexit clears.
The common currency touched its strongest level in seven weeks on Thursday after the U.K. and the European Union reached a deal on Brexit. While British lawmakers could reject the pact on Saturday, the possibility of increased government spending in Europe and further U.S. interest-rate cuts may help keep wind in the euro’s sails.
It will also receive a boost if the European Central Bank looks away from monetary easing and steps up its demands for fiscal stimulus. In recent months, the steady stream of poor economic data out of the region has intensified speculation that the ECB will add to its bond-buying stimulus. Yet its latest wave of quantitative easing faces internal opposition. ECB President Mario Draghi may repeat his call for governments to increase their spending at his final meeting later this month.
This time round, the plea may not fall on deaf ears.
German politicians are coming around to the concept of abandoning the much-heralded “black zero” -- the country’s long-held commitment to a balanced budget -- in case a downturn requires a powerful response. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government cut its 2020 growth forecast to 1% recently, down from an earlier 1.5%, while China’s economic growth has slowed to levels last seen in the early 1990s.
On top of this, Draghi’s promise of open-ended quantitative easing is also coming into question. The interest rate for overnight loans between European banks, known as Eonia, has actually risen as banks prepare for the start of ECB’s tiered deposit rate system, which is designed to mitigate the cost of lower rates.
Reuters reported last week that the ECB has one year of German debt to buy before reaching its limit, and that policy makers would prefer bending the capital key and buying fewer German bonds instead of changing the issuer limit, also supporting the euro.
Outside the shared currency’s area, add to the mix weak U.S. data, which may force the Federal Reserve to make further cuts, enough in itself to set the euro up for further gains. Production at U.S. factories fell in September by the most in five months, retail sales unexpectedly posted the first decline in seven months, and a gauge of inflation expectations from the New York Fed fell last month to the lowest level since 2013.
Certainly, the euro isn’t out of the woods yet. Dollar liquidity may tighten toward year-end and trade tensions between U.S. and the EU could flare up. As ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane noted, the convergence of inflation toward its aim has recently slowed and partly reversed.
But as sentiment gets increasingly bullish for the euro -- options traders need to pay a premium to own upside exposure across tenors now -- risks are brewing that technical resistance around $1.12 may not be able to absorb buying pressure for long.

859,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Currency strategists are ruling nothing out for Saturday’s crucial parliamentary vote on Britain’s deal to exit the European Union -- and that makes forecasting where sterling will settle something of a crapshoot.
The pound could surge to $1.35 or slip to around $1.26, strategists and fund managers say as they assess the range of possible outcomes from Brexit’s climactic moment.
Sterling already jumped 5% this month to around $1.29 and now it’s pinned to that marker as traders wait to see if Prime Minister Boris Johnson can convince skeptics in the House of Commons to approve the divorce deal he sealed this week. It’s fine margins, and if he can’t, that opens the door to other scenarios including an election, a second referendum, or even a move to leave the EU with no agreement in place.
While Johnson’s accord has lowered the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, the risks “are not mathematically zero,” say strategists at Toronto-Dominion Bank, including Ned Rumpeltin.
“Any positions predicated on an imminent no-deal crash-out look difficult to countenance at this stage,” said Rumpeltin, the European head of currency strategy at TD. “Looking forward however, we think it is still a little too early to sound an unqualified all-clear.”
If Parliament does manage to pass the deal this week, the pound could test May’s peak of around $1.3185, the TD strategists forecast, though they see it struggling to move higher in the absence of fresh catalysts.
UBS Global Wealth Management is more bullish. It’s retaining an overweight position in sterling against the dollar, said Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele. A “convincing deal” could drive the pound to $1.35, he predicted.
Johnson needs 61 of 85 possible votes from potential swing lawmakers, a tight but feasible number. One blow is that Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, with 10 potential supporters, came out firmly against the deal.
If lawmakers were to reject it and that led to an extension beyond the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, the risk of a general election would “suck the wind” out of sterling’s rally and see it test $1.2640-60, the TD strategists predict. And that level could come under significant pressure if Parliament’s blocking of the deal were followed by the EU rejecting a request for an extension to the Brexit deadline.
Other scenarios -- including a potential second referendum that could cancel Brexit altogether, or an election that could cement Johnson’s leadership and seal his deal -- cannot be ruled out either.
No wonder implied volatility on sterling is so high and risk gauges are swinging back and forth. And adding to the drama, the currency market won’t get its first chance to react to the twists and turns of the weekend until trading resumes at 7 p.m. local time (or 7 a.m. in Auckland), when liquidity can be limited and exacerbate price swings.
“No deal remains a threat until either a deal or no Brexit is completed,” Rumpeltin said. “An unexpected jump to an alternative scenario would quickly return both rates and FX to the state of confusion and -- often -- contradiction that has defined much of the Brexit process so far.”"
860,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 06:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Turkish lira jumped to its strongest level in almost two weeks while bonds and stocks rallied after the U.S. agreed not to impose any further sanctions on Turkey as part of a temporary cease-fire deal in Syria struck between Ankara and Washington on Thursday.
The currency gained as much as 1.3% to 5.7585 per dollar, erasing losses that were fueled in recent days by concern Washington would impose punitive measures against the Turkish economy in response to the offensive against Kurdish rebels in Syria.
The benchmark stock gauge jumped almost 4% at the open, its biggest advance since June. The yield on five-year benchmark bonds dropped more than 160 basis points, falling below 15% for the first time in a week.
“The truce deal, even a temporary one, fueled optimism among investors that the risk of sanctions has diminished significantly,” said Can Oksun, senior manager of institutional sales at Global Securities in Istanbul. “The mood is broadly more positive.”
The agreement enshrines Turkish control of a 20-mile deep “safe zone” in northern Syria, representing a victory for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had been seeking one for years. The U.S. has also promised to withdraw sanctions announced earlier this week once a permanent cease-fire takes effect.
‘Brutal’ House Bill
Still, risks remain. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have vowed to move ahead with sanctions despite Thursday’s announcement. The measures would penalize Turkish leaders, financial institutions and its energy sector, as well as prohibit any U.S. firms or individuals from buying the country’s sovereign debt.
“If this bill holds as is and is passed it would be brutal,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “Sanctioning sovereign debt would be lights out for Turkey, given it has $180 billion in short-term external debt to finance every year.”
While there is strong bipartisan opposition to Turkey’s incursion into northern Syria, Senate leaders haven’t committed to bringing a sanctions bill to a vote.
The lira was trading 0.9% stronger at 5.7803 per dollar as of 10:53 a.m. in Istanbul. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index trimmed its advance to 3.5%, with gains being led by Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS and Akbank TAS, the nation’s largest listed lenders."
861,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The phenomenon of the dollar’s strength against emerging-market currencies during U.S. stock market sell-offs -- the so-called Dollar Smile -- has diminished.
A Bloomberg study on the performance of non-Asian developing nation currencies since 2000 shows dollar strength accompanying U.S. equity market corrections is becoming significantly less pronounced -- similar to findings in a recent analysis covering Asian markets.
The median dollar gain during the latest three normalized 10% declines in the S&P 500 index has been 2.3% for a basket of EM currencies including the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and South African rand, according to calculations by Bloomberg. That’s down from 7.4% in the earliest six equity sell-offs in the analysis.
Stephen Jen’s “Dollar Smile” framework to describe gains in the U.S. currency during extreme periods of U.S. economic strength or weakness is a cornerstone of emerging-market investor positioning. It suggests the dollar rises when American growth is higher than the rest of the world, but can also gain on haven purchases during periods of economic or stock-market weakness.
While Bloomberg’s previous study on Asian FX showed a more uniform drop across the region’s currencies, the results on other countries displayed greater contrast. For example, the average dollar strength against the Brazilian real fell to 2.1% from 9.5% from the earlier to the later U.S. stock sell-offs -- in contrast, it slipped just one percentage point to 5.9% for the Mexican peso.
A combination of significant structural changes in global trade and a rise in the financial prominence of the Chinese yuan is likely behind the fall in the effectiveness of the smile. The behavior of the euro does not seem to have played a role, according to the analysis.
Another point worth keeping in mind for emerging-market investors -- the dollar’s “valuation” is currently elevated should there be a stock-market shock around the corner. The greenback is about 9% stronger in real effective terms than the average of the episodes in the study, and has been rising against all EM currencies in our study over the past three months."
862,"<span>Oct 18, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"Investing.com -- The dollar was mixed in narrow ranged in early trading in Europe Friday, while the pound retreated as doubts swirled both about the merits of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and about the likelihood of him persuading Parliament to approve it.
The biggest gainer of the morning was the Turkish lira, which surged nearly 1% against the dollar to 5.78126 by 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), after posting a 10-day high, in the wake of the five-day ceasefire agreed on Thursday between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence.
The Chinese yuan edged only modestly lower despite data showing that economic growth slowed to its lowest in nearly 30 years in the third quarter, rising 6.0% rather than the 6.1% expected.
Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for Emerging Asia at Natixis, said via Twitter that there was “nothing new in the China GDP that we didn’t know from high frequency data.
“Investment sags. Uncertainty is in the policy response not growth trend,” she added.
The news didn’t stop commodity currencies from the Russian ruble to the Aussie and kiwi dollars from strengthening against the dollar.
Combined with losses against the euro and sterling over the week, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies is now bumping along the bottom of its recent range. By 4:10 AM ET, it was at 97.333, only 0.1% above the two-month low it hit earlier in the week.
In Europe, the British pound was only fractionally lower as markets braced for a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal agreed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson with the EU on Thursday. Johnson is not assured of a majority in the House of Commons, having lost the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party and withdrawn the whip from 21 of his own lawmakers. 
Local media suggest the vote will be extremely narrow in Saturday’s extraordinary session. However, it won’t represent the end of the Brexit drama whichever way the House votes, given that the opposition will have one last chance to force a 2nd referendum when the government drafts a bill to implement the agreement. By 4:10 AM ET, GBP/USD was down 0.1% at $1.2875, while EUR/GBP was up 0.1% at 0.8639. "

TOKYO (Reuters) - The British pound traded near a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Union leaders agreed a new deal for Britain to exit the bloc.
Sterling's gains on the dollar helped push the greenback to a five-month low versus the euro and a three-week low against the Swiss franc.
The yuan held steady against the dollar in offshore trade before the release of China's GDP data. Economists have forecast the economy will grow at the weakest pace in more than 27 years in the third quarter due to a costly trade war with the United States.
The initial relief at securing the long-awaited Brexit deal could be brief, however, because the prime minister still needs to sell the agreement to skeptical lawmakers when parliament sits on Saturday.
Once Britain does leave the EU, its economic growth is expected to slow, which is likely to be a negative for sterling in the longer term, analysts warn. []nL5N27262N]
""Assuming we clear the parliamentary hurdle, the pound has room to rise further because there are a lot of shorts to be unwound,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo.
""But after that, people will start to question whether this is really good for Britain's economy, and further gains in sterling could become difficult.""
The pound traded at $1.2870 in Asia on Friday, close to a five-month high of $1.2988 reached on Thursday after EU leaders unanimously backed the new Brexit deal with Britain.
Against the euro (EURGBP=D3), sterling traded at 86.42 pence, near a five-month high of 85.77 pence.
For the week, the pound was on course for a 1.7% gain versus the dollar and a 0.9% increase against the common currency.
Britain's new Brexit deal has a ""decent chance"" of clearing parliament on Saturday, finance minister Sajid Javid said, but some investors are wary because debate so far on Brexit has been fractious and difficult to predict.
Even if Johnson can win approval in parliament, Britain is still on course for more distant economic ties and increased trade barriers with the EU, which many economists say will slow growth in the UK.
For now, sterling's gains and worries about weak U.S. economic data are pushing the greenback lower against other currencies.
The dollar traded at 0.9875 Swiss franc , close to the lowest since Sept. 25 and on course for its biggest weekly decline since Aug. 9.
The dollar was quoted at 108.57 yen, headed for its second week of gains.
In offshore trade, the yuan traded at 7.0815 per dollar.
China is expected to post its weakest economic growth in at least 27-1/2 years in the third quarter when Beijing releases gross domestic product data at 0200 GMT.
Downbeat data in recent months has highlighted weaker demand at home and abroad, fanning expectations that Beijing will need new measures to ward off a sharper slowdown due to a year-long trade war with the United States.
The world's two-largest economies have imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a dispute over China's trade and industrial policies that has slammed the brakes on global economic growth."
865,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 02:21PM ET</span>","Investing.com – Turkish assets rose Thursday after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to a five-day ceasefire in Syria following a meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Turkey agreed to halt its assault in Syria for five days, allowing Kurdish forces to withdraw from the Turkey-Syria border, Pence told reporters. Turkey also agreed to ""a permanent ceasefire"" once the Kurdish forces have withdrawn, he added. Turkey will control a ""safe zone"" as far as 20 miles into Syrian territory.


The cease-fire agreement comes just a day after President Donald Trump said that Turkey’s military assault on Syria had “nothing to do” with the U.S. But Trump has faced widespread criticism for withdrawing U.S. troops from the region, with many fearing that it could cause terrorist group ISIS to reemerge. Recent media reports suggested that hundreds of captured members of ISIS had escaped from prisons in Syria after the Kurds moved forces to the Syrian border to meet Turkey's assault.

European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an agreement via Twitter, which was later expanded on by the EU's top negotiator Michel Barnier. 
However, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said it remains opposed to the proposed agreement, making it uncertain if the deal will be passed by the U.K. Parliament when it votes on Saturday.
The deal hinges on Northern Ireland applying a limited set of EU rules on some goods, with the U.K. only charging EU tariffs on goods passing through to EU markets. Northern Ireland will also maintain the right to vote every four years on whether the arrangements will stay.

867,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 09:52AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Franklin Templeton star bond investor Michael Hasenstab is loading up on safe-haven currencies and winding down massive holdings in emerging markets after two of his biggest investments flopped in August.
The fund manager doubled exposure to the yen to 40% in the $30 billion Templeton Global Bond Fund in the third quarter, according to a recent filing. He’s also added long positions in the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona and is increasing liquidity by boosting cash across his funds, he said in an October note.
Total net assets in the global bond fund dropped by $3 billion in the three months through September as a massive holding in Argentina was pummeled by the country’s default. The fund was also holding a huge short position in U.S. Treasuries as yields sank to a three-year low.
“A number of global risk factors have increased, raising the need to hedge some of our foreign exchange risk exposures and counterbalance our U.S. rate hedge,” said Hasenstab, who oversees more than $100 billion. “The potential for a geopolitical event appears higher than it has been in decades, given ongoing tensions among major world powers.”
Templeton’s Global Bond Fund has underperformed more than 80% of peers this year, losing 1.3% compared with a return of about 7% from Treasuries. The fund has returned 2.3% in the past three years, Bloomberg data show.
The fund is holding on to its Treasury short, but shifting the focus to those with longer maturities, according to the report. Hasenstab argues that markets continue to overvalue long bonds given rising deficit spending and rising debt.
Average duration in the Global Bond Fund, a measure of sensitivity to shifts in rates, increased to minus 1.39 years as of the end of September, the filings show. At the end of June it was a record low of minus 2.82 years.
While Hasenstab continues to see value in emerging markets, he says he is now “sizing and hedging” positions for individual risks. A 14% holding in Brazilian bonds, for example, is being offset by a net-negative position in the Australian dollar, according to the report.
“Investment strategies that may have worked well over the last decade are not as likely to be effective in the next one,” Hasenstab said. “Investors need to prepare for today’s challenges by building portfolios that can provide true diversification against highly correlated risks present across many asset classes.”"
