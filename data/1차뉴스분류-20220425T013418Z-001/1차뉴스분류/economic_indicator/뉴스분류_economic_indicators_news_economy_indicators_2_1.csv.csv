0,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - China's economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, as tepid manufacturing activity, higher raw material costs, and fresh COVID-19 cases weighed on the recovery momentum.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, missing expectations for a rise of 8.1% in a Reuters poll of economists.
Growth slowed significantly from a record 18.3% expansion in the January-March period, when the year-on-year growth rate was heavily skewed by the COVID-induced slump in the first quarter of 2020.

Asian shares advanced on Thursday as economic data from China was largely more resilient than expected, and as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell assured that tapering of its massive stimulus was still a way off. 
COMMENTARY:
IRIS PANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR GREATER CHINA, ING, HONG KONG
""Considering all of the data released, the recent developments in international politics, and ongoing domestic reforms, the RRR cut and rollover of MLF look more reasonable.
""We believe that there will be another RRR cut in the next quarter if these risk factors do not abate.
""We are revising our 2021 GDP forecast to 9.4% from 8.7%, mainly due to our weaker forecast in 2Q than the reported figure, and a slight upward adjustment for 3Q21 to reflect the boost from the RRR cut.
""We expect no change in policy interest rates for 2021, including the loan prime rate and 7D policy rate. We are keeping our USDCNY forecast at 6.45 for the end of 2021."" 
JULIAN EVANS-PRITCHARD, SENIOR CHINA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, SINGAPORE
""Base effects continued to distort the June data so we focus on the seasonally-adjusted m/m changes. Retail sales softened to 0.7% last month from 0.8% in May, most likely due to localised curbs in response to a virus outbreak in Guangdong province. 
""But the industry improved slightly, with output growth edging up to 0.6% m/m from 0.5%, perhaps reflecting stronger exports and easing shortages of semiconductors.
""Headwinds to growth are likely to intensify during the second half of the year. China's COVID-19 export boom appears to have peaked and will unwind over the coming quarters as vaccine rollouts and reopening help to normalise global consumption patterns. The upshot is that we expect q/q growth to remain slow by historic standards over the next few quarters, with headline y/y growth likely to end the year below 5%."" 
CARLOS CASANOVA, SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR ASIA, UNION BANCAIRE PRIVEE, HONG KONG 
""The release from the NBS says that China's economy will continue to recover, but still faces external uncertainties. That is a nod to the fact that U.S. demand is going to peak, inventories are already replenished. So we really are looking at that domestic pivot away from the supply side towards the demand side, or in other words, from manufacturing to consumption to take place. That will, however, only happen very gradually because sentiment is subdued as a result of everything that's been happening on the regulatory front, but also as a result of too-aggressive policy tightening.
""I wouldn't go as far as calling it a mistake because there's a whole set of policy priorities that they are trying to balance, but they've definitely decided to take a U-turn on that and put a put it on the back burner for the time being to make sure that pickup in domestic consumption does take place in the second half. 
LI WEI, SENIOR CHINA ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, SHANGHAI
""Solid performance in H1. Upside risk grows after the policy setting turned more supportive with RRR cut and pledges to accelerate infrastructure investment by the government.
""The slowdown angst is overdone.
""The gap between households consumption and income growth narrowed, suggesting recovery in confidence and reduced precautionary sackings."" 
XING ZHAOPENG, SENIOR CHINA STRATEGIST, ANZ, SHANGHAI 
""The data was largely driven by low base effect as the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing's Xinfadi Market took place last June.
""Based on the current situation, if policymakers do not act, the GDP figure in Q4 could fall out of the reasonable range as data from last Q4 was shining.
""Given these factors have mainly influenced the supply side, I expect the government to roll out targeted easing measures."" 
GARY NG, ECONOMIST, ASIA-PACIFIC, NATIXIS, HONG KONG
""China's 2Q GDP shows that the cyclical rebound from the pandemic has peaked. The future momentum will be more normalised and also return to more structural factors as well. 
""One of the concerns is if we look at household income growth, it's still slightly lagging behind the economic growth as well, so that may exert some pressure on consumption. And for investments, basically there is a sharper slowdown from June data mostly because of the base effect, but another point is ... there is actually lower bond issuance from the local governments as well. So that means that infrastructure spending may have decelerated as well. 
""The PBOC has partially rolled over 100 billion (yuan) ... I think it's a signal that - yes, the monetary policy tone is going to be softer, but it's not going to be massive liquidity raining into the market."" 
LOUIS KUIJS, HEAD OF ASIA ECONOMICS, OXFORD ECONOMICS, HONG KONG
""We recently cut our 2021 GDP growth forecast to 8.4% (from 8.9% previously) to reflect the recent weakness. But we expect growth to gather pace in H2. Household consumption should be supported by rising vaccination and corporate investment by the recovery in profit.""
""We expect the pick-up in H2 momentum to allow policymakers to broadly continue normalizing macro policy. Indeed, we don't think the recent RRR cut heralds a shift to monetary easing. Meanwhile, the rise in PPI inflation has likely run its course."" 
ZHU CHAOPING, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI
""China's economy looks like on track for recovery, with the 6% annual growth goal in reach. However, the downside and structural risks in domestic demand are concerning. Long-term credit growth has remained weak as the government deploys policies to control leverage and calm the property bubble. The uncertainties in market regulation may also be weighing down short-term consumer and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, resilient external demand could help offset some domestic pressure and support aggregate growth. 
""The PBOC announced a 50bp RRR cut last week as a fine-tuning measure. This could help release Rmb 1 trillion funds for bank lending, and lower banks' funding cost by Rmb 13 billion per year. However, Rmb 1 trillion is still far below the Rmb 4.15 trillion of MLF maturing in 2H2021, suggesting the RRR cut was a structural measure to stimulate long-term lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, rather than a sharp change in Chinese monetary policy. 
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reiterated that the government will not flood the economy with excessive liquidity, and the PBOC also emphasized that the RRR cut is simply part of normalizing the policy environment, reflecting policy makers' intention to manage market expectations for strong stimulus."" 
WOEI CHEN HO, ECONOMIST, UOB, SINGAPORE
""The numbers were marginally below our expectations and the market's expectations, (but) I think the momentum is fairly strong.
""For the monthly economic data for June, we see a slowdown in retail sales, industrial production and also fixed investment from May, but in terms of market expectations, all these numbers are better than expected. In particular, the retail sales growth was quite strong - that is quite encouraging.
""On comparison with last year, though, we will get slower growth. We expect second-half growth to be slowing to maybe around 6%. 
""Our greater concern is the uneven recovery that we've seen so far, and for China the recovery in domestic consumption is very important ... retail sales this month was fairly strong and that may allay some concerns."" 
BACKGROUND:
* China's economy has been recovering since the second quarter of last year, buoyed by solid overseas demand for its exports, but growth is losing steam as manufacturing activity slows on higher raw material costs and supply shortages.
* The central bank said it would cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, even as policymakers have been scaling back pandemic-driven stimulus to contain debt and financial risks.
* China's economy has surprised many with the speed of its recovery from last year's coronavirus jolt, especially as policymakers have also had to navigate tense U.S.-China relations on trade and other fronts — GDP shrank 6.8% in Q1, 2020 for its first contraction since at least 1992 when official quarterly records started.
* Since then it managed a remarkable rebound and at a quickening pace, partly due to stringent lockdown measures to contain the novel coronavirus, which first emerged in China in late 2019.
* The recovery has been led by export strength as factories raced to fill overseas orders and consumption steadily picked up despite sporadic COVID-19 cases in some cities.
* China's government has rolled out a raft of support measures, including more fiscal spending, tax relief, and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the economy and support employment.

* With the economy back on more solid footing, the People's Bank of China is turning its focus to cooling credit growth to help contain debt and financial risks, but it is treading cautiously to avoid derailing the recovery.
* Authorities are especially concerned about financial risks involving the country's overheated property market, and have asked banks to trim their loan books this year to guard against asset bubble.

1,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 11:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy is forecast to grow 2.2% this year, down from the 3.4% projected earlier, due to the impact of a third wave of COVID-19 infections and weak tourism, the World Bank said on Thursday, as the country battles its biggest outbreak yet.
Thailand's tourism-reliant economy contracted 6.1% last year, its deepest slump in over two decades, with the tourism sector devastated by the impact of the pandemic. 
""Economic activity is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic levels until 2022, and the recovery is projected to be slow and uneven,"" the World Bank said in a report. 
After recording 40 million foreign tourists in 2019, Thailand is expected to receive just 600,000 arrivals this year, sharply down from a previous forecast of 4-5 million, it said.
Good exports and the ongoing rollout of fiscal support measures are expected to remain important drivers of overall economic activity, the World Bank said.
The recovery is expected to accelerate in 2022, with GDP growth projected at 5.1%, it said, noting risks to growth were skewed to the downside and the outlook remained uncertain.

The GDP outlook compared with growth of 1.8% this year and 3.9% in 2022 projected by Thailand's central bank which recently said growth could miss forecasts after the latest stricter coronavirus containment measures.
Given Thailand's COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts, its public debt level is expected to rise to 62% of GDP in 2022, exceeding the government's target ceiling of 60%, but risks to fiscal sustainability remained manageable, the World Bank said.

2,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy slowed largely in line with economists forecasts in the second quarter, with the recovery showing signs of steadying as consumption accelerated in June.
Gross domestic product expanded 7.9% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, down from 18.3% in the previous quarter and compared with a median forecast of 8% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. On a two-year average growth basis, which strips out the effect of last year’s pandemic, the economy grew 5.5% last quarter, up from 5% in the previous three months.
The recovery has shown signs of plateauing in recent months after a sharp V-shaped rebound driven by industrial output and exports. Consumers had remained cautious after incomes took a knock during the pandemic and sporadic virus outbreaks more recently restricted travel and spending. The June pickup in retail sales may fuel optimism that the rebalancing in the economy toward consumption is taking shape.
The second-quarter data suggest Beijing can comfortably meet its growth target of more than 6% for the year, and continue to drive global markets for commodities and industrial goods. But a slowing recovery is a possible sign the economy is more reliant on policy support than before the pandemic, a warning to other major economies as they ponder an exit from stimulus.
The offshore yuan extended declines, falling 0.1% to 6.4687 per dollar. 10-year government bond futures stayed lower while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index pared some losses.
In a surprise move last week, China’s central bank said it will cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, freeing up about 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) in liquidity that could be used to boost lending. The move went further than many economists had expected and suggested growing concerns about the economy’s growth outlook.
Earlier Thursday, the People’s Bank of China rolled over a portion of medium-term policy loans coming due, a move that confirms its intention to keep monetary policy largely unchanged. The 100 billion yuan of loans offered to banks is in addition to the liquidity from the reserve requirement ratio cut that comes into effect today.
Premier Li Keqiang also sounded a cautious note this week about the economy’s outlook, warning the nation needs to prepare for cyclical risks and make counter-cyclical adjustments.

Retail sales rose 12.1% from a year earlier in June. Analysts had expected an 11.0% increase after May's 12.4% rise.

Fixed asset investment grew 12.6% in the first six months of the year from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 12.1% rise and down from a 15.4% jump in January-May. 
China's economy has largely rebounded from the coronavirus hit last year thanks to pent-up demand and robust foreign orders for its exports, but recent data has suggested the recovery is losing some steam with increased raw material costs and supply shortages hurting factory activity.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland plans to reduce its budget deficit more gradually than previously forecast to increase capital spending on areas such as housing and expects it to fall to 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2025 from an estimated 5.1% this year.
Ireland's finance ministry had forecast in April that the deficit would drop to 0.2% of GDP by 2025 without further policy actions. Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath said the additional borrowing will ensure the government tackles a years-long imbalance between housing supply and demand ""head on"".
""This increase is justified given the critical role that capital investment has to play in delivering on our economic, social and climate priorities. From 2023 onwards, the government will be borrowing only to finance for capital expenditure,"" the government said in its summer economic statement.
The finance ministry said that on the basis of the deficit-GDP projections set out, Ireland should not be a fiscal outlier and that its deficit trajectory in the coming years should be broadly in line with other European countries.
To ensure that the public finances remain on a sustainable path, the government agreed to set an expenditure rule whereby core non-coronavirus related expenditure growth is fixed at the economy's estimated trend growth rate, taking account of inflation.
While the ministry almost doubled its GDP forecast for this year to 8.8% from 4.5% due to strong export growth, the new rule means core expenditure will grow by just over 5% on average per year over the period to 2025.
Ireland's debt is forecast to peak in 2022 at 108.6% of modified gross national income (GNI*) and fall more slowly than previously anticipated to 106.3% by 2025. 

GNI* is viewed by government as a more accurate measure of the size of the economy due to how Ireland's large hub of big multinationals can distort GDP. 
Ireland's debt agency said it had nudged up its target funding range for the year to 18-20 billion euros from an earlier target of 16-20 billion euros due to the government's new plan.

6,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in June by more than expected, indicating pressure is mounting on companies to pass along higher costs to consumers.
The producer price index for final demand increased 1% from the prior month and 7.3% from June of last year, according to data from the Labor Department on Wednesday. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI also rose 1%, the most on record, and was up 5.6% from a year ago.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in the overall PPI and a 0.5% increase in the core figure. The annual increases were the largest in data back to 2010.
The PPI, which tracks changes in the cost of production, has accelerated at a faster pace than expected in recent months due to higher commodity prices and complications with global supply chains. Challenges in hiring skilled workers have also put upward pressure on wages.
The increases in production and labor costs help explain why the pace of consumer inflation has exceeded economists’ estimates in each of the last four months.
Consumer Prices
A report Tuesday showed the consumer price index surged in June by the most since 2008. The increase was primarily in categories associated with reopening, including hotel stays, car rentals and airfares.
Federal Reserve officials have said upward pressure on prices is likely to be transitory, but some investors worry the recent gains will lead to more persistent inflation.
The PPI report showed prices for goods increased 1.2% after a 1.5% advance in the prior month, while the cost of services rose 0.8%, the most since the start of the year. Almost 60% of the overall PPI advance was due to services, according to the Labor Department.
The increase in the costs of services reflected growth in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.5% from the prior month and increased 5.5% from a year earlier. The annual gain was the largest on data back to 2014.
In an earnings call Tuesday, packaged food company Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc. reported a 8.6% increase in the cost of goods sold for its most recent quarter, with expectations for a rate of about 9% for fiscal year 2022.
“The bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils, proteins, packaging, and transportation,” Chief Financial Officer David Marberger said on the call.

(Reuters) - The number of applications for home mortgages increased last week driven by an increase in refinancing activity and an uptick in purchase activity as mortgage rates fell. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index rose 16.0% in the week ending on July 9 from a week earlier. This reflected a 20.4% increase in applications to refinance existing loans and an 8.3% rise in applications to purchase a home.
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages decreased to 3.09% last week, the lowest level since February, from 3.15% the prior week. This week's data included an adjustment for the Fourth of July holiday. 
""There may have been a delayed spillover of applications from the previous week, when rates also decreased but there was not much of response in terms of refinance applications,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement. ""Purchase applications increased last week, but average loan sizes decreased to their lowest level since January 2021.""
This week's data comes just one week after the number of applications for home mortgages decreased to the lowest level since January 2020.

Rising home prices combined with insufficient supply has continued to weigh on the housing market.
""We continue to see ebbs and flows as housing demand remains strong but for-sale inventory remains low,"" Kan said. ""However, lower rates may be helping some home buyers close on their purchases, especially first-time home buyers.""

""We must do everything possible so we don't get another lockdown,"" Stefan Genth, managing director of the German association of retailers (HDE) told a news briefing.
Asked for his reaction to the decision by the German state of Saxony to lift the obligation to wear masks in stores, Genth said: ""We warn against giving up such things too early.""
Germany reported 1,548 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, 563 more than a week ago, to bring the total to 3.74 million. The death toll rose by 28 to 91,287.
Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on Tuesday that more people needed to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before restrictions could be lifted, following news that England will scrap nearly all curbs from next week.
German retailers expect to record a 1.5% rise in sales in 2021, assuming no further lockdowns, the HDE forecast on Wednesday, driven by a 3.1% increase in food sales, while the rest of the sector is set to record a 4.2% decline.
Fashion stores have been particularly hard hit, with sales still expected to be down 37% in 2021 compared to 2019 before the pandemic hit.
""Spending is bouncing back but shopper traffic in the inner cities is not back to pre-crisis levels,"" Genth said.
Online sales are expected to rise by around 20% this year to just over 87 billion euros ($103 billion), the HDE said, up from a previous forecast for 17% growth.
HDE said three quarters of retail companies in Germany reported lower revenue in the first half of the year due to lockdowns.

""The crisis is not over yet, the situation is still very difficult for many retailers,"" Genth said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European corporate earnings are expected to have more than doubled in the second quarter of 2021, but many investors fear volatility could follow as the idea sinks in that Europe Inc has probably reached peak momentum.
Euro zone business growth accelerated in June at its fastest pace in 15 years and all indicators point towards a robust rebound from last year's COVID-19 induced lockdowns.
Just a week ago, the European Commission revised its forecast for euro area economic growth to 4.8% this year, much faster than the 4.3% it envisaged in May.
Profits of the 600 biggest listed European companies are seen surging 110% year-on-year for the April to June quarter, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
Expectations for the second quarter have been regularly revised upwards since late-April when the rise was expected at just below 90%.

""I think there is a high likelihood that 2Q21 earnings growth marks the peak of the current recovery cycle,"" said Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at UniCredit Bank.
Stocker still expects profits to rise about 10% next year but noted that similar periods of deceleration in past cycles have tended to increase stock market volatility, meaning there could be ""an increasing risk of some setback during the summer"".
To weather such summer squalls, investors should consider investing in defensive stocks such as healthcare and consumer staples, he added.
Bourses in Europe, just like on Wall Street, are hovering near record highs but a renewed upsurge in COVID-19 infections could easily knock them off down again. 
At about 460 points, the STOXX 600 index is already 10 points above the consensus target that a Reuters poll of funds managers and analysts had pointed to in May. 
But having risen more than 15% since the beginning of 2021, the pan-European benchmark seems to have shifted into a lower gear. 
""The dynamic through stock markets is now more prudent as 'peak growth' has already been priced in and investors are therefore less bullish than they were"", said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""In some way, good results this quarter would validate the performance of markets but would not necessarily lift them much beyond that"", he added.
Cau predicts ""cyclical stocks to have a less bullish second half of the year"".

A survey of fund managers in July conducted by BofA showed 82% of respondents looking at single-digit percentage year-end upside for European equities. 
FOMO - the fear of missing out - remained high though, as ""47% of respondents saw reducing equity exposure too early as the biggest risk for their portfolio"".

The ministry said it expects inflation to reach 3% or more in the second half of 2021 due to a base effect from a temporary VAT cut last year that was part of the government's stimulus program to help the economy recover from the coronavirus shock.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's economy contracted in the second quarter after battling new outbreaks of COVID-19 but economists expect it to get back on track quickly as global growth picks up and vaccination rates rise. 
The city state's economy still showed the best growth in more than a decade on a year-on-year basis, as many economies have done because of last year's coronavirus-induced slump. 
""The economy stumbled in Q2 after the government reimposed restrictions in response to a spike in virus cases, but with new infections down and the government rolling back containment measures, the recovery should regain momentum over the coming months,"" said Alex Holmes, economist at Capital Economics.
He still expects GDP growth to come in at the top end of the government's 4%-6% estimate in 2021.
The economy contracted a seasonally adjusted 2% in the second quarter of 2021, a reversal from 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter, preliminary government data showed on Wednesday.
On an annual basis, GDP grew 14.3% in the second quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry data showed, against economists' forecast in a Reuters poll of 14.2%. 
GDP had fallen a record 13.3% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2020. The country was under a lockdown for most of that period to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Singapore had implemented tougher rules on public gatherings in May this year after a spike in COVID-19 cases. It has been loosening them over the last few weeks as vaccinations pick up. 
In absolute terms, gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2021 remained 0.9% below its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of 2019. 
The manufacturing sector grew 18.5% on year, helped by robust global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The construction sector expanded 98.8% compared with a year earlier when most construction activities stopped due to the lockdown. 
The Singapore dollar has lost about 2.5% this year, most of it in the past month as the U.S. dollar has climbed broadly and as a resurgence of the virus has weighed on Asian currencies. It was little changed after Wednesday's data. 
The government expects GDP to expand 4% to 6% this year, although growth could exceed the upper end of that forecast. The bellwether economy had posted its worst recession last year.
Selena Ling at OCBC Bank said the quarter-on-quarter contraction was a temporary setback. She expects the economy to return to pre-COVID-19 levels by this year-end or early 2022. 
Vaccinations have been gaining pace globally, and Singapore has inoculated nearly 70% of its population with at least one dose of a vaccine.
But many of its neighbours, including Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, are struggling with new outbreaks, which could have some spillover economic effects for the city-state, including challenging its attempts to open up its borders.

The central bank maintained its accommodative monetary policy at its last meeting in April. The next policy review is due in mid-October.
""There will probably be a pivot away from being very outrightly dovish,"" OCBC's Ling said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House expects supply chain pressures that are fueling higher inflation to abate in the ""not-too-distant future,"" but cannot say exactly when, a senior official said on Tuesday after June consumer prices showed the biggest gain in 13 years.
The official declined to repeat earlier forecasts that inflation would peak in the summer months, citing continued uncertainty about when supply chain pressures would ease and concerns over the emergence of new COVID-19 variants.
Asked if the bump in prices for certain services reflected any price gouging, the official said, ""that probably remains to be seen,"" adding that it was an issue worth investigating.
The U.S. consumer price index increased 0.9% in June amid supply constraints and a continued rebound in the cost of travel-related services from pandemic-depressed levels as the economic recovery gathered momentum.
The CPI jumped 0.6% in May.
White House officials remain convinced that the bump in prices is transitory, citing moderating pressures in the semiconductor market and a drop in lumber prices - two factors that have led to bottlenecks and pushed prices higher.
They cited recent upward revisions in overall growth forecasts and said President Joe Biden's COVID-19 rescue plan has been effective in driving a stronger-than-expected recovery, but also signaled growing concern about the new COVID-19 variants and lingering disparities in vaccination rates.
""We expect that these things will work themselves out in the not-too-distant future, but I can't say exactly when,"" said one official. ""We also can't say whether or not we really truly do have this pandemic under control.""
Pressed to put a timeframe on when the inflationary pressures would ease, the official said, ""We are just watching the data closely, week by week, month by month.""
Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said Biden's policies were driving up prices.
""With consumer prices at a 13-year high, Bidenflation is growing faster than paychecks, wiping out workers’ wage gains, and leaving American families behind,"" he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a Democratic-aligned economist who has criticized the current White House policies for potentially stoking inflation, met with top Biden economic advisers Brian Deese and Cecilia Rouse on Tuesday. His criticism has rankled White House officials, who have insisted the current spike in prices is temporary.
Though Summers was critical of Biden's initial stimulus plans, he has been supportive of spending on ""green"" infrastructure.
""They talked about the infrastructure package and the importance of passing the president’s full Build Back Better agenda,"" said a White House official. 
Summers declined to comment.
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
Treasury bond yields rose on Tuesday, indicating that investors may start demanding increased compensation for the risk of higher prices.
About 60% of the June price increase was due to used and new cars and auto parts, the administration official said. Excluding autos and pandemic-related services, prices increased just 0.2%.
The administration is looking carefully at the sectors driving the higher prices, the official said, adding that some of the increase reflected the low level of prices seen during the pandemic.
A second official said there was continued concern about the automotive market, but the Biden administration is in close touch with dealers, producers, semiconductor suppliers and others, and remained convinced current pressures would diminish.
The White House did not expect the sharp increases in used car prices to last beyond this year, said one of the officials.

The official said some underlying problems in the U.S. economy - including a severe shortage of housing and the high price of pharmaceuticals - would remain a problem.
Biden's proposed budget included $213 billion in funding for affordable housing to address part of the issue, while the executive order he signed on Friday should result in lower pharmaceutical and hearing aid prices, the official said.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday rose 1.5%, recouping a little of June's 5.2% drop.
That left the index up 23.8% on July last year when the country was still emerging from a round of nationwide lockdowns. The index reading of 108.8 showed optimists outnumbered pessimists.
""Confidence has held up overall despite a sharp fall in NSW as other states - notably Victoria and Western Australia - recorded strong bounce-backs from COVID-related disruptions in June,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.

""The main takeaway is that concerns around the current virus outbreak and associated restrictions in NSW are not spilling over to the rest of the country.""
The survey was conducted over the week of July 5-9, when Sydney was also locked down but restrictions were tightened further on July 9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence rose in July to hit a more than two-and-a-half-year high, as the country's export-driven recovery remained intact thanks to solid global demand, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
But in a worrying sign, service-sector sentiment turned pessimistic, as firms struggled with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis, according to the poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
""The global economy is showing signs of recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,"" a manager at a machinery maker wrote in the poll.
""But the outlook remains uncertain, as our customers are putting off business spending decisions because their budgets are on a declining trend.""
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 25 from 22 in June, its highest since November 2018, the poll conducted June 30-July 9 showed. The service index fell to minus 3 from a flat reading the prior month. (For a detailed table of the results, click)
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.
Manufacturers' sentiment got a boost from strong confidence at car, chemical and metal products makers, which offset negative conditions in the textiles and paper sector.
The poll, which surveyed 503 large- and mid-sized companies of which 257 firms responded on condition of anonymity, comes ahead of the BOJ's July 15-16 policy meeting.
The BOJ's own ""tankan"" business survey out this month also showed business confidence improved to a two-and-half-year high, while service-sector sentiment turned positive for the first time in five quarters.
The BOJ is expected to slash this fiscal year's economic growth forecasts in fresh quarterly projections as a fresh state of emergency for Tokyo, which will run through to Aug. 22, threatens to hurt consumer and business sentiment.
The Reuters Tankan poll underscored the pain firms, especially those in the service sector, were feeling from the health crisis.
""Overall consumer behaviour is slow, as sentiment isn't improving due to anti-coronavirus measures,"" a manager at a food producer wrote in the survey.

But even as they are taking a hit from prolonged curbs, the Japanese government estimated this month that it expected the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year, largely thanks to solid exports and a boost to consumer spending from progress in vaccinations.
Manufacturers' business confidence was seen improving further to 28 in October, while that of service-sector firms was expected to rise to 8, a slightly lower forecast for three months out than that of the previous month, the survey showed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deflation will likely become a larger force in financial markets in the year ahead despite the recent spike in consumer prices to 13-year highs, star stockpicker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest said in a webinar on Tuesday. 
U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in 13 years in June due in part to supply constraints, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Wood, whose Ark Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar last year, said technological innovation would continue to push down prices significantly.
""The message we continue to pound the table on is that nominal GDP growth, because of these deflationary forces, will be surprisingly low,"" said Wood.
As a result, 10-year Treasury yields will likely stay below 3% for the foreseeable future, pushing up the broad valuation of the U.S. stock market, she said. 
""I believe the bond market is in a bubble,"" Wood said, adding that ""too many people are afraid of inflation"" which is a ""killer"" for stock market valuations. 
Any further rallies in oil prices will likely lead to a sharper sell-off in the future as demand withers and more consumers opt for electric vehicles, Wood said. 
""We would not be on the long side of oil,"" Wood said. 
ARK remains bullish on the online betting market and estimates that the U.S. market will grow from $9.5 billion to $37 billion by 2025. The fund has a position in DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc, which is up 7.2% for the year to date. 

Wood's $23.6 billion ARK Innovation ETF suffered steep declines earlier this year as investors rotated away from growth and technology stocks to more cyclical sectors such as financials and energy. But it has gained 7.4% over the last month as Treasury yields edge lower. 
The fund is up 0.2% for the year, a performance that puts it in the bottom 98th percentile of the 595 U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data.

Receipts for June jumped 87% to $449 billion, in part a reflection of this year's Internal Revenue Service income tax filing deadline being brought forward to May 17 compared to last year's pandemic-induced delay to July 15.
The Treasury also said taxes withheld from wages increased by 33%, on an adjusted basis, to $240 billion during June compared to a year ago, while June corporate taxes rose to $79 billion from $11 billion last year.
Outlays for June dropped 44% from a year earlier to $623 billion, largely due to the outsized impact on the deficit a year earlier from the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program, a subsidy to keep businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This reduction in costs helped lower the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $2.238 trillion from $2.744 trillion for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, Treasury officials said.
Year-to-date receipts rose 35% from a year earlier to $3.056 trillion, while outlays grew 6% to $5.294 trillion.

Services activity rose 1.2 percent from April after seasonal adjustments.
Still, the sector remains below the levels seen in February of this year, just before a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic led to new economic restrictions in March. 
""In April and May, those measures began to relax and the sector grew again,"" said Rodrigo Lobo, who leads the IBGE survey. ""The sector is growing as a result of more vaccination, especially those (companies) that depend on in-person consumption."" 
Growth, however, did not reach all corners of the services sector in May. The IBGE survey tracks five service activities and registered growth in three of them: transportation, tourism and family services. 

Growth was highest in the tourism sector, up 18% in May compared with April. But tourism also remains 53% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the survey.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is on course to run a budget surplus this year, analysts say, a turnaround after strong half-year data, with high oil prices giving room to cover spending promises from President Vladimir Putin ahead of parliamentary elections.
Last month, Putin promised to spend on infrastructure, education and health, seeking to give the ruling United Russia party a boost. The pledges added to social support measures announced in April that will cost the budget around 400 billion roubles ($5.40 billion) over two years.
Russia had a budget surplus of 626 billion roubles from January to June, the finance ministry said on Monday, with tax increases, the economic recovery and high prices for oil, Russia's major export, all behind the boost in revenues.
""Such positive data is largely due to the Russian economy's earlier than expected recovery and also high prices for oil,"" said Bank St Petersburg analysts. 
Unless significant anti-COVID-19 curbs are implemented, something Putin and other senior officials have repeatedly said they want to avoid, the budget will end the year in surplus, they added. 
The finance ministry's 2021 plan was for a budget deficit of almost 2.8 trillion roubles, around 2.4% of gross domestic product this year. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov last month said the deficit would likely stand at 1% of GDP.
Increased tax revenue has also helped. Russia is planning to hit metals firms with $2.3 billion in export taxes between August and December, one of a handful of tax increases since the coronavirus pandemic pushed Russia's economy to a 3% decline last year.
""Clearly the tax burden has increased and will increase further,"" said Sofya Donets, Russia and CIS economist at Renaissance Capital. 
Renaissance Capital sees a budget surplus of 3% of GDP if oil prices remain near current levels of $75 a barrel. UralSib analysts forecast a surplus of 1.37 trillion roubles, or around 1.1% of GDP. 

""Additional spending promised by... Putin... will increase budget spending in the second half of 2021. But we think that there will be a budget surplus at the end of the year if oil prices remain high,"" Sberbank CIB said in a note.

COMMENTS:
JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER, HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA 
“The headline CPI numbers have shock value, for sure; however, once you realize that a third of the increase is used car prices, the transitory picture becomes more clear.  Inflation is rising, but things are well behaved and have not changed materially.”
KEN POLCARI, MANAGING PARTNER, KACE CAPITAL ADVISORS, BOCA RATON, FLORIDA
“It came in very hot, much hotter, so it is going to be difficult for the Fed or any of the talking heads to try to talk it away as transitory. It raises the conversation, it is significantly stronger and that plays right into the ongoing inflationary concerns. Tomorrow you are going to get PPI and that is also expected to be stronger, and that is at the producer level which only means a couple of months later after you see it at the producer level it comes down to the consumer level on top of what we already have. 
That is going to cause some consternation, between that and what we are seeing already in some of the earnings reports – JP Morgan and Goldman – certainly blowing the roof off the house but you don’t see this big explosion to the upside. You see it is more moderated and the market might get a little bit weaker today.”
GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“There are a lot of reopening-driven factors at play. Right off the bat I can see very strong rebound in used car prices, another strong rebound in airfares and lodging as well, all of these are COVID impacted.”
“A lot of this will play into the Fed’s transitory story. There is certainly some concern that some of these price increases are coming in much quicker than expected, but you can argue that a lot of this is due to the recovery.”
“The approach that they took at the last meeting was one of risk management, it wasn’t putting FAIT (flexible average inflation targeting) on the backburner, it was basically saying inflation is coming in a little bit stronger than expected therefore we are going to shift our stance modestly. We still believe in FAIT, we’re still going to let inflation run a little hot, but a lot of this is transitory and a lot of this is reopening related. I don’t think there is anything here to really change that stance.”
EDWARD MOYA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST FOR THE AMERICAS, OANDA, NEW YORK
“That came in pretty hot and we saw short end rates jump pretty solidly here and the move was very positive for the dollar. This is really going to excite the hawks on the Fed and intensify the debate to taper sooner, and if these inflation pressures are still elevated by the time we’re at the end of the year, you’re going to see the market start to move forward interest rate hike expectations.”
NANCY DAVIS, FOUNDER, QUADRATIC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT (email)
“Tuesday's elevated Consumer Price Index is more evidence that prices for goods are rising across the board, something that consumers have been noticing for months at the grocery store and at the gasoline pump.
“The Consumer Price Index may not be the best inflation measure, as one-third of the index's calculation is defined by shelter, which is primarily housing rent in cities. We have seen a significant divergence in real estate markets across the country - housing prices are falling in many cities due to increased demand for housing in suburbs, a trend caused by the pandemic.
“We expect the Federal Reserve to allow inflation to overshoot its inflation target in order to attain full employment. The market is currently pricing in close to four 25 bps interest rate hikes by the end of 2023, which is aggressive in our view.
“I believe investors have only just started to think about inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield is significantly below the rate of inflation and a continuation of that dynamic would likely create challenges for fixed income investors.”
JIM VOGEL, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, FHN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE
""So we've got a flatter curve, we've got a lot of increase in the three-year (U.S. Treasury note) as you should anticipate, the five-year is under some pressure, the 30-year is not. And so right now, I would call this a tame reaction as people try to dig into all of these numbers because they don't want to get wrong footed in the way they did after the May CPI.""
MICHAEL BROWN, SENIOR ANALYST, CAXTON, LONDON    
    ""(This was) clearly an upside surprise. It will make (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill tomorrow a much trickier exercise than it would've otherwise been given that it will put some additional pressure on the 'transitory' narrative.""
    ""FX reaction as one would expect given an upside surprise, with the dollar rallying across the board in line with the sharp rise in Treasury yields. All relatively contained however, within recent ranges, and one print won't significantly change the FOMC's outlook/stance. Attention now shifts to Powell's comments tomorrow, and where we are in the tapering discussion.""
KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
“It was a very, very strong number – strongest in 13 years. Clearly it was very positive for the U.S. dollar. It kind of reinforced the Fed taper story and the dollar has been consolidating for the front of the week and I think this was the kick that it needed to renew its gains.”

PAUL HICKEY, BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP, NEW YORK (email)
""Futures were mixed ahead of the June CPI report, but a much higher than expected print has been met initially with selling in equity futures and rising bond yields.  So far, the declines haven't been too large, but as traders digest the internals of the report, we'll be watching to see how things play out.  One driver of the gains this month was used car prices which rose 10.5% m/m and accounted for one-third of the total increase.  New car prices also increased by 2.0% m/m which was the largest m/m increase since 1981!""

LONDON (Reuters) - A calming down of Italian government bonds, typically among the most volatile in the euro zone, suggests a sea change in the way foreign investors perceive the 2.3-trillion-euro ($2.7 trillion)market -- the bloc's biggest.
Volatility, the propensity of an asset to display wild and unpredictable price swings, is generally a negative for bond returns over time. So the message from one volatility indicator on BTPs, as Italian government bonds are known, will be welcomed by investors.
That indicator is an index of 30-day option-implied volatility on BTPs, which has fallen to around 50 basis points, around half its level a year ago and approaching levels seen for higher-rated French and German government bonds. 
The BTP volatility index, based on a working paper from the European Stability Mechanism, is also the lowest since more than three years ago, when options on BTP futures first started trading. 
Graphic: Italian bond market volatility slides: https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROZONE-BONDS/xlbpgqwbypq/chart.png 
""What we're seeing in Italian bonds is a little bit of a replay of the convergence trade that we've seen in the past, when euro zone bond markets started to trade on this idea that over time every member state could issue (debt) at the same level,"" said David Arnaud, a senior fund manager at Canada Life Asset Management.
He was referring to the period before the 2011-2012 crisis when weaker states such as Italy and Greece enjoyed borrowing costs only marginally above those of financially robust Germany or the Netherlands.
The yield gap ballooned during the crisis and then during periodic market selloffs, including last year, but has since snapped in. The steep volatility decline has followed and this time some believe it may last longer than before.
ECB, EU, DRAGHI 
Several factors are driving the change in investor perceptions towards Italy. First is the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme which has pinned down borrowing costs across the euro area. 
Second is the European Union's 800-billion-euro post-pandemic recovery fund, of which Italy is a major beneficiary, standing to receive some 200 billion euros in grants and loans in the coming years. Since then, Italy's anti-euro parties, including the far-right League, have become much less vocal in their opposition to the EU.
Finally, the appointment in February of former ECB chief Mario Draghi as prime minister raised hopes that Italy could more effectively use recovery fund monies to boost economic growth. 
All this has squeezed Italian yields lower, even as the COVID-19 crisis is projected to send Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio -- Europe's second-highest -- towards 180%. 
""We think that the market has underestimated the impact of the recovery plan, particularly in Italy, and Draghi has under-promised and will over-deliver,"" said Jacob Nell,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s head of European economics.
Last week the Italian government agreed amendments to a law overhauling the criminal justice system, a key reform plank included in the Recovery and Resilience Plan.
LOCK-STEP
It's not just volatility gauges showing Italian bonds converging with higher-rated peers. Italian and German yields have moved in lock-step over recent months, suggesting investors view Italy as less risky than before, at least for now. 
That's despite Italy's Baa3 credit rating from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and BBB- rating with Fitch -- nine notches below Germany's triple-A score.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analysts estimate that 75-day correlations between Italian and German bonds have risen to 0.8 from around 0.4 just before Draghi's appointment. Back in 2018, just after an election in Italy that boosted anti-euro parties, the correlation was -0.4, they said. 
Correlations between Spanish and German debt are broadly steady this year.
""The increase in the correlation between BTP and Bund yields indicates that the market is dealing with Italian debt as an asset driven more by the general macro fundamentals than by country-specific factors,"" Luca Cazzulani, UniCredit's co-head of strategy research, said.
He forecast the correlation at current high levels for a ""prolonged period.""
Investors still demand a 100 basis-point premium over German bonds to hold Italian 10-year debt, reflecting risks of premature ECB policy tightening or changes in the political scenario in Rome. 
""These two factors (a Draghi-led government and a dovish ECB stance) need to stay in play. If there was a hawkish turn by the European Central Bank, it would be challenging for Italian debt,"" Cazzulani added.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's exports grew much faster than expected in June, as solid global demand led by easing lockdown measures and vaccination drives worldwide eclipsed virus outbreaks and port delays.
But overall trade growth in the world's second-biggest economy may slow in the second half of 2021, a customs official warned on Tuesday, partly reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties as the Delta virus variant wreaks havoc in some countries.
Overall imports also beat expectations, though the pace of gains eased from May, with the values boosted by high raw material prices, customs data showed.
Thanks to Beijing's efforts in largely containing the pandemic earlier than its trading partners, the world's biggest exporter has managed a solid economic revival from the coronavirus-induced slump in the first few months of 2020. 
Exports in dollar terms rose 32.2% in June from a year earlier, compared with 27.9% growth in May. The analysts polled by Reuters had forecasted a 23.1% increase.
""Exports surprised on the upside in June, shrugging off the impact of the temporary Shenzhen port closure and other supply chain bottlenecks,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
""The headline US$ numbers suggest that in real, sequential terms shipments held up in June, after having moderated earlier on from the record levels of end-2020.""
China's trade performance has seen some pressure in recent months, mainly due to a global semiconductor shortage, logistics bottlenecks, and higher raw material and freight costs. 
All the same, the global easings in COVID-19 lockdown measures and vaccination drives appeared to underpin a strong uptick in worldwide demand for Chinese goods.
Germany, for example, which was at first sluggish in its vaccination drive, said this month it had caught up with the United States in terms of the proportion of the population having had one shot of COVID-19 vaccine. Close to half of Americans are now fully vaccinated, while elsewhere in Europe the rate has also increased recently.
China's strong shipment numbers last month underlined some solid factory surveys overseas. A measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June, while Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years.
The data also showed imports increased 36.7% year-on-year last month, beating a 30.0% forecast but slowing from a 51.1% gain in May, which was the highest growth rate in a decade.
China's crude oil imports in the first half fell 3% in their first contraction for the period since 2013, as an import quota shortage and rising global prices curbed buying, but imports of soybeans, natural gas and iron ore rose.
Asian stock markets, partly buffeted over recent weeks by concerns over the spreading Delta virus variant and easing growth rates in China, extended their gains after the trade data and were headed for the best session in more than two weeks. 
China's yuan also rose to a near one-week high against the dollar as the data tempered worries over softening GDP growth. On Friday, the People's Bank of China said it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves to support the economy, especially as smaller firms were unable to pass on rising raw material costs.
PANDEMIC UNCERTAINTIES
China's customs administration spokesperson Li Kuiwen said imported inflation risks were manageable, but cautioned that the country's overall trade still faces uncertainties due to the global pandemic. 
Li, speaking at a news conference in Beijing earlier in the day, said trade growth may slow in the second half of 2021, mainly reflecting the statistical impact of the high growth rate. 
""But overall we think China's foreign trade in the second half still has hopes of achieving relatively fast growth,"" he said.
China posted a trade surplus of $51.53 billion for last month, compared with the poll's forecast for a $44.2 billion surplus and the $45.54 billion surplus in May. 
Asia's economic powerhouse has contained a sporadic coronavirus outbreak in one of its major export hubs in southern Guangdong province last month. However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs and logistics bottlenecks.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
""The pandemic-induced surge in retail sales in advanced economies has started to reverse recently as consumption patterns begin to normalise amid reopening,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""Once retailers in these countries have rebuilt their inventories, softer consumer demand will feed through into weaker foreign demand for Chinese exports."" 

China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to $32.58 billion in June, Reuters calculations based on customs data showed, up from the May figure of $31.78 billion.
Top officials from China and the United States started exchanges in June to address mutual concerns, while the Biden administration is conducting a review of trade policy between the world's two biggest economies, ahead of the expiry of their Phase 1 deal at the end of 2021.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's crude steel output is forecast to jump 30.1% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, as demand is picking up from a pandemic-induced slump in the previous year, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said on Tuesday.
It would mark a second consecutive quarterly increase. 
The ministry estimated crude steel output in the world's No.3 steel producer to be 24.69 million tonnes for the July to September period, up from 18.98 million tonnes a year earlier, boosted by robust demand from industries such as automobile and machinery.
It expects to log a 1.2% increase from the previous quarter, thanks also to expanding public works as part of the government's resilience plan to prevent and mitigate disaster impact, said Daisuke Matsuno, director of METI's metal industries division.
""Manufacturing industry as a whole is on track for a recovery, except for ship-building,"" Matsuno told a news conference.
The predicted steel output for this quarter will beat pre-pandemic production of 24.55 million tonnes in the same quarter in 2019, but it is not clear whether the nation's annual output would reach pre-pandemic level, Matsuno said.
""We will need to watch closely how the recent resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic would impact steel demand at home and abroad,"" he said. 

Demand for steel products, including those for exports, is forecast to increase 17.0% to 21.75 million tonnes in July-September versus a year earlier, the ministry said, citing an industry survey.
Exports are forecast to rise 26.7% to 7.35 million tonnes, the ministry said.

""Stronger productivity growth has been one of the silver linings of the pandemic,"" economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note dated Monday.
""Higher-frequency measures indicate further gains in the middle of the year."" 
The gains are more evident in the information technology sector, followed by professional services, product development and retail sector, the note said.

Industries which have been able to carry on with virtual meetings and reduce expenditure on in-person facilities like travel and entertainment have seen improvements despite the partial re-openings, the analysts said.
Rapid vaccinations have opened parts of the economy this year, but economist Hatzius believes the reopening of offices and the face-to-face economy should not be linked to a pause or reversal of the trend as gains from workplace digitization are sustainable.

Investing.com – Chinese exports recorded a much better-than-expected growth in June, with imports and the trade balance also beating expectations. However, signs are beginning to emerge of a slowdown in China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Customs Administration data released earlier in the day said exports grew 32.2% year-on-year in June, higher than the 23.1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 27.9% growth recorded in May. Imports grew 36.7% year-on year, higher than the forecast 30% growth but below May’s 51.1% growth.
The trade balance stood at $51.53 billion, the highest since January 2021. The surplus was above both the $44.2 billion in Investing.com forecasts and May’s $45.54 billion figure.
The continuous global appetite for Chinese goods such as medical goods and work-from-home equipment helped drive the surprising growth alongside rising prices. But high shipping costs and increasing production capacity outside the country have contributed to supply shortages, a possible sign of the slowdown in the COVID-19 recovery.
“The surprise surge in exports is probably in large part due to rising commodity prices, as commodities like iron ore soared and price pressures passed on from imports to exports,” Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) senior emerging markets economist Zhou Hao told Bloomberg. However, export growth will likely slow in the second half of 2021 because of a high base in 2020, he added.
Customs administration spokesman Li Kuiwen also warned that growth in imports and exports would slow down for the rest of 2021, while noting that “China’s foreign trade in the second half still has hopes of achieving relatively fast growth.”
An outbreak of COVID-19 cases in June 2021 at one of China's major export hubs in southern Guangdong province caused delays in shipments at some major ports for much of the month. Although the outbreak was contained, exporters must now deal with rising raw material and freight costs as well as logistics bottlenecks.
China’s trade surplus with the U.S. continued to increase, reaching $32.6 billion in June. The two countries started exchanges of top officials in June 2021 to address mutual concerns, with the U.S. conducting a review of trade policy, ahead of the expiry of their Phase One trade deal at the end of the year."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's customs administration spokesperson Li Kuiwen said on Tuesday that the country's trade may slow in the second half of 2021, mainly reflecting the statistical impact of the high growth rate last year.
Li, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, also said that imported inflation risks were manageable but China's trade still faces many uncertainties due to the global pandemic.

Exports rose 19.9% from a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official data, up from 18.1% in May. That was higher than the median estimate of 15.1% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Growth in imports in yuan slowed to 26.1% in June from 39.5% in the previous month.
The customs administration published data for the first half of the year showing exports in yuan terms climbed 28.1% from a year earlier, while imports rose 25.9%. China will publish monthly data for June and also the value of trade in dollars later Tuesday.
Global appetite for Chinese goods including medical goods and work-from-home equipment helped to spur exports this year. But there are emerging signs the momentum could begin to moderate as the world economy and production capacity elsewhere recovers.

National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s index of business conditions dropped 12 points to +24 in June, after climbing 5 points in a very strong May survey. 
The survey's measure of confidence slipped 9 points to +11, though that was still above the long-term average.
""The decline in conditions was broad-based across states but led by a significant decline in Victoria coming off the back of the lockdown that started in late May but was eased, in a series of steps, over June,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
However, as the lockdown in Victoria eased, another began in Greater Sydney which looks set to extend for several weeks.
""The hope is that, as like previous episodes of shutdowns, that businesses bounce back on reopening,"" added Oster. ""While, there is less fiscal support around, businesses conditions have been strong and hopefully the recovery continues.""
The survey measure for trading, or sales, fell 10 points to a still-high +35 in June, while profitability lost 13 points to +25 and employment 8 points to +17.
Capacity utilisation dipped back to 83.9%, while forward orders shed 9 points to +15.

Confidence fell in all industries except mining and manufacturing, with recreation & personal suffering a steep 27 point decline as businesses were shut.
The NAB survey was conducted from June 18-30, catching the start of the Sydney lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported a record annual increase in sales in the three months to the end of June, although growth was flattered by widespread store closures a year earlier due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The British Retail Consortium - members of which tend to be large high-street chains and supermarkets - said on Tuesday that sales in the second quarter of 2021 were 28.4% higher than a year earlier and 10.4% higher than two years before.
The year-on-year increase was the largest since the BRC's records began in 1995.
""The gradual unlocking of the UK economy encouraged a release of pent-up demand,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
While supermarkets have been trading throughout the pandemic, 'non-essential' retailers such as clothing stores were closed for most of this year, before reopening in England on April 12. Dates varied in other parts of the United Kingdom.
Total sales in June alone were up 13.1% on two years earlier, compared with growth of 10.0% in May. Versus last year, sales were 10.4% higher on a total basis and 6.7% higher on a like-for-like basis which adjusts for changes in floorspace.
""Fashion and footwear did well while the sun was out in the first half of June, while the start of Euro 2020 provided a boost for TVs, snack food and beer,"" Dickinson said.
England's men's soccer team enjoyed a successful run in the Euro 2020 international tournament before losing in the final against Italy on Sunday.
Data released on Monday for early July showed underwhelming numbers of shoppers during the tournament's final week. 
Payments processor Barclaycard said its measure of consumer spending was also up strongly in June and stood 11.1% higher than in June 2019. In May, the same measure - which is based on almost half of British credit and debit card payments - showed spending was up 7.6%.

Spending at pubs and bars soared by 38% compared with two years ago, the biggest rise since September, and food and drink specialist stores such as off-licences saw sales jump by 76%.
""June saw Brits flock back to pubs, bars and beer gardens to watch the football and tennis on the big screens, as the heatwave early in the month encouraged many of us to get out in the sunshine and socialise,"" Barclaycard's head of consumer products, Raheel Ahmed, said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's mining-driven economy is set for a ""vigorous"" rebound this year that should limit the need for the incoming government set to take office on July 28 to open the fiscal spending taps, current Economy Minister Waldo Mendoza said on Monday.
Peru's economy will expand by at least 10% this year and 5% the next due to fiscal injections already made, while benefiting from high global prices of commodities including copper, the country's most important export, Mendoza said. 
The Andean country, the world's no. 2 copper producer behind Chile, is waiting for socialist Pedro Castillo to be formally confirmed the next president after he narrowly edged out a conservative rival in a June 6 election. He has pledged to hike taxes on mining and increase spending on healthcare and education.
""We can grow 10%, 11% and maybe 12% this year without any additional fiscal boost thanks to the recovery of companies that have been supported by large programs of credit, funded with a state guarantee,"" Mendoza said at a press conference.
In comments aimed at the likely new leftist government Mendoza said tax hikes should be made cautiously to avoid impacting the competitiveness of the economy and said his team intended to share proposals with the incoming administration.
Castillo, a teacher and son of peasant farmers, has rattled the Andean country's political and business elite with proposals to shake up mining laws and the constitution, though he has of late looked to win over investors with more market-friendly rhetoric.
""The temptation to spend more, get into debt, is a temptation that we should not fall into,"" said Mendoza. ""Macroeconomic stability is necessary, let's not underestimate it.""

Mendoza said that the current government will leave ""very solid"" public accounts, with international reserves at 36.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) and public debt at 34% of GDP, strong levels compared to neighboring countries in the region.
""The external context is terrific,"" he said. ""It is an additional boost for the recovery, which is coming along well and is very vigorous.""

""Next week we will discuss new forward guidance that includes the new definition of price stability,"" ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Monday at an event organised by London-based think-tank OMFIF.
""The formulation of the forward guidance has to be modified to include the new definition of price stability.""
A long-awaited ECB strategy review last week saw the bank tweak its inflation target to a flat 2% in the medium term from ""below but close to 2%"" previously.
The ECB's current guidance says it will pump in stimulus via bond buys for as long as necessary and keep interest rates at their current record-low, sub-zero levels until it has seen the inflation outlook ""robustly converge"" to its goal.
De Guindos said that while the 19-country euro zone economy was currently in recovery mode, the situation remained ""fragile"" due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, adding that some members, like Spain, were not doing as well as Germany.

""We will need to maintain favourable financing conditions,"" the former Spanish economy minister said. ""The withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary stimuli has to be very prudent, very gradual and should not be premature.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose for the third straight month in May, a welcome sign for an economy struggling to overcome the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
The government imposed a new state of emergency in Tokyo that will run through to Aug. 22 in an attempt to control the health crisis, clouding the outlook for the economy even as activity in many other countries rebounds.
The jump in core orders indicates a modest revival in corporate spending, seen by policymakers as necessary to accelerate Japan's tepid recovery.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, jumped 7.8% in May from the previous month, beating a 2.6% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and compared with a rise of 0.6% in April.
""The data confirmed a recovery in capital spending by manufacturers,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""But while non-manufacturers saw quite a big rebound in orders, their starting point was different. They haven't seen a recovery in conditions yet.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers grew 2.8%, boosted by electrical machinery, helped by demand for such investments due to a global semiconductor supply shortage. 
Those from non-manufacturers rose 10.0%, rebounding from the prior month's sharp decline, led by other non-manufacturers and telecommunications, which saw orders rise for the first time in six months, the Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
Separate Bank of Japan data on Monday showed Japanese wholesale prices rose 5.0% in the year to June, a sign global inflationary pressures are weighing on firms that are still facing coronavirus emergency curbs at home.
In declaring the state of emergency, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said last week it was key to prevent Tokyo, which is hosting the Olympic Games, from becoming a flashpoint of new infections.
But with the move, Suga risks hurting Japan's economic recovery. Dai-ichi Life Research Institute estimated that the state of emergency could slash about 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) from gross domestic product and cut 55,000 jobs over the coming months.
Lawmakers from the prime minister's Liberal Democratic Party have escalated calls for a new relief package, with party heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai saying an extra budget of around 30 trillion yen ($270 billion) is needed.
On Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan stands ready to pump more money into the economy, providing support for businesses and people in need.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders for the first time since December, saying they were showing signs of pickup.

From a year earlier, core machinery orders, which exclude those for ships and electricity, rose 12.2% in May, beating a 6.3% advance expected by economists.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices continued to surge in June as import costs spiked at the fastest pace on record, data showed on Monday, a sign rising raw material costs were weighing on corporate profits.
Households may also start to feel the pinch as recent increases in oil costs are likely to push up consumer inflation in coming months, though the rebound will be more modest in Japan than in other advanced nations due to weak demand, analysts say.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 5.0% in June from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, beating a median market forecast for a 4.7% gain.
It followed a 5.1% increase in May, which was the fastest pace of growth since September 2008, and marked the fourth straight month of year-on-year gain.
""Wholesale prices will remain under upward pressure as steady COVID-19 vaccinations continue to support the global economic recovery,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division.
""More and more companies are being able to pass on higher costs,"" mainly in sectors like steel and energy, he said.
Of the 744 items consisting CGPI, the number of items that saw prices rise in June exceeded that for price falls by 75 - up from 57 in May.
In a sign a weak yen was inflating raw material costs for firms, the yen-based import price index surged 28.0% in June to mark the fastest year-on-year gain on record.
An index gauging raw material prices jumped 49.8% in June from a year earlier, as commodities ranging from fuel oil to wood see prices spike on solid global demand.

On the other hand, domestic final goods prices - which loosely track the consumer price index - rose just 2.0% in a sign weak domestic demand was still discouraging many firms from passing on the higher costs to their corporate customers.
Japan's economy is recovering moderately as robust exports offset some of the weakness in consumption. But a resurgent coronavirus forced Japan to declare a state of emergency in the capital Tokyo that will last through the Olympics Games, casting doubts over the strength of the recovery.

LONDON (Reuters) - Big businesses in Britain are rushing ahead with post-lockdown investment plans that could usher in a long-awaited improvement in the country's weak productivity growth, a survey of chief finance officers showed.
Accountancy firm Deloitte said its poll found CFOs were planning to increase investment, as well as hiring, at the fastest pace in almost seven years and were their most aggressive about acquisitions in 11 years.
Many firms around the world have ramped up their spending on digital technology in response to the coronavirus pandemic which up-ended their working practices.
Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said CFOs were much less concerned about Brexit. COVID-19 was still the top of the worry list, followed by inflation and climate change. Over three quarters of CFOs reported growing recruitment problems.
""The pandemic, like all major shocks, will reshape the economy and we are likely to see years of normal growth compressed into just a few months,"" he said.
Eight in 10 CFOs who took part in the survey said they thought productivity would grow faster after the pandemic. 
""That offers the hope of a more comprehensive recovery than after the global financial crisis,"" Stewart said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Friday he expected that an increase in productivity gains brought about by more investment in technology since the onset of the coronavirus crisis would prove to be lasting.
Slow productivity growth weighs on an economy's long-term growth potential and ultimately the earnings of workers, and has plagued Britain's economy since the late 2000s.
Deloitte said 71% of CFOs it polled expected to increase capital expenditure - helped by British finance minister Rishi Sunak's two-year tax break for corporate investment - and 76% expected more hiring over the year ahead. By contrast, 2020's top priority had been cost reduction. 

The Deloitte survey was conducted between June 16 and 29 and polled 107 CFOs from companies, 69 of them UK-listed with a combined market value of 548 billion pounds ($758 billion).

VENICE (Reuters) - COVID-19 is probably only a forerunner of increasingly dangerous pandemics in the future and governments need to find $75 billion over the next 5 years to prepare for them, a panel of experts told finance ministers of the Group of 20 rich countries on Friday.
In a report to the G20 meeting in Venice the panel said the $15 bln per year of investments it recommended doubled current spending levels but was ""negligible"" compared with the costs of another major outbreak of a new contagious illness.
""The economic case for these additional investments is overwhelming,"" said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who co-chaired the 23-member panel along with World Trade Organization Chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Singapore's former finance minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
Summers told Reuters in an interview he was ""guardedly optimistic"" its recommendations would be implemented and said ""we won't be reluctant to speak out"" if they are not.
""Spending tens of billions of dollars could save tens of trillions,"" he said.
To plug ""major gaps"" in pandemic preparedness, the panel identified four main areas for action: infectious disease surveillance, resilience of national health systems, supply and delivery of vaccines and other medicines, and global governance.
The report, titled ""Global deal for a pandemic age"", called for the creation of a $10 bln annual Global Health Threats Fund, plus $5 bln to strengthen the World Health Organization and create dedicated pandemic facilities at the World Bank and multilateral development banks.
In addition, low and middle-income income countries would need to add about 1% of gross domestic product to public spending on health over the next five years, it said. 
""Achieving safety from pandemics will require a basic shift in thinking about international cooperation,"" said Shanmugaratnam. ""It is the ultimate case for both national self-interest and international solidarity at the same time.""
The panel was set up in January and includes prominent names such as former European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, Ana Botin, executive chairman of the Santander (MC:SAN) group, and Guntram Wolff, head of the Bruegel think-tank.

The G20, chaired this year by Italy, will consider its recommendations in the lead up to a joint finance and health ministers' meeting in October. 
Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters the finance ministers had been ""generally very positive"" about the report and she was confident it would be taken forward.

LONDON (Reuters) -British goods exports to the European Union rose to their highest since October 2019 in May, official data showed on Friday, reversing a slump at the start of 2021 when Britain exited the bloc's single market and customs union.
Britain's government is likely to view the data as backing its expectation that the change in customs arrangements would only cause temporary inconvenience to most businesses.
However, overall trade with the EU has lagged behind growth in sales to the rest of the world, and business groups said they still faced extra red tape dealing with European customers and suppliers as a result of Brexit.
""While we are seeing a modest pick-up in demand for UK goods in the last month as economies reopen, the overall climate remains fragile,"" the head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, William Bain, said after the data.
Britain's Office for National Statistics said goods exports to the European Union, excluding precious metals, rose to 14.0 billion pounds ($19.4 billion) in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, their highest since October 2019 and almost twice January's level.
Total goods exports of 27.9 billion pounds, excluding precious metals, were the highest since January 2020, just before the coronavirus pandemic began to cause disruption.
Imports from the EU have also risen after a slump at the start of the year, when COVID-19 disrupted traffic across the English Channel, although they remain slightly below imports from the rest of the world. Before 2021, Britain almost always sourced most of its imports from the EU.
The head of Britain's biggest port - Dover (NYSE:DOV) - told Reuters trade disruption could return if British holidaymakers head for European summer breaks, adding to strain on stretched customs staff.
LONG-TERM EFFECT HARD TO MEASURE
Britain formally left the EU at the end of January 2020, and remained in the EU's single market and customs union for a further 11 months while it negotiated a trade agreement.
Teasing out the longer-term impact of Brexit is made harder by the slump in exports caused by COVID-19 last year, and brinkmanship in Britain's parliament in 2018 and 2019 that led to periodic fears of potential sudden border checks.
The Bank of England said last year it expected a long-term reduction in trade with the EU. Some smaller businesses - especially those selling fresh produce such as seafood - face big regulatory hurdles.
Comparing the first five months of 2021 with the same period of 2020 - which includes the severe initial impact of COVID - trade with countries outside the EU grew faster.
British exports outside the EU increased by 8%, while those to the EU rose by 5%. Imports from the EU were broadly flat while imports from further afield rose by 19%.
""The longer-term picture ... shows the severe headwinds of the pandemic, rising raw material and shipping costs, and ongoing Brexit red tape are having on the ability of UK businesses to trade with EU customers,"" Bain said.

The British figures on exports to the EU contrast sharply with recent data from Eurostat. This showed a 27% fall in EU imports from Britain for the first four months of 2021, due largely to a change in methodology on Jan. 1 to no longer count goods shipped from Britain which originated further afield.
The ONS said its figures were more consistent when comparing exports over time. ($1 = 0.7227 pounds)

Chinese banks extended 2.12 trillion yuan ($327 billion) in new yuan loans in June, up from 1.5 trillion yuan the previous month, data from the People's Bank of China showed on Friday. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.8 trillion yuan in June. 
The Chinese economy has largely rebounded to its pre-pandemic growth levels, driven by the surprisingly resilient export sector. However, smaller firms are bearing the brunt of the recent surge in raw material prices, as they struggle to pass on increased costs to consumers.
To help small firms coping with rising costs, the PBOC on Friday also announced a new cut in the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, the first such move since April last year when the economy was still badly affected by the coronavirus crisis.
Loans to households rose to 868.5 billion yuan in June from 623.2 billion yuan in May, while corporate loans surged to 1.46 trillion yuan from 805.7 billion yuan in May. 
In June, total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 3.67 trillion yuan from 1.92 trillion yuan in May and substantially higher than analysts' forecasts of 2.87 trillion yuan. 
TSF includes off-balance-sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
The outstanding TSF rose 11% to 301.56 trillion yuan ($46.49 trillion) at the end of June from a year earlier. 
Broad M2 money supply grew 8.6% from a year earlier, also above estimates of 8.2% forecast in the Reuters poll. M2 grew 8.3% in May from a year ago.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Capital expenditure growth in Japan sped up in May, a Reuters poll of 18 economists showed, a glimmer of hope that solid exports may help boost private-sector investment for a post-pandemic growth.
Cabinet Office data due at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350 GMT Sunday) will likely show core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 2.6% in May.
It would mark a third straight month of increase, accelerating from the previous month's 0.6% gain.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity utilities, likely grew 6.3% in May, following a 6.5% growth in the previous month.
""Restrictions on people's movement have eased in those countries that have proceeded with vaccinations, raising the prospects for economic recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That has helped boost shipments of capital goods and information-related items"" underpinning Japanese exports and business investment, he added.
Separate data by the Bank of Japan, due at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350 GMT Sunday) will probably show Japan's wholesale prices rose 4.7% year-on-year in June, slowing from the prior month's fastest annual pace in 13 years.
That would ease some concerns about higher commodity costs squeezing profits at firms struggling to pass on rising costs to customers.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for their goods, rose 0.6% month-on-month in June, slowing from the prior month's 0.7% increase.
With global inflationary pressures are pinching firms already hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the uptick in wholesale inflation is unlikely to prod the BOJ into withdrawing its massive stimulus any time soon.

As years of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its powerful monetary easing for the foreseeable future.
The poll showed the BOJ will likely keep a -0.1% target for short-term rates and cap 10-year bond yields around 0% under its yield curve control at its July 15-16 policy-setting meeting.

Although the statistical base effects of sharp declines from a year ago are seen keeping headline trade numbers attractive, real demand has also made a significant recovery in recent months.
Exports are expected to have risen 23.1% in June from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 15 economists, compared with a 27.9% gain in May.
Imports likely rose 30.0% last month year-on-year, the poll showed, compared to 51.1% growth in May.

A measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June, while Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years.
However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs and logistics bottlenecks.
There are signs that production bottlenecks are beginning to ease in Asia, said Frederic Neumann, an economist with HSBC, in a note. But ""that won't provide imminent relief: manufacturing elsewhere still appears tight, and there are still transportation ripples that need to be dealt with,"" he said.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
China's factory gate inflation eased in June after a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices, but the annual rate stayed uncomfortably high and underlined growing strains on the economy as Beijing tries to bolster a post-coronavirus revival.

And a private survey showed activity in the country's factories expanded at a softer pace last month, as the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the export province of Guangdong and supply chain woes drove output growth to the lowest in 15 months. 
The trade surplus is expected to be $44.20 billion in June, narrowing slightly from $45.54 billion in May, the poll showed. The data will be released on Tuesday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Rising costs to ship crops globally are adding to concerns about food inflation that are already at decade-highs and hitting cost-sensitive consumers in import-dependent markets.
The cost of bulk carriers that move grains and oilseeds from production hubs in the Americas and Black Sea to key consumers have roughly doubled from last year due to rising fuel costs, tighter vessel supply and longer port turnaround times amid COVID-19 curbs, according to grain and shipping sources. 
""Freight cost has become a real challenge as it comes when we see huge increases in grain prices,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Melbourne.
""For years, buyers enjoyed low grain and freight prices. I see no immediate end to high freight costs."" 
Crop shipping costs surge on key routes as higher fuel costs, slower turnaround times bite https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jbyvrzezjve/CropShippingCosts.png 
The cost of moving grains from Australia to Southeast Asia has risen to $30 a tonne from $15 last year, and to $55 from $25 from the U.S. Pacific Northwest to Asia, shipping sources said.
Ships carrying wheat from the Black Sea to Asia now cost around $65 a tonne, from around $35 last year.
""It is the cost of bunker fuel and the cost of bulk ships lifting the prices of carrying grains,"" said one trader at a leading brokerage in Singapore. ""We also have COVID-19 quarantine requirements slowing cargo movement.""
FUEL TO THE FIRE
With world food prices having risen at their fastest pace in over a decade in May, the spike in crop freight costs poses a fresh challenge to food importers and policymakers attempting to keep inflation levels in check just as several key economies reopen following coronavirus lockdowns.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate prices rose at a slower pace and consumer inflation also eased after the government stepped up efforts to rein in rising commodity prices.
China’s producer price index (PPI) rose 8.8% year-on-year in June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Forecasts prepared by Investing.com expected an 8.8% growth in June, while a 9% increase was recorded in May.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.1% year-on-year and decreased 0.4% month-on-month in June, compared with a 1.3% rise and 0.1% decrease during the previous year and month respectively.
The world’s second-biggest economy continued its economic recovery from COVID-19 but this was clouded by persistently high inflationary pressures in the industrial sector. Chinese regulators are increasingly worried that small firms will not be able to pass on the higher costs to consumers.
However, price increase slowed in the oil and natural gas extraction, as well as the ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting and processing sectors, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a statement accompanying the data release.
“The domestic policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices in the commodity sector is showing initial effect, driving an improvement in the market supply and demand, and a slowdown in price gains of industrial products,” Dong added.
Commodity prices of coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged in recent months as many countries eased COVID-19 curbs. To help address the issue, China’s State Council hinted on Wednesday that the People's Bank of China could cut its reserve requirement ratio for banks to give the economy a boost. It would be the first such move since April 2020, when China’s economy was badly hurt by COVID-19.
Previously, China, the world’s biggest consumer of both coal and iron ore, sold supplies from state reserves which triggered a drop in steel and copper prices.
“China’s inflation pressures are mainly on the PPI side, which is actually peaking out and will come down in the second half modestly,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) chief China economist Zhu Haibin told Bloomberg."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate inflation eased in June after a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices, but the annual rate stayed uncomfortably high and underlined growing strains on the economy as Beijing tries to bolster a post-coronavirus revival.
The persistently high inflationary pressures in the industrial sector prompted China's cabinet this week to flag potential policy easing measures, mainly to support smaller firms.
Friday's data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the producer price index (PPI) increased 8.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 9.0% rise in May, and in line with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll.
The NBS also released consumer price inflation data, which showed a slowing last month and limited pass-through from high factory gate prices.
The PPI, a benchmark gauge of a country's industrial profitability, inched up 0.3% on a monthly basis, easing sharply from a 1.6% uptick in May, as prices for copper and steel fell. 
The monthly slowdown comes as China, the world's biggest consumer of both coal and iron ore, has stepped up efforts to rein in runaway metals prices. The measures included selling supplies from state reserves and launching investigation of illegal stockpiling and price gouging..
""The domestic policy of ensuring supply and stabilising prices in the commodity sector is showing initial effect, driving an improvement in the market supply and demand, and a slowdown in price gains of industrial products,"" said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a statement accompanying the data release 
Yet, some analysts believe the government crackdown will have only a limited impact due to an ongoing imbalance between tight supplies and rising demand by more countries recovering from the pandemic.
""PPI continued to hover at an elevated level in June and we did not see a significant fallback,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank, adding that he expects PPI to trend above 7% year-on-year in the second half of the year. 
""Despite the recent changes in commodity prices, we cannot rule out price gains would accelerate again in H2. We need to stay alert to the possibility of another peak in factory-gate inflation.""
Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), expects PPI would stay around 8-9% in the second half of the year, given the recent strength in international crude oil prices. 
POLICY SUPPORT?
Chinese leaders have raised increasing alarm over the negative impact of rising raw material prices on many small firms, which are unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers.
That in turn has stoked broader worries of a stalling in the post-COVID recovery of the world's second-biggest economy.
To help firms cope with rising commodity prices, the country's cabinet on Wednesday raised the prospect of timely cuts to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserve, which would be the first such move since April last year when the economy was badly jolted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Price gains slowed in annual terms in the oil and natural gas extraction, and ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting and processing sectors, statistics agency's Dong said. 
Many analysts expect the pent-up COVID demand has peaked and China's growth rates are starting to moderate in the second half of the year, weighed by weakening exports, surging producer price inflation and Beijing's continued crackdown on property market. 
NBS data also showed China's consumer price index (CPI) rose1.1% in June in annual terms, slower than a 1.3% gain tipped by the Reuters poll, pointing to limited pass-through to consumers from the high industrial prices.
Pork prices, a key component of China's CPI, have been on the decline in recent months, driving a drop of 1.7% in food prices. Concerned about tumbling pork prices, authorities late last month also announced plans to buy pork for state reserves.
China's annual average consumer inflation is likely to be below 2% this year, the central bank governor Yi Gang said last month, well below the government target of around 3%.
Core inflation, which strips of volatile food and energy prices, stood at a mild rate 0.9% in June, unchanged from May, a potential source of concern for policymakers as it suggests underlying demand remains weak. 

""In our view, the elevated PPI inflation reading is the result of supply side constraints, so we expect Beijing to turn to easing measures – rather than tightening – to contain the surge in raw materials prices and support growth,"" said analysts at Nomura.
""The low CPI inflation reading, though largely driven by slumping pork prices, also provides space for Beijing to ease.""

46,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 10:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation eased in June from an almost 13-year high in the previous month as a stronger dollar and government measures helped to cool commodity prices.
The producer price index rose 8.8% from a year earlier after jumping 9% in May, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. That was the same as the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Consumer prices increased 1.1% from a year ago, lower than in May and below the estimate of 1.2%.
Global commodity prices were mostly flat in June after rallying for more than a year, with the Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift pushing the greenback higher and weighing on commodities, which are mostly priced in dollars. Chinese regulators also took a number of steps to tame prices, from requesting commodity firms cut their bullish futures bets to pledging more releases of metal reserves.
The data was in line with the decline of both input and output prices in the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in June. A higher base a year earlier, when the economy was starting to recover from the pandemic, also likely helped to moderate inflation.
So far, price pressures have been mostly felt by upstream sectors, with producers unable to pass on the price increases to consumers due to intense competition and a slow recovery in domestic consumer demand. People’s Bank of China’s Governor Yi Gang said last month that consumer inflation will stay under 2% this year, below the government’s official target of about 3%.
In a surprise move, the government hinted this week that it will cut the reserve requirement ratio, or the amount of money banks must keep in reserve, in order to help firms deal with the impact of rising commodity prices. This could better support small businesses and lower their financing costs, the State Council said in a statement Wednesday.

The analysis looks at spread of the virus' Delta variant versus the pace of vaccination, which in some countries is not accelerating enough to offset higher rates of transmission.
Even if the Delta variant is shown to result in lower hospitalization and death rates, the report said, pressure on healthcare systems and a higher absolute number of deaths could occur, likely raising pressure on some governments to extend or re-impose mobility restrictions.
A separate note from Oxford Economics showed strong economic activity rebounds in Latin America on the back of gains in mobility.
(Graphic: Journey to the new normal, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzzandvw/2021-07-08_12h39_39.png) 
The JPMorgan analysis said vaccination thresholds for getting mobility back to normal vary by country, so the results are best taken as relative performance from country to country.
""The model estimates suggest that the Philippines, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and Colombia face the longest journeys back to pre-pandemic levels of mobility, while Singapore, Turkey, India and Brazil have the shortest journeys.""

In Latin America, authorities have been less likely to re-impose or lengthen mobility restrictions, the report said.
""While the region has shown surprising resilience in the face of the virus and other headwinds, downside risks to growth could still manifest through the impact of worsening public health on confidence even if the uptrend in mobility remains in place.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The economy of Latin America and the Caribbean should grow 5.2% in 2021, although uncertainty remained about countries' uneven progress in dealing with structural problems and COVID-19 vaccination plans, the United Nations' ECLAC said on Thursday.
After the 6.8% contraction in 2020, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean upgraded its view for this year versus the 3.7% rise it projected in December.
""The dynamics and persistence of growth in 2021 and going forward are subject to uncertainties arising from uneven progress in vaccinations and the capacity that countries have to reverse structural problems,"" ECLAC said in a report.
This year's forecasts reflect the low base of comparison set in 2020, when economic activity was beset by the pandemic.
""The structural problems that limited the growth of the region before the pandemic were exacerbated and will negatively impact the recovery of economic activity and labor markets beyond the 2021 growth rebound and 2022,"" the agency said.
It highlighted the explosive growth in electronic commerce. But it said digitization was aimed at the use of mature technologies, such as broadband, rather than the internet and artificial intelligence.
Panama, Peru and Chile should score the best performances in the year, with expansions of 12%, 9.5% and 8%, respectively, it said. Brazil, the top economy in the region, should grow by 4.5%, while Mexico was set to advance 5.8% and Argentina, 6.3%.

While the upward trajectory of commodity prices should benefit Latin America this year, ECLAC said its duration going forward was uncertain.
Despite the increase in employment in the first quarter of 2021, the region had so far only recovered 58% of the total jobs that have been lost during the pandemic.

Businesses have reopened at a rapid clip, boosted by a rollback in restrictions now that more than 155 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. Still, the job market rebound has been anything but steady despite recent employment gains.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 373,000 for the week ended July 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 350,000 applications for the latest week.
""Through some of the noise in the data it still looks like the trend for filings keeps moving lower over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been cited for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There were a record 9.2 million job openings at the end of May and 9.5 million people were officially unemployed in June.
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid declined 145,000 to 3.339 million during the week ended June 26, the claims report showed. There were 14.2 million people receiving benefits under all programs in late June, a fall from 14.7 million earlier in the month.
The data comes on the heels of an encouraging monthly jobs report from the Labor Department last Friday, which showed U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months in June.
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020 but remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is seen as consistent with a healthy labor market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, fell 250 to 394,750.
The claims data may remain volatile in the coming weeks as 25 states with mostly Republican governors pull out of federal government-funded unemployment programs. These included a $300 weekly check, which businesses complained was encouraging the jobless to stay at home. 

Those collecting benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs dropped by nearly 465,000 in the week ended June 19, the largest decline since early May. At a combined 10.7 million, their rolls were the lowest since the start of the year. 
The early termination of aid began on June 5 and will run through July 31, when Louisiana, the only one of those states with a Democratic governor, ends the weekly check. For the rest of the country, these benefits will lapse on Sept. 6.

Investing.com -- The improvement in the U.S. labor market stalled again last week, as the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits edged up from a week earlier.
Labor Department data showed that initial jobless claims rose to 373,000, disappointing hopes for a new post-pandemic low of 350,000. Last week’s total was also revised up by 7,000 to 371,000.
Continuing claims, which are collated with a one-week lag to initial ones, continued to fall as more states phased out the enhanced benefits that were offered during the most acute phase of the pandemic. At 3.339 million, they were effectively in line with consensus forecasts.
The numbers come at a time of growing concern that the U.S. economy’s rebound may be topping out, as favorable base effects fade and the spread of new variants of Covid-19 threatens to cause fresh havoc in parts of the country where vaccination rates have lagged.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of British staff on furlough fell to a new low last month as employers struggled to fill vacancies and consumers appeared to shrug off a new rise in COVID-19 cases, adding to signs of recovery as restrictions are lifted.
Britain's economy has rebounded in recent months after 2020's record slump, but some analysts worry that growth could be dampened by any further surge in coronavirus infections caused by the more contagious Delta variant.
Businesses reported that the proportion of staff on furlough dropped to 5% in the last two weeks of June from 6% in the first half of the month, the Office for National Statistics said.
Almost a third of workers were furloughed at the peak of the job-support programme in May 2020. The scheme is due to end on Sept. 30.
Many businesses are reporting difficulty recruiting staff, especially in sectors such as hospitality which shed employees during the pandemic and relied heavily on workers from the European Union before Britain left the bloc.
The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said businesses were hiring staff at the fastest rate since it started collecting records in the late 1990s.
Figures from recruiter Adzuna showed the number of online job adverts as of July 2 was 35% higher than in February 2020 - before the pandemic's impact was felt in Britain - and up 4% on the previous week.
Though COVID-19 cases have hit their highest level since January, the government says it is confident the roll-out of vaccines means there will be fewer hospital admissions and deaths.
It plans to lift most remaining restrictions on public events and social distancing in pubs and restaurants on July 19, after a four-week delay intended to allow more vaccinations.
ECONOMY NOT YET RECOVERED
The economy as a whole is not expected to regain its pre-crisis size until the end of 2021, in contrast to the much faster recovery in the United States. Spending remains below pre-pandemic levels and a peak hit earlier this year.
Weekly Bank of England data showed consumer spending on credit and debit cards rose by 3 percentage points to 96% of its February 2020 level in the week to July 1 although it was below its level a month earlier.
Spending on socialising rose to 84% of its pre-pandemic level from 80% the previous week, but remained the weakest of the four main categories in the data.
A separate survey suggested Britons were again close to the recent peak level of confidence seen in May, when some COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. There was a dip in June when cases of the Delta variant rose.
The daily survey, conducted by data company Morning Consult https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/07/uk-consumer-confidence, showed consumer confidence in Britain was below pre-pandemic levels but had recovered quickly from the Delta dip, as it did after cases were detected of an earlier strain of COVID-19.

""The impact of increases in cases resulting from the Delta variant is very different to the impact of the increases in cases in February 2020,"" Morning Consult's chief economist John Leer said. ""It becomes easier for consumers to shake off increases in cases realising that hospitalisations and deaths are so much lower than they were before.""
But consumers in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, the United States and China, were showing signs of uncertainty about the longer-term effects of the pandemic on the economy, and this could limit spending growth, Leer said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index rose for the first time in three months in June, a government survey showed Thursday,
even as the government prepared to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo to curb a new wave of coronavirus infections.
The index, which rose 9.5 points to 47.6 in June, is based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff who are called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.
While that index focused on prevailing business conditions, a separate index measuring the outlook for future conditions improved for a second straight month, gaining 4.8 points to 52.4 in June. 
Some analysts say the improvement could prove temporary given that the plans for a fourth round of coronavirus emergency measures in Tokyo from next week through August 22, to make the capital safer while it hosts the Olympic Games.
Based on the survey, the Cabinet Office upgraded its view of the economy, saying it was ""picking up"", albeit from a severe condition. 
Having also sounded a cautiously optimistic note, the Bank of Japan is set to hold a policy review on July 15-16, when it will give its latest projections for growth and inflation.

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in the first quarter and likely grew only modestly in the April-June period.
Many analysts expect consumption to remain a soft, due in part to a slow vaccine roll-out.

Taiwan has been encouraging its firms to invest at home, having seen companies flock back to the island during the China-U.S. trade war, to avoid being affected by punitive tariffs both of those countries have imposed on imports from each other.
The Cabinet said in a statement that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been no let up in investment by companies in Taiwan, where the economy and especially the tech exports have continued to boom, driven by demand globally from people working and studying from home during lockdowns.
With more than 50 companies awaiting approval for investment projects, and to encourage more, the Cabinet said it would offer another T$150 billion in loans to help with financing, after previous funding was used up.
Export-dependent Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors, a shortage of which has impacted global auto makers in particular, and Taiwan companies are ramping up capacity to meet the demand.
Taiwan's exports in the first half of this year exceed $200 billion, a record high, driven in large part by its tech and chip products.

The figures underscore the view that many companies are emerging from the pandemic's immediate hit, but holding onto cash on uncertainty over the economic outlook.
""The balance of bank lending remains at elevated levels, but corporate fund demand seems to be subsiding,"" a Bank of Japan official told reporters at a briefing.
Total outstanding loans held by Japanese banks rose 1.4% in June from a year earlier to 578 trillion yen ($5.23 trillion), BOJ data showed, the slowest growth rate since January 2013.
Major banks saw lending fall 1.6% last month, posting the first year-on-year decline since November 2012, as some big borrowers paid back loans thanks to higher profits.
Total deposits held by banks stood at 834 trillion yen, hitting a fresh record.
Japan has not experienced the kind of explosive COVID-19 outbreaks seen in many other countries but has had more than 800,000 cases and 14,800 deaths.

Slow vaccine rollouts and a resurgence in infections are likely to force authorities to impose another state of emergency in Tokyo through Aug. 22, putting more pressure on a fragile economic recovery.

Vacancies also reached their highest level since the launch of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation's (REC) survey almost 24 years ago.
""Recruiters are working flat out to fill roles across our economy,"" Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said. ""The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time.""
Britain's labour market was supported through lockdowns by the government's huge job subsidy programme and hiring is bouncing back as the economy reopens.
Most remaining COVID restrictions are due to end in England on July 19, allowing pubs and restaurants to serve greater numbers of customers and large-scale public events to resume.
But with many foreign workers leaving Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, the search for staff has become a problem for many firms.
The REC survey showed starting salaries jumped by the most since 2014 and a rise in hourly pay rates for short-term staff was the strongest since 2004, something the Bank of England will note as it assesses how temporary a recent rise in inflation is likely to prove.
Carberry said the phasing out of the government's coronavirus emergency job subsidies between July and the end of September might mean more people would be looking for work.
British recruiters PageGroup and Robert Walters both raised profit forecasts on Wednesday due to increased hiring in a number of countries where they operate.
But PageGroup's chief executive said it was too soon to know if the surge in hiring represented temporary pent-up demand or the start of a longer-term increase.
A separate survey, published by the British Chambers of Commerce, underscored the problems faced by many employers looking to hire workers as the economy reopens.
The BCC said 52% of firms attempted to recruit in the second quarter of 2021, the most since immediately before the pandemic hit Britain. Some 70% of them reported difficulties finding staff, up 7 percentage points from the first quarter. 

The sector with the highest proportion of firms reporting difficulties was construction at 82%, followed by hotels and catering at 76%.
Nearly 40% of firms expected to expand their workforce in the next quarter, higher than a pre-pandemic 2018-19 average of 29%, the BCC said.

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden made the case for spending trillions of dollars on U.S. infrastructure, paid for by higher taxes on corporations, at an Illinois community college on Wednesday, as opposition builds from U.S. business groups.
In a speech Biden focused on what he called ""human infrastructure"" priorities that did not make it into a $1.2 trillion bipartisan deal struck with Republicans.
The policies include tax rebates for parents, free preschool and community college, healthcare and clean energy subsidies as well as 12 weeks of paid medical leave, financed by raising corporate taxes on U.S. companies.
Biden said a minimum tax of 15% on companies that manage to avoid paying taxes would raise $240 billion and could be used to finance his plans, which he acknowledged are ""really expensive""
""The fact is that it is paid for,"" he said. ""Everybody has to pay their fair share. I'm not trying to gouge anybody. They've just got to get in the game,"" he said.
Corporations currently supply less than 10% of U.S. tax revenue, down from nearly 40% in the 1940s. 
The Biden administration's bedrock economic argument is neither corporations nor wealthy Americans are paying their ""fair share"" to support research, education, infrastructure and workers in the world's largest economy. 
The International Monetary Fund projects 2021 U.S. growth at 7.0%, one of the strongest recoveries worldwide from the recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, if Biden's plans are enacted.
Speaking at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, Illinois, near Chicago, Biden said Illinois has 2,374 bridges and more than 6,200 miles of highways in need of repair and that one of every 10 people in the state lacks access to high speed internet.
Democrats hope that most of the proposals not in the bipartisan bill will pass under a budget mechanism that would require only a simple majority in the U.S. Congress, bypassing Republicans, who oppose any new corporate taxes.
Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday vowed a ""hell of a fight for what this country ought to look like in the future"" over the tax and spending issue.
Biden shrugged off McConnell's comments and said McConnell had talked about how his home state of Kentucky would benefit from infrastructure spending. ""He's bragging about it in Kentucky,"" Biden said.

U.S. business lobbying groups who backed the bipartisan plan are gearing up to fight https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-lobby-groups-write-battle-plan-beat-biden-tax-hikes-2021-07-06 looming corporate tax hikes, using the same argument they employed in 2017 to secure huge tax cuts from Republicans: higher corporate taxes equal fewer jobs.
""We don't know what's in that package,"" Rachelle Bernstein, chief tax counsel for a retail lobby group, said of the Democrats' bill. ""But we don't think it is good to use a corporate tax increase to finance spending.""

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew close to 1% in the second quarter from the previous three months, up from a previous estimate of half a percentage point, the central bank said.
The government ended France's third national lockdown in mid-May and has been gradually relaxing other restrictions since then.
The economy was seen operating at 98% of pre-crisis levels in June and July, up from 96% in May, the central bank said in a note accompanying its monthly survey of 8,500 businesses.
A growing number of companies reported trouble finding enough staff and getting hold of raw materials as the economy re-opened.
The survey found 47% of industrial companies were facing supply-chain problems in June, up from 44% in May while the number hit as high as 80% in the carmaking sector.

Manufacturers' stocks of raw materials were the lowest on record going back to the early 1980s, while price increases for inputs were the highest since the early 1980s.
Meanwhile, 44% of the companies surveyed said they were having trouble recruiting enough workers in June, up from 37% in May. The number reached as high as 50% in the construction sector and 47% in services.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose by 16,000 to 9.2 million on the last day of May, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Wednesday.
Hiring also dipped to 5.9 million in May from 6.0 million in the prior month. The government reported last Friday that job growth accelerated in June as U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months.
""The latest survey data suggest that labor shortages remain acute,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.

The number of people re-entering the workforce has lagged job openings as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 9 million people remain officially unemployed. A lack of affordable childcare in particular has been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, on the sidelines while others have stayed home due to lingering fears about the virus.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 9.39 million in May. Vacancies were little changed in all four regions and the job openings rate was unchanged at 6.0%.

Unfilled vacancies increased by 109,000 in other services and there were an additional 46,000 job openings in state and local government education. Vacancies declined in state and local government and the federal government.
The report also showed the number of people voluntarily leaving their employment in May fell to 3.6 million from 4.0 million in April, although quits levels still rose in the leisure and hospitality, and accommodation and food services sectors. The quits rate is usually seen as a barometer of job market confidence.
People quitting their jobs now accounts for more than two-thirds of all job separations and remains well above pre-pandemic levels.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian retail sales rose in May for a second month in a row, figures showed on Wednesday, with a strong upward revision for April suggesting consumers are shrugging off the COVID-19 pandemic and driving the broader economic recovery.
Figures from government statistics agency IBGE showed that the rise in retail sales in May was broad-based, and means total volumes were almost 4% above the pre-pandemic levels of early last year.
Sales excluding autos and construction materials rose a seasonally adjusted 1.4% in May from April. That was less than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a 2.4% rise, but April's 1.8% rise was revised sharply higher to an increase of 4.9%.
IBGE survey manager Cristiano Santos urged caution, however.
""This is a recovery, but from a very low base,"" he said.
Sales jumped 16.0% on a year-on-year basis, boosted by base effects following the steep decline in May last year. That was slightly less than the 16.5% rise forecast in the Reuters poll.
IBGE said month-on-month sales rose in seven of the eight categories surveyed in May, led by a 16.8% rise in clothing and footwear and a 6.8% increase in fuel sales. The only sector to post a fall in sales was pharmaceutical and cosmetics goods.
So far this year, retail sales are up 6.8% from the January-May period last year, IBGE said, although still 1.3% below the record high from October last year.

On a wider basis, including cars and building materials, retail sales in May rose 3.8% on the month, jumped 26.2% on the year, and are up 12.4% so far this year, IBGE said.
By this measure, however, retail sales in Brazil were still down 3.4% from their peak in August 2012, IBGE said.

The tourism-reliant country's biggest outbreak that emerged in April has seen the most cases and deaths, dealing a deeper blow to an already fragile economic recovery.
""The rapid and severe third wave has affected domestic demand although a clear global economic recovery will benefit Thai exports,"" Payong Srivanich, chairman of the joint-business group of industry, banking and commerce, told a briefing.
The group raised its export growth forecast to 8% to 10% this year from 5% to 7% due to better-than-expected global demand but cited infections at factories as a risk.
In the first five months of 2021, exports rose 10.78% from a year earlier, customs data showed.

If the outbreak cannot be controlled, more restrictions are imposed and foreign tourist numbers miss targets, the economy is likely to contract this year, Supant Mongkolsuthree, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, told the briefing.

The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output decreased by 0.3% on the month after an upwardly revised decline of 0.3% in April. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.5%.
The fall was driven by a plunge in the production of capital goods, such as machinery and vehicles, which fell 3.4%, the data showed. Consumer, intermediate goods and construction output rose.
Compared with February 2020, the month before the start of the coronavirus restrictions, production was down 5% in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms. 
The economy ministry said the decline was mainly due to semiconductor bottlenecks which are hitting the automotive sector, but said the forecast for the economy remained positive due to strong demand and optimistic export expectations.
Investor sentiment in Germany remained at a very high level in July despite a bigger-than-expected drop as forecasts for a strong economic recovery rose, a survey showed on Tuesday.

Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP bank, said the supply crunch slowing down production might temper some economists' growth forecasts.

Prices were 0.5% lower than in May, Halifax said. In annual terms, they stood 8.8% higher than in June 2020 after leaping by the most in 14 years in May when they rose 9.6%.
""It is important to put such a moderate decrease in context, with average prices still more than 21,000 pounds ($29,000)higher than this time last year, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.
Last week, rival lender Nationwide said its measure of house prices showed a 13.4% leap between June 2020 and June 2021, the biggest increase in over 16 years.
Britain's housing market has been spurred on by finance minister Rishi Sunak's COVID-19 emergency tax break for buyers many of whom were already seeking bigger properties as they increasingly work from home because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The tax exemption on the first 500,000 pounds of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland expired at the end of June. A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance will run until the end of September.
Galley said demand from people looking for bigger homes would not fade entirely as the economy recovers and the shortage of properties on the market would also support prices.
""However, we would still expect annual growth to have slowed somewhat more by the end of the year, with unemployment expected to edge higher as job support measures unwind, and the peak of buyer demand now likely to have passed,"" he said.

Prices in London rose by a below-average 2.9% in annual terms in June, slowing from May. All other regions of the United Kingdom, except for the Midlands, saw prices rise more quickly than in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity grew at a moderate pace in June, likely restrained by labor and raw material shortages, resulting in unfinished work continuing to pile up.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 60.1 last month from 64.0 in May, which was the highest reading in the series' history. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index easing to 63.5. 
The economy has been hit by shortages of labor and raw materials as it reopens after more than a year of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 150 million people are fully immunized against the coronavirus, resulting in the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions on businesses and mask mandates, helping demand to revert back to services from goods. 
The survey's measure of backlog orders increased to a reading of 65.8 from 61.1 in May. New orders remained healthy and there is ample scope for hefty gains in the months ahead, with inventories contracting in June. Inventory sentiment among customers remained poor. Business inventories were depleted in the first quarter amid pent-up demand. 
With supply constraints showing no sign of letting up, businesses continued to pay more for inputs. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries dipped to a still-high 79.5 from 80.6 in May, which was the highest reading since September 2005. The continued elevation supports some economists' view that higher inflation to prove to be more persistent than currently envisioned by the Federal Reserve.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory noting that he expected supply chains to normalize and adapt, views also shared by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, shot up 3.4% year-on-year in May, the largest gain since April 1992. 

The ISM survey's measure of service employment fell to a reading of 49.3 in June from 55.3 in May. There is, however, cautious optimism that the worker shortage is starting to ease.
The government reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs in June, the largest gain in 10 months, after rising 583,000 in May.

The ZEW economic research institute said its survey of sentiment among investors fell to 63.3 points from 79.8 in the previous month. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall to 75.2.
But a separate ZEW gauge of current conditions surged to 21.9 from -9.1 points in June, moving into positive territory for the first time in two years and easily beating a consensus forecast for 5.0 points.
""The economic development continues to normalise,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. ""In the meantime, the situation indicator for Germany has clearly overcome the coronavirus-related decline.""
He added: ""The financial market experts therefore expect the overall economic situation to be extraordinarily positive in the coming six months.""
Separate data on Tuesday from the Federal Statistics Office showed that orders for German-made goods posted their sharpest slump in May since the first lockdown in 2020.
That reflected weaker demand from countries outside the euro zone and fewer contracts for machinery and intermediate goods.
Orders for industrial goods fell 3.7% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms -- the first drop in new business this year.

Carsten Brzeski of ING said the decline largely reflected supply chain disruptions, delivery delays and lack of materials and intermediate goods. 
""Today's disappointing industrial orders are no reason to be concerned,"" he wrote in a note. ""Order books are more than richly filled and reducing backlogs is a bigger problem for German companies than acquiring new orders.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's exports jumped 15% to $38.76 billion in the financial year ended June, data showed on Tuesday, led by a rebound in demand for garments as Western economies recovered.
The world's second-largest apparel producer after China took a roughly $6 billion hit in the 2019-20 financial year, with overseas apparel sales falling 18% to $27.94 billion.
Garment exports rose 13% to $31.5 billion in 2020/21 from a year earlier, thanks to a 21% surge in overseas sales of knitwear products such as t-shirts and sweaters, but were 7% below the pre-pandemic period of 2018-19 financial year, the Export Promotion Bureau said.
Sales of woven garments, such as formal denim shirts and pants, rose only 3%, which exporters attributed to tepid demand as more people worked from home and avoided social gatherings.
Bangladesh's exports in June grew at a record pace of 31% from a year earlier to $3.58 billion, led by more orders from the United States and Europe, the main destinations of apparel sales.
Garment industry leaders said they expect exports to increase but rising costs of freight and raw materials could hold back growth.
""Order flow is satisfactory. But freight costs and cotton prices are rising up, that could hamper our exports"" Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garments Exporters and Manufacturers Association, said.
""Our garment factories are largely unaffected by the latest pandemic situation at home but we need to control it soon,"" said Azim, who supplies European and North American retailers.
Bangladesh is currently battling a record spike in coronavirus cases, prompting the government to extend its strictest lockdown to July 14. Garment factories, however, are allowed to operate observing health protocols. 
Some garment workers are happy as they are able to earn overtime wages, which often account for 20% of their monthly income.

""I am really happy that I can earn some more doing overtime. There was a time when we went to the factory and sat idle all day as there were no orders,"" said Munna Khan, a worker in Gazipur, on the outskirt of the capital city Dhaka.
Low wages have helped Bangladesh build its garment industry, with some 4,000 factories employing 4 million workers, supplying brands such as H&M and GAP. Readymade garments are a mainstay of the economy, accounting for almost 16% of the country's GDP.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction industry recorded its fastest growth in 24 years last month, bolstered by a jump in demand for new homes and commercial property, but the sector was beset by a record rise in the cost of raw materials.
The monthly purchasing managers' index data underscored the speed of Britain's broader economic rebound as coronavirus restrictions ease, and also how bottlenecks in supply chains are creating inflation pressures.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction PMI jumped to 66.3 in June from 64.2 in May, its highest since June 1997 and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market has been boosted by a tax break for home-buyers which finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to phase out by the end of September.
The PMI's input cost component was the highest since the series started in April 1997, and delivery times were the longest on record too.
""Supply chains once again struggled to keep up with demand for construction products and materials,"" IHS Markit's economics director Tim Moore said.
The Bank of England last month said it expected inflation to peak above 3% but it predicts https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2E73SB the bottlenecks that are partly behind the rise will prove temporary.
Construction slumped at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic but recovered faster than other parts of Britain's economy as it was less affected by social-distancing restrictions and benefited from booming house prices https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uk-house-prices-jump-by-134-12-months-june-nationwide-2021-06-29.
Official data https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpmonthlyestimateuk/april2021#the-construction-sector showed that construction output in April was slightly above its pre-pandemic level.
Confidence among purchasing managers remained high but weakened to its lowest since January, partly due to rising costs and difficulties hiring construction workers.

""Escalating cost pressures and concerns about labour availability appear to have constrained business optimism at some building firms,"" Moore said.
Separate PMI data for the private sector as a whole, which includes the much larger services sector and manufacturing, showed a small fall to 62.6 in June from May's record-high 63.0.

This represented 4.5% of overall employees after 6.8% in May, Ifo said, adding that the estimate was based on a business survey and data from the Federal Labour Office.
In the hospitality sector, the number of people on the schemes fell to 331,000 in June from 520,000 in May, Ifo said, adding that more than 30% of staff in the sector were still on short-time work.

Ifo said supply bottlenecks for raw materials have not yet impacted on the number of short-time workers in the industry.
Short-time work allows employers to switch staff onto shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. It aims to prevent shocks such as the coronavirus crisis leading to mass unemployment.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's business confidence improved sharply in the second quarter as the COVID-free economy surged, prompting the New Zealand dollar to surge as investors brought forward rate hike expectations.
A net 7% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to improve, compared with a 13% predicting a deterioration in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 10% expected business conditions to improve, swinging from 8% who had expected a deterioration in the previous survey.
Firms also reported they were finding it more difficult than ever before to hire skilled labour.
Economists at Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) and ASB Bank reckoned resulting inflationary pressures were enough to justify pulling forward their expectations for interest rate hikes to November 2021.
The New Zealand dollar rose 0.6% to $0.7075, the yield on two-year sovereign bonds jumped nearly 10 basis points and swaps pricing rose to reflect a risk of hiking as soon as November. 
The only other major market where a rate rise is expected this year is Norway, whose central bank has projected an increase in the third or fourth quarter.
""Today's data confirm our view that the only questions now are when will rates rise and by how much,"" BNZ economists said in a note. ""The when has clearly moved closer and so we formally move our rate hike call to November 2021.""
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) held interest rates in May but hinted at a hike as early as September 2022, becoming one of the first advanced economies to signal a move away from the stimulatory settings adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RBNZ's next monetary policy review is due next week.
The NZIER survey's measure of capacity utilisation was 94.9% from the previous quarter's 93.9%.
Firms also reported a sharp upturn in their trading activity, with a net 26% of businesses reporting that they expected demand to have increased in the June quarter, compared with just 2% who had expected demand to have increased in the previous survey.
Labour shortages and supply chain disruptions are leading to a further build-up of capacity pressures and point to rising inflation, NZIER said.
""The increase in both costs and prices points to rising inflation pressures, which is underpinning expectations of interest rate increases from the Reserve Bank over the coming year,"" NZIER said in a statement.

About 60% of financial services sector firms now expect interest rates to rise over the coming year, it said.
""It is very clear that record amounts of monetary stimulus are no longer needed to support the economy,"" ASB analysts said in a note which brought forward their hike projections from May 2022 to November.

Japan's economy is struggling to shake off the drag from the coronavirus pandemic after the government put in place ""quasi-emergency"" measures in Tokyo and other major areas to curb a resurgence of infections.
Household spending grew 11.6% year-on-year in May, the third month of gains, after a 13.0% rise in April, government data showed on Tuesday. That was stronger than a median market forecast for a 10.9% gain in a Reuters poll.
But the gains were heavily skewed by the recoil effect from last year's plunge, when the pandemic and a nationwide state of emergency shuttered businesses and disrupted day to day life.
Stripping out big-ticket items like housing, cars and gifts, household spending was up 8.9% year-on-year, but down 6.5% compared to the same month two years earlier - a sign the recovery is taking time to bed in.
""It will be hard for services spending to recover if curbs on economic activity are not lifted completely,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""While the vaccination rollout is progressing more quickly than thought, its (economic) impact may not be seen until September or later.""
The month-on-month figures showed a 2.1% contraction compared with a forecast decline of 3.7%, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications data showed.
While May's expenditure declined less from the previous month than thought, weak car sales in June - partly due to the impact on supply of a semiconductor shortage - were likely to weigh on last month's spending, Tsunoda said.
The spending growth in May is unlikely to dispel worries that Japan is lagging recoveries seen in other major economies such as the United States, which the International Monetary Fund is forecasting to grow 7.0% this year - the fastest pace in a generation.
The combination of the risk of another spike in infections and a late vaccination drive in the nation has dented both consumer and business confidence.
Separate data on Tuesday showed inflation-adjusted real wages in May posted the biggest year-on-year rise since June 2018, in part due to a year-on-year surge in overtime pay.

Some analysts fear Japan's economy may fall back into recession in the second quarter, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, as consumer and business confidence took a hit from measures to stem a rise in coronavirus infections.
On Monday, a private business survey showed Japan's services sector activity shrank for the 17th straight month in June.

LONDON (Reuters) - The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) surged to new highs in the second quarter, with $2.5 billion in sales so far this year, up from just $13.7 million in the first half of 2020, marketplace data showed.
An NFT is a crypto asset, representing an intangible digital item such as an image, video, or in-game item. Owners of NFTs are recorded on blockchain, allowing an NFT to be traded as a stand-in for the digital asset it represents.
Sales volumes have remained high after NFTs exploded in popularity early this year. Monthly sales volumes on OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace, reached a record high in June. 
(GRAPHIC: NFT sales on OpenSea near $150m in June - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/azgvoqjajvd/chart.png) 
Some NFT enthusiasts see them as collectibles with intrinsic value because of their cultural significance, while others treat them as an investment, speculating on rising prices. 
Buyers have mostly totalled 10,000 to 20,000 per week since March, outnumbering sellers, according to NonFungible.com, which aggregates NFT transactions on the ethereum blockchain. 
(GRAPHIC: Weekly NFT buyers - NonFungible.com - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/jbyprzxebpe/chart.png) 
Total sales volume estimates vary depending on which NFT transactions are included.
DappRadar, which tracks sales across multiple blockchains, said volumes hit just under $2.5 billion for the first half of 2021. But NonFungible.com's figure is $1.3 billion, excluding around $8 billion of ""DeFi"" (decentralised finance) NFTs.

(GRAPHIC: Weekly NFT sales volume - NonFungible.com - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/dgkplrjagpb/chart.png) 
Both sites only track sales which occur on the blockchain, also known as ""on-chain"" transactions. Some of the biggest NFT sales, such as those at auction houses, have part of the transaction take place ""off-chain"", meaning they must be manually added to the data.
In March, a digital image sold for a record $69.3 million at Christie's as an NFT. No NFT sale has come close since. The second most expensive known NFT sale was a ""CryptoPunk"" which fetched $11.8 million at Sotheby's. 
(GRAPHIC: Sports and collectible NFTs are most popular - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/xlbvgqwwyvq/chart.png) 
The U.S. National Basketball Association Top Shot marketplace, which allows fans to buy and trade NFTs in the form of video highlights, has seen volumes shrink and buyers drop to 246,000 in June from 403,000 in March. The average price of a Top Shot ""moment"" slumped to $27 in June, after peaking at $182 in February. 
(GRAPHIC: NBA Top Shot sales fall - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/ygdvzznnmvw/chart.png) 

But as some NFT types become less popular, others take off. 
The Bored Ape Yacht Club, a set of 10,000 unique digital ape NFTs, has become a hit among collectors. The average ape sold on OpenSea as of July 1 for $3,600, up 1,574% from the launch price of $215 in April. Total sales have jumped to $61 million, according to the club's creators, U.S.-based Yuga Labs.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone businesses expanded activity at the fastest rate in 15 years in June as the easing of more coronavirus restrictions brought life back to the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed on Monday.
But that surge in growth has come at a cost as inflationary pressures mounted due to labour shortages and disruptions to supply chains caused by the pandemic.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, jumped to 59.5 last month from May's 57.1, its highest level since June 2006.
That was ahead of the 59.2 ""flash"" estimate and well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The index was at its 15-year high, confirming that the recovery in bloc's economy is well underway. At the same time, backlogs and producer price pressures show no signs of abating,"" said Mateusz Urban at Oxford Economics.
""The services PMI sub-index posted an increase. This indicated that the sector has benefited from easing of restrictions and increased consumer optimism on the back of advancing vaccination campaign.
An acceleration in vaccination programmes on the continent has meant governments have allowed more of the services industry to re-open and the sector's PMI soared to its highest reading since July 2007.

PRICE RISE
A PMI covering euro zone manufacturers, released last week, showed factory activity expanded at its fastest pace on record in June but that they faced the steepest rise in raw materials costs in well over two decades.
Those inflationary pressures were also felt by the services industry and the composite input prices index bounced to the highest in nearly 21 years.
Although inflation risks are skewed to the upside the European Central Bank was expected to maintain its loose monetary policy and look through higher inflation expectations for a while before it acts, a Reuters poll found last month. [ECILT/EU]

With demand surging, and amid hopes of further easing of restrictions leading to a more normal way of life, optimism about the coming year improved. The services business expectations index climbed to 72.7 from 71.2, its highest since August 2000.
Investor morale in the euro zone rose for the fifth month in a row in July, its highest level since February 2018, lifted by reopening restaurants and retailers as well as tourism as coronavirus cases fall, another survey showed on Monday.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector edged down to 62.4 from 62.9 in May but was slightly higher than a preliminary June reading of 61.7. 
Job creation was the fastest for seven years but even so staff shortages contributed to the highest level of backlogs since the survey began in 1996. That in turn helped to push up prices by the most on record for inputs and prices charged.
Britain's economy slumped by nearly 10% last year as the country suffered one of the world's highest COVID-19 death tolls. 
But this year it is expected to grow faster than the United States and other advanced economies, helped by its early COVID-19 vaccination rollout and huge monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Despite the growth spurt and inflation running above its 2% target, the Bank of England has signalled it is in no rush to ease off on its support. It is waiting to see if unemployment rises as the government winds down its job subsidies over the next three months.

IHS Markit said there was a small fall in exports due to travel restrictions and uncertainty about quarantine policies. Some firms also said Brexit-related issues had dampened export orders to the European Union. 
The composite PMI, including previously released manufacturing data, also eased back, slipping to 62.2 from May's 62.9 which was the highest reading since the series began in January 1998.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 in June, the lowest since April 2020 and down significantly from 55.1 in May. It held just above the 50-mark, which separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
China's official services gauge had also shown a marked slowdown in June, though it remained well in expansion territory. The private survey is believed to focus more on smaller companies.
Coupled with a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, analysts say the PMI survey findings suggest that pent-up COVID demand may have peaked and China's robust economic rebound from the crisis is starting to moderate.
Though slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, a gradual improvement in consumption in recent months had boosted China's services sector.
However, a COVID-19 outbreak of the more infectious Delta strain in the export and manufacturing hub of Guangdong since late May and the subsequent imposition of anti-virus measures have weighed on consumer and business activity.
While the government reacted quickly to contain the new wave of cases, and economic disruptions are easing, the private survey showed services providers' business outlook for the year ahead slipped to the lowest in nine months.
A sub-index of new business stood at 50.5, also the lowest since April 2020 when the services sector was still mired in COVID paralysis. Firms also cut staff in June for the first time in four months, as a result of slowing demand. 
One bright spot in the survey was a marked easing in inflationary pressures, which have squeezed profit margins. Input costs rose at the slowest pace since September 2020, and services firms cut their prices charged for the first time in 11 months to win new business. 
Caixin's June composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, fell to a 14-month low of 50.6 from May's 53.8. 

""The manufacturing industry has returned to normal in the wake of the epidemic, while the services industry is still sensitive to regional resurgences,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""In addition, the low base effect from last year will continue to weaken in the second half of this year. Inflationary pressure, intertwined with the economic slowdown, will still be a serious challenge.""

Investing.com – China's Caixin survey said on Monday that China’s services sector grew at a slower pace in June, a 14-month low, due to a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong province. The survey also indicated that the economic recovery of the world’s second-largest economy may have started to slow down.
Data released earlier in the day said that the Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) in June was at 50.3, the lowest since April 2020. It was lower than May’s 55.1 figure but remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
Meanwhile, Caixin manufacturing PMI in June, released on Thursday, was at 51.3, below the 51.8 figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and May’s 52 reading.
The data suggested that demand may have peaked in both the manufacturing and services sectors, and China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 is slowing down, some investors told Reuters.
Although China’s services sector rebounded slower than the manufacturing sector, it had been boosted by a gradual improvement in consumption in the previous months. However, an outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong province since late May and restrictive measures to curb the spread of the outbreak hurt consumer and business activity.
Even as the government took immediate measures to curb the virus' spread, the Caixin survey indicated that services providers' business outlook for the year ahead decreased to the lowest in nine months.
""The manufacturing industry has returned to normal in the wake of COVID-19, while the services industry is still sensitive to regional resurgences,"" Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian job advertisements extended their record-breaking run in June as demand for labour remained strong despite a round of coronavirus lockdowns across the country, a sign any drag on the economy will likely be fleeting.
Other data out on Monday showed retail sales topped forecasts in May with a rise of 0.4%, while sales of new vehicles held firm in June, in a promising omen for consumption.
Approvals to build new homes did drop 7.1% in May from the previous month, but that followed months of gains which still left approvals up 53% on a year earlier. 
Figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed job ads climbed 3.0% in June from May, when they jumped 6.8%. That was the 13th straight month of gains and showed 129% growth versus a year earlier when the labour market was recovering from a national pandemic lockdown.
""Recent history shows that workers laid off or stood down during lockdowns tend to be reinstated or find new jobs quickly once restrictions lift, given the underlying strength in the labour market and overall demand,"" said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch.
The survey came hot on the heels of government data on vacancies out last week which showed a huge 23% increase in the three months to May.
""Vacancies are twice their pre-pandemic level, and there are now 1.9 unemployed people per vacancy, easily the lowest ratio on record,"" said Birch. ""This suggests the unemployment rate has a lot further to fall.""
Unemployment has already fallen much quicker than policymakers expected and hit 5.1% in April, down from a pandemic peak of 7.5% reached in July last year.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth and inflation after years of tepid gains.

The central bank holds its July policy meeting on Tuesday and the resilience of employment should provide the confidence to temper its massive stimulus programme.
Analysts expect it will not extend its three-year yield target to late 2024 but will announce another round of bond buying, perhaps in a more flexible manner.

The decline in the services industry kept overall private-sector activity in contraction for a second month, in a sign the country's economic recovery struggles to pick up despite making progress with a coronavirus vaccine rollout.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a seasonally adjusted 48.0, up from the prior month's final level of 46.5 and a 47.2 flash reading.
It meant services activity came in below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 17th month, the longest such streak since a 27-month run through March 2010.
The PMI survey showed firms saw a slower contraction in new business, including from overseas, and grew increasingly bullish about expectations for the year ahead.
Outstanding business, however, saw a slightly faster rate of decline, suggesting many firms in the services sector are still feeling the pain from the health crisis despite their optimism conditions would improve over the year ahead.
""Businesses in the Japanese service sector reported that activity remained subdued as the country continued to battle the latest wave of COVID-19 infections,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Firms continued to build capacity in anticipation of increasing demand, though the pace of job creation eased to a four-month low.""

Sectors covered in the survey include transport, real estate, communication, information, business services and consumer, excluding retail.
The final au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, was 48.9 in June, the second straight month of a contractionary reading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months in June, raising wages and offering incentives to entice millions of unemployed Americans sitting at home, in a tentative sign that a labor shortage hanging over the economy was starting to ease.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed 151,000 people entered the labor force last month, though the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one did not budge from the tight range it has been in since June 2020. 
The acceleration in hiring suggested the economy ended the second quarter with strong momentum, following a reopening made possible by vaccinations against COVID-19. 
""While businesses are still having a hard time filling positions, staffing challenges do not seem quite as dire based on today's pickup in payrolls,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The survey of establishments showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs last month. The economy created 15,000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported. Employment is about 6.8 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would advance by 700,000 jobs. Women, who have been hardest hit by the pandemic, took nearly half of the jobs created last month. There are a record 9.3 million job openings.
(UNEMPLOYMENT - JOBS - FLAT VERSIONS JPG, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY-UNEMPLOYMENT/0100318Z2TX/usa-economy-unemployment.jpg) 
President Joe Biden hailed the pick-up in hiring.
""This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic as well as other elements of the American Rescue Plan,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House.
The leisure and hospitality industry added 343,000 jobs, accounting for 40% of the employment gains in June. More than 150 million people are fully immunized against COVID-19, which has led to the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions on businesses and mask mandates. Government employment jumped by 188,000 jobs, driven by state and local government education, which were boosted by fewer end-of-school-year layoffs relative to the previous year. 
Manufacturing added a modest 15,000 jobs, with employment at motor vehicle assembly plants declining 12,300. A global semiconductor shortage has forced some automakers to cut production. Other manufacturing industries are also grappling with shortages of raw materials and workers.
Construction payrolls contracted for the third straight month. Though the sector remains supported by robust demand for housing, scarcity of workers and expensive raw materials like framing lumber are hampering homebuilding.
Politicians, businesses and some economists have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the government, for the labor crunch. Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have also been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home.
There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes. Economists generally expect the labor supply squeeze to ease in the fall as schools reopen and the government-funded unemployment benefits lapse, but they caution that many unemployed will probably never return to work.
Record-high U.S. stock prices and surging home values have also encouraged early retirements. About 3.4 million people have dropped out of the labor force since February 2020.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite hitting record highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES
Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% last month, led by low-wage industries, after gaining 0.4% in May. That raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 3.6% from 1.9% in May. Annual wage growth was in part flattered by so-called base effects following a big drop last June. 
According to job search engine Indeed, 4.1% of job postings advertised hiring incentives through the seven days ending June 18, more than double the 1.8% share in the week ending July 1, 2020. The incentives, which included signing bonuses, retention bonuses or one-time cash payments on being hired, ranged from as low as $100 to as high as $30,000 in the month ended June 18. 
Some restaurant jobs are paying as much as $27 per hour plus tips, according to postings on Poachedjobs.com, a national job board for the restaurant/hospitality industry. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, but some states have higher minimum wages.
The average workweek dipped to 34.7 hours from 34.8 hours. With employment not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level until sometime in 2022, rising wages are unlikely to worry Federal Reserve officials even as inflation is heating up because of supply constraints. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said he expects high inflation will be transitory.
The U.S. central bank last month opened talks on how to end its crisis-era massive bond-buying.
""We still think Fed officials will need to see several more months of strengthening to achieve their 'substantial further progress' tapering criterion,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York.
Details of the smaller and volatile household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, were mixed. Household employment fell 18,000 in June. But according to Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), adjusting ""the household measure to match the employment concept used in the establishment survey the figure was up 604,000.""
(Graphic: In any given month ..., https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/PAYROLLS-SURVEYS/yzdpxlqajpx/chart.png) 
The unemployment rate rose to 5.9% from 5.8% in May. The jobless rate continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 6.1% in June.

But the number of people working part-time for economic reasons declined 644,000. As a result, a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to a 15-month low of 9.8% from 10.2% in May.
Women continued to trickle back, with 148,000 re-joining the labor force. That lifted women's labor force participation rate to 57.5% from 57.4%. The overall participation rate was unchanged at 61.6%.

If you got too strong a  report the market could've had a negative reaction saying that means the Fed can't wait two years to raise interest rates. There would've been concerns that pulls the Fed forward. This was perfect. There were enough jobs that you'd want to see but not so much that it concerns people that the Fed may have to act sooner."" 
    ""Participation looks strong. Its unchanged month over month but there's good evidence people are returning.
   ""The narrative there is we're seeing exactly what we were expecting, the services piece turning back on as the economy opens up. That's great news. That's exactly what we want at this stage of the recovery."" 
    ""Wages were strong ... It's starting it's build. I don't think we've seen the high water mark yet in wage inflation pressure.""
    ""Up to this point its been largely industrials and goods sector that's been pushing the economy forward. Services has been turned off as retail, restaurants, travel haven't been where we've wanted them to be. As that turns back on, that will put pressure on wages.""
    ""We still have upward pressure that lies before us in wages. Beyond the headline jobs number, that's the first place my eyes go to, what's happening in wages?""   
TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SEAPORT GLOBAL HOLDINGS, NEW YORK
“The nonfarm payroll number beat fairly well, but the unemployment rate shot up a little bit, that has people baffled.”
“The (U.S. Treasury) market is kind of struggling to go to lower yields, because were already at somewhat lower levels before the data came out. The market popped but can’t seem to go lower than 1.42% right after the release (on yields on the 10-year note.)""
“Most of the gains came from the restaurant industry and education. As educators came back to work in the fall you’ll see a real drop in the unemployment rate. I think we’re geared toward a fairly decent reopening but most of it will take place in the fall.”
VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, FX STRATEGIST, UBS, NEW YORK
    ""The FX market was gearing up for a stronger number all week and you saw that in the dollar's strength. I think the bar for a positive surprise was higher as a result. We initially reacted positively to the headline, which was stronger than expected. And then moved a little lower because of some of the weaker details of the report such as the higher unemployment rate and the higher bar for a positive surprise.""
    ""Overall, we're moving in the right direction. The U.S. labor market is strong. How quickly we can eliminate slack in the labor market remains to be seen. But our view at UBS is that there is more slack than what appears at first glance. We expect more people to join the labor force in the coming months and as a result, unemployment rate will fall slowly.""
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“It was definitely a very encouraging number overall.""
""This definitely shows that the pace is very steady of opening things back up and that is what we want to see so that the wages aren’t too hot and some of the inflation fears get a little bit mitigated given the fact you look at the average hourly wage really isn’t up much both over month and over year. The fact we did have so many restaurant and bar jobs, even though we know those people are probably getting paid more than they were before all this, that is still a lower wage than construction, etc, which was flat once again this month.” 
JOSEPH LAVORGNA, AMERICAS CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK
“Big headline, the jobs market is recovering. There’s still a lot of slack, there’s just no wage pressure. 
“The labor market is looking pretty good, it’s moving in the right direction. There’s still a lot more improvement that’s needed but left to its own devices at this point, the labor market and the broader economy are going to be fine.
“I would also argue that at the margin the data we got maybe makes a little less likely you’re going to get fiscal stimulus because people will focus mostly on the headline and why does the government need to do more if the things are getting better and you’re generating substantial job gains?”

“A better report should mean higher front-end rates (on U.S. Treasuries), but they didn’t last. I think the market is torn between whether to price in the market outlook or the Fed reaction.”
“If the data is better normally that should mean higher rates, but if the Fed is forced to exit faster that would slow down the economy.”
“It’s the interplay between the economic outlook and the Fed reaction function that is creating some weird dynamics.”

""It’s yet another hopeful sign that this jobs report exceeded expectations. With continued rapid vaccine rollout and largely successful reopening efforts occurring across the country, cautious optimism seems warranted. The road forward looks promising as we slowly make strides to return to the robust 3.5% unemployment rate and pre-pandemic labor market conditions.
""Furthermore, U.S. household net worth has increased by $25.6 trillion since March 31st, bringing the total to $136.9 trillion. While this may be great news for some, there is strong evidence that the increase in household net worth mainly helped individuals at the upper end as most of these gains came from the stock market and real estate holdings, both of which are held by majority well-off households that tend to be white. Without programs in place to help those who are not able to participate in the market upswings, these positive numbers are less meaningful.""

84,"<span>Jul 02, 2021 09:01AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased in May as efforts by business to rebuild inventories amid booming demand pulled in imports. 
The Commerce Department said on Friday that the trade gap rose 3.1% to $71.2 billion in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $71.4 billion deficit.

Goods imports rose 1.2% to $234.7 billion. Massive fiscal stimulus and a reopening economy, thanks to vaccinations against COVID-19, are fueling demand for goods and services. Raw material shortages are hampering production. Business inventories were drawn down in the first quarter.
Exports of goods gained 0.3% to $145.5 billion, a record high. With the United States leading the global economic recovery from the pandemic recession, the trade deficit has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for three straight quarters. The trend likely persisted into the second quarter.

Investing.com -- The recovery in the U.S. labor market appeared to strengthen in June, with 850,000 people finding a job, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.
The headline nonfarm payrolls number was well above a consensus forecast of 700,000. In addition, May's nonfarm payrolls gain was revised up by 24,000 to 583,000. 
Daniel Zhao, senior economist with Glassdoor, noted via Twitter that ""Job gains were most heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality (+343,000), accounting for 40% of the gains"" in the month. 
However, other elements of the report weren't as unambiguously positive. The unemployment rate rose to 5.9% of the workforce, instead of falling to 5.7% as expected. That suggests that people who lost their jobs during the pandemic still aren't rejoining the labor force as quickly as could be hoped for. 
""Overall, this report signals incremental progress in the pace of job growth, but there’s no sign yet of a shift back into the labor force,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients. ""The missing millions are still missing,"" he said, adding that overall employment is still some 8.8 million short of its pre-pandemic trend.
U.S. stock futures gained on the news, on the perception that the weaker-looking parts of the report will provide fresh arguments for keeping unprecedented amounts of monetary stimulus in place. The Federal Reserve is still injecting $120 billion a month into the financial system through bond purchases, despite increasing signs of overheating in some areas of the economy such as the housing market, and broader signs of rising inflation in the economy at large. 
Rising wage pressures, often a key concern of inflation hawks, came out a little weaker in the report that had been expected. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to 0.3% from 0.4% in May, while their 3.6% annual growth rate was also below the 3.7% expected. That may be partly explained by the predominance of leisure and hospitality in net job gains, considering that the sector's high share of low-paid work.
The participation rate, which measures employment relative to the total working age population, also remained stuck at May's level of 61.6%.
""Participation for both men and women has been flat over the past year,"" said Shepherdson. ""If that doesn’t change in the fall, the risk of sustained inflation, via accelerating wage growth, will be much bigger."""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil rose in May for the first month in four, figures showed on Friday, lifting output up to pre-pandemic levels although the pace of growth was slower than economists had expected and not particularly widespread.
Statistics agency IBGE said output rose 1.4% from the previous month, compared with the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists for a 1.7% rise. April's figure was revised to a 1.5% fall from a 1.3% decline.
These figures mean Brazilian industrial production is now back to where it was in February last year before the COVID-19 pandemic, IBGE said.
IBGE survey manager Andre Macedo said the effects of the second wave of the pandemic this year are still being felt across the sector.
""Much of this predominantly negative trend in recent months is directly linked to the resurgence of the pandemic at the beginning of 2021, which wreaked havoc on production chains,"" he said.
IBGE said 15 of the 26 sectors surveyed saw a rise in production in May, and only two of the four major categories - capital goods and consumer goods - saw output rise.
Compared to May last year, however, overall production jumped 24.0% due to base effects, the second biggest year-on-year rise on record after April's rebound, IBGE said.

January-May production was up 13.1% from a year earlier, and output in the 12 months through May was 4.9% higher than the same period a year earlier, IBGE said.
The central bank last week revised up its 2021 growth forecast for Brazilian industry to 6.6% from 6.4%. IBGE figures show, however, that the industrial sector is still 16.7% smaller than its peak in May 2011.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain posted a record drop in jobless figures for the second month in a row in June, as looser COVID-19 restrictions, increased vaccination rates and the cautious return of tourism buoyed the labour market.
The number of people registering as jobless fell by 4.4% from May, leaving 3.61 million out of work, labour ministry data showed on Friday, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline.
The social security ministry said Spain had created a net calendar-adjusted 203,000 jobs last month, thanks largely to robust growth in the services sector as the summer tourism season cranks into gear, drawing in Spanish holidaymakers and raising the size of the workforce to near pre-pandemic levels.
Still, regions dependent on foreign tourism like the Balearic and Canary Islands are lagging behind on job creation and are home to the majority of furloughed workers, Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva told a news conference.
However, most Spanish regions have already reached pre-pandemic employment levels, according to data from his department. 
""The numbers surprised everyone,"" he said. 
There were also 6.4% fewer jobless claims than in June 2020, when economic activity was still hamstrung by a strict lockdown to curb the first wave of coronavirus infections, the labour ministry said. 
However, the number of jobless remained significantly above the 3.02 million of June 2019 before the pandemic struck.
Friday's solid data adds to recent positive economic signals from Spain, where growth in factory activity also reached a two-decade high last month. 

After a 10.8% slump in 2020, the economy shrank a further 0.4% in the first quarter as COVID-19 restrictions slowed activity, but Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said this week that output expanded a record 18% in the second quarter from a year ago. 
A national state of emergency ended in May, and the country began letting in vaccinated visitors from anywhere in the world from June 7. The government expects foreign tourist arrivals to reach 45% of their pre-pandemic levels this summer.

Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.3% month-on-month for a 9.6% year-on-year increase.
Changes in prices at factory gates are usually transmitted to final consumers and therefore herald trends in inflation that the European Central Bank targets with its monetary policy.
Euro zone inflation eased in June to 1.9%, levelling off for the summer months before an expected move well above the ECB's target towards the autumn on higher commodity prices. 
The ECB wants to keep consumer price growth ""below but close to 2%"" over the medium term.
The rise in intermediate goods' prices remained the same in May against April, at 1.8%, with energy costs registering the third-biggest increase of 2.1%. But in year-on-year terms, energy contributed the most, with prices surging 25.1% against May 2020, while intermediate goods were up 9.2%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home rental prices rose by their fastest for at least 2-1/2 years, according to a private survey, as record numbers of college graduates flocked to big cities in search of jobs as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Average prices in 40 cities rose 2.1% in June from a month earlier, compared with May's 0.78% increase, statistics from Zhuge House Hunter, one of China's largest independent real estate research firms, showed on Thursday. It was the biggest monthly increase since Zhuge started compiling the data in January 2019. 
Rents rose fastest in top-tier cities, with the southern tech hub of Shenzhen up 2.56% compared with May's 1.3% growth. Such cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, are the top locations for young job seekers, Zhuge House Hunter said. 
Compared with a year earlier, rents in June were up 1.51%, the first gain since April 2020.
Growing numbers of college leavers has fuelled demand, and China has vowed to expand rental markets to make housing more affordable in big cities, where home prices and rents have surged in recent years.
The education ministry has estimated that more than 9 million college students would graduate this year, beating the record of 8.73 million set last year. The ministry expects graduates to exceed 10 million in 2022.
Major cities such as Beijing and Shenzhen began implementing measures this year to boost the supply of rental properties. 
Kaylee Jian, 22, a postgraduate student from southwestern Chengdu city, arrived in Beijing in June to intern at a firm while exploring job opportunities in the capital ahead of her graduation in December. 
""My rent takes up 150% of my intern salary, so I still have to spend my family's money,"" she said. 
Jian shares an apartment with one other person in the north of Beijing, and pays about 3,000 yuan ($463) a month in rent. 

""My parents told me that in Chengdu you could rent an entire well-renovated home for 2,000 yuan a month. I've finally realised how expensive it is to live in cities like our capital.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Consumer inflation in South Korea stayed above 2% in June for the third consecutive month, hovering near a nine-year peak, adding pressure on policymakers to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.
Consumer prices rose 2.4% from the same month a year prior, government data showed on Friday, slightly missing analysts' 2.5% forecast and a tad off May's 2.6% - the fastest growth since April 2012.
The breakdown of data showed the cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products rose 10.4% on year, while that of petroleum surged 19.9%.
""As the impact from a low base of comparison persists over the coming months, and as fresh-food prices likely rise ahead of the monsoon season and Chuseok holiday, inflation will continue to stay above 2% for some time,"" said economist Kim Yeon-jin at Eugene Investment & Securities.
""The government's planned extra budget and cash handouts will likely lift the service sector and boost demand,"" Kim said.
On Thursday, the government announced a 33 trillion won ($29.08 billion) supplementary budget that included pandemic relief for households.
Many economists now see a base interest rate hike from the current record low of 0.50% as early as the third quarter of 2021, as house prices soar and inflation remains above 2%, even as the impact of last year's low base fades.
South Korea is seen to be Asia's first economy to pull back on pandemic-era monetary stimulus and normalise easy policy.
Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor Lee Ju-yeol said last week the bank will start normalising easy monetary policy by year-end.
""A third-quarter hike is possible if the recent surge in domestic virus cases is quickly contained and the vaccination roll-out regains strong momentum, but as things stand, a move in the fourth-quarter looks more likely,"" said ANZ economist Krystal Tan.
The BOK next reviews its policy rate at its July 15 meeting.
STOPPED BUYING
Consumer prices soared an average 1.8% during the first half of the year, versus 0.6% a year earlier and approaching the BOK's 2% target.
""I saw snack bars and ready-meal stores using quail eggs instead of just eggs because they got so expensive. Zucchinis and spring onions are also so expensive I stopped buying them,"" said 26-year-old homemaker Kim Sung-eun.
""Apples have also shot up in price, but I still buy them as drinking squashed apple juice every morning is a daily routine for me and my husband,"" she said.
""Our living expenses jumped nearly 20% in the first half of this year from last.""
Rising input costs due to inflationary pressure is also straining South Korean manufacturers, with the BOK in a report this week saying 49% of 281 firms surveyed were passing higher costs to clients.
Meanwhile, the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, came at 1.2%, unchanged from May when it rose at the sharpest pace since November 2018.

However, on a month-on-month basis, headline inflation was minus 0.1%, falling into negative territory for the first time in seven months, compared with positive 0.1% in May.
The BOK currently sees inflation at 1.8% for all of 2021 and 1.4% for 2022. It was 0.5% in 2020, just above the record low of 0.4% in 2019.

91,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 07:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The pace of South Korean inflation slowed for the first time in six months, according to data that supports the central bank’s view of recent price pressures as temporary.
Consumer prices rose 2.4% from a year earlier, slowing from a 2.6% pace in May, data from the statistics office showed Friday. Economists had expected the pace would decelerate only to 2.5%.
The slowdown adds support to the Bank of Korea’s argument that recent price data have been boosted by comparison with last year’s dismal figures and some inflationary pressures are likely to fade going forward. The central bank sees inflation fluctuating around its 2% target for the rest of the year before sliding lower in 2022.
Inflation may get a boost from a 33 trillion won extra budget proposed by the government this week to provide cash handouts to 80% of South Korean households. If the stimulus package passes, it would be among the largest since the pandemic hit last year.
Vaccinations have also been accelerating even though they have yet to reach the majority of the population. The latest threat to consumer activity has been the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which prompted authorities to delay plans to ease social distancing rules in Seoul from this week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, while layoffs plunged to a 21-year low in June, suggesting the labor market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining traction.
But a shortage of willing workers is hampering hiring, with other data on Thursday showing a measure of employment at factories contracting in June for the first time in seven months. Manufacturers said they were experiencing ""difficulty in hiring and retaining direct labor,"" the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said in its survey of national factory activity, noting that these challenges ""across the entire value chain continue to be the major obstacles to increasing growth."" 
One respondent in primary metals said ""lack of labor is killing us.""
The data was released ahead of Friday's closely watched employment report for June, which according to a Reuters survey of economists will likely show nonfarm payrolls increasing by 700,000 jobs last month after rising by 559,000 in May. The unemployment rate is forecast to tick down to 5.7% from 5.8%. 
The economy is experiencing a boom in demand following a reopening made possible by vaccinations against the coronavirus, with more than 150 million Americans fully immunized. 
""America's back to work and an important milestone was reached where new claims are back below the 400,000 barrier after a hiccup at the start of June,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Summer is always the strongest season for hiring each year, and this year is no exception.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 364,000 for the week ended June 26, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest number since March 2020, when mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
The improvement in claims had appeared to stall in mid-June. Though claims remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market, they have tumbled from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 390,000 applications for the latest week. There was a big decline in filings in Pennsylvania, which reversed the prior week's surge. The state last month upgraded its filing system, and the transition could be causing volatility in the data. There were also large drops in claims in California, Kentucky and Texas. 
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkplrlazpb/jobless-claims.png 
The claims data could become noisy in the weeks ahead as 25 states with mostly Republican governors pull out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly check, which businesses complained were encouraging the jobless to stay at home. The early termination began on June 5 and will run through July 31, when Louisiana, the only one of those states with a Democratic governor, ends the weekly check.
For the rest of the country, these benefits will lapse on Sept. 6. There is no evidence so far of a surge in job searches in the 20 states that have already ended the federal benefits.
A survey this week by job search engine Indeed https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/06/29/indeed-job-seeker-survey-june-2021 found that while the vast majority of the unemployed indicated they would like to start looking for work in the next three months, many did not express a sense of urgency. But rising vaccinations, dwindling savings and the opening of schools in the fall will be key to pulling them back into the labor force.
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid rose 56,000 to 3.469 million during the week ended June 19. There were 14.7 million people receiving benefits under all programs in mid-June, slightly down from 14.8 million early in the month.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
EMPLOYEE POACHING
In a separate report on Thursday, ISM said its index of national factory activity slipped to 60.6 last month from 61.2 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. 
A measure of factory employment contracted for the first time since November. Companies reported hiring or attempting to hire. A significant number reported ""employee turnover due to wage dynamics in the markets,"" ISM's Timothy Fiore said. 
Graphic: ISM PMI - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/nmopaxqdrva/ismpmi.png 
""It appears that companies are paying up to steal workers from other firms,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have also been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There were a record 9.3 million job openings at the end of April and 9.3 million people were officially unemployed in May.
A third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers tumbled 16.7% to 20,476 in June, the lowest level since June 2000. Layoffs plummeted 88% compared to June 2020.

There were 67,975 job cuts in the second quarter, the fewest since the April-June period in 1997. In the first half of this year, layoffs dropped 87% to 212,661, the lowest total for the January-June period since 1995.
""We're seeing the rubber band snap back,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""Companies are holding on tight to their workers during a time of record job openings and very high job seeker confidence. We haven't seen job cuts this low since the Dot-Com boom.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Colombia could have fallen 0.08% in June, mostly due to food supplies returning to normal following a long-running wave of protests and blockades, a Reuters poll revealed on Thursday. 
Estimates from 14 analysts fluctuated between a fall in prices of 0.28% and an increase of 0.21%. 
If the poll's median estimate is achieved, it will contrast with Colombia's 1% increase in inflation in May, when consumer prices were affected by national protests which saw highways blocked across the country, affecting centers of production and international trade.
""Our estimate takes into account the recovery in domestic supply, which would lead to a correction in prices,"" bank Bancolombia (NYSE:CIB) said in a statement. 
""This could be partially offset by the effect of the exchange rate on some imported foods and the evolution of international prices for goods such as corn and soybeans,"" it added.
The government's DANE statistics agency is expected to publish the monthly inflation figures on July 3.
If the median forecast is reached, inflation for the last 12 months will reach 3.61%, higher than the 3.35% as of May, and above the central bank's long-term target of 3%. 
Furthermore, estimates for annual inflation in 2021 have risen to 3.72%, up from 3.30% in last month's poll. 

In a similar vein, analysts now forecast inflation to close 2022 at 3.10%, up from estimates of 3% in the previous survey. 
Low inflation has been one of the central bank's chief reasons for keeping its benchmark interest rate stable at a historic low of 1.75% over the last nine months as it seeks to support economic recovery.

The index has been clawing its way higher gradually after plummeting to 35.0 in April 2020, by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-year history.
""Firms continued to signal lower sales, falling production and job shedding, but tentative signs of a recovery in demand curbed the respective rates of contraction,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Most of the PMI's sub-indexes remained below the 50.0 mark, despite rising from May, though input prices and business expectations increased above that threshold.
Business confidence improved for a third straight month to its highest level since the start of 2020 on the back of ""hopes of greater vaccine and raw material availability,"" said De Lima. ""Firms also foresee an economic recovery and a pick-up in demand in the year ahead.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Job growth in Brazil accelerated sharply in May, official figures showed on Thursday, with formal jobs created almost double the consensus estimate to lift the total number of new positions opened this year above 1 million.
That marks the strongest pace of job growth since 2010, both for the month of May and the first five months of the year, according to the Economy Ministry. 
""The Brazilian economy is rising, and most importantly, sectors that were hit really hard before, like services, are now leading the way,"" Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said in an online address after the figures were released.
""This confirms that the recovery is broad-based, all sectors are creating new jobs, the pace is very strong, and we hope that measures we are taking will accelerate this process even further,"" he said.
Some 1.55 million positions were created in May and 1.27 million were cut, resulting in 280,666 net new positions. That was well up from the previous month and almost double the median forecast of 150,000 new jobs in a Reuters poll of economists.
The gains were led by the services sector, which created a net 110,956 new positions. Commerce accounted for 60,480 net new positions, industry 44,146 and agriculture 42,526, the ministry said.
This means Brazil created a net 1.23 million new formal jobs in the first five months of the year. These figures do not include the nearly 40 million undocumented workers in Brazil who do not have formal employment registration.
The total number of formally registered workers in Brazil rose to 40.6 million in May, the highest May reading since 2015, according to ministry figures.

Earnings fell, however, with the average monthly salary of new jobs created in May down 4.1% in real terms from the prior month to an unadjusted 1,797.10 reais ($363).

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that construction spending dropped 0.3% after edging up 0.1% in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.4%. Construction spending, which accounts for about 3.6% of gross domestic product, increased 7.5% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Spending on private construction projects fell 0.3%, weighed down by a 1.1% drop in private nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling. Business investment on nonresidential structures has declined for sixth straight quarters. Private construction outlays increased 0.3% in April. 
Investment in residential projects rose 0.2%, lifted by a 0.8% increase in single-family homebuilding. 
Demand for housing remains robust, but expensive building materials, especially framing lumber, are constraining builders' ability to ramp up construction.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a moderate pace in June, but employment contracted for the first time in seven months, likely because of rampant shortages of raw materials and labor. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity slipped to 60.6 last month, the lowest reading since January, from 61.2 in May.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 61.0 in June.
Massive fiscal stimulus boosted demand for long-lasting manufactured goods during the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of Americans working from home and learning remotely. Factories are struggling to keep up as the pandemic fractured supply chains and disrupted the global shipping industry. 
A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting production of motor vehicles, electronics and household appliances. The scarcity of raw materials is driving up costs for both manufacturers and consumers, contributing to an acceleration in inflation in recent months.
Though higher inflation is generally viewed as transitory, Americans should expect to pay more for goods and services until the demand-supply imbalance eases. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believe supply will start catching up later this year, but caution it could take until at least mid-2022 to fully restore motor vehicle inventories.
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to a record 92.1 last month from a reading of 88.0 in May. Consumer prices have been surging, with the Federal Reserve's main annual inflation measure rising by the most in 29 years in May. 
Demand is also being fueled by the reopening of the economy, with more than 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.
The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index edged down to a reading of 66.0 last month from 67.0 in May. Inventories at factories remain low and business warehouses are almost empty. A pickup in production allowed factories to work through some of the backlog of uncompleted work.
A measure of factory employment contracted for the first time since November. 
Labor is scarce even as 9.3 million people are officially unemployed. Generous unemployment benefits funded by the government, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus have been blamed for keeping workers home.

There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as transitions to new careers. The slowdown in hiring at factories last month was highlighted in the June ADP National Employment Report published on Wednesday.
The government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 700,000 jobs in June after rising 559,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Growth in Brazil's manufacturing sector accelerated in June to its fastest rate in four months, a survey of purchasing managers' activity showed on Thursday, led by the strongest growth this year in employment and export orders.
The average pace of growth in the second quarter, however, was slower than the prior three-month period, a consequence of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Brazilian businesses banked on an end to the current difficulties and a brighter second half of the year, IHS Markit's purchasing managers index (PMI) report showed.
The headline PMI rose to 56.4 in June from 53.7 in May, IHS Markit said, the highest since February. A reading above 50.0 marks expansion, while a reading below signifies contraction. The series was launched in 2006.
""Despite the ongoing battle against another wave of COVID-19 cases, companies saw their order books expand substantially from last month ... (and) factories worked on rebuilding their stocks to fulfill rising demand,"" said Polyanna de Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
""The resilience of the manufacturing industry fed through to the labor market as companies were confident in the rebound and took on additional workers. Employment increased at the quickest pace in seven months as business optimism improved,"" she said.

The economy's resilience to the pandemic has prompted upward revisions to this year's growth outlook, and the latest median forecast in a weekly central bank survey of economists is 5.1%. 
The employment index rose to the highest since November, and the new export orders index rose to the highest since December, IHS Markit said.

Initial claims in regular state programs decreased by 51,000 to 364,000 in the week ended June 26, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 388,000 initial applications.
Continuing claims for ongoing state benefits increased to 3.47 million the week ended June 19.
The drop in applications is consistent with improving business conditions and companies’ efforts to increase headcounts to meet demand as the economy reopens. Still, initial claims remain above pre-pandemic levels and many employers say they are having trouble finding qualified workers, which is likely holding back the pace of the recovery.

The finance ministry said 2.4 million people remained fully or partially on the government's Coronavirus Job Retention scheme at the end of May, down from a peak of almost 9 million in May 2020.
Early estimates published by the Office for National Statistics had shown 1.7 million people were furloughed in late May.

""Higher numbers on furlough than expected does mean a bumpier ride in aggregate, and more individuals at risk of unemployment in the months ahead,"" Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said on Twitter.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -European factories continued to ramp up their post-lockdown recovery in June but Asian manufacturers saw momentum weaken amid rising input costs and the reintroduction of curbs to combat a new wave of coronavirus infections, surveys showed.
Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace on record last month while Britain's factories extended their post-lockdown recovery and went on a hiring spree.
""How has that story turned -- a few months ago we were seeing the euro zone was lagging with vaccinations far behind. We were expecting a turnaround and we haven't seen much disappointment,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""That upside scenario has materialised. There is a very broad feeling amongst businesses in both services and industry that the coming months are going to be very strong as economies reopen.""
Czech and Polish manufacturing hit a record pace of activity for the second month in a row as orders rose and economies opened up again.
But manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in China and Japan as raw materials rose, while activity shrank in Vietnam, Malaysia and India, where governments imposed tougher restrictions to contain fresh coronavirus outbreaks.
A shortage of shipping containers and supply chains hugely affected by the global pandemic have made it a sellers' market for materials needed by factories. An index measuring input prices in the euro zone was at its highest since the survey began 24 years ago.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) nevertheless rose to a survey high of 63.4 in June from May's 63.1, above an initial 63.1 ""flash"" estimate. Anything above 50 indicates growth. [EUR/PMIM]

ASIA LAG
Data showed Asia was lagging behind western economies in recovering from the pandemic doldrums, reinforcing the view that many regional central banks were unlikely to withdraw pandemic-era stimulus soon.
""The June PMIs dropped back as virus outbreaks and supply chain issues created mounting headwinds for industry,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
""With neither issue likely to be resolved soon, the rapid growth in industry over the past few quarters looks unlikely to be repeated.""
China's factory activity expanded at a softer pace in June with output growth slumping to the lowest level in 15 months, according to a private survey, in line with an official survey showing a dip in activity to a fourth-month low.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell to 51.3 in June from May's 52, marking the 14th month of expansion but coming in below analyst expectations for only a slight slowdown to 51.8.
Higher raw materials costs and a shortage of semiconductor chips also hurt export powerhouses including Japan, which saw factory activity expand at the slowest pace in four months in June.
South Korea fared better, with factory activity growing for a ninth consecutive month in June, though record input and output price rises pointed to strains on manufacturers.
""Manufacturers were increasingly commenting that severe supply chain disruption was starting to impact activity,"" said Usamah Bhatti, an economist at IHS Markit.
Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asian's emerging economies are lagging advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts hurt domestic demand and countries reliant on tourism.

Vietnam's PMI plunged to 44.1, marking the sharpest deterioration in business conditions while Malaysia's PMI fell to 39.9 as renewed COVID curbs weighed on external and domestic demand. The PMI for Taiwan fell to 57.6 from 62.0.
India's factory activity contracted for the first time in almost a year as restrictions to contain the deadly second wave of the coronavirus hit demand.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to shutter much of the 19-country bloc's dominant services industry, ravaging the economy, but factories have largely remained open and the lifting of some restrictions has boosted demand.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 63.4 in June from May's 63.1, above an initial 63.1 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday and seen as a good guide to economic health, rose from May's 62.2 to 62.6. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""Euro zone manufacturing continued to grow at a rate unbeaten in almost 24 years of survey history in June as demand surged with the further relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""However, the sheer speed of the recent upsurge in demand has led to a sellers' market as capacity and transportation constraints limit the availability of inputs to factories, which have in turn driven industrial prices higher at a rate not previously witnessed by the survey.""
Due to a shortage of shipping containers and supply chains hugely affected by the global pandemic, the input prices index soared to 88.5 from 87.1 -- by far the highest in the survey's history. Inflation dipped to 1.9% last month, official flash data showed on Wednesday.

After a slow start, vaccine programmes are accelerating in the bloc so optimism improved and to meet strong demand, factories increased headcount at the fastest rate since the survey began.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 63.9 from an all-time high of 65.6 in May. It was also down a touch from a preliminary ""flash"" reading for June of 64.2.
The pace of expansion in output, new orders and employment remained among the highest of the survey's near 30-year history after COVID-19 restrictions in Britain and beyond were eased.
But the combination of surging demand and lingering social-distancing requirements caused delays in supply chains and fanned inflationary pressures, IHS Markit said.
Average input costs rose at the fastest pace on record with prices rising for chemicals, electronics, energy, food products, metals, plastics and timber.
As a result, selling prices rose by the most since those figures were first collected in November 1999.

The Bank of England said last week it thought a rise in consumer price inflation in Britain had further to run but would prove temporary, as it kept its huge monetary stimulus programme in place.
Final PMIs for the services and construction sectors are due on Monday and Tuesday next week.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 60.4 last month from 59.4 in May, which was already the highest level since April 1998. Figures above the 50.0 mark indicate expansions in activity.
""Order books were swelled by improved demand from across a spectrum of sources, with hospitality reportedly a key driver of growth as the economy reopens further in line with easing COVID restrictions,"" said Paul Smith, an economist at IHS Markit.
The strong growth is coming alongside challenges with supply chains, creating pressure on wholesale prices.

While Spain's economy shrank 0.5% in the first quarter as COVID-19 restrictions hurt businesses, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier this week that the country's output expanded a record 18% in the second quarter from a year ago.
The government expects the economy to grow 6.5% this year after 2020's record 10.8% contraction.

Although many Indian states have recently relaxed some containment measures following a decrease in daily cases the rapid emergence of the new Delta Plus variant has raised concerns over the nation's already weak economic outlook.
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, declined to an 11-month low of 48.1 in June from May's 50.8, moving below the 50-level separating growth from contraction.
""The intensification of the COVID-19 crisis in India had a detrimental impact on the manufacturing economy,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
""Out of the three broad areas of the manufacturing sector monitored by the survey, capital goods was the worst-affected area in June. Output here declined at a steep rate due to a sharp fall in sales.""
As overall demand and output shrank in June for the first time in 11 months, manufacturing firms extended their record job cutting spree, albeit at a slower pace.
The survey, conducted before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's announcement of additional fiscal support on Monday, also showed optimism about the year ahead declined to its lowest since July 2020.
""Companies became increasingly worried about when the pandemic will end, which resulted in downward revisions to output growth projections. As a result of subdued optimism, jobs were shed again in June,"" De Lima said.
Despite a sustained rise in input costs, firms increased output prices at a slower rate last month to attract demand.

However that may not be enough to significantly soften a surge in overall inflation, which hit a six-month high in May. A jump in input costs due to a strong increase in energy and commodity prices pushed wholesale price inflation to its strongest in at least 15 years.
Still, the Reserve Bank of India, which in April cut its growth forecast for this fiscal year to 9.5% from 10.5%, was not expected to hike its key interest rates anytime soon as the primary focus remains on boosting economic growth. [ECILT/IN]

In a major boost for the employment outlook, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Thursday showed vacancies in the three months to May surged 23.4%, from the previous quarter, to 362,500.
That was 132,000 higher than in February last year before the coronavirus forced the closure of much of the economy.
While a fresh outbreak had recently closed some cities, the demand for labour showed no sign of waning with 22% of businesses reporting at least one vacancy.
""There has been a steady increase in the proportion of businesses reporting at least one vacancy, after it fell to 7% in May 2020, early in the pandemic,"" said Bjorn Jarvis, head of Labour Statistics at the ABS.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean exports marked a fourth consecutive month of double-digit growth in June, albeit at a reduced pace, propelled by solid economic recovery in major markets globally and continued strong demand for memory chips and automobiles.
Exports surged 39.7% in June versus the same month a year earlier, reaching the third-biggest value on record at $54.80 billion, trade ministry data showed on Thursday. That beat the 33.6% average of 17 economist estimates in a Reuters poll, and marked the eighth consecutive month of expansion.
Exports grew 45.6% in May, the sharpest increase since August 1988.
""As base effect (from the coronavirus) fades, the growth rate itself probably reached the peak in May ... but the exports value will likely continue growing in the third quarter,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
""We expected weakened Chinese demand due to shipping delays and supply-chain disruptions but the impact is seen limited, with exports to other ASEAN economies improving.""
The nation's monthly trade data is a closely watched as it is the first to be released among major exporting economies and so widely considered a bellwether for global trade.
Overseas sales of semiconductors, the country's top export, grew for the 12th month in a row, by 34.4%, while those of cars and petrochemical products surged 62.5% and 68.5% respectively.
By destination, exports to China, the United States and the European Union soared 14.3% and 51.9% and 65.3%, while those to South Korea's six other major trading partners also increased.
Fresh risks to exports are the spread of the coronavirus Delta variant and worries about slowing Chinese economic recovery, economists said.
""Exports to China may fall to single-digit growth as China's June manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers index) signalled weakening recovery momentum... Delta virus and related lockdown measures are also a potential risk to exports,"" Park said.
Data on Wednesday showed growth in Chinese factory activity slowed in June to a four-month low on higher raw material costs, a shortage of semiconductors and a COVID-19 outbreak in major export province Guangdong, amid wider supply chain disruption in Asia.

Meanwhile, South Korean trade data on Thursday also showed imports grew 40.7% in June, beating forecasts for a 33.0% jump. The trade surplus stood at $4.44 billion, versus $2.94 billion a month prior.
Earlier this week, the finance ministry sharply upgraded its 2021 growth forecast to an 11-year high of 4.2%, with an 18.5% jump in exports towing the expansion.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence improved in the second quarter to hit a two-and-half-year high, a central bank survey showed, a sign solid global demand was helping the economy emerge from the coronavirus pandemic-induced doldrums.
Service-sector sentiment also turned positive for the first time in five quarters, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) ""Tankan"" survey showed, indicating that the economic recovery was broadening even as Japan struggles to contain a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.
Companies expect to increase capital expenditure in the year that began in April as profit recovers from last year's slump, offering hope among policymakers who project growth to accelerate in the latter half of this year.
""The further rebound in the Q2 Tankan supports our view that the economy's disappointing start to the year won't prevent vaccines driving a strong rebound in the second half of the year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment jumped to plus 14 in June from plus 5 in March, improving for the fourth consecutive quarter and hitting the highest level since December 2018, the survey showed on Thursday.
Non-manufacturers' mood also improved to plus 1 from minus 1 in the previous survey, to reach its highest index reading since March 2020, as goods distribution and leisure industries saw activity gradually resume after disruption caused by COVID-19.
""Exports and output continue to improve, which is helping sentiment improve for most manufacturing sectors. The auto sector, however, saw sentiment worsen due to shortages in semiconductor chips,"" a BOJ official said at a briefing.
Big companies expect capital expenditure to rise 9.6% in the current fiscal year ending in March, after a 8.3% drop in the previous year, the survey showed.
Some analysts, however, have questioned how quickly the economy can sustainably emerge from the pandemic with a resurgence in infections and slow a vaccination programme clouding the outlook for consumption.
Soaring raw material costs and chip shortages were also fanning caution among some manufacturers, such as those of lumber goods and automobiles, the survey showed.
""Industries such as restaurants and hotels showed signs of improvement probably because people are getting used to the coronavirus, though department stores appear to feel more of a pain from COVID curbs,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities.
""The pace of recovery will largely depend on developments of the coronavirus and vaccine rollout from now on,"" he said.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in the first quarter and likely grew only modestly in the April-June period as state-of-emergency curbs to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cooled consumption.
While the curbs have been lifted for most areas, many analysts expect consumption to remain a weak spot in Japan's export-driven recovery as slow vaccinations keep households from boosting spending on leisure and dining out.

The Tankan will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise at its interest rate review on July 15-16, when it will produce fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections.
Tankan sentiment index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 last month from May's 52, marking the 14th month of expansion, but it came below analyst expectations for a only slight slowdown to 51.8. 
The softer results in the private survey, mostly covering export-oriented and small manufacturers, are in line with those in an official survey, which showed factory growth dipped to a four-month low due to the drag from production.
A sub-index for output dropped to 51.0 in June, the lowest since March 2020, when the industrial sector started to rebound from COVID-induced paralysis. The growth in new orders also eased to a three-month low. 
New export orders barely grew, compared with a robust expansion the previous month as rising COVID-19 cases across the world, especially of the more infectious Delta variant, took a toll on demand. 
More than 150 novel coronavirus cases have been reported in Guangdong province, a manufacturing and exporting hub in southern China, since the latest wave of cases struck in late May, prompting local governments to step up prevention and control efforts that have curbed port processing capacity.
However, there are some bright spots in the private survey, which showed firms added to their payrolls at the fastest pace in seven months, as they ramped up efforts to increase capacity in the months ahead amid improved customers demand.
Inflationary pressures eased a bit, with input prices rising at slowest pace since November last year. 

""The manufacturing sector has gradually returned to normal,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. 
""In the second half of this year, the low base effect from last year will weaken. Inflationary pressure, coupled with the economic slowdown, is still a serious challenge for China.""

(Reuters) -Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes rose by the most in 11 months in May driven by a decline in mortgage rates as well as an uptick in listings.
The increase could signal some imminent relief from the shortage of homes for sale that has weighed on sales and driven residential property prices to record highs.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 8.0% to 114.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would decline 0.8% percent.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
""May's strong increase in transactions – following April’s decline, as well as a sudden erosion in home affordability – was indeed a surprise,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. 
Compared with one year ago, pending sales were up 13.1%.
New and existing home sales have fallen sharply this year because of a shortage of houses on the market, and the limited supply has resulted in skyrocketing home prices.
But Yun said listings were up recently - with the inventory of existing homes climbing to 2.5 months' supply at recent sales rates, the highest since last October, according to NAR data.
He also pointed to an easing in borrowing costs as a factor helping to lift the volume of contract signings. 

After hitting record lows below 3% late last year, the interest rate on 30-year fixed rate mortgages climbed sharply in the first quarter, but then fell back somewhat in May. The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages was 3.20% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers' Association.. 
""Home price growth will steadily moderate with increased supply, but a broad and prolonged decline in prices is unlikely,"" Yun said. ""However, if a reduction occurs in some markets, homebuyers will view the lower home price as a second-chance opportunity to get into the market after being outbid in previous multiple-bid market conditions.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in June as companies rushed to boost production and services amid a rapidly reopening economy, though a shortage of willing workers continues to hang over the labor market recovery.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector accounting for nearly half of the increase in private payrolls this month. Manufacturing payrolls growth slowed, likely reflecting labor shortages as well as scarce raw materials. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering production of motor vehicles and some household appliances.
""The labor market is continuing to heal,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Job growth is expected to pick up on a broader reopening, but timing is uncertain given it is unclear how quickly supply constraints will ease.""
Private payrolls increased by 692,000 jobs in June. Data for May was revised lower to show 886,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 978,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 600,000 jobs. 
More than 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing authorities to remove pandemic-related restrictions on businesses and mask mandates for the inoculated. 
Employment gains in June were evenly spread among small, medium and large companies, indicating that the economy's recovery from the pandemic was broadening in scope.
Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased by 332,000 jobs and there were solid gains in education and health services. Factories added only 19,000 jobs, below the monthly average 43,000 jobs in the past three months. 
Hiring at construction sites increased by 47,000 jobs. The sector is being underpinned by strong demand for housing, thanks to historically low mortgage rates and a shift to home offices during the pandemic. 
A separate report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded 8% in May. But the housing market is grappling with a severe shortages of homes for sale, which is driving up prices well beyond the reach of some first-time buyers.
Applications for loans to buy a home fell last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in another report. Home purchase loans were down 17.3% compared to same period last year.
""We expect record high home prices and scarce inventories of existing homes for sale will continue to weigh on home sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
LABOR CRUNCH
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for June on Friday. But it has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of methodology differences.
The ADP report has in recent months overestimated the private payroll gains reflected in the BLS data after understating that growth through much of the jobs recovery, which started in May 2020.
""It remains difficult to use the ADP data to accurately predict the BLS data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 600,000 jobs in June after rising 492,000 in May. With government hiring expected to have increased by about 100,000, that would lead to overall payrolls advancing by 700,000 jobs in June. 
The economy created 559,000 jobs in May. A shortage of willing workers is frustrating efforts to ramp up hiring. There were a record 9.3 million job openings as of April.
The precise cause of the labor crunch is a matter of fierce - often political - debate. Economists generally point to several factors, among them the unusually generous unemployment benefits, including a weekly $300 subsidy from the federal government, that were part of the Biden administration's pandemic relief package. 
A lack of child care facilities as some centers which shut during the pandemic never reopened, is also keeping some parents home, and there is also indication that some workers remain worried about the health risks of returning to work.
At least 26 states mostly led by Republican governors are terminating federal government-funded unemployment benefits before the Sept. 6 expiration date. No evidence has emerged so far that the early terminations, which started on June 12 and will run through July 31, are pulling the unemployed into jobs, although the rolls of those receiving benefits is shrinking faster in those states.
A survey by job search engine Indeed https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/06/29/indeed-job-seeker-survey-june-2021 found that while the vast majority of unemployed indicated they would like to start looking for work in the next three months, many did not express a sense of urgency. It showed rising vaccinations, shrinking savings and the opening of schools in the fall will be key catalysts.

About 9.3 million people are officially classified as unemployed. Job growth could, however, surprise on the upside this month. The Conference Board's survey of consumers showed households extremely upbeat in their views of the labor market.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, surged in June to the highest level since 2000.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's current account deficit widened in the January-March quarter on the back of a higher trade deficit and lower net invisible receipts, the Reserve Bank of India said in a release on Wednesday.
The current account deficit stood at $8.1 billion in the January-March quarter compared to a surplus of $0.6 billion in the same quarter last year.
The deficit stood at 1% of gross domestic product in the latest quarter, RBI data showed.
""A normalisation in import demand as well as a surge in gold imports contributed to the widening of the current account deficit,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at the rating agency ICRA.
Data earlier in June showed India's deficit in goods trade had widened to $6.28 billion in May from $3.15 billion in May 2020.
RBI said net external commercial borrowing had fallen to $6.1 billion in the January-March quarter compared with $9.4 billion a year earlier, but portfolio investments, mainly in the form of equity purchases, increased by $7.3 billion versus a decline of $13.7 billion.
Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings, said the current account data was revealing.
""India needs to focus on improving the competitiveness of its exports to make its external balance position more sustainable,"" she said. 
Boosting exports would also help to offset weakness in domestic demand stemming from the slowness of economic recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, she added.
A second wave of coronavirus infections is seen delaying economic recovery, while a rise in crude oil prices is also likely to hurt the economy. India imports over two-thirds of its oil.
For the full year 2020/21, which ended on March 31, India recorded a current account surplus of 0.9% of GDP, as against a deficit of 0.9% of GDP in 2019/20, on account of a sharp contraction in the trade deficit.
India moved to a current account surplus for the first time in over a decade in January-March 2020, and touched a record $19.2 billion in the April-June quarter.
During that period, the trade deficit narrowed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a related drop in domestic economic activity.
The balance of payments showed a surplus of $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2020/21, compared with a surplus of $18.8 billion the previous year.
Net foreign direct investment inflows increased marginally to $44 billion in 2020/21 but in the January-March quarter they stood at just $2.7 billion, well down from $12 billion a year earlier. 

Nitsure said the decline in net FDI did not bode well and that India needed to become more attractive as a destination for long-term investments.
""With the widening state-level restrictions shrinking the domestic demand for fuels and gold in May 2021, we expect the current account to revert to a small, transient surplus in the ongoing quarter,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist rating agency ICRA.

(Reuters) - U.S. applications for home mortgages decreased by the most in almost five months driven by sharp declines in refinancing activity and purchase applications.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index fell 6.9% in the week ending June 25 from a week earlier, the largest drop since early February. This reflected an 8.2% decrease in applications for refinancing existing loans and a 4.8% drop in applications to purchase a home.
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages increased to 3.20% last week from 3.18% the prior week.

""Purchase applications for conventional loans declined last week to the lowest level since last May,"" Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist, said in a statement. ""The average loan size for total purchase applications increased, indicating that first-time homebuyers, who typically get smaller loans, are likely getting squeezed out of the market due to the lack of entry-level homes for sale.""
Both new and existing home sales have fallen sharply this year due to a shortage of houses on the market.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate held steady at a historic high of 14.7% in the three months through April, figures showed on Wednesday, with the rate of deterioration in the labor market continuing to slow gradually from a year ago. 
Although the unemployment rate was unchanged from the quarter ending in March, statistics agency IBGE's comparisons with the three months through January indicated a softer market amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rodolfo Margato, an economist at brokerage XP (NASDAQ:XP), said the labor market will continue to improve in the months ahead due to ""increased mobility, rising business confidence and more favorable growth prospects for the labor intensive service sector.""
That said, the labor force will only get back to ""normal levels"" in the second quarter of next year with the unemployment rate not falling below pre-pandemic levels until the second half of next year, he said.
The 14.7% unemployment rate is the highest since IBGE's series began in 2012, and as has consistently been the case for almost a year now, less than 50% of the working population have a job, the figures showed. 
Graphic: Brazil unemployment - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzzdjdvw/PARO.png 
Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) calculated that the unemployment rate would have been over 20% had the rate of participation in the job market been the same as it was a year ago.
IBGE said that the number of people officially unemployed was 14.8 million, up 489,000 from the three months through January. There are now 3.3 million fewer Brazilians in work than before the pandemic struck over a year ago, IBGE said.
Some 85.9 million Brazilians had work in April, IBGE said, little changed from the previous quarter but down 3.7%, or 3.3 million people, from the same period a year earlier.

The number of people entirely out of the workforce held steady at 76.4 million, IBGE said, but that was up more than 5.5 million people, or 7.7%, from a year earlier.
The under-employment rate rose to 29.7% from 29.0% in the November-January period, IBGE said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's public finances improved across the board in May, official figures showed on Wednesday, as the budget deficit shrank to a year low and government debt fell to its lowest as a share of the overall economy in almost a year.
Government debt fell to 84.5% of gross domestic product in May, central bank figures showed, the lowest since July 2020 and down from 85.6% the month before. 
Graphic: Brazil debt - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxlnjdvx/DEBTGDP.png 
Net public-sector debt also fell in May, to 59.7% of GDP from 59.8% the month before, the lowest since August.
Stronger-than-expected tax revenues in recent months have helped brighten the outlook for Brazil's public finances, so much so that Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said last month that the overall budget deficit could swing to surplus in 2023.
Guedes said last week that Brazil's debt-to-GDP ratio should close this year at 84%.
The central bank's figures on Wednesday showed that the public sector registered a deficit in May excluding interest payments of 15.5 billion reais ($3.1 billion), less than the 23.7 billion reais deficit forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The nominal deficit in the month including interest payments was 37.4 billion reais, the central bank said.
The accumulated primary deficit in the 12 months through May was 428.6 billion reais, or 5.4% of GDP, the smallest deficit since May 2020 and below a downwardly revised 7% of GDP in the year through April, the central bank said.

The nominal deficit including interest payments in the year through May was 724.3 billion reais, or 9.1% of GDP, the central bank said, compared with 827.2 billion reais, or 10.6%, of GDP the month before.

117,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 05:13AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation eased this month, levelling off for the summer months before an expected move well above the European Central Bank's target towards the autumn on higher commodity prices. 
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slipped to 1.9% in June from 2.0% in May, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll and right on the ECB's target of ""below but close to 2%"".
Consumer price growth has accelerated this year but mostly on one-off factors, such as rebounding oil prices, a German tax hike and the statistical impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
These factors will continue to push inflation higher and price growth is likely to peak above 2.5% towards the end of the year, according to the ECB's projections.
That is creating a communications challenge for the bank, which has persistently undershot its target since 2003 and not faced rapid price growth in a decade.
However, the ECB has made it clear that this is not the sort of inflation that requires a policy response, so no tightening is on the cards and borrowing costs are set to stay ultra-low for years to come.
Policymakers argue that higher commodity prices mask weak underlying trends and inflation for services and durable goods, more meaningful measures for central bankers, remain weak.
Indeed, core inflation, or prices excluding volatile food and energy costs, held steady in June as expected at 0.9% while a more narrow measure excluding alcohol and tobacco slipped to 0.9% from 1.0%.

Wage growth, a key condition of durable inflation, is also anaemic while ECB policy is usually ineffective against short-term price movements, providing yet another reason for the bank to look past this year's surge.
The ECB sees inflation well below its target both next year and 2023 and so far no policymaker has argued that this current period of relatively high inflation could translate into the sort of durable price pressure that would risk an overshoot beyond a temporary peak.

LONDON (Reuters) -British households increased their savings sharply in early 2021 as a return to lockdowns prevented them from visiting bars, restaurants and many shops, potentially boosting their spending power for the economic recovery now under way.
The country's savings rate, which measures the income households save as a proportion of disposable income, rose to 19.9% from 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.
That was the second-highest savings rate on record after a leap to 25.9% in April-June last year during the first round of coronavirus lockdowns.
Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics, said the stock of excess savings was bigger than he had expected. 
""This represents a larger upside risk to the pace and duration of the economic recovery further ahead should households choose to spend it,"" he said.
The data also showed Britain's economy shrank a bit more than previously thought in the first quarter as gross domestic product contracted by 1.6%. The ONS had previously estimated GDP shrank by 1.5%.
Household spending was weaker than first estimated.
However, the hit to GDP in early 2021 was just a fraction of the roughly 20% slump in the second quarter of 2020 when Britain was in its first lockdown. Many businesses have adapted to the rules by, for example, ramping up their online operations. 
Britain has suffered one of the world's biggest coronavirus death tolls and its GDP shrank by almost 10% in 2020, a more severe hit than in almost all other advanced economies.
Samuel Tombs, with consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Britain was probably was the Group of Seven's laggard for the last time in the first quarter, thanks to a fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccines which would boost growth into early 2022.
""Thereafter, however, the recovery likely will lose momentum and the UK will slip back towards the bottom of the pack, as other countries close the vaccination gap,"" Tombs said.
Last week, the Bank of England kept its economic stimulus programmes in place and, despite the signs of economic recovery, most of its monetary policymakers said they wanted to ""lean strongly against downside risks to the outlook"".
Separate ONS figures showed Britain's current account deficit narrowed to 12.828 billion pounds ($17.76 billion) in the first quarter as the tightening of coronavirus rules hit the economy and hurt demand for imports.
The balance of payments shortfall was equivalent to 2.4% of GDP compared with 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The deficit is a long-standing concern for investors because it leaves Britain reliant on foreign inflows of cash and is bigger than in many other similar economies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment surged in June to a 21-year-high as an accelerated pace of COVID-19 vaccinations led to further reopening and an improved mood across all sectors of the economy, notably in retail and services.
The European Commission's monthly sentiment survey for the 19 countries sharing the euro on Tuesday showed optimism rising to 117.9 points in June from 114.5 in May, beating the consensus estimate in a Reuters poll of 116.5.
Sentiment became much more upbeat in services, the euro zone's biggest sector that is responsible for more than two thirds of gross domestic product. The sub-index rose to 17.9 points from 11.3 in May, far above expectations.
Retail sentiment rose to 4.5 points from 0.5 in May.
Optimism in industry, construction and among consumers also ticked up, although more modestly.
Sentiment in Germany hit an all-time high and improved in the six largest EU countries, except Spain, where it slightly declined.
The optimism translated into manufacturing industry's selling price expectations rising to 36.0 points in June from 29.9 in May, the highest reading in records stretching back to 1985.
Consumers also began to expect higher inflation over the next 12 months, with the reading going up to a 13-month high of 27.1.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Growth in China's June factory activity dipped to a four-month low on higher raw material costs, a shortage of semiconductors and a COVID-19 outbreak in the major export province of Guangdong, amid wider supply chain disruptions in Asia. 
The chip supply crunch has hammered other manufacturing powerhouses in Asia. Industrial output in Japan and South Korea slumped in May from the previous month as auto production declined due to semiconductor shortages, adding to concerns of flagging momentum in their respective economies.
China's June official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) eased slightly to 50.9 versus 51.0 in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. It, however, exceeded analysts' forecast for a slowdown to 50.8.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The soft factory activity data aided a rebound in Chinese 
stocks on Wednesday as it eased fears of policy tightening.
""This was largely a result of COVID, which has affected factory output and also new export orders due to the rising waves of infections and resultant restrictions in some neighbouring economies,"" said Iris Pang, Great China chief economist at ING. 
""Overall, (it's) not a great month but no really worrying signs ... China's growth rate is still positive, though it would be a lot lower in H2 than H1, mostly because of the change in base effects,"" said Pang, referring to year-ago comparisons with 2020's pandemic disruptions.
The sub-index for production eased to 51.9, a four-month low, from 52.7 the previous month. Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slowdown in production to constraining factors such as a shortage of semiconductors, inadequate coal supply, a power crunch and maintenance of equipment.
A shortage of coal supply in China's southern regions, which started in mid-May, hit factory operations though the government has said the power crunch should ease soon.
New export orders fell for a second consecutive month in June and at a faster pace, likely due to the global resurgence of COVID-19 variants, forcing some countries to reimpose lockdowns.
A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 61.2 in June, compared with May's 72.8, as the government cracked down on high raw material prices.
BRIGHT SPOTS
Growth in new orders, however, picked up, as domestic demand improved. 
Economists at Nomura believe the PMI prints were still solid in the second quarter, despite recent sequential moderation, pointing to the resilience of China's economy amid the recent resurgence of infections in Guangdong province.
""We expect the official manufacturing PMI to rebound slightly to 51.2 in July, thanks to the release of pent-up demand following the containment of latest wave of COVID-19, the recovery of some South China ports, and the relaxation of safety and environmental protection rules imposed before the 100th anniversary of the ruling party's foundation.""
The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the pandemic, with the consumption and service sectors seen catching up to exports and manufacturing, though gross domestic product growth is set to moderate. 
""Much of the recovery has occurred and the momentum is slowing. Combined with a relatively higher base, this means year-on-year GDP growth is expected to slow to 7.2% in Q2 from 18.3% in Q1,"" said analysts at HSBC.
However, in two-year average terms, they expect growth to pick up to 5.2% from 5.0%, though this is still below pre-pandemic levels of 6.0% growth.

The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.5 in June from 55.2 in May, a separate survey from the NBS showed, dampened by a sharp pull-back in the recovery of the services sector due to local COVID outbreaks.
The construction index held steady at 60.1, although analysts expect the sector to face headwinds amid Beijing's clampdown on the property market.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity kept growing in June but at a slower pace, falling to a four-month low. Manufacturers were grappling with new challenges such as higher raw material costs, as well as a recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong province.
China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.9 for June, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day. It was slightly higher than 50.8 figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than May’s 51 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.5 in June, below May’s 55.2 figure.
They remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The data also indicated that China’s economic recovery is steadying and more balanced among sectors, following its rapid growth as the economy recovered from COVID-19. Chinese policymakers were optimistic about the economy, saying earlier this week that it is showing more stability and strength despite global and domestic risks.
However, Chinese manufacturers still face challenges, including higher raw material costs and global supply chain bottlenecks. Meanwhile, a recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong, a major export province, disrupted shipments.
Factors such as a shortage of semiconductors, inadequate coal supply, a power crunch and maintenance of equipment contributed to the slowdown in production, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
Factory output remained expansion but at a slower pace, and job sentiments have improved, the NBS said in a statement. The services sector was affected by the “impact of regional pandemic outbreaks.” It added that air transport, hotels and catering had contracted in June.
Despite an accelerating vaccination and demand recovery globally, the stimulus measures China rolled out during COVID-19 are likely to fuel inflation and weigh on China’s manufacturing sector.
China’s regulators, however, said it would take measures to curb any unreasonable surges in commodity prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output posted the biggest monthly drop in a year in May, as a sharp fall in car production threatened to undermine the country's economic recovery just weeks before Tokyo is set to host the Olympic Games.
The world's third-largest economy will likely grow at a much slower pace than initially thought in the current quarter in part due to weakness in consumer spending, a poll by economists showed this month.
Factory output slumped 5.9% in May from the previous month, official data showed on Wednesday, hit by declines in the manufacturing of cars and production machinery to post its largest monthly drop since May last year.
The contraction, which was the first drop in three months, was much weaker than a 2.4% fall forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. It followed a 2.9% gain in the previous month. 
Output was weighed by a 19.4% drop in motor vehicle production, largely due to supply issues with semiconductor chips, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said.
The car industry has a big impact on Japan's overall economy. Manufacturers of intermediate goods, such as tires and electrical lighting of passenger cars, are taking a hit from declines in motor vehicle production.
""The service sector was impacted by a state of emergency. If output comes in negative in the second quarter, the economy will be pushed down considerably,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""There's a possibility the economy will see negative growth,"" she said, adding that may show Japan as a laggard in its coronavirus recovery compared to other major global economies.
Manufacturers said they expected output to rebound 9.1% in June and drop 1.4% in July, though those forecasts may not fully take the global semiconductor supply issue into account, a trade ministry official said.
The worse-than-expected output data comes weeks before the start of the Tokyo Summer Olympics on July 23, which were already delayed by a year.
A successful staging of the Games may help boost confidence among the Japanese public, which could stimulate household consumption and broader demand conditions at home.
Separate figures on Tuesday showed retail sales rose for a third straight month in May, but failed to dispel worries that the economic recovery will take time to gather steam as COVID-19-linked pressures remained.

Japan's economy slipped into contraction in the first quarter as a late vaccine rollout and emergency measures put in place to stem a rise in infections have taken a toll on domestic demand, throwing into doubt the country's economic outlook.
Despite those setbacks, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura expects the economy to return to pre-coronavirus levels in the current fiscal year, which runs through March 2022.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slipped to 50.9 in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. That compares with 51 in the previous month and 50.8 projected by economists.
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, dropped to 53.5, lower than the 55.3 predicted by economists. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in output.
The latest data adds to signs that China’s economic recovery is steadying after rapid expansion from the pandemic, with growth becoming more balanced among sectors. Top policy makers this week provided a positive assessment of the economy, saying it’s showing more stability and strength even though global and domestic risks remain.
Manufacturers continued to face constraints from supply chain bottlenecks and raw material price hikes in June. A Covid-19 outbreak in the Guangdong province caused a month of disruptions at Yantian, one of the world’s busiest container ports, and only restored normal operations last week. Price pressures remained elevated in the month, although there are signs they are beginning to cool.

126,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Prices charged by British retailers fell slightly faster in June than in May due to a fierce battle between supermarkets, but growing costs linked to COVID-19 and Brexit might add to the rise in broader inflation soon, an industry group said.
The British Retail Consortium's shop price index for June showed prices were 0.7% lower than a year before compared with a 0.6% fall in the year to May, which was the smallest drop since February 2020.
Shop prices as measured by the BRC typically show year-on-year price falls unlike the wider measure of consumer price inflation targeted by the Bank of England which includes services and a bigger range of goods.
The BoE said last week that CPI is likely to peak at more than 3%, above its 2% target, but the increase would be due largely to a global rise in energy prices and one-off supply chain problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The central bank stuck to its view that the rise in overall inflation was likely to be temporary.
""The fact that shop prices remain in negative territory despite the recent rise in CPI is indicative of the competitive retail landscape in the UK,"" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ which co-produces the index.
BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said costs for retailers were rising due to higher food and fuel prices, Brexit-related red tape and supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic.

""The increasing cost burden on retailers may be passed onto the consumer, threatening price rises as the pressure mounts in the months ahead, especially with additional Brexit checks this autumn,"" she said.
The BRC collected price data between June 1 and June 7.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in June as growing labor market optimism amid a reopening economy offset concerns about higher inflation.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed a healthy appetite for long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances, suggesting strong momentum in the economy as the second quarter ended. 
Consumers were also keen to purchase homes, a sign that house prices will continue to rapidly increase as supply lags. Many intended to go on vacation, mostly in the United States, over the next six months, which should boost demand for services and add fuel to consumer spending. 
""Consumers have plenty to be cheerful about after being cooped up at home for more than a year,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Looking ahead, low COVID infections, rebounding employment, and elevated savings will buoy confidence and push consumers to spend at a breakneck pace over the summer.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index raced to a reading of 127.3 this month, the highest level since February 2020, from 120.0 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 119.0. 
The survey places more emphasis on the labor market, which is steadily recovering. More than 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing for broader economic re-engagement.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to 157.7 from 148.7 last month. The expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, rose to 107.0 from 100.9.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 6.7% from 6.5% last month.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high for the fourth straight session. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

STRONG LABOR MARKET VIEWS
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, vaulted to 43.5 in June. That was the highest level since 2000 and was up from 36.9 in May.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report. The jump in the so-called labor market differential augurs well for June's employment report due out on Friday. There are a record 9.3 million job openings.
""This could indicate one million new nonfarm payroll jobs in Friday's report if the consumer is right,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. 
According a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 690,000 jobs in June after rising 559,000 in May. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 5.7% from 5.8%. Though job growth has picked up, a shortage of willing workers is frustrating companies' efforts to ramp up hiring. 
The worker shortage has been blamed on generous unemployment benefits, including a weekly $300 subsidy from the federal government. A lack of child care facilities as some centers which shut during the pandemic never reopened, is also keeping some parents home.
At least 26 states are terminating federal government-funded unemployment benefits before the Sept. 6 expiration date. This, together with school districts expected to resume in-person classes in the fall, is seen expanding the labor pool.
This month, more consumers planned to buy homes, cars and major household appliances over the next six months, relative to May. That suggests demand for so-called durable goods will remain strong even as spending shifts backs to services such as air travel, dining out and hotel accommodation.
Economists are forecasting another double-digit rise in consumer spending this quarter, which is expected to lead to the economy growing at about a 10% annualized rate. Gross domestic product expanded at a 6.4% pace in the first quarter.
Accelerating home prices are curbing sales, which will likely limit the housing market's contribution to GDP growth this quarter. Demand for housing is being driven by historically low mortgage rates and shift to home offices during the pandemic. Other parts of the economy are also experiencing shortages and high prices because of bottlenecks in the supply chain. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas accelerated 14.9% year-on-year in April, the largest gain since December 2005. That followed a 13.4% increase in March.

Soaring house price inflation was corroborated by another report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index shot up a record 15.7% in April from a year ago after rising 14.0% in March. 
Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing as the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. 

""We often get asked if we are in a housing bubble, but that is not necessarily the case,"" said Jordan van Rijn, senior economist at the Credit Union National Association. 
""There are structural factors at play, such as lower supply of existing homes, a shortage of materials and labor, and higher cost in materials.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is considering a wide range of measures to bring the bloc's financial sector into line with its climate plans, sources who have seen a European Commission strategy paper told Reuters.
The document outlines several actions including combating so-called greenwashing of investments, setting climate change targets for banks and encouraging low carbon blockchain projects, the sources said.
Entitled ""financing transition to a sustainable economy"", the paper builds on the EU executive's 2018 action which set the stage for the bloc's classification of truly green investments, and mandatory climate-related disclosures by companies. 
But the commission believes more action is needed because it has become clearer that Europe should improve how the financial sector contributes to sustainability, the sources said.
The EU's goal to eliminate its net emissions by 2050 will require huge investments, much of it private funding. Its system of classification, or taxonomy, aims to make green activities more visible and attractive to investors.
EU states will be asked to assess how their financial markets contribute to reaching the bloc's climate goals, covering asset managers, pension funds, banks and insurers.
A consolidated report on EU financial markets' transition will be delivered by the end of 2023, the sources said.
The commission will then coordinate with the European Central Bank and the bloc's banking watchdog to ""calibrate the right pace for the transition"".
There will be more work on labelling bonds as sustainable.
An ""initiative"" by the first quarter of 2023 will aim to make environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings of companies more reliable and comparable. The EU will also consider options to broaden out its taxonomy to cater better for investments in companies moving to a more sustainable footing, the sources said.

The strategy paper seeks to ""empower"" retail investors and small companies through green loans and mortgages, and better expertise of financial advisors in sustainability investments, 
There will be a ""digital sustainable finance roadmap"" by 2023 to foster investment in low emission data centres and blockchain technology, the sources said.

(Reuters) -U.S. single-family home prices in 20 key urban markets rose in April from a year earlier by the most in over 15 years as the shortage of homes available to buy drives up prices at the fastest rate seen since before the financial crisis, a closely watched survey said on Tuesday.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 14.9% through the 12 months ended in April, the largest annual price increase since December 2005. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 14.5% increase. 
On a month-to-month basis, the 20-city composite index rose 1.6% from March. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a 1.7% increase.
Among the twenty cities, Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle reported the highest year-over-year gains in April. 
""While the acceleration may be met with concerns, mortgage interest rates remain 50% lower than they were in 2005, when home price growth last peaked, keeping the ratio of mortgage payments to monthly households income lower today,"" Selma Hepp, CoreLogic Deputy Chief Economist said. ""It's probably that continued massive demand will keep pressure on prices, which are likely to remain at double-digit growth rate throughout the remainder of 2021.""
Similar data out Tuesday from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency showed its home price index gained a record-high 15.7% through the 12 months ended in April.
Home prices have surged nationwide in large part due to limited supply. Contrary to the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the current boom does not feature a frenzy of speculators and buyers with low credit scores buying homes and trying to flip them. Prices are at a record while sales volumes are still roughly 20% below their peak level in mid-2005.

""Despite sharply rising prices, demand for homes remains very strong,"" Zillow Economist Matthew Speakman said. ""Bidding wars for the relatively few houses available remain common and homes are going under contract at an increasingly fast pace. Inventory upticks in recent weeks suggest that a respite from these red-hot market conditions may be starting to form.""
Last week, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a one-year low in May as expensive raw materials such as lumber continue to increase prices of newly constructed houses. Also, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell for a fourth consecutive month in May.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government is expected to announce an insurance scheme in the coming weeks for live events, including festivals, theatre and sports, to allow them to go ahead despite the pandemic, insurance industry sources said.
Insurers have since last year stripped COVID-19 from event cancellation insurance policies, meaning event organisers have no cover if a coronavirus outbreak forces them to tear up their schedules.
A report from a parliamentary committee last month called for a government-backed insurance scheme for live events, similar to a successful 500 million pounds ($696.05 million) scheme introduced for the film and TV industry last year.
The government is due to respond to the committee's report by the end of the month.
It was ""considering options"" on insurance and indemnity, Nigel Huddleston, a junior minister at Britain's culture ministry, told parliament last week.
""We are hopeful there will be an announcement,"" said Tim Thornhill, a director at insurance broker Tysers, highlighting the urgency given there have already been cancellations.
Music festival Womad cancelled its July 2021 festival on Monday, citing the government’s unwillingness to provide insurance support for festivals.
However, insurance industry sources said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has set up an ""events indemnity sprint team"" across several government departments and a government spokesperson said the department was working flat out to support live events. 
""We are aware of the wider concerns about securing indemnity cover and are exploring what further support may be required when the sector is able to reopen,"" a ministry spokesperson said by email. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said further lockdowns cannot be entirely ruled out, but that Britain is on course to lift most remaining COVID-19 restrictions on July 19. 
ECONOMIC VALUE
In pressing the case for government support, the cultural sector says it is a huge tourist draw and theatre closures last year and this year have dealt a heavy blow to the economy.
In 2019, before the pandemic, Britain's music industry alone contributed 5.8 billion pounds ($8.04 billion) to the economy, UK Music said.
After months of closure or pared back performances with reduced audiences to allow social distancing, planning ahead to revive the sector is all but impossible without events cancellation insurance, theatre and music directors say.
That makes government intervention crucial if the commercial sector will not pay.
""It would make a massive difference to us,"" said Neil McPherson, artistic director at the Finborough Theatre, an independent venue in west London.
""We basically have the choice of carrying on with productions with devastating repercussions if we have to cancel, or cancel completely in advance because we can't take the risk."" 
Andrew Lloyd-Webber and other West End impresarios last week also said a government-backed insurance scheme was vital.
Specialist insurers in the Lloyd's of London and broader London commercial insurance market would be likely to provide some initial cover, brokers said, but most would take the form of a backstop from the government.
That structure would enable the government to reduce its exposure as the risk of COVID-19 subsides. 
""There have to be insurers involved so there is an exit plan,"" said James Davies, divisional director, sport and entertainment at EC3 Brokers. Both Tysers and EC3 have provided data to the government to help it to design a scheme.
Industry sources are hoping for a scheme at least as large as the film and TV scheme. The larger the scheme, the greater the variety of events which could get cover, including conferences and weddings, they said.

Thornhill said modelling by Tysers showed the government could insure 1.1 billion pounds in event costs with 250-300 million pounds of insurance.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - One in every nine new cars sold in Europe last year was an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, with low-emission car sales surging even as the COVID-19 pandemic knocked overall vehicle sales, the European Environment Agency said on Tuesday.
The uptick in electric car sales caused a 12% drop in average CO2 emissions of new cars sold in Europe last year, compared with in 2019, reversing a trend that had seen such emissions increase for three consecutive years.
It was the biggest annual drop in such emissions since the EU introduced its car CO2 standards in 2010.
Of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year, 11% were fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, according to the provisional data. 
Those vehicles tripled their share of new car sales, from 3.5% in 2019.
Tougher CO2 targets for carmakers came into force last year, pushing carmakers to curb their fleet-wide emissions by selling more low-emission vehicles, buy credits from other carmakers that overachieved their targets, or face fines. The EEA did not confirm which carmakers met their targets.
Countries including France and Germany also included electric vehicle subsidies in COVID-19 economic recovery packages last year.
While overall new car sales dropped, Europe's electric and plug-in hybrid car sales increased to more than 1 million in 2020.
Campaign group Transport & Environment said the data showed the emissions targets were working, but urged Brussels to propose CO2 standards that would ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035, when it announces a package of climate policies next month.
EU officials said policymakers have not yet confirmed which specific car CO2 targets the Commission will propose.

The average car stays on the road for 10 to 15 years, and campaigners say selling polluting vehicles after 2035 would thwart the EU's target to have net zero emissions by 2050.
Average emissions for new cars registered in Europe were 107.8 grams of CO2 per kilometre in 2020, a decrease of 14.5 grams compared with 2019.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.1% in June, down from 2.4% in May.
The June reading was in line with a Reuters forecast.
The national consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.3% in June from 2.5% in May.
Germany's preliminary inflation data does not include a harmonized figure for core inflation which strips out more volatile index components such as energy and food costs.
But a breakdown of the non-harmonized data showed that energy and food inflation rose a little less strongly in June while prices for rents and goods accelerated at the same pace.
""There are increasing signs that underlying price pressure is picking up slightly,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner said, adding that clothing, overnight stays and restaurant visits had become noticeably more expensive.
The German central bank earlier this month lifted its inflation forecast to 2.6% this year, which would be the highest since 2008.
The Bundesbank has played down the significance of the surge, blaming it mainly on energy prices and tax effects. Without those, it said, inflation would stand at just 1%, in line with last year and well below 2019's level.

The sudden surge in prices, which could see inflation touch 4% in the second half of 2021, might affect perceptions after a long period of low inflation and impact consumer behaviour.
Citing the temporary nature of price rises, both the central bank and government expect inflation to ease again next year despite an expected strong economic recovery.

The finance ministry said that payment card data showed spending was up 18% in the third week of June from the same period of 2019 with little sign of easing in the weeks after coronavirus restrictions were relaxed.
""The real surprise is that it's holding up over time,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Cnews television. ""That proves that (consumers) are using their savings for consumption and reviving the economy."" 
Spending on electronic goods was up more than 45%, and nearly 30% on clothes while spending in hotels and restaurants was up more than 10%, the data showed.
Shops, museums, cinemas and theatres reopened on May 19, ending the country's third nationwide lockdown since the pandemic emerged last year. 
Since then cafes, bars and restaurants have gradually been allowed to have more patrons and a national night-time curfew ended on June 20, 10 days earlier than initially scheduled as infection numbers fell and a vaccination campaign gained speed.
With restrictions relaxed, consumer confidence surged in June to its highest level since March last year, just before the outbreak swept across the country.
The INSEE official statistics agency said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index jumped to 102 in June from 98 in May, surpassing economists' average expectation for a reading of 100 in a Reuters poll.

It also showed that concerns about unemployment were the lowest since the outbreak first started while pessimism about the general economic outlook was the weakest since December 2017.
Separately, INSEE said that unemployment ticked only marginally higher in the first quarter, rising to 8.1% from 8.0% in the previous three months.

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices jumped by the most in more than 16 years this month, soaring by 13.4% from June 2020, and demand is expected to stay strong while a coronavirus emergency tax break remains in place, mortgage lender Nationwide said.
In monthly terms, house prices were 0.7% higher than in May as buyers rushed to take advantage of the tax incentive and sought bigger homes after their experiences of lockdown.
""While the strength is partly due to base effects, with June last year unusually weak due to the first lockdown, the market continues to show significant momentum,"" Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 13.7% in annual terms and by 0.7% from May. 
The tax break, introduced last year as part of British finance minister Rishi Sunak's emergency support for the economy, had originally been due to expire at the end of March. 
But the first 500,000 pounds ($693,250) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland are now due to remain exempt until the end of June, and a 250,000 pound tax-free allowance will run until the end of September.
""Underlying demand is likely to remain solid in the near term as the economy unlocks,"" Gardner said. 
""Consumer confidence has rebounded while borrowing costs remain low. This, combined with a lack of supply on the market, suggests further upward pressure on prices. But as we look toward the end of the year, the outlook is harder to foresee.""
THE BOE IS WATCHING 
As well as the tax break, Sunak's huge jobs support programme is also due to be phased out by the end of September, raising fears of an increase in unemployment. 
Nationwide said it was still possible that the shift in demand for larger properties seen during the pandemic would continue to help the market once the tax break is gone.
The lender published a survey last month showing that almost seven in 10 homeowners who were considering a move would be doing it even without the extension of the tax incentive.
Nationwide said house prices were close to a record high relative to incomes, making it harder for first-time buyers to raise a deposit. But mortgage payments were not high as a proportion of pay, due mostly to low mortgage rates. 
The Bank of England has said is monitoring the housing market as it weighs up the chances of a broader pick-up in inflation as the economy reopens. 
Last week, the central bank left its key interest rate at an all-time low or 0.1% and made no change to its plan to increase its government bond purchases to 895 billion pounds.
Despite the signs of recovery in Britain's economy, most BoE rate-setters said they wanted to ""lean strongly against downside risks to the outlook"".

Nationwide said house prices in London rose at the slowest rate of any region in England during the second quarter of 2021 but they still increased by 7.3%. Northern Ireland was the strongest performing region, with prices up 14% year-on-year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales beat expectations in May as households loosened their purse strings, but underlying trends in consumption remain hostage to COVID-19-linked pressures and suggest the economic recovery will take time to gather steam. 
With Tokyo set to host the Olympic Games next month, analysts expect Japan's economy will barely grow in the second quarter after prolonged coronavirus emergency curbs hurt the growth outlook.
As major global economies such as the United States rebound strongly from the COVID-19 slump, the weak growth rate in Japan is pressuring policymakers to take fresh supportive measures on top of the massive existing stimulus to boost demand.
Retail sales jumped 8.2% in May from a year earlier, the third straight month of growth, government data showed on Tuesday, a larger rise than the median market forecast for a 7.9% gain. 
Despite the better-than-expected rise in retail sales, the jump was not strong enough to mark a definite shift towards a brighter outlook for spending conditions, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Many elderly were unlikely to go out and spend money in April and May as there was still a state of emergency or quasi-emergency measures (in major areas),"" said Minami.
""It's hard to imagine that the Olympics will set off a spending rush,"" he said, adding that risks remained that another resurgence in COVID-19 infections would weigh on consumption ahead.
The broader rise in retail sales, which was largely due to statistical base effects that reflected last year's slide, was underpinned by year-on-year gains in spending on items such as general merchandise, clothing, cars and fuel, the data showed.
But compared with the previous month, retail sales lost 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis, in a sign the trend for spending by Japanese consumers was losing steam.
Separate data showed the nationwide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was up at 3.0%, above the previous month's 2.8% and a median forecast of 2.9%.

There were 1.09 jobs per applicant in May, unchanged from April, labour ministry data showed. 
The world's third-largest economy is set to expand by an annualised 0.5% in the current quarter after posting a sharp 3.9% annualised drop in January-March, according to the latest Reuters poll data.

The ministry said that after a 1.5% decline last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, a fall that was modest compared to most other developed countries, exports have done well so far this year, with goods exports up 2% and services exports up 15%.
Software and computers services, which make up most of high-tech exports, are up more than 20% so far in 2021, the ministry said.
Service exports rose 11.6% in 2020 to $43.4 billion and have risen an average of 13% a year since 2016.
""The high-tech sector is the most significant source of export growth for Israeli exports in recent years and especially in the year of the coronavirus crisis. This trend is expected to continue and even strengthen in the coming year,"" the ministry said.
High tech is a key economic growth driver for Israel, accounting for some 12% of economic output and 10% of the country's labour force. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a former tech executive, has set a target of raising the tech workforce to 15% by 2026.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is likely to ease to 50.8 in June from 51 in May, showed the median forecast of 32 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
""The key drag would be COVID disruption on Shenzhen ports, accounting for about 7% of national exports, which has led to slower container throughput growth,"" said analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in a note to clients.
""This could weigh down national exports by 3-4 percentage points, and thus drag the pace of production in mid- to downstream sectors. Meanwhile, construction activity likely slowed amid higher raw material prices.""
More than 150 novel coronavirus cases have been reported in Guangdong province, a manufacturing and exporting hub in southern China, since the latest wave of cases struck in late May, prompting local governments to step up prevention and control efforts that have curbed port processing capacity. 
But port congestion is easing, with Shenzhen's Yantian Port, which had been hit by a COVID-19 outbreak, resuming full capacity on Saturday, state media reported. Guangdong has not reported any COVID-19 cases in six days.
Chinese exporters, which have defied expectations of a slowdown since the beginning of the pandemic, are grappling with a global shortage of semiconductors, high raw material costs and sky-rocketing shipping fees as a surge in global demand for Chinese goods stretches global shipping capacity. 
Chinese officials have said they would curb any unreasonable increases in commodity prices. The state planner has launched investigations into the coal, iron ore and fertiliser markets.
Meanwhile, at China's industrial firms, profit growth slowed again in May, official data showed on Sunday, as surging raw material prices squeezed margins and weighed on factory activity.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Wednesday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Thursday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip slightly to 51.8 from May's 52.

Profits at China's industrial firms rose 36.4% in May from a year earlier to 829.92 billion yuan ($128.58 billion) official data showed on Sunday.
That was a slowdown from the 57% surge reported in April, according to National Bureau of Statistics.
The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by COVID-19, but it faces new challenges such as elevated raw material costs and global supply chain crunches. Officials warn that China's recovery remains uneven.
Imbalances in profitability became prominent between upstream and downstream firms due to high commodity prices, said Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau.
""The foundation for recovery is not yet solid,"" he said in a statement accompanying the data. 
Profits grew rapidly in the metals, chemicals and petroleum sectors, while smaller and downstream enterprises saw much more pressure, Zhu said. 
For the January-May period, industrial firms' profits grew 83.4% from the same period a year earlier to 3.42 trillion yuan. 
Factory-gate inflation saw its fastest annual growth in over 12 years in May driven by surging commodity prices, posing risks to profit margins for mid- and downstream firms.
Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to cool runaway metals prices, including selling supplies from state reserves, but with global demand continuing to recover some analysts believe the moves will have only a limited impact.
China's official manufacturing data this week is expected to show weaker growth in activity in June, likely due to disruptions caused by COVID-19 flare-ups at the country's major southern ports. In addition, investors will be looking to trends in input costs and selling prices for any further signs of margin pressure.

Liabilities at industrial firms were up 8.2% year-on-year at the end of May, versus 8.6% growth a month earlier.
The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment ticked up in June, driven by an improving economic outlook among affluent households, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index rose to a final reading of 85.5 from May's final level of 82.9, though it was below June's preliminary reading of 86.4.
That was below the median forecast of 86.5 among economists polled by Reuters.
""All of the June gain was among households with incomes above $100,000, and mainly in the way they judged future economic prospects,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. Also, a record 56% of respondents expect a drop in unemployment in the year ahead.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 88.6 from May's 89.4, and also down from June's preliminary reading of 90.6.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations jumped to 83.5 in June from May's 78.8, but down modestly from the mid-month reading of 83.8.
""While many are optimistic about a gradual end to the pandemic, consumers still judged the risks from emerging COVID variants as appreciable,"" Curtin said. ""It is likely that consumers will not reduce their savings and wealth to pre-pandemic levels, but maintain a higher level of precautionary funds.""

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 4.2% from May's final reading of 4.6%, while the survey's five-year inflation outlook declined to 2.8% from 3%.
""Not only did year-ahead inflation expectations fall slightly to 4.2% in June from May's decade peak of 4.6%, consumers also believed that the price surges will mostly be temporary,"" Curtin said. ""The growing strength in the economy meant that nearly three-quarters of all consumers expected rising interest rates during the year ahead, the highest proportion since 2018 when the economy was near its last peak.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending paused in May as shortages hurt motor vehicle purchases, but the supply constraints and increased demand for services helped to lift prices, with the Federal Reserve's main inflation measure rising by the most in 29 years.
There was, however, some good news on inflation. Consumers this month perceived higher inflation to be temporary, a survey showed on Friday, aligning with the views of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Consumers' inflation expectations are key as they can influence households' behavior.
With at least 150 million Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which is allowing the economy to reopen and people to travel, dine out and engage in other activities that were restricted during the pandemic, consumer spending is expected to pick up in the coming months. Trillions of dollars in excess savings and rising household wealth due to gains in stock prices and home values are expected to provide a powerful tailwind. 
""Spending growth will shift to services from goods, and drive a strong economic recovery throughout the rest of 2021 and all of 2022,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""The biggest drags are higher prices for some goods and services and shortages due to production bottlenecks.""
The unchanged reading in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, followed an upwardly revised 0.9% jump in April, the Commerce Department said. Consumer spending was previously reported to have increased 0.5% in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would rise 0.4% in May. 
Motor vehicles and some household appliances are scarce because of supply bottlenecks stemming from the pandemic. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering motor vehicle production. Spending is also starting to shift back to the services part of the economy, which accounts for two-thirds of consumer spending, though the pace last month was insufficient to offset the drag from goods. 
Spending on services rose 0.7%, led by recreation, restaurants and hotels as well as housing and utilities. Spending on goods fell 1.3%, with outlays of long-lasting goods like motor vehicles tumbling 2.8%. Goods spending surged as the pandemic confined people to their homes. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.5% after advancing 0.7% in April. In the 12 months through May, the so-called core PCE price index shot up 3.4%, the largest gain since April 1992. The core PCE price index rose 3.1% on a year-on-year basis in April. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. Year-on-year inflation is accelerating in part as last spring's weak readings drop from the calculation. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record high as investors focused on the moderation in the monthly inflation reading. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.

NO RUNAWAY INFLATION
Though the so-called base effects likely peaked in May, inflation will probably remain high in the near term because of the supply constraints and worker shortages, which are boosting wage growth.
""While we foresee increased inflation stickiness, with core PCE inflation hovering around 3.0% in the second half (of the year), we don't foresee runaway inflation,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Consumers seem to agree. The University of Michigan consumer survey's one-year inflation expectation dropped to 4.2% in June from a decade-high 4.6% in May. The survey noted that ""consumers also believed that the price surges will mostly be temporary.""
The five-to-10-year inflation expectation fell to 2.8% this month from 3.0% in May. Fed officials put more emphasis on the five-to-10-year series.
Powell acknowledged this week that ""inflation has increased notably in recent months,"" but told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank ""will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation.""

When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.4% last month after rising 0.3% in April. Despite May's drop in the so-called real consumer spending, consumption is running higher than its pace in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for this quarter are around a 9% annualized rate, which would be an acceleration from the 6.4% pace logged in the first quarter. Economists believe the economy could achieve growth of at least 7% this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years. 
In addition to the supply squeeze, the ebbing boost from government stimulus checks likely restrained consumer spending last month. Transfer payments from the government dropped 11.7%. That resulted in personal income falling 2.0% after declining 13.1% in April. 

But there is ample fuel to drive spending. Wages gained 0.8% after rising 1.0% in April. The saving rate fell to a still-lofty 12.4% from 14.5% in April. Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic.
From July through December some households will receive income under the expanded Child Tax Credit program, which will soften the blow of an early termination of government-funded unemployment benefits in 26 states.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position with the world improved again in May, central bank figures showed on Friday, as the second consecutive monthly current account surplus shrank the rolling 12-month deficit to its smallest in more than 13 years.
Latin America's largest economy also attracted a combined $7.2 billion of foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows into its domestic stock and bond markets in the month, the figures showed.
The narrowing current account deficit and consistent capital inflows recently have helped propel a rapid rise in the exchange rate, with the dollar now trading below 5.00 reais for the first time in a year. 
Central bank figures show that Brazil posted a $3.8 billion current account surplus in May, slightly less than the $4 billion median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
That was largely thanks to a goods trade surplus of $8.1 billion in the month. Exports jumped 54.4% from the same month last year to a record $27.2 billion, outstripping a 31.9% increase in imports.
In the 12 months to May, the current account deficit totaled $8.4 billion, or 0.55% of gross domestic product, which was the smallest since February 2008. The deficit a year earlier stood at almost 4% of GDP.
On Thursday, the central bank raised its 2021 current account surplus forecast slightly to $3 billion from $2 billion. That would be the country's first annual surplus since 2007.
On the capital flows side, foreign direct investment in May totaled $1.2 billion, the central bank said. That was less than the $2.5 billion forecast in the Reuters poll.
Based on partial data already in for June, the central bank said it expects a current account surplus of $6.5 billion and FDI inflows of $2.5 billion in the month.
Investors plowed a net $6 billion into Brazilian stocks and bonds in May. Stocks saw a $2.9 billion inflow and debt securities attracted $3.1 billion, the central bank said.

On Thursday, the central bank more than doubled its 2021 portfolio inflows forecast to $21 billion from $10 billion. Net inflows in the 12 months through May totaled $41.8 billion, the central bank said.

Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
Retail sales for new vehicles in June are estimated to reach 1.1 million units, up 12.4% from last year, the companies said in a statement, lower than their expectations for 34% and 110% growth in May and April, respectively.
Total new-vehicle sales for June, including retail and non-retail, are projected to reach 1.3 million units, a 19.5% increase compared with the same period in 2020.
""The effect of fewer vehicles in inventory at dealerships is finally starting to have a material effect on aggregate industry sales volumes, as eager buyers struggle to find their desired new vehicle,"" said Thomas King, president of data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average transaction prices are expected to rise 14.9% to $40,206, the highest on record, while the average incentive spending per unit is expected to fall to $2,492 from $4,349 last year.

""Consumers are buying more expensive vehicles despite smaller discounts, which is dramatically increasing the profitability of those sales for both manufacturers and retailers,"" King added.
The total seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 15.8 million vehicles, up 2.6 million units from 2020 but 1.4 million units less than 2019.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian consumer inflation rose above 8% in the month to mid-June for the first time in almost five years, figures showed on Friday, driven by strong rises in gasoline and electricity prices.
The IPCA-15 annual price index rose to 8.1% from 7.3% a month earlier, statistics agency IBGE said, another sharp rise that shows why the central bank last week again raised interest rates aggressively to try and keep 2022 inflation expectations in check.
That was the highest level since October 2016, and just shy of the 8.2% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. A year ago, annual inflation was under 2%.
The 0.83% monthly rate of inflation in mid-June was virtually double the 0.44% the month before and also pretty much in line with a Reuters poll estimate of 0.86%. 
According to IBGE, prices rose in all nine groups of goods and services covered. 
Transport costs rose 1.35% in the month, accounting for just over a quarter of the overall rise, IBGE said. Within that segment, gasoline prices jumped 2.9% and are now up 46% over the last 12 months.
Housing costs rose 1.67% in the month, also accounting for around a quarter of the overall rise, led by a 3.9% surge in electricity prices, IBGE said.
The central bank's year-end inflation goal is 3.75% with a margin of error of 1.5 percentage point on either side, and its central target for next year is 3.50%. 

The central bank last week raised its benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points for a third time to 4.25%. Minutes of the meeting showed that policymakers discussed an even bigger increase and could make a bolder move in August.
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Thursday that many of the recent inflation surprises were transitory but had spread. He said the central bank would use all the tools at its disposal to ensure its 2022 inflation goal was met.

The CBI's measure of the volume of sales rose to +25 from May's +18, the highest since August 2018, while sales were reported as above seasonal norms - which excludes the effect of last year's lockdown - were the highest in over four years.
""This was the latest sign that the success of the vaccination programme is feeding through to stronger consumer confidence,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.

The CBI survey also showed stock levels in relation to expected sales sank to their lowest since records began in August 1983 and no improvement was expected next month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output likely fell in May while retail sales rose for a third straight month, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, highlighting the uneven recovery in the world's third largest economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The mixed data forecast comes as the government lifted a state of emergency in Tokyo and elsewhere this week to ease curbs on service-sector firms such as bars and restaurants, stoking worries about a resurgence of infections a little less than a month before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics.
While pent-up demand may underpin private consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, a global chip shortage may weigh on an export-led recovery, analysts say.
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry data out at 8:50 a.m. June 30 (2350 GMT June 29) is expected to show factory output fell 2.4% month-on-month in May, reversing from a 2.9% gain in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of 17 economists.
Factory activity is seen as a key driver of economic recovery, led by global demand for cars and electronics, but the chip shortage is likely to weigh on auto production and shipments in the coming months, analysts say.
""Overseas economies will continue to recover but cuts in car production will drag on, causing factory output to seesaw in June and July as well,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Japan's economy likely avoided falling into recession this quarter but an extension of emergency measures to stem a rise in coronavirus infections has dented the growth outlook, a separate Reuters poll showed.
Separate METI data due at 8:50 a.m. June 29 (2350 GMT June 28) is expected to show retail sales grew 7.9% in May, following a 12% increase in April, likely driven by pent-up demand from COVID-19 curbs and rises in gasoline prices.

While the job availability and jobless rate probably little changed at 1.08 and 2.9% respectively in May, housing starts are expected to have increased 8.3% in the year to May, which would mark a third straight month of annual gains.
Job data will be published at 8:30 a.m. June 29 (2330 GMT June 28) and housing starts data will be issued at 2 p.m. June 30 (0500 GMT).

GfK's consumer confidence index remained at -9 in June, unchanged from May and its highest since early March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a small rise to -7.
""Forecasts for rising retail price inflation could weaken consumer confidence quickly and that may account for the six-point dip in June in our measure for the wider economy in the coming year,"" GfK's client strategy director, Joe Staton, said.
The Bank of England warned on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2E019B that consumer price inflation was likely to temporarily exceed 3% later this year, after a bigger-than-expected jump to 2.1% in May.
Households in the GfK survey, which began in 1974, were more upbeat about the outlook for their personal and their willingness to make bigger purchases.

Britain's economy shrank almost 10% last year, its biggest decline in more than 300 years, but the impact was softened for many households by a job furlough scheme that paid 80% of their previous wages.
The number of workers on furlough has fallen sharply since the end of March, as shops and restaurants reopen, but around 1.5 million staff are yet to return to work. The programme ends on Sept. 30.

150,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 04:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street banks are poised to announce a deluge of dividend increases and stock buybacks after the Federal Reserve’s stress tests showed the industry built up a stockpile of cash during the pandemic.
Lenders can announce their plans for distributing capital after the market closes on June 28, and the industry’s strong results mean payouts may be the largest ever following the Fed’s annual exams. Early estimates indicate the six biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., could return more than $140 billion to shareholders.
The passing marks -- announced Thursday by the Fed -- mean firms are officially free from restrictions that the regulator put on dividend payments and share repurchases last year when Covid-19 was ravaging the economy. The banks’ solid showing also signals that the industry has grown much more comfortable with the exercises, which used to trigger anxiety and frustration across Wall Street.
In the Fed’s invented economic pain in this year’s exams, the biggest U.S. banks saw their aggregate common equity tier 1 capital ratio fall to a minimum of 10.6%, which is still more than twice the 4.5% minimum the agency demands.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). was -- as usual -- among the megabanks closest to the edge, with 8.8%.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. joined it at that level.
“Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has run three stress tests with several different hypothetical recessions and all have confirmed that the banking system is strongly positioned to support the ongoing recovery,” Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.
Banks rose in postmarket trading with Bank of America Corp.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman all gaining.

The hypothetical crisis envisioned in this year’s exams -- including a nearly 11% unemployment rate and the stock market tanking by more than half -- produced unique loss figures for each of the 23 lenders tested based on their differing books of business.
The banks use those numbers to assess how much capital they can afford to dole out to investors, a metric known as the stress capital buffer. Unlike in previous exams, banks don’t need the Fed to sign-off on their capital plans, as long as each lender stays above its established capital minimum.
If a bank falls below its required stress capital buffer at any point in the year following the stress tests, the Fed can hit it with sanctions, including restrictions on capital distributions and bonus payments.
Even before the results were released, Wall Street lobbyists were defending the industry’s plans to boost payouts to shareholders. Kevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum in Washington, argued this week that increased dividends and buybacks are “a promising sign for the economy.”
Such comments aren’t likely to impress Senator Elizabeth Warren and other progressive lawmakers. The Massachusetts Democrat has repeatedly criticized buybacks, labeling them a form of market manipulation that enriches executives. Banks should instead use their excess capital to invest in their businesses and their employees, she’s argued.

(Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in several Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states ticked up in June, driven by demand for durable goods such as fabricated metals and machinery, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said on Thursday.
The Kansas City Fed's monthly survey of manufacturing activity across its district showed its composite index rose to 27 in June from 26 in May, edging back toward April's record-high level. Meanwhile, the bank's measure of production in the district - which covers Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming and parts of Missouri and New Mexico - declined to 30 from 32, also after reaching a record high in April.
""Manufacturers reported that stronger demand and growth were primary factors supporting business investment and capital spending for the remainder of 2021,"" the survey said. ""On the other hand, manufacturers also reported the lack of availability of parts and employees were primary factors restraining business investment and capital spending for the rest of 2021.""
Manufacturing employment strengthened in the district and price pressures eased a touch but remained near historically high levels.
The bank's measure of the number of employees rose to 26 in June from 20 a month earlier. The gauge of prices paid for materials pulled back to 79 from May's record-high 86, and the index for prices received for finished products fell to 48 from 51.
Looking ahead, the bank's future composite index reached a new survey record high, increasing from 33 to 37 in June.
Factories have struggled to keep up with demand in recent months as the U.S. economy shows signs of emerging from the COVID-19 recession and consumers flush with cash from recent stimulus programs ramp up spending.
The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that orders for durable goods rose 2.3% in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as the labor market steadily recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic amid a reopening economy, but a dearth of willing workers could hinder faster job growth in the near term.
The economy appears to be at cruising speed more than half way through the second quarter, with other data on Thursday showing strong growth in business spending on equipment in May. While the goods trade deficit widened, that was because of an increase in imports as businesses desperately try to keep up with robust demand. Retailers' warehouses are almost bare.
""It looks like the economy continues to astound us with the speed and strength of the recovery from what is turning out to be the quickest recession in history,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 411,000 for the week ended June 19, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 6,000 more applications received than previously reported. The first increase since late April was blamed by economists on volatility in the aftermath of the May 31 Memorial Day holiday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 380,000 applications for the latest week. There was a surge in claims in Pennsylvania last week. The state upgraded its filing system this month and the transition could have caused a backlog. There were sizeable declines in California, Florida and Illinois.
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, but are still above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. Despite last week's modest decline, layoffs are trending lower, with companies scrambling to fill a record 9.8 million job openings.
The claims data could become volatile in the weeks ahead as 26 states with mostly Republican governors pull out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly check, which businesses complained were encouraging the jobless to stay at home. The early termination started on June 5 and will run through July 31. 
Louisiana is the only state with a Democratic governor to terminate federal benefits. For the rest of the country, these benefits will lapse on Sept. 6. There is no evidence so far of a surge in job searches in the 12 states that have already ended the federal benefits. 
""The fits and starts in the labor market should be expected and imply that a premature withdrawal of support for the unemployed would be a policy error that will reduce overall economic activity,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York.
At least 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing the economy to begin reopening. A shortage of childcare facilities is keeping some parents, mostly women, outside the labor force. Some people also are hesitant to return to work out of fear of contracting the virus. Pandemic-related retirements and transitions into new careers are factors as well.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that he believed the economy would see strong job creation in the fall.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes hitting all-time highs. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
STRONG GROWTH
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 144,000 to 3.390 million in the week ending June 12. At least 14.8 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the first week of June, compared to 31.3 million during the same period in 2020.
In addition to the brightening public health situation, trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from the government are underpinning the economy. In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.9% in May after gaining 1.0% in April. 
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. But supply bottlenecks could be slowing momentum.
Still, a strong rebound in corporate profits and excess savings accumulated by households should allow factories to weather the production and labor supply constraints. Profits from current production increased $55.2 billion in the first quarter after decreasing $31.4 billion the fourth quarter.
""We expect strong revenues this year while margins remain well-supported as stronger productivity growth and increased pricing power offset higher labor costs,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The summer will be hot for the U.S. economy.""
Strong demand and tight supply are forcing businesses to turn to imports, boosting the trade deficit. In a third report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 2.8% to $88.1 billion in May. While inventories at wholesalers rose 1.1%, stocks at retailers dropped 0.8%. That mostly reflected a 5.3% decline in inventories of motor vehicles. Auto production has been hampered by a global semiconductor shortage.

The swelling goods trade deficit and falling retail inventories did little to change economists' robust GDP growth expectations for this quarter, with estimates around a 10% annualized rate. The Commerce Department confirmed in a fourth report that economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, thanks to the massive fiscal stimulus. 
The economy grew at a 6.4% rate last quarter, unrevised from the estimate published in May. That followed a 4.3% pace of expansion in the fourth quarter.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 2.7% in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.6%. Orders increased 16.3% year-on-year in May.
Business investment on equipment has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last three quarters thanks to a shift in demand towards goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and massive fiscal stimulus to ease the blow to the economy from the public health crisis.
Though demand is starting to revert back to services as vaccinations allow for broader economic re-engagement, appetite for goods remains healthy. But manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is experiencing shortages of labor and raw materials, causing shortages that are boosting prices. 
Last month, core capital goods orders were held down by machinery and fabricated metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 1.3%.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.9% after advancing 1.0% in April. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
With households sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings, demand booming and inventories low, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rebounded 2.3% in May after falling 0.8% in April. They were lifted by a 7.6% rise in orders for transportation equipment.
Orders for civilian aircraft increased 27.4%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 73 aircraft order compared to only 25 aircraft in April. 

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 2.1% in May after decreasing 8.1% in April. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products has also been impacted.

Weekly unemployment claims have fallen considerably since the beginning of the year as health concerns abate and businesses like restaurants return to full capacity. Still, the initial claims remain significantly higher than they were before Covid-19 and many employers say they are having trouble finding workers.
Federal Reserve officials are focused on achieving maximum employment, which they define as a “broad and inclusive goal.” In a congressional hearing Tuesday, Chair Jerome Powell said that the labor market has a long way to go and needs continued support.
“The very quick job gains of the early recovery essentially involved going back to your old job,” Powell said. “Now it’s actually finding new jobs and that’s a that’s a matching function that that is more labor intensive and time consuming.”

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil rose in June to a seven-month high, a survey indicated on Thursday, a third consecutive increase as households looked through the current wave of COVID-19 to brighter economic prospects in the coming months.

""For the first time since July last year, intentions to buy durable goods has risen more sharply, which seems related to greater optimism regarding the labor market in the coming months,"" said survey coordinator Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
The index remains below its pre-pandemic level of 87.8 in February last year, however. 

The current situation index rose 2.9 points to 71.6, while the expectations index jumped 5.9 points to 88.3, FGV said.

EDC's Trade Confidence Index jumped 19% from end-2020 to mid-2021, the largest 6-month increase since the survey began in 1999, the agency said. The recovery appears to be broad-based across all regions of the country, it said.
""It's just extraordinary that this kind of rush is happening. It's really telling us that everybody is arming themselves for what's coming in the second half of this year,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at EDC. 
Canada's economy - like those of many of its global peers - is set to boom in the second half of 2021, as widespread public vaccinations allow businesses to reopen and consumers begin to dip into their pandemic savings. 
A strong rebound south of the border is also expected to help. A growing share of companies reported orders from customers in the United States, Canada's largest trading partner, had improved in the past six months, EDC said. 
And 65% of respondents said they are planning to export to new markets, with the UK and Australia top destinations. Exports account for about a third of Canada's gross domestic product.

But concerns remain, notably the strong Canadian dollar - which hit a six-year high earlier this month - and mounting worries over trade protectionism, especially U.S. President Joe Biden's ""Buy American"" plan and fraught China-Canada relations.
The survey was conducted between April and June, spanning a period that saw fresh lockdowns amid a harsh third wave of COVID-19 infections followed by the early stages of reopening.

Germany's central bank raised its growth forecasts earlier this month and now expects the economy to reach pre-pandemic levels as soon as next quarter and grow by 3.7% this year and 5.2% next year.
German authorities have loosened COVID-19 restrictions in light of falling infections and higher vaccination numbers.
The bounce-back from lockdown is driving the largest upward leap in retail conditions seen since German reunification more than three decades ago, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Despite concerns about supply bottlenecks, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Tuesday a global chip shortage that is hitting carmakers will not impact its forecasts for 2021 operating profit margins.
""Fortunately, been we have able to notably limit the negative impact on our customers and thus on delivery figures so far, for example by selling off inventories and other measures,"" a spokesperson for the company said.
Ifo's Wohlrabe said the economy would grow by 1.3% in the second quarter, and by a further 3.6% in the following quarter, with bottlenecks and rising input costs pushing many companies to raise prices.
Even in hospitality, among the sectors worst-hit by lockdown, where conditions were still bad, there was growing optimism, he added.
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank Group, said the economy is ""currently in excellent shape"".

""However, the pandemic is still not completely eliminated as an economic stumbling block. The Delta variant worries not only virologists but also economists,"" he added.
The share of COVID-19 infections caused by the more easily transmitted Delta variant of the coronavirus has doubled in Germany in a week and is likely to gain more traction over other variants, the Robert Koch Institute public health agency said on Wednesday.

Investing.com -- German business confidence hit its highest level since the end of 2018 in June. as the gradual relaxation of pandemic restrictions supported both current activity and expectations for the future.Ifo, the Munich-based think-tank, said its closely-watched business climate index rose to 104.0, from 102.9 in May. Analysts had expected a more modest increase to 103.6. Ifo economists said that conditions in the retail sector were improving at their fastest rate since reunification back in 1990 - a reflection of the lifting of restrictions on many German retailers as the incidence of Covid-19 in Europe's largest economy receded.
Germany's economy is typically the engine of growth for the broader Eurozone economy, which is showing signs of an increasingly broad and robust recovery as vaccination rates improve.. The IHS Markit composite PMI for the Eurozone, a real-time proxy for economic growth, hit a record high in June, according to preliminary estimates released on Wednesday.
""The reopening of the economy on the back of a still accelerating vaccination rollout has clearly boosted optimism and seems to be outweighing any concerns stemming from supply chain disruptions,"" ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said in a note to clients. ""The potential spillovers from US fiscal stimulus, the implementation of the European Recovery Fund in the second half of the year, a rebound in the construction sector and the fact that the manufacturing sector still has not reached pre-crisis levels, all signal that the only way is up for the German economy.""
Earlier Thursday, the Eurozone's second-largest economy France had reported a similar rise in its INSEE business confidence index to 107. That rise was, however, less sharp than forecast. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a one-year low in May as the median price of newly built houses soared amid expensive raw materials, including framing lumber.
The second straight monthly decline in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was the latest indication that the tailwind from the COVID-19 pandemic could be subsiding. Single-family housing benefited from a migration from cities as millions of Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling during the pandemic.
""New home sales along with existing home sales suggest home buying activity is past its peak,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""We don't know what is going to happen when the stay-at-home economy shifts to going back to the office.""
New home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 769,000 units last month, the lowest level since May 2020. April's sales pace was revised down to 817,000 units from the previously reported 863,000 units. 
New home sales are considered a leading housing market indicator as they are recorded when contracts are signed. Last month's decline was concentrated in the populous South, where sales tumbled 14.5%. Sales, however, rose in the Northeast and West. They were unchanged in the Midwest.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for a small share of U.S. home sales, would be at a rate of 870,000 units in May. 
New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales rose 9.2% on a year-on-year basis in May. The median new house price jumped 18.1% from a year earlier to $374,400 in May. 
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
INVENTORY SQUEEZE
The market for new homes is being supported by a dearth of previously owned houses. At least 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing the economy to begin reopening and companies to recall workers back to offices. A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes fell for a fourth straight month in May.
Builders have failed to take advantage of the inventory squeeze because of shortages of lumber and other raw materials. Exorbitant prices for raw materials are significantly raising the prices of newly built homes. At the same time, the supply gap is boosting competition for available homes, threatening to sideline some first-time buyers from the market. 
The supply-side constraints were also underscored by a separate survey from data firm IHS Markit on Wednesday showing manufacturers struggling to source raw materials this month.

New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 2% of transactions last month.
There were 330,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 315,000 in April. At May's sales pace it would take 5.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.6 months in April. About 76% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

160,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June, but manufacturers are still struggling to secure raw materials and qualified workers, substantially raising prices for both businesses and consumers.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Wednesday its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI rose to a reading of 62.6 this month. That was the highest since the survey was expanded to cover all manufacturing industries in October 2009 and followed a final reading of 62.1 in May. 
The survey was conducted between June 10 and June 22. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 61.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
The strength in manufacturing bolsters economists' expectations for double-digit growth in the second quarter. Demand shifted to goods from services as the COVID-19 pandemic kept Americans at home and is remaining robust even as vaccinations and trillions of dollars in relief money from the government allow the economy to reopen more broadly. 
But supply is struggling to cope with the demand surge, leading to huge backlogs of uncompleted work as well as sky-rocketing prices for raw materials and finished products, which are feeding into higher inflation.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that inflation has ""increased notably in recent months,"" which he attributed in part to the supply bottlenecks and the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen. Powell expressed optimism that inflation will subside ""as these transitory supply effects abate.""
IHS Markit said ""average supplier delivery times lengthened to the greatest extent on record."" 
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers rose to the highest level since the series started. It said ""firms raised their selling prices at a quicker rate in an effort to pass on these higher costs."" 
The survey's new orders measure slipped, noting also that ""firms struggled to find staff or entice workers back to employment.""
Though IHS Markit's flash services sector PMI dropped to 64.8 from a reading of 70.4 in May, it was still the second highest since data collection began in October 2009.
Businesses in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, worried about rising inflation and the inability to find qualified labor and people willing to work. 

There are a record 9.3 million job openings. About 9.3 million people are classified as officially unemployed. 
With services activity moderating, overall business activity cooled this month. The survey's flash composite PMI output index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 63.9 from a final reading of 68.7 in May.

161,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 10:43AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit increased to a 14-year high in the first quarter as an acceleration in economic growth drew in imports, and the gap could remain wide, with the United States leading the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 11.8% to $195.7 billion last quarter. That was the largest shortfall since the first quarter of 2007.
Data for the fourth quarter was revised to show a $175.1 billion gap, instead of $188.5 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap widening to $206.8 billion in the January-March quarter.
The current account gap represented 3.5% of gross domestic product last quarter. That was up from 3.3% in the fourth quarter and the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel.
The wider deficit is likely not an issue for the United States because of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter. Growth this year is expected to top 7%. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Imports of goods jumped $39.9 billion to a record $677.0 billion in the first quarter. Vaccinations against COVID-19 and trillions of dollars in pandemic relief are allowing for a greater reopening of the economy, unleashing pent-up demand, which is being partially satiated with imports. 
Exports of goods rose $24.5 billion to $408.6 billion last quarter. The increases in both exports and imports reflected increases in nearly all major categories, led by industrial supplies and materials, primarily petroleum and products.
Imports of services increased $1.8 billion to $120.2 billion, mostly reflecting a rise in sea freight transport. Exports of services increased $1.1 billion to $175.9 billion, led by personal travel.
Primary income receipts increased $9.6 billion to $261.7 billion, lifted by a rise in direct investment income, mostly earnings. Payments of primary income increased $13.5 billion to
$211.4 billion, driven by gains in earnings and portfolio

investment income, mostly interest on long-term debt securities.
Secondary income receipts rose $1.6 billion to $42.6 billion. They were boosted by increase in general government transfers, primarily public sector fines and penalties.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales plunged in April and May, as shops and other businesses were shuttered amid a third wave of COVID-19 infections, Statistics Canada data showed on Wednesday.
Retail trade fell 5.7% in April, the sharpest decline in a year, missing analyst forecasts of a 5.0% drop. In a preliminary estimate, Statscan said May retail sales likely fell by 3.2% as store closures dragged on.
""April showers brought no May flowers for Canadian retailers this year,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
Statscan said that 5.0% of retailers were closed at some point in April. The average length of the closure was one day, it said, citing respondent feedback. 
Sales decreased in nine of the 11 subsectors, while core sales, which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicles, were down 7.6% in April.
Clothing and accessory store sales fell 28.6%, with sales at building material and garden equipment stores falling for the first time in nine months, by 10.4%.
""These results continue to suggest that the Bank of Canada is too optimistic on the growth outlook for the second quarter, even if there is a solid rebound occurring now in June,"" Mendes said.

The central bank said in April that it expects Canada's economy to grow 6.5% in 2021 and signaled interest rates could begin to rise in the second half of 2022.
The Canadian dollar held on to earlier gains after the data, trading up 0.3% at 1.2271 to the greenback, or 81.49 U.S. cents.

LONDON (Reuters) -Inflation pressures faced by British firms hit record levels this month, and growth in the private sector cooled only slightly from an all-time high in May when coronavirus restrictions were lifted, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The preliminary reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) pointed to one of the strongest monthly improvements in business activity since 1998, with a reading of 61.7 - not far off May's unprecedented 62.9.
Input costs matched a previous record increase from June 2008 and prices charged by firms rose by the largest amount since these records began in 1999, as disruption to supply chains caused a scramble for components.
Inflation faced by consumers could now have a lot further to rise after breaking above the Bank of England's 2% target last month, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The BoE is not expected to change monetary policy when it announces the outcome of its June policy meeting on Thursday but investors are waiting to hear whether it is sticking to its view that the rise in inflation is likely to prove transient.
Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said the PMI showed the private sector was struggling to keep up with the vaccine-driven rebound in demand.
""Today's data will strengthen the conviction of those on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe that extraordinary levels of policy support are no longer warranted,"" he said.
But Samuel Tombs, at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said an expected rise in unemployment as the government's job protection scheme winds down over the next three months, and an easing of COVID-19 bottleneck pressures on prices, meant the BoE would probably not be swayed by short-term inflation signals.
BREXIT EFFECT
Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed bars, restaurants and other hospitality firms in England to resume indoor service in mid-May. But last week he delayed the removal of the last social-distancing rules after COVID-19 cases rose again.
There were signs in the PMI survey that the rebound might be slowing as new orders cooled and manufacturers also felt the effects of Brexit after Britain left the European Union's single market on Jan. 1.
Tombs said British manufacturers' export orders undershot those of their euro zone peers for the sixth consecutive month, and by a larger margin than in May.
The PMI survey showed hiring rose by a record amount in June but many firms were unable to operate at full capacity because of staff shortages. The lack of candidates also pushed up wages.
Williamson said that could add to worries that the recent spike in inflation will last longer than the BoE has suggested.

The PMI for the services sector dipped to 61.7 in June from 62.9 in May. The index for the smaller manufacturing sector fell to 64.2 from 65.6.
Sentiment about the economic outlook, while still positive, fell to its lowest in five months.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years in June as the easing of lockdown measures unleashed pent-up demand and drove a boom in the dominant services sector but also led to soaring price pressures, a survey found.
When the coronavirus was spreading rapidly, governments imposed strict restrictions, encouraging citizens to stay at home and forcing much of the service industry to close.
But after a slow start the region's vaccination drive is picking up pace and the burden on health services has eased, allowing some restrictions placed on services firms - which were already adapting to new operating conditions - to be lifted.
That led to a jump in IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, to 59.2 from 57.1, its highest reading since June 2006. It was ahead of the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and a Reuters poll estimate for 58.8.
""Accelerated vaccine rollouts and falling case numbers are allowing restrictions to be eased and consumers to feel more confident,"" said Willem Sels, chief investment officer, Private Banking and Wealth Management at HSBC. 
""Services, and consumption in particular, are seeing strong momentum and are now the number one engine of European economic growth.""
A flash services PMI bounced to 58.0 from 55.2, its highest since January 2018 and above the 57.8 Reuters poll prediction. Suggesting that momentum would continue, the new business index climbed to a near 14-year high of 57.7 from 56.6.
The latest easing of restrictions in Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies and the only ones to report flash PMIs, led to a boom in services there as well.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, growth in the private sector cooled only slightly from an all-time high in May when more coronavirus restrictions were lifted.
PRICING PRESSURES
The expansion in euro zone manufacturing activity meanwhile matched May's blistering record pace, with the June flash PMI estimate holding steady from May's final reading of 63.1, confounding the Reuters poll estimate for a dip to 62.1. 
An index measuring output which feeds into the Composite PMI nudged up to 62.4 from 62.2.
But supply side disruptions and huge demand have made it a sellers' market for the raw materials factories need. The manufacturing input prices index rose to 88.0 from 87.1, the highest since the survey began in June 1997.
""Inflation pressures continued to mount as input prices soared in June,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""The problem with these surveys is that they measure the number of businesses that indicate higher prices, not the extent of it. In this reopening phase, that might overstate expectations of the pace of inflation.""

The European Central Bank is likely to look through those inflationary pressures and will keep monetary policy loose this year to offer support to the economy, a Reuters poll found earlier this month. [ECILT/EU]
Amid hopes the worst of the pandemic is behind the bloc, overall optimism rose to its highest since IHS Markit began collecting the data in July 2012. The composite future output index rose to 71.6 from 70.6.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's economy will grow substantially faster than previously expected this year, as it bounces back from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government said on Wednesday. 
The hit to Sweden's economy from the pandemic has turned out to be milder than first feared in 2020, when GDP shrank 2.8%.
The recovery has also been quicker, despite concerns over shortages of input goods and transport bottlenecks that have hit the export sector.
""We can revise up growth for this year,"" Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference. ""We had the strongest growth in the Nordic region in the first quarter. The labour market is strengthening and government finances are improving.""
However, Andersson warned that the current political uncertainty could damage prospects. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven lost a vote of no-confidence in parliament on Monday and has a week to decide whether to resign or call a snap election.
""It is clear that political uncertainty can have an adverse effect,"" Andersson said. ""It is clear that there is a risk.""
The centre-left and centre-right blocs in parliament are evenly balanced with no clear alternative to Lofven's minority coalition of the Social Democrats and Greens. Opinion polls suggest little would be changed by a new election.
VOLUNTARY MEASURES
Sweden's strong economic performance through the pandemic has, in part, been due to a response based more on voluntary measures focused on social distancing, than the kind of strict lockdowns adopted across much of the continent. 
But its heavy reliance on industry, with a smaller services sector, has also helped.
The government said gross domestic product would expand 4.7% in 2021 against 3.2% growth predicted in the previous forecast, made in April. Andersson said she did not see signs of overheating.
In 2022, growth is seen slowing to 2.9%, versus a previous forecast of 3.8% growth as a result of the quicker recovery this year.
In a separate forecast, the National Institute of Economic Research, a leading think-tank, said it saw growth this year of 4.4%.
The government has pumped more than 400 billion crowns ($47.19 billion) into the economy in measures such as furlough schemes to see it through the pandemic.
However, Sweden's finances remain strong with debt expected to be around 38% of GDP this year against around 90% across the European Union.

The government's forecast showed public finances running a deficit of 2.2% of GDP this year, compared with the previous forecast of a deficit of 4.5%. Finances should be balanced again by next year, the government said.

Activity for the private sector as a whole contracted for a second straight month due to the weaker reading for manufacturing and continued shrinking in the services sector, clouding the outlook for second-quarter economic growth in the country.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.5 in June from a final 53.0 in the previous month, largely due to a sharp decline in output.
Output shrank at the quickest rate since last November, the PMI survey showed, underscoring the pressure Japanese firms were facing from restrictions put in place in response to the health crisis.
""Flash PMI data signalled a quicker deterioration in business activity,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Manufacturers faced disruptions to operating conditions from ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and supply chain pressures, according to Bhatti.
Overall orders and export orders expanded, but at a weaker pace than in the previous month, the survey showed.
But manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead stayed largely intact on hopes that Japan's delayed vaccine roll-out would lead to an easing of coronavirus restrictions and fuel an economic recovery.
The survey also highlighted severe conditions in the services sector, which saw activity contract for the 17th straight month, though at a slightly slower pace.

That was the highest level since July 2016, shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union, and the first time the index was in positive territory since 2018.
""This surge in employers' confidence in the UK economy is remarkable,"" Neil Carberry, REC chief executive, said.
""However, we are seeing labour and skills shortages across the economy right now, which the pandemic has made worse. These could threaten to slow down the recovery if not addressed quickly,"" he said. Better access to training was needed, as was support for staff wanting to change sectors, he added.
Britain's economy has shown signs of a strong recovery from its slump of nearly 10% in 2020, although the Bank of England thinks it will only regain its pre-pandemic size in the final quarter of this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell for a fourth straight month in May as record-high prices amid low inventory frustrated potential buyers, a trend that could persist for a while, with builders unable to deliver more houses because of expensive lumber.
The decline in sales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday was concentrated in the single-family housing segment, which benefited from a migration from cities as millions of Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sales are retreating back to their pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the tailwind from the virus is diminishing. 
""It's becoming clear that record-high price growth and an enduring shortage of available homes are beginning to hinder would-be homebuyers,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""Sales volume continues to struggle to regain the momentum it built late last year.""
Existing home sales dropped 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.80 million units last month. Sales fell in the Northeast, West and the densely populated South. They, however, rose in the Midwest, which is generally considered as having more affordable homes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall to a rate of 5.72 million units in May. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 44.6% on a year-on-year basis. The annual increase was, however, distorted by the plunge in sales in May 2020, when the economy was reeling from mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
The median existing house price accelerated a record 23.6% from a year ago to an all-time high of $350,300 in May, with sales remaining skewed towards bigger and more expensive homes.
U.S. stocks were mostly higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
BIDDING WARS 
Single-family home sales, the largest segment of the housing market, dropped 1.0% to a pace of 5.08 million units, the lowest since last June. Sales of multi-family homes were unchanged, though they continue to rebound as more people return to cities.
At least 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing the economy to begin reopening and companies to recall workers back to offices.
""The pandemic-driven tailwind home sales have enjoyed appears to be lessening,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Much of the speculation about how many workers would work remotely indefinitely appear to have been greatly exaggerated."" 
Housing supply was already tight before the pandemic. With the public health situation brightening, there is cautious optimism that inventory will improve. Some homeowners were reluctant to list their homes because of fear of contracting the virus from potential buyers touring their properties. Some elderly Americans likely delayed downsizing due to the pandemic.
Economists are also hopeful that higher prices will entice some owners to put their homes on the market.
There were 1.23 million previously owned homes available for sale in May, up 7.0% from April and down 20.6% from one year ago. While the monthly improvement in inventory is welcome, the supply gap could take a long time to close.
The pandemic has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials. Though lumber prices have eased from recent record highs, they remain exorbitant, limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes. The government last week reported a moderate rebound in homebuilding in May and a drop in permits.
""A lack of availability and affordability concerns will likely be headwinds until supply constraints ease,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
That has led some economists to expect that housing would be a drag on gross domestic product growth in the second quarter after hefty contributions since the third quarter of 2020.
At May's sales pace, it would take 2.5 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.6 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Properties typically remained on the market for only 17 days in May, down from 26 days a year ago. 
There are widespread bidding wars, with institutional buyers reported to be outbidding other buyers. First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in May, down from 34% a year ago.

All-cash sales made up 23% of transactions, up from 17% last May.
Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the price surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. But the rapidly rising prices could feed inflation.

The CBI's orders balance - measuring the difference between the proportion of employers who say order levels are above or below normal - hit +19 in June from +17 in May, its highest since 1988.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of +18.
""Encouragingly, this performance is reflected in the majority of manufacturing sub-sectors and looks set to continue in the coming quarter,"" Anna Leach, the CBI's deputy chief economist, said.

""However, supply shortages continue to bite, and firms expect that to push through into prices in the months ahead.""
The survey's price balance rose to +46 from +38 in May, the highest since 1982 and well above its average of +3.

rose by 0.8% compared with a month before, the biggest rise for the time of year since 2015, as available housing remains in short supply, property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said on Monday.
The increase is less than the 1.8% recorded a month earlier but still takes asking prices 7.5% above their level in early March 2020, before Britain went into its first COVID lockdown.
""Buyer demand remains very strong, though with an all-time low in the number of properties available for sale ... and new stock at higher-than-ever average prices, there are early signs of a slowing in the frenetic pace,"" Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said.
Rightmove, which says it advertises 95% of homes for sale in Britain, collected the data between May 9 and June 12.
British house prices surged last year despite the pandemic as many richer households sought more space to work from home, and the government cut property purchase taxes to reverse an initial slump in sales early in the pandemic.
June is the last month when the full stamp duty tax break applies, before it is wholly phased out in October.
Britain's official measure of house prices, based on completed transactions, showed prices in the year to April rose 8.9%, after a 9.9% increase for the year to March.
Rightmove said the most expensive homes were seeing the biggest percentage increases in asking prices. Typically these were detached houses with at least four bedrooms whose buyers were less stretched for cash.
London has seen weaker prices and demand than other parts of Britain, due to a fall in the number of foreign buyers and less need for many high-paid workers to commute to city-centre jobs.

Separate figures from property data company LonRes showed prices were 1.9% lower in expensive parts of the capital than a year ago. The number of new listings in central London was 33% higher in May than two years before. 
""Demand is not outstripping supply in most areas of prime London. Estate agents' windows have, for the most part, stayed well stocked, meaning prices have not seen the rapid growth experienced in other parts of the country,"" LonRes's head of research, Marcus Dixon, said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales fell unexpectedly last month as a lifting of lockdown restrictions encouraged spending in restaurants rather than shops, according to official data.
Retail sales fell 1.4% between April and May, the Office for National Statistics said.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an 1.6% month-on-month increase in retail sales volumes for May. Only three of 19 forecasts showed a fall.
Food stores suffered the biggest hit, with a 5.7% drop in sales. Separately on Friday supermarket chain Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Britain's biggest retailer, reported a sharp slowdown in underlying UK sales growth in its first quarter.
""Anecdotal evidence suggests the easing of hospitality restrictions had an impact on sales as people returned to eating and drinking at locations such as restaurants and bars,"" the ONS said.
Most economists said the weak retail sales data was not necessarily suggestive of weaker consumer spending as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, since hospitality businesses have reported booming trade.
But Samuel Tombs, at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said more recent payment card data suggested that the surge in consumer spending could be losing steam.
""Households' real disposable income looks set to fall in Q4, as the end of the furlough scheme reduces employment and inflation rises to match wage growth,"" he said.
The rapid advance of the ""delta"" variant of COVID-19, despite Britain's swift roll-out of vaccines, could also crimp household spending in the weeks ahead.
An end to lockdown in England that had been scheduled for Monday has been delayed for four weeks.
In annual terms, retail sales were 24.6% higher than May last year, short of the median expectation for a 29.0% increase.
Household good stores bucked the wider decline with month-on-month growth of 9.0%, which the ONS linked to spending on outdoor goods.

Earlier this week, motoring and outdoor goods store Halfords said it had been doing a roaring trade in bicycles.

Other data next week is expected to show the Tokyo-area consumer price index (CPI) fell again in June as slow consumer demand amid the coronavirus pandemic caused a further easing of prices.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey was expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rose to plus 15 from plus 5 in March, the poll of 16 economists showed.
An increase would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement.
""Large manufacturers are expected to see corporate profits improve as the yen remains on a depreciating trend, and are supported by steadily increasing conditions in exports due to a recovery in overseas economies,"" analysts at the Japan Research Institute wrote.
The mood among big non-manufacturers was also likely to improve, turning positive for the first time since the first quarter of last year, the poll showed.
But big non-manufacturers' sentiment was still expected to remain more subdued than that of manufacturers, likely coming in at plus 3 from minus 1 in March.
The forecasts suggested firms are shaking off more of the drag from the coronavirus pandemic, but it continues to weigh heavily on non-manufacturers.
After contracting in January-March, Japan's economy is expected to grow at a much slower pace than other major economies such as the United States in the second quarter, in part due to anti-virus measures and a late vaccine rollout.
For the three months ahead, big manufacturers' optimism was expected to improve at a slower pace, likely rising to plus 18, the poll showed.
The big non-manufacturers' outlook index was seen rising to plus 8, it showed.
Big firms will likely raise their capital spending plans by 7.2% for the current fiscal year as the outlook improves.
The BOJ will announce the tankan quarterly survey results at 8:50 a.m. on July 1.

The BOJ on Friday maintained its massive stimulus, while it also said it will launch a new scheme to encourage financial institutions to boost lending and investment for fighting climate change.
Separate data from the internal ministry due out on June 25 is expected to show Tokyo-area core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include oil products, fell 0.1% in June from a year earlier, the poll found.

174,"<span>Jun 17, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s inflation edged into positive territory for the first time in 14 months as rising commodity costs fed higher gasoline prices at the pump, according to data that comes before a central bank policy decision later today.
Consumer prices excluding fresh food ticked up 0.1% compared with a year earlier, lifted by a 20% jump in gas prices, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Economists had predicted flat prices overall.
While even the smallest uptick in inflation is likely to be seen positively by the Bank of Japan, price momentum is still far more subdued than in the U.S. and other countries where central banks are starting to project possible rate increases. The BOJ forecasts inflation staying below its 2% target for the foreseeable future, meaning its main stimulus will probably stay in place for years to come.

“Looking ahead, we expect core inflation (excluding fresh food) to come back to 0% year on year in June, assuming the state of emergency ends on June 20 as scheduled. Beyond that, pent-up demand and higher energy prices could lift core inflation to 0.2% in 3Q.”

The index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes in 11 major Canadian markets, rose 2.8% on the month in May, led by strong month-over-month gains in the Ottawa-Gatineau capital region, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in Hamilton, Ontario.
""It was a third consecutive month in which all 11 markets of the composite index were up from the month before,"" said Daren King, an economist at National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), in a note.
On an annual basis, the Teranet index was up 13.7% from a year earlier, the 10th consecutive acceleration and the strongest 12-month gain since July 2017. 
Halifax led the year-over-year gains, up 29.9%, followed by Hamilton at 25.5% and Ottawa-Gatineau at 22.8%.
Housing price gains in smaller cities outside Toronto and its immediate suburbs again outpaced the major urban centers, with Barrie, Ontario leading the pack, up 31.4%.
On a month-over-month basis, prices rose 4.9% in Ottawa-Gatineau, 4.3% in Halifax and 3.7% in Hamilton.

The Teranet index measures price gains based on the change between the two most recent sales of properties that have been sold at least twice.

A breakdown of the figures showed that secondary activities, which include manufacturing, were up by 36.4% from May 2020. Meanwhile tertiary activities, which encompass the service sector, expanded by 19.8% over the same period.
If the preliminary estimate is confirmed, May's activity was only about 0.4% behind the level reached in February 2020, the last full month before pandemic-related restrictions began to hit the economy, according to an index compiled by INEGI.
INEGI noted that April's data had been revised up to show growth of some 21.6% from the same month in 2020, one percentage point higher than the previous estimate.
The agency also said the preliminary figures pointed to month-on-month economic growth of 0.5% between April and May.

The coronavirus pandemic hit the Mexican economy hard last year, reducing gross domestic product by some 8.5%. In 2021, the finance ministry says the economy could grow by 6.5%, recouping much of the ground lost.
Robust export activity has helped to drive the recovery, which has benefited from massive economic stimulus spending in the United States, Mexico's top trade partner.

(Reuters) - A gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased for the third consecutive month in May, suggesting the economy continued to recover from the recession caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators (LEI) rose 1.3% last month to 114.5, topping its previous peak reached in January 2020. That was in line with economists' expectations, according to a Reuters poll.
""Strengths among the leading indicators were widespread, with initial claims for unemployment insurance making the largest positive contribution to the index; housing permits made this month’s only negative contribution,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at The Conference Board in Washington. 

The LEI's coincident index, a measure of current economic conditions, rose for the third consecutive month by 0.4% in May after increasing 0.3% in April.

(Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region declined for the second consecutive month in June after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 30.7 from 31.5 in May. That was just shy of economists' expectations for a reading of 31.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out July 1.
Factories have struggled to keep up with demand in recent months as the economy shows signs of emerging from the COVID-19 recession and consumers flush with cash from recent stimulus programs ramp up spending. In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since April 1973.

The bank's employment index increased to 30.7 from 19.3 in May. 
Additionally, the price paid index rose for the second consecutive month to 80.7 from 76.8 in the month prior, its highest reading since June 1979.

Initial claims in regular state programs increased by 37,000 to 412,000 in the week ended June 12, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 360,000 applications.
Even with the increase in claims, which have been volatile during the pandemic, layoffs have declined significantly in recent months as health concerns ebb and businesses ramp up hiring. Economists forecast continued improvement in the labor market through the end of the year, with an expectation that the unemployment rate will fall below 5% by the end of the fourth quarter.
Federal Reserve officials are watching for signs that employment is “inclusive and broad-based.” At the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting Wednesday, Chair Jerome Powell said the pace of improvement in the labor market has been uneven.
“Factors related to the pandemic, such as care-giving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments appear to be weighing on employment growth,” Powell said. “These factors should wane in coming months, against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment.”

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3% month- on-month for a 2.0% year-on-year increase, as estimated earlier. The ECB wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2%.
Energy prices added 1.19 percentage point to the overall year-on-year figure and services 0.45 point, while food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.15 point.
Without the most volatile components of energy and food, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices rose 0.2% on the month and only 0.9% year-on-year.

Economists expect inflation may be even higher late in the year, coming closer to 2.5% as the recovery from a pandemic-induced double-dip recession and recent commodity price increases add to price pressures.
But the ECB believes the surge in inflation is temporary and has vowed to keep its monetary policy loose because the drivers of price growth will fade early next year and inflation will be below target for years to come.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
Despite a spike in domestic COVID-19 cases, Taiwan's economy remains strong with exports unaffected.
The island's April export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 42.6% year-on-year to $54.93 billion.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities grew 0.6% in May, unchanged from April, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
On a year-on-year basis, new home prices rose 4.9%, slightly faster than a 4.8% rise in April.
Real estate, a vital source of growth for China's economy, has bounced back quickly from the COVID-19 crisis. But a relentless rise in home prices, particularly in big cities, has raised concerns about overheating and prompted the government to ramp up efforts to cool the red-hot market this year.
""The new home price growth has peaked,"" said Li Yujia, chief economist at Guangdong Property Policy Research Institute. 
""It is due to local government's price caps, and sales discounts offered by many developers who are in debt repayment peak season and under stringent scrutiny on debt ratios."" 
Chinese property prices have risen rapidly this year, even as the government took a series of measures to cool the market including stricter rules for home buyers, curbing debt accumulation by developers and guiding banks to increase mortgage rates.
The NBS data showed 62 cities reported monthly gains in May, with the number unchanged from the tally in April.
New home prices quickened slightly in tier-1 cities, while growth flatlined in tier-2 and 3 cities.
Second-hand home prices in Shenzhen, the front runner amid the rampant property boom, fell 0.1% month-on-month in May. Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline, said it was the first monthly fall in nearly two years.
Li expected new home price growth to remain elevated as land prices stay high, although developers are likely to ramp up price discounts to promote sales.
""The growth is expected to soften at the end of (the) third quarter if current policy tightenings remain in place.""

Earlier this week, data showed China's real estate investment rose in May at its weakest clip this year as policy tightening on developers' financing and mortgages gradually kicked in, although growth stayed resilient.
China's home prices are expected to grow 5% this year, according to a Reuters poll of analysts in June, up from a forecast for a 3.3% gain in a similar survey in February.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian job creation blew past expectations in May as unemployment dived to pre-pandemic lows, a major upside surprise that will test policy makers' commitment to keeping rates at historic lows for another two years or more.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed 115,200 net new jobs were created in May, far above forecasts for a 30,000 gain. Full-time jobs jumped by 97,500 and hours worked rose sharply, pointing to expanding output.
Unemployment dropped to 5.1%, from 5.5% in April, a remarkable recovery from a high of 7.5% hit last July when coronavirus lockdowns tipped the economy into recession.
Such strength will be warmly welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), but also challenges the bank's belief that it will be years before the labour market is tight enough to drive wages and inflation sustainably higher.
The RBA has been the odd man out as other rich world central banks turn more hawkish, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
""In light of the recent shift in rhetoric overseas the RBA appears incredibly dovish, particularly given the relative strength of the economy,"" said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA.
The surprise jobs data came just after RBA Governor Philip Lowe argued that wages would remain subdued for some time, in part due to a widespread focus on cost cutting by firms.
Firms were using non-wage strategies to retain and attract staff, or even choosing to ration output instead, Lowe said in a speech delivered earlier on Thursday.
As a result, the RBA had signalled it would not raise the 0.1% cash rate until inflation was back in its 2-3% target band and that was unlikely until 2024.
Yet the May data showed unemployment already down at 5.1%, when the RBA had not expected to reach 5% until the end of this year. Lowe has said it could take a jobless rate of 4% or lower to push annual wage growth above 3% as desired.
The data added to the case for the RBA to scale back its bond yield target and asset buying programme at its July policy meeting, said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.

""We expect the RBA to announce a flexible asset purchase programme at its next meeting,"" Udy said.
""But if the labour market recovery holds up as we expect, the Bank may be making use of that flexibility by tapering asset purchases sooner than November as we had anticipated.""

184,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s unemployment rate tumbled in May in response to a burst of hiring, led by full-time positions, underscoring the economy’s ongoing momentum supported by fiscal-monetary stimulus.
The jobless rate declined to 5.1% in April, well below economists’ estimate that it would remain unchanged at 5.5%, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday in Sydney. The economy added 115,200 roles versus a forecast 30,000 gain, while the participation rate climbed to 66.2%.
The decline in the jobless rate is now back to the level in February 2020, said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “The declining unemployment rate continues to align with the strong increases in job vacancies,” he added.
The Australian dollar jumped 0.3% to the day’s high of 76.45 U.S. cents as some traders rushed to cover short positions, according to an Asia-based FX trader.
The yield on sovereign bonds that mature in November 2024 surged almost 12 basis points as investors bet that a more hawkish Federal Reserve and the stronger jobs data add to the case for the Reserve Bank of Australia to decide against rolling forward its yield control. The spread between April and November 2024 notes surged to over 30 basis points.
Australia has transitioned from recovery to expansion after recouping jobs and output lost during the pandemic. Thursday’s data suggests the economy has managed to absorb losses from the end of the government’s signature JobKeeper wage subsidy in late March.
Withdrawal Weathered
“The labor market has weathered the withdrawal of JobKeeper very well,” said Sean Langcake, a senior economist at BIS Oxford Economics. “The recovery took a pause in April following the last JobKeeper payments at the end of March. But there are no signs of lingering effects in today’s data. Participation is back around an all-time level.”
Both the RBA and Treasury expect employment will keep strengthening, based on job advertisements and other forward indicators. Yet there may also be some weaker readings ahead after Melbourne was forced back into a two-week lockdown to contain a Covid-19 outbreak.
Among other details in today’s report:
The RBA is due to decide in less than three weeks whether to roll over its three-year yield target bond to November 2024 from the current April 2024 and the scale of any further quantitative easing. Its current A$100 billion ($76 billion) tranche of QE is due to conclude in September.
The government has joined forces with the central bank in trying to push unemployment down toward 4% to spur wage growth and rekindle inflation. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced targeted additional fiscal support in his May budget to keep supporting the economy.
The RBA’s updated quarterly forecasts released last month show the jobless rate falling to 5% by the end of this year and 4.5% at the end of 2022. Under an optimistic scenario for unemployment, the rate could decline to 3.75% by mid-2023, the forecasts showed.
Australia’s containment of Covid has underpinned a recovery in sentiment that’s seen households spend and firms flag further investment. However, Melbourne’s lockdown did put a damper on the latest consumer confidence reading.
Yet business conditions -- which measures hiring, sales and profits, and is monitored by the RBA -- rose in May to a fresh record.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's economic growth swept past forecasts in the first quarter on the back of a housing boom and strong retail spending, avoiding a second recession and bringing forward expectations for tighter monetary policy.
Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.6% in the three months through to March, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday, well ahead of a Reuters poll forecast of 0.5% growth and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) estimate of a 0.6% fall.
New Zealand's success in virtually eliminating the coronavirus in the country allowed it to reopen its domestic economy must before other advanced nations, boosting employment and consumer spending.
Westpac Bank said economic growth was estimated to be running at about 0.8% above levels prior to the global coronavirus outbreak.
The rapid recovery follows better than expected readings on key indicators like employment and retail spending in recent months that prompted the central bank to signal a move away from stimulatory monetary policy settings adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the first in the world to do so.
ANZ Bank said it was bringing forward its forecast for the central bank to hike its official cash rate to February 2022, saying ""a year from now feels too far away"".
""Q1 data confirm NZ's economic recovery has been spectacular relative to early-pandemic expectations. And while there are still pockets of weakness, they are getting hard to identify at the aggregate level,"" said ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner.
The better than expected GDP figures pushed the Kiwi dollar up 0.3% to around $0.7073.
Growth was largely driven by a surging housing sector amid historically low interest rates and cheap mortgages, although worries about housing affordability have led the government and RBNZ to introduce measures to try to cool the market.
Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in a statement that confidence in the recovery also led to a boost in retail spending, dining out and holiday accommodation, offsetting the loss of overseas tourism, but he warned there were still uncertainties.
New Zealand's vaccine rollout has been slower than other nations, and the country's border are expected to remain closed until 2022.
The GDP bounce comes after New Zealand reported a 1.0% fall in economic growth in the final quarter of 2020.

The country had rebounded from recession with a revised 14.1% quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the three months to end-September last year. That more than reversed an 11% drop in the preceding quarter as the country observed strict lockdown measures. 
Annual GDP rose 2.4% in the first quarter, Statistics New Zealand said, compared with analyst expectations for a 0.9% rise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded less than expected in May as very expensive lumber and shortages of other materials continued to constrain builders' ability to take advantage of an acute shortage of houses on the market.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed permits for future home construction falling to a seven-month low. Housing completions also declined while the number of homes authorized for construction but not yet started rose to the highest level since 1999, indicating supply will likely remain tight for a while and boost house price inflation.
""Shortages of materials and labor have builders struggling to increase production of new homes, though the demand remains strong,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Potential home buyers should expect tight inventories and rising prices for both new and existing homes for the foreseeable future.""
Housing starts rose 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.572 million units last month. Data for April was revised down to a rate of 1.517 million units from the previously reported 1.569 million units. 
Groundbreaking activity rose in the Midwest, the West and the densely populated South, but fell in the Northeast.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.630 million units. Last month's increase still left starts below March's rate of 1.725 million units, which was the highest level since June 2006. Housing starts, however, jumped 50.3% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.2% to a rate of 1.098 million units. Starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 2.4% to a pace of 474,000 units.

Softwood lumber prices increased a record 154.3% year-on-year in May, according to the latest producer price data. Lumber futures contracts have dropped from historic highs set in early May as sawmills ramped up production and imports increased. Still, prices remain very high.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell to a 10-month low in June. 
The NAHB blamed the ebb in sentiment on ""higher costs and declining availability for softwood lumber and other building materials,"" noting that was driving up prices of new houses ""which has slowed the strong pace of homebuilding."" 
Copper is in short supply while tariffs on steel imports are also adding to building costs, which are boosting new home prices and contributing to higher inflation. Some appliances are also scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. 
A separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed import prices rising 1.1% in May. That lifted the year-on-year increase to 11.3%, the largest gain since September 2011, from 10.8% in April.

DEMAND BOOM
Demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left millions of Americans still working from home, is driving a housing market boom. The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows. 
House prices have increased by the most in more than 15 years on an annual basis, raising concerns that some first-time buyers could be priced out of the market.
Permits for future homebuilding fell 3.0% to a rate of 1.681 million units in May. Building permits surged 34.9% compared to May 2020. They are running slightly ahead of starts, suggesting moderate gains in homebuilding in the months ahead.
The housing market has been the star performer in the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020. Residential construction investment has enjoyed double-digit growth since the third quarter of last year. Most economists expect housing will make a modest contribution to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter.
""New residential construction remains strong, but building material pricing and availability are likely to remain significant headwinds,"" said Charlie Dougherty, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Building permits for single-family homes fell 1.6% to a rate of 1.130 million units. The number of housing units authorized to be built but not started increased 0.8% to a rate of 238,000 at the end of May, the highest since the government started tracking the series in January 1999.
Building permits for multi-family housing projects dropped 5.8% to a rate of 551,000 units. The multi-family housing market is seen getting a lift from people returning to cities as the economy reopens amid an easing of the pandemic's grip.
Housing completions fell 4.1% to a rate of 1.368 million units last month. Single-family home completions dropped 2.6% to a rate of 978,000 units.

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction rose 0.5% to a rate of 1.324 million units last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence levels of Japanese manufacturers and service sector firms were little changed in June from the prior month, highlighting the fragile and uneven state of the country's coronavirus recovery, a Reuters survey showed.
While manufacturers' mood remained positive thanks to strong overseas demand, it was forecast to be slightly lower three months from this month, according to the Reuters Tankan poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers edged up to 22 from 21 in May, while the mood in the service sector was more dour. The service index was flat, down from 2 the prior month, the poll conducted June 3-14 showed. (For a detailed table of the results, click)
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.
Among manufacturers, buoyant sentiment at chemical and metal product makers offset less favourable conditions in sectors such as textiles and paper, according to the survey of 481 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 238 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
""We're seeing a positive impact from growing overseas demand and in electronic materials-related industries,"" a manager at a chemical products maker said.
The poll comes a day before the BOJ is set to end a June 17-18 policy meeting where it may extend its pandemic-relief programmes to support the country's economic recovery, which would help solidify the view it will lag other central banks in cutting crisis-mode policies.
The BOJ's own ""tankan"" business survey is next due on July 1, weeks before Tokyo is set to host the Olympic Games later that month amid ongoing concerns the event could fuel a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Japan's economy is expected to narrowly avoid falling into recession this quarter, but is unlikely to see the sharp growth rates of the United States, largely due to extended coronavirus curbs and Tokyo's late vaccine rollout.
The Reuters Tankan survey also highlighted the hit that firms were feeling from the health crisis, with a manager at a wholesaler describing the recovery from the coronavirus blow as still being ""sluggish"".

Another manager, at a real estate firm, also remained negative. ""Demand in aviation continues to decline due to the impact of the coronavirus,"" the manager wrote in the survey.
Manufacturers' business confidence was seen a notch lower at 21 in September, while that of service-sector firms was expected to rise to 10, the survey showed.

Sunak said there was no sign that expectations for higher inflation were becoming entrenched as the economy bounces back from its coronavirus lockdowns.
""That's different to what's happening in the U.S. so I think actually here, people's expectation is inflation will remain at target over the medium term, but of course that's one of the many risks that it's my job to worry about,"" Sunak said in an interview with broadcaster GB News.
Earlier, official data showed Britain's consumer price index hit 2.1% in May. 
Sunak also told GB News there would be would be no return to austerity after his 350 billion pounds ($490 billion) of spending to see Britain's economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, he said he wanted to protect the country against shocks ahead and not leave Britain's debt to be paid for by future generations 
""(And) that does require a bit of focus and prioritisation,"" Sunak said.

Asked if the government will keep its promise to maintain its mechanism for increasing state pensions, which could mean rises that track fast-growing wages, Sunak said the issue would be reviewed in the autumn.

Import prices rose 1.1% last month after gaining a 0.8% in April, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. The seventh straight monthly gain lifted the year-on-year increase to 11.3%, the largest rise since September 2011. Import prices surged 10.8% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, rising 0.8%. Part of the acceleration in the year-on-year prices reflected the dropping of last spring's weak readings from the calculation.
Data this month showed strong increases in producer and consumer prices in May. Vaccinations against COVID-19, trillions of dollars from the government and record-low interest rates are whipping up demand, leaving companies scrambling for raw materials and labor. But the higher inflation is largely viewed as transitory, with supply chains expected to adjust.
Imported fuel prices jumped 4.0% last month after rising 1.6% in April. Petroleum prices increased 3.8%, while the cost of imported food fell 0.4%. Excluding fuel and food, import prices rose 1.0%. These so-called core import prices advanced 0.7% in April.
The report also showed export prices jumped 2.2% in May after rising 1.1% in April. Prices for agricultural exports rose 6.1%, the largest gain since in November 2010. 

Nonagricultural export prices rose 1.7%, lifted by industrial supplies and materials and consumer goods. 
Export prices surged 17.4% year-on-year, the largest rise since the series started in September 1983, after advancing 14.9% in April.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's target in May when it hit 2.1%, part of a post-lockdown climb in prices that is expected gather pace.
The acceleration of the consumer price index from April's 1.5% largely reflected how weak inflation was in May 2020 when the economy was reeling from its first tight lockdown.
The figure represented the first time inflation has gone above the BoE's 2% target in almost two years and was above all 33 forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists which had pointed to a rise in inflation to 1.8%.
Yields on British government bonds rose early on Wednesday with the yield on two-year gilts - which are sensitive to speculation about BoE policy moves - briefly touching their highest in nearly a month.
Investors around the world are assessing the risks of a sustained jump in prices, especially in the United States where annual inflation hit 5.0% in May, the highest in almost 13 years, and where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package.
""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, it is clearly a hawkish surprise,"" HSBC economist Chris Hare said. 
""Of course, some major uncertainties, such as the end of the furlough scheme in September, remain. But if the upside surprises continue, calls for a rate rise on the Monetary Policy Committee may grow louder.""
The CPI data showed fuel prices in May were almost 18% higher than a year earlier while clothing and footwear costs rose by 2.1% as people, emerging from their lockdown isolation, bought new outfits.
The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from May 17. 
The BoE has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains.
Previous surges in inflation since the 2008 financial crisis proved temporary, as the labour market was too weak to create the type of wage-price spirals which occurred in the 1970s.
The central bank is expected to leave policy unchanged on June 24 after its latest meeting.
SIX-MONTH SURGE
Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of price growth from 0.3% in November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis.
""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the U.S.,"" Leslie said.
Sterling rose slightly after the ONS figures.
Core inflation, which excludes the price of food, energy and other volatile items, rose to 2.0% in the 12 months to May from 1.3% in April, the Office for National Statistics said.
While BoE Governor Andrew Bailey and most of his colleagues say the climb in inflation will be temporary, Chief Economist Andy Haldane said last week the central bank faced the ""most dangerous moment"" since the European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis in 1992.
There were signs of further price pressure ahead in Wednesday's data.

Prices paid by manufacturers for their inputs rose by 10.7% in the 12 months to May, the highest since September 2011, and the prices they charged rose by 4.6%, the biggest increase since January 2012.
House prices in April were 8.9% higher than a year before, slowing from a 9.9% rise in March which was the strongest increase since 2007. The ONS said April's dip reflected a rush of sales in March when buyers had been expecting the expiry of a cut in stamp duty which has since been extended.

While the COVID-19 pandemic briefly halted seven years of unbroken price growth last year, a second shutdown of construction earlier this year has compounded a long-standing mismatch between low supply and high demand.
Property prices outside of Dublin were 5.4% higher in April than a year before compared with growth of 3.5% in the capital, the data showed. Overall, prices are 14.3% below a peak hit in 2007 before the bursting of a property bubble.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Growth in China's factory output slowed for a third straight month in May, likely weighed down by disruptions caused by COVID-19 outbreaks in the country's southern export powerhouse of Guangdong.
Retail sales and investment growth also came in below market expectations, but analysts say underlying activity still looks quite solid, noting headline readings remain highly distorted by comparisons to the pandemic plunge early last year. 
The Chinese economy has largely shaken off the gloom from the coronavirus slump, but officials warn its recovery remains uneven amid challenges including soft domestic demand, rising raw material prices and global supply chain disruptions.
China's rapid recovery last year and a U.S. rebound this year have sharply boosted Asia's export-reliant economies -- Japan posted its strongest export growth in 41 years on Wednesday -- but resurgent COVID infections and lockdowns are holding back broader-based recoveries.
Chinese industrial production rose 8.8% in May from a year ago, slower than the 9.8% uptick in April, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, missing a 9.0% on-year rise forecast by analysts from a Reuters poll.
In particular, the output of auto vehicles fell 4% from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 6.8% in April, crimped by a global chip shortage.
""This is a normal cyclical slowdown after an economic recovery. In a nutshell, we can see the economic rebound is peaking,"" said Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""The extent of the slowdown in the second half is key. So far, it's still normal and there's still room for the fiscal policy to play a part later in the year.""
Most analysts had expected some moderation in May output due to softer export orders, higher input costs for factories and tighter environmental restrictions on heavy industry.
Outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Pearl River Delta since late May also have brought some key ports to a standstill, economists at Nomura said in a note to clients, though it believes the current spate of infections can be contained in a relatively short period of time.
Fu Linghui, an NBS official, said external risks also remain, such as still rising global COVID-19 infections, an uneven recovery in the world economy and spill-over effects from large stimulus programmes from some countries.
BRIGHT SPOTS
Retail sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in May, weaker than 13.6% growth expected by analysts and down from the 17.7% jump seen in April.
Chinese consumer and business confidence has been picking up thanks to pent-up demand and quickening vaccine rollouts, which are also reviving domestic tourism.
Two-year average growth for retail sales stood at 4.5% in May, faster than the 4.3% in April, in a sign that sales are gradually rebounding, Fu from NBS told reporters.
Fixed asset investment increased 15.4% in the first five months from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 16.9% rise, slowing from January-April's 19.9% increase.
Notably, two-year average growth in manufacturing investment turned positive in May. 
""What is gratifying is some weak indicators such as consumption and manufacturing investments are showing some improvement,"" Li Huiyong, deputy general manager at Hwabao WP Fund Management Co., adding that he expects the trend to continue. 
China's unemployment rate also continued to drop. Nationwide urban jobless rate fell to 5.0% in May, the lowest since May 2019, from 5.1% in April.
On a month-on-month basis, Capital Economics estimated industrial output growth was unchanged at 0.5%, the pace of investment spending eased slightly and retail sales picked up.
However, Reuters calculations showed real estate investment 
in May rose at its slowest pace this year as more smaller towns joined bigger cities in trying to curb red-hot housing prices. New construction starts fell for a second month.
MIXED BAG?
Earlier data for May painted a somewhat mixed picture, with export growth easing but imports picking up, fuelled by surging demand and prices for raw materials.

Surging commodities prices pushed China's producer inflation to its highest level in over 12 years, squeezing profit margins for mid- and downstream firms.
Bank lending unexpectedly rose but broader credit growth continued to slow, a trend analysts said could start to weigh on activity in the second half of the year.

193,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy will grow by a weaker-than-expected 3.3% this year as supply bottlenecks in manufacturing hold back industrial output, the Ifo economic institute predicted on Wednesday.
The lower growth forecast for Europe's largest economy represented a cut of 0.4 percentage points compared to its previous estimate from March, Ifo said.
For 2022, the institute raised its GDP growth forecast to 4.3% from 3.2% previously.
""In the short term, the bottlenecks in the delivery of primary products in particular are holding back the economy,"" Ifo economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said.
""The recovery, which is strong in itself due to the reopening of the economy, is being pushed back a bit further than we had expected in spring.""
Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Tuesday they are cutting working hours at some of their plants as carmakers continue to suffer from a shortage of semiconductors.
The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply bottlenecks for chips, timber and other materials are pushing up prices, prompting Ifo to forecast inflation will jump to 2.6% this year from 0.6% in 2020 before easing back to 1.9% in 2022.
The strong rebound is likely to push up domestic demand and with it imports, which are forecast to surpass exports in 2021 and 2022.
This will help to reduce Germany's large current account surplus to 5.8% of economic output in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, bringing it below the European Union's indicative threshold of 6% for the first time in many years, the institute said.

Ifo's growth forecast is less optimistic than estimates from the Bundesbank, which predicts 3.7% for this year and 5.2% next year.
In contrast to the Bundesbank, the Ifo institute expects household spending to be less supportive as many consumers are unlikely to spend all the savings which they piled up during the lockdowns, Wollmershaeuser said.

Japan’s exports surged by nearly 50% from last year’s dismal level, as record jumps in shipments to the U.S. and Europe helped boost an economy still struggling with the virus at home.
The value of overseas shipments jumped 49.6% in May compared to a year earlier, when the world economy was suffering under pandemic lockdowns, according to finance ministry figures released Wednesday that were largely in line with the median forecast from analysts. It was the biggest gain since April 1980.
Shipments of cars and auto parts more than doubled, despite a shortage of semiconductors that has crimped vehicle production in the U.S. and other markets.
Still, economists warned that the data give an inflated view of the strength of Japan’s exports because they’re based on a comparison with 2020’s terrible figures, pointing out that the value of shipments was flat compared with April on a seasonally adjusted basis. Compared with 2019’s level, exports rose more than 7%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports rose at the fastest pace since 1980 in May and a key gauge of capital spending grew, helping the world's third largest economy offset sluggish domestic demand as COVID-19 vaccinations boost business activity in key markets.
The jump in exports largely reflected a rebound in shipments from last year's pandemic-driven plunge, but was a welcome sign as the economy struggles to rebound from the first quarter's doldrums amid a prolonged coronavirus state of emergency.
The solid data will likely bolster the view that the central bank will stick with its ultra-easy policy at its June 17-18 policy meeting, although it may extend pandemic-relief programmes to back a fragile economic recovery. The government recently extended coronavirus emergency curbs in Tokyo and other major areas.
""We cannot count on private consumption, but an uptrend in exports and capital spending will help pick up the slack in the second quarter,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Still, export growth may lack strength as a global chip shortage will put a drag on car production over the next half year or so,"" he added.
Ministry of Finance data on Wednesday showed exports grew 49.6% year-on-year in May, versus a 51.3% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, led by U.S.-bound car shipments.
The jump followed a 38% rise in April and marked the sharpest monthly increase since April 1980, when shipments surged 51.4%.
May's rise largely reflected the recoil effect of a 28.3% plunge in May of 2020.
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, grew 23.6%, led by chip production equipment, hybrid cars and scrap copper, the trade data showed.
Exports to the United States, another key market for Japanese goods, jumped 87.9% in May, a record for year-on-year growth according to comparable data going back to January 1980, driven by cars and auto parts.
Imports rose 27.9% year-on-year in May versus a median estimate for a 26.6% gain, resulting in a trade deficit of 187.1 billion yen ($1.70 billion), against the median estimate for a 91.2 billion yen shortfall.
Separate data by the Cabinet Office showed core machinery orders, which serve as a leading indicator of capital expenditure in the coming six to nine months, rose 0.6% in April from the previous month, below an expected 2.7% gain.
The Cabinet Office left its assessment on machinery orders unchanged, saying a pick-up was stalling.
A government official said solid overseas demand for chip manufacturing equipment helped support external orders, which jumped 46.2% in April, rebounding from a 53.9% fall in March.
Core orders, which exclude those for ships and electrical utilities, grew 6.5% year-on-year in April, versus an 8.0% gain expected by economists, the data showed.

The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% at its policy meeting this week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May, with spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to travel and engage in other activities that had been restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite last month's decline reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, the trend in retail sales remains strong. Sales in April were revised sharply up and are well above their pre-pandemic level, keeping intact expectations of double-digit growth in both consumer spending and the economy this quarter.
""The days of spending money online and splurging on durable goods and home furnishings is pivoting toward getting ready for trips to see grandma and grandpa at the lake or the beach and evenings out reconnecting with friends at bars and restaurants,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Retail sales fell 1.3% last month. Data for April was revised higher to show sales increasing 0.9% instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales declining 0.8%. 
Retail sales surged 28.1% on a year-on-year basis. The retail sales report mostly capture spending on goods, with restaurants and bars the only services category included. 
During the pandemic, demand shifted to goods like electronics and motor vehicles as millions of people worked from home, switched to online classes and avoided public transportation. More than half of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated, boosting demand for air travel, hotel accommodation, dining out and entertainment among other activities. 
May's decline in retail sales was also due to a drop in receipts at auto dealerships, reflecting tight supply as a global semiconductor shortage hampers motor vehicle production. 
Receipts at auto dealerships fell 3.7%. Shortages also likely hurt sales at electronics and appliance stores, which dropped 3.4%. Receipts at building material stores tumbled 5.9%. There were also declines in sales at furniture retailers as well as at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
Online retail sales slipped 0.8%. But sales at clothing stores rose 3.0%. Consumers also increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 1.8% rise in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars are 70.6% higher compared to May 2020.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dropped 0.7% after a revised 0.4% fall in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
They were previously estimated to have decreased 1.5% in April. Services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation make up the other component of consumer spending.
U.S. stocks were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG INFLATION
Vaccinations have allowed for a broader reopening of the economy. But the resulting demand, which is also being fired up by trillions of dollars from the government and record-low interest rates, is straining supply chains, fanning inflation.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.8% last month after rising 0.6% in April. In the 12 months through May, the PPI accelerated 6.6%, the largest gain since November 2010, after advancing 6.2% in April.
The report followed news last week that consumer prices rose solidly in May, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in nearly 13 years.
With the PPI and CPI data in hand, economists are forecasting that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose at least 0.4% in May. That would push the year-on-year rate to about 3.4% from 3.1% in April. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% target.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. With the economy reopening, prices are rising back to normal levels in areas hardest hit by the virus. Last spring's weak readings are also dropping out from the calculation.
Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and were expected to keep the overnight benchmark interest rate near zero. The Fed is pumping money into the economy through bond purchases. Economists will, however, be watching to see if the Fed opens discussion about when and how it will withdraw some of the support to the economy. 
""Inflationary pressures are strong in the U.S. right now but should cool in the second half of the year,"" said Bill Adams, an economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is expected to reiterate tomorrow that more progress toward a recovery is needed before they slow their bond purchases."" 
There was some encouraging news on the supply bottlenecks, with a third report from the Fed showing production at factories increased 0.9% in May as motor vehicle assemblies jumped about 1 million units, though they remain below their average level in the second half of 2020.
Surging prices for used cars and trucks have been one of the main drivers of inflation. Some easing of the supply squeeze could help to slow inflation and support retail sales. 
Goods account for about 41% of consumer spending. Even with the boost from stimulus checks fading, consumption could get a powerful tailwind from the at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings amassed by households during the pandemic. 

Wages are rising and some households will from July through December receive income under the expanded Child Care Tax Credit program, which will soften the blow of an early termination of government-funded unemployment benefits in at least 25 states. 
""By our estimate, this program should provide approximately $16.7 billion in additional income per month in the second half of this year, for a total of $100 billion,"" said Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's economy grew by 58.49% in April, the government said on Tuesday, bolstered by soaring growth in key mining and fishing sectors and by a low basis for comparison with the same month in the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The data came with the copper-rich Andean country stuck in a political impasse as tensions rise over the yet-to-be confirmed result of a tight June 6 run-off election between socialist Pedro Castillo and right-winger Keiko Fujimori.
Castillo, who has pledged to redraft Peru's constitution and hike taxes on mining firms, has a narrow 45,000-vote lead in the count with over 99.99% of ballots counted, but the result has been delayed with Fujimori seeking to get votes annulled.
The leftist's rise was driven by left-behind rural voters, who have felt the sharp impact of the world's deadliest per capita COVID-19 outbreak that has seen poverty and inequality levels rise as the mining-driven economy has tanked.
Government statistics agency INEI highlighted sharp expansions in the manufacturing, fishing and mining sectors as major factors contributing to Peru's fledgling recovery. Agricultural production fell off slightly, hampered by drought and a reduced planting area.
But the agency also noted that the spike in growth could be in part attributed to a low basis for comparison. Peru's economy in April 2020 contracted by 39.09%, ravaged by quarantines imposed to help contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The economy has yet to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels, the agency noted.

""The production results for April 2021 still have not exceeded the output levels registered in April 2019 (pre-pandemic year), showing a decrease of -3.46% with respect to production that month,"" it said in a statement.
The South American nation, which is the world's second largest producer of copper, has suffered the world's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak per capita, and last year posted its worst economic contraction in three decades.

(Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder confidence in the market for single family homes fell in June to its lowest level since August 2020, dented by higher housing costs and shortages in key materials such as lumber.
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined to a reading of 81 this month from 83 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index would be unchanged at 83. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November 2020.
""While builders have adopted a variety of business strategies including price escalation clauses to deal with scarce building materials, labor and lots, unavoidable increases for new home prices are pushing some buyers to the sidelines,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""Moreover, these supply-constraints are resulting in insufficient appraisals and making it more difficult for builders to access construction loans.""
Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales recently, and fewer U.S. consumers believe that now is a good time to buy a home.

(Reuters) -The U.S. housing market bounced back quickly last year after the pandemic gave some workers the flexibility to work from anywhere - and demand for vacation homes was especially hot, according to a report released on Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors. 
Sales of existing homes in counties with a higher share of vacation homes rose by 24% on average in 2020, more than double the 11% increase in counties that don't have a high concentration of vacation homes. 
Home prices also appreciated more quickly in vacation home counties, gaining an average 14% last year, compared with the average 10% annual increase in non-vacation-home counties. Buyers in vacation areas were also more likely to make all-cash offers.
Vacation-home counties were defined as those where at least 20% of the properties are for seasonal or recreational use. As of 2019, about 10% of the 3,143 counties in the United States were vacation-home counties, according to the association https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/vacation-home-sales-skyrocket-as-a-result-of-pandemic.
The hottest vacation markets were concentrated in 16 states, including North Carolina, New York, Vermont and Massachusetts. The No. 1 county, based on sales growth, price and days on the market, was Lee County in Florida, which includes cities such as Fort Myers and Cape Coral. 
In the next hottest market, Oscoda County, Michigan, home sales rose by 54% in 2020 and the median sales price increased by 79%, according to the report. The county, which is about four hours away from Detroit, includes the Huron-Manistee National Forests and Oscoda Beach Park. 
The increased demand for vacation homes was sparked by the move to work from home and the shift to virtual schooling, which gave families the flexibility to relocate, the researchers said. 
The dramatic increase in home sales in some vacation markets is a reminder of the stark inequality that struck the housing market during the pandemic, which left millions of Americans out of work and caused some to fall behind on their housing payments. 

A rush of federal aid - including direct cash payments, eviction moratoriums and a mortgage forbearance program - helped to keep many people in their homes, but some households are still struggling. 
The share of homeowners with mortgages in forbearance surged to 7% by May 2020 and slowly declined to 4% this spring, according to a report https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/05/keeping-borrowers-current-in-a-pandemic.html by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers in low-income areas and those with loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration were more likely to stay in forbearance for an extended period of time.

Business inventories decreased 0.2% after increasing 0.2% in March, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories dipping 0.1%.
Inventories dropped 3.6% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Retail inventories decreased 1.8% in April, rather than 1.6% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.4% decrease in March. Motor vehicle inventories dropped 7.5% rather than 7.0% as estimated in an advance report published last month. Motor vehicle stocks are being run down as a global semiconductor shortage weighs on auto production.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.6% instead of 0.5% as estimated last month.
Manufacturers are battling shortages of raw materials and labor in the wake of pent-up demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy as vaccinations ease COVID-19's intensity.
With demand robust, inventories were depleted in the first quarter. The inventory drawdown subtracted nearly three percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a strong 6.4% annualized rate after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Most economists are forecasting double-digit GDP growth in the second quarter. 

Wholesale inventories increased 0.8% in April. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.3%.
Business sales advanced 0.6% in April after rebounding 5.8% in March. At April's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in March.

Manufacturing output accelerated 0.9% last month after dipping 0.1% in April, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output increasing 0.6% in May. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by massive fiscal stimulus, low interest rates and continued strong demand for goods even as spending is shifting towards services amid a vastly improved public health situation. 
But robust demand is straining the supply chain, with shortages of raw materials and labor across the industry. 
The automobile industry has been hit by a global shortage of semiconductors, which has forced some automakers to cut production. Hyundai Motor USA said on Monday it would suspend production at its Montgomery plant in Alabama for a week because of the chip crunch and will ""will continue to take necessary measures to optimize production.""
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said last week it expected the supply squeeze to ease in the third quarter, though it saw the bottlenecks continuing in the long term.
That suggests the 6.7% increase in production at auto plants last month was likely temporary. Motor vehicle assemblies jumped about 1 million units to an annualized rate of 9.9 million units last month, but remained more than 1 million units below their average level in the second half of 2020.
Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.5% last month.
The rebound in manufacturing output combined with a 1.2% increase in mining and a 0.2% gain in utilities to boost industrial production by 0.8% last month. That followed a 0.1% rise in April. 

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.7 percentage point to 75.6%. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector was up 0.6 percentage point to 75.2%. It is 4.4 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

(Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve said on Tuesday its barometer on manufacturing business activity in New York state declined for a second consecutive month in June.
The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions fell seven points to 17.4, lower than a reading of 23.0 forecast among analysts polled by Reuters. 

A reading above zero signals the New York manufacturing sector is expanding. 
New orders increased moderately, deliveries lengthened at a record-setting pace while inventories edged lower. New York's manufacturing firms were optimistic. The survey's six-month outlook gauge rose eleven points to 47.7. The indexes for new orders and shipments rose to similar levels.

203,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 08:08AM ET</span>",,,,,,"DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's inflation rate rose for the second consecutive month, climbing to 5.7% in May from 5.3% in April, again reflecting a tripling of value-added tax to 15% last year, official data showed on Tuesday.
The increase was mainly due to higher prices of food and beverages and transport, the General Authority for Statistics said. Food prices have a weight of 17% in the Saudi consumer basket, making them the main driver of the headline inflation rate in May.
The VAT increase, which went into effect in July last year, came as the Saudi government sought to bolster its coffers after being hit by the twin shock of last year's oil price crash and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as voluntary oil production cuts implemented to help stabilise world prices.
""Prices of food and beverages recorded the highest annual increase of 7.4%, mainly due to the increase in food prices (+7.3%). In particular, the increase in prices of meat (+6.8%) and vegetables (+6.7%) was remarkable,"" the General Authority for Statistics said.
Consumer prices rose slightly on a month-on-month basis, by 0.2%.
""Looking ahead, the headline inflation rate is likely to peak in June at around 6.3% y/y,"" James Swanston, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.
""But, from July, inflation will drop sharply as the base effects of the tripling of the VAT rate last year drop out of the annual price comparison. We think that the headline rate will slow to around 1.0-1.5% y/y and remain at this pace over the course of this year and throughout 2022-23.""

Saudi Arabia's economy shrank 3% in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier, hit by oil output cuts, but the non-oil economy expanded 2.9%, recovering from the pandemic.
The kingdom's economy, the largest in the Arab world, shrank 4.1% last year. The International Monetary Fund expects real GDP, an inflation-adjusted measure, to grow 2.1% this year.

The European Union's statistics office said the unadjusted trade surplus of the 19 countries sharing the euro was 10.9 billion euros in April compared with 2.3 billion in April 2020, as overall euro zone exports rose 43.2% while imports increased 37.4%.
But the April result fell short of market expectations of a 15.8 billion euro surplus in a Reuters poll of economists.
Exports of machinery and vehicles from the whole EU jumped 11.9% in the first four months of 2021, swelling the surplus in that category to 58.5 billion euros from 48.5 billion euros a year earlier.
The EU's trade deficit with its biggest trading partner China widened, but it was offset by increased trade surpluses with the United States and Britain.

The 27-nation bloc's overall trade volume with Britain fell after the country left the EU's internal market at the start of the year but the surplus surged because imports from Britain plunged 27.1% in January-April while exports declined only 3.3%.
Adjusted for seasonal factors the euro zone's external trade surplus was 9.4 billion euros in April, down from 18.3 billion euros in March.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of employees on British company payrolls surged by a record amount in May as COVID restrictions eased and pubs and restaurants resumed indoor service, though it still remains more than half a million below its pre-pandemic peak.
Tax data released on Tuesday showed that British companies increased their number of employees by 197,000 in May, the biggest single-month increase since records began in July 2014, taking the total to 28.5 million. 
Tuesday's figures also showed the fastest headline wage growth since 2007 in the year to April, although statisticians warned that this was distorted by comparisons with depressed wages a year ago and greater job losses among low-paid staff.
""The level of employment is still well below its pre-crisis level, suggesting there is still plenty of slack in the labour market,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.
The headline unemployment rate fell for a fourth month in a row to 4.7% for the three months to April, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. 
""The latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
The jobless rate has been kept down by the government's furlough programme. This paid wages on 8.9 million jobs at its peak in May 2020, during the first COVID lockdown, and supported 3.4 million jobs in April 2021.
More recent ONS survey data pointed to a further fall to just over 2 million jobs by mid-May, and Tuesday's data showed the most job vacancies since the pandemic began.
The biggest rise in vacancies was in the accommodation and food service sector. The sector was hit hard hit by the pandemic, and will face an extra challenge in coming weeks as the full lifting of COVID capacity constraints has been delayed until July 19 due to the spread of a new, more infectious, COVID variant.
The Bank of England predicted last month that unemployment would only rise modestly when the furlough scheme stops at the end of September 2020, and is keeping a close eye on inflation pressures - though it still sees substantial slack.
The proportion of working-age men classed as inactive rose to a record-high 17.8%. This category includes students and people caring for family, as well as those who have given up looking for work.

Average weekly earnings in the three months to the end of April rose by 5.6% compared with a year earlier, its biggest rise since March 2007 and above forecasts.
The ONS said that although there were some signs of employers offering sign-on bonuses to attract staff, most of the rise reflected base effects and other distortions. It estimated underlying wage growth was around 3%.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's export growth shot up on a yearly basis to an 11-year high in May, supported by high commodity prices and a low base effect, while imports also jumped as domestic demand rose, official data showed on Tuesday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy has seen its exports recover vigorously from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on soaring prices of its main commodities amid improving demand from major trade partners like China and the United States.
In May, prices of commodities such as coal, palm oil and copper roughly doubled from a year earlier, helping the resource-rich country book a $2.37 billion trade surplus, the statistics bureau said, which was the highest in six months.
The poll had expected a $2.30 billion surplus in May after April's $2.19 billion surplus.
May's exports rose 58.76% to $16.60 billion, the biggest increase since January, 2010. This compared with a 57.49% rise expected in a Reuters poll and April's 51.94% growth.
Imports were $14.23 billion, up 68.68% from last year, higher than the poll's 65% growth forecast and April's 29.93% rise. May's growth was the strongest since April, 2010.
However, the robust growth figures also showed the extent the pandemic had hurt Indonesia's trade performance last year.
In the first five months of the year, Indonesia had a $10.17 billion surplus, also the highest in the past few years.

Dian Ayu Yustina, an economist at Bank Mandiri, expects the monthly surplus to narrow gradually as demand for imports climbs alongside the economic recovery, while exports are likely to remain strong in the next year.
""There is a base year effect and the economic recovery in advanced economies may not be balanced by a recovery in the supply side. Once supply catches up, commodity prices will plateau,"" she said.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers are expecting the economy to boom over the next year, with expectations for inflation, home prices, earnings and the labor market all picking up in May, according to a monthly survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
Median expectations for what inflation will look like over the next year rose for the seventh consecutive month to 4% in May. That is up from 3.4% in April and reaches a new high for the series, which launched in 2013. Expectations for inflation over the next three years increased more modestly to 3.6% from 3.1%. 
Consumers also shared a much brighter outlook for the labor market at a time when more businesses are opening up, travel is increasing and hiring is improving.
The average expectation that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now dropped to a series low of 31.9% in May, down from 34.6% in April. 
The perceived odds of losing a job over the next year also reached a new low, falling to an average of 12.6% in May from 15% in April. The shift was most pronounced among workers below the age of 40, those earning less than $50,000 in household income and people with no more than a high school degree. 

Workers also said they felt they had better odds of finding a job if they became unemployed, with the expected odds rising to 54% in May from 49.8% in April - the largest monthly increase for the series. Those expectations were the highest they've been since February 2020, but were still below pre-pandemic levels. 
Fed officials said they will soon begin discussing plans for pulling back the support they are offering to the U.S. economy through $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and low interest rates. Some economists expect the conversation could start during the policy meeting happening this week on Tuesday and Wednesday.

It said shopper numbers, or footfall, fell 9.0% on high streets week-on-week, by 7.5% in shopping centres and by 0.9% in retail parks.
""UK retail destinations suffered post Bank Holiday blues last week, with footfall dropping back by around half of the uplift recorded in the week before, when the school half-term holiday coincided with the Spring bank holiday and amazing weather,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's insights director.
Overall UK footfall increased 11.6% in the week to June 5.
Springboard said week to June 12 footfall was down 18.4% compared with the same week in 2019, before the pandemic started to disrupt traffic.
Non-essential stores reopened in England and Wales on April 12 after more than three months of COVID-19 lockdowns. They reopened in Scotland on April 26 and Northern Ireland on April 30. Indoor hospitality was allowed from May 17.
However, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Monday that the end of further restrictions will be delayed by several weeks following concerns about a rapid rise of Delta variant infections.

Springboard said that with the removal of restrictions set to be delayed by as much as a month, footfall is not likely to strengthen significantly over the next four weeks.
""However, it should receive a huge boost in the second half of July, particularly as this coincides with the start of the school summer break,"" said Wehrle.

The kingdom's economy has been hit hard by the twin shock of last year's historic oil price crash and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The non-oil sector grew 2.9%, from 1.6% growth a year earlier, while the oil sector declined by 11.7% which was a much sharper fall than the 4.6% contraction a year earlier, the General Authority for Statistics said in a statement on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY). 
In flash estimates in May the authority said the economy shrank 3.3% in the first quarter and the non-oil sector grew for the first since the first quarter of 2020.
The non-oil and private sectors are at the centre of Vision 2030, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's transformation plan to wean the Saudi economy off oil.
Real GDP, an inflation-adjusted measure, shrank 4.1% last year. The International Monetary Fund expects the Saudi economy to grow 2.1% this year.
Saudi Arabia's private sector expanded by 4.4% in the first quarter and the government sector declined slightly, by 0.4%, the official data showed.
On a quarterly basis, real GDP declined by 0.5%, mainly due to an 8.7% drop in the oil sector, while the non-oil sector expanded by 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter, driven by a 6.3% private sector expansion as well as 1.7% growth in the government sector.

Crude petroleum and natural gas and petroleum refining activities was the only economic activity that did not record growth on a quarterly basis and was also the biggest drag on the quarter's decline compared to the first quarter of 2020.

The research firm said the two-month increase in vehicles' average age over the 2019 figure could be short-lived as sales of both new and used cars continue to pick up as the pandemic eases.
Vehicle miles traveled in the United States declined more than 13% in 2020, according to IHS, while more than 15 million vehicles were scrapped - about 5.6 percent of the total vehicle population.
Normally, such a high scrappage rate would cause average vehicle age to decline, the firm said. But fewer miles traveled, combined with lower vehicle sales during the pandemic, had the opposite effect, with average age rising from 11.9 years in 2019.

IHS researchers also said an ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which cut into vehicle production, resulted in lower dealer inventories and inflated transaction prices, in turn causing a concurrent rise in used vehicle prices.
The firm said these factors could cause the average vehicle age to go back down in 2021, as more owners sell or trade in their older used vehicles.

Trade body Make UK and accountants BDO said their quarterly gauge of manufacturing output rose at the fastest pace since the series started 30 years ago, chiming with other business surveys that show an accelerating economic recovery.
While this reflected a ""rubber band"" effect following the record-low readings seen last year, the strength of the upturn persuaded Make UK to raise its manufacturing growth forecast for 2021 to 7.8% from 3.9% previously.
""Manufacturing growth is now firmly accelerating as restrictions have been eased and economies around the globe have started to open up,"" said Fhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK.
""Looking forward there seems no reason to believe that this will not continue, assuming the shackles come off firmly in the second half of the year,"" he added.
Official data last week showed British manufacturing output in April remained 2.4% below its pre-pandemic level. Make UK estimated it would take until the end of 2022 to regain that level, less time than it had previously thought.
The survey's gauge of investment intentions showed growth for the first time since early 2020.

""It appears the government's introduction of the temporary super-deduction tax has provided the incentive manufacturers needed to bring forward their investment plans,"" said Richard Austin, head of manufacturing at BDO.

Compared with March, industrial output dropped 0.2% in seasonally adjusted terms as expansion in the mining sector was offset by declines in manufacturing, construction and energy, data published by national statistics office INEGI showed.
""Supply-chain frictions, cost-push pressures, lingering policy uncertainty, weak business confidence, and slow progress with the vaccination program are likely to weigh on the broad industrial sector for a while despite firmer external demand,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos.
The latest IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed factory activity shrinking for the 15th straight month in May due to subdued sales, raw material shortages and the COVID-19 crisis. Still, the rate of decline was the second-slowest since the pandemic hit.
In annual terms, output posted its largest jump in over 2-1/2 decades in April, rising by 35.7% in adjusted terms and by 36.6% in unadjusted terms. Both increases were the biggest registered in INEGI's online data bank, which extends back to 1994.

Industrial output hit bottom in May 2020 and has recovered as the economy gradually reopens, mobility increases, businesses adjust and external demand firms, said Goldman's Ramos, who anticipated ""significant positive spillovers from U.S. growth.""
The economy shrank by some 8.5% last year, the sharpest slump since the 1930s. Mexico is expected to recoup much of that in 2021, for which the government is forecasting 6.5% growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment rebounded in early June as inflation fears subsided and households grew more optimistic about future economic growth and employment, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index increased to 86.4 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 82.9 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 84.
""Stronger growth in the national economy was anticipated, with an all-time record number of consumers anticipating a net decline in unemployment,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. 
Curtin said the improvement in sentiment was largely led by middle-and higher-income households, reflecting the continued uneven nature of the economic recovery.
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions edged up to a reading of 90.6 from 89.4 in May. Its measure of consumer expectations rose to 83.8, the highest since February 2020, from 78.8. 
""Overall, taking into account the progress made in reopening and normalizing the economy as well as the state of the vaccine rollout, there is much more good in this report than bad,"" Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said in a note.
The survey's one-year inflation expectations fell to 4.0% from 4.6%, while its five-to-10-year inflation outlook dropped to 2.8% from 3.0% in May.
While consumers have a brighter view of the job market and economy than they did in May and their inflation worries eased somewhat, people still remain concerned about high prices for things such as cars and homes. 

""Spontaneous references to market prices for homes, vehicles, and household durables fell to their worst level since the all-time record in November 1974,"" Curtin said. ""These unfavorable perceptions of market prices reduced overall buying attitudes for vehicles and homes to their lowest point since 1982.""
""Consumers tend to overreact to inflation, predicting it will be higher than it turns out to be, especially in volatile times such as these,"" Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a note. ""However, inflation perceptions can quickly turn. Should supply chain issues in auto manufacturing get ironed out, and prices of new and used cars moderate or even fall, that will go a long way to quelling inflation fears.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic sped up in April as lockdown measures eased, with the fastest monthly growth since July leaving output a record 27.6% higher than a year earlier, when the virus was rampant and lockdown tightest.
The figures on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed rapid growth in the services sector as non-essential retail and hospitality businesses opened their doors after months of closure and schools fully restarted.
Economic output rose by 2.3% month-on-month in April, marking the fastest growth since July, the ONS said, and slightly above the Reuters poll consensus for a 2.2% increase.
""The jump in GDP in April was another sign that consumers are raring to spend as the economy reopens,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
However, British economic output remained 3.7% below its level in February 2020, before the pandemic led to lockdown measures, the ONS said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to fully lift lockdown restrictions in England on June 21, helped by a swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines that has brightened Britain's economic outlook.
But with the Delta variant of COVID-19 first detected in India spreading fast, Johnson has said the lifting of lockdown could be delayed.
April's growth came despite an unexpected 1.3% drop in industrial output, reflecting widespread maintenance of oil rigs and a shortage of computer chips for car manufacturers. 
Output in the services sector jumped by 3.4% in monthly terms in April - above all forecasts in the Reuters poll that pointed to growth of 2.8%.
Schools reopening added 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in April, while the retail and wholesale sector added 0.9 percentage points, the ONS said.
Construction output fell unexpectedly by 2.0% in April - although the ONS said this followed a hefty 5.8% jump in March.
""Today's figures are a promising sign that our economy is beginning to recover,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Last month the Bank of England raised its forecast for British economic growth in 2021 to 7.25% from February's estimate of 5.0%.
That would be the fastest annual growth since 1941 when Britain was rearming during World War Two. But it comes after output plunged by almost 10%, the biggest drop in more than 300 years.
Trade with the EU continues to be hurt by friction from new post-Brexit trade restrictions, though by less than at the start of the year.
Compared with three years ago - the last time trade was unaffected by either COVID or fears of an imminent disruptive Brexit - British goods exports to the EU this April were 7.1% lower and imports from the EU were 15.3% lower.

Exports to the EU were also below their average for 2019.
""That is a disappointing performance, given the boom in global trade flows; UK exporters have lost market share,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.

Overall sales in the world's biggest car market totaled 2.13 million vehicles in May, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
China sold 10.88 million vehicles between January and May, up 36% from the same period a year earlier.

The production index measures factory output in manufacturing, mining and electricity generation.
The expansion in April beat the 46.1% jump forecast by 10 economists in a Reuters poll, and sharply higher than the 9.3% rise recorded in March.
The previous record for industrial production was a 20.2% spike in March 2009.
The sharp improvement was reflective of recovery due to base effects from a coronavirus lockdown in March last year when the government shut down all economic activity, the Statistics Department said in a statement.
Manufacturing output rose 68% year-on-year in April, driven by demand for transport equipment and other manufactures, and non-metallic mineral products and basic metal and fabricated metal products, the department said.

Electricity output rose 14.3%, while mining rose for the first time since February last year by 22.9%, according to the data.
Malaysia's exports rose 63% in April, its quickest pace since 1998, on a rise in shipments in all categories except liquefied natural gas and transport equipment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a May deficit of $132 billion, about a third of the May 2020 deficit of $399 billion, as higher employment and an earlier tax deadline this year boosted receipts sharply, even as COVID-19 pandemic-related outlays grew, the U.S. Treasury said on Thursday.
Receipts for May rose 167% to $464 billion, an increase partly attributed to last year's delay of the Internal Revenue Service income tax filing deadline until July 15. This year's deadline shifted by a month to May 17.
The Treasury also said taxes withheld from wages increased by 20% to $204 billion during May compared to a year ago, while May corporate taxes rose to $18 billion from $2 billion last year.
Outlays for May increased 4% from a year earlier to $596 billion as benefits from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package continued to be paid out.

This spending also helped push the fiscal year-to-date deficit to a record $2.064 trillion from $1.88 trillion for the first eight months of the prior fiscal year, Treasury officials said.
Year-to-date receipts rose 29% from a year earlier to $2.607 trillion, while outlays grew 20% to $4.671 trillion.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business applications increased 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted 500,219 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 52,499 applications from corporations, down 0.8% from April. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 57,000, an increase of 0.9% from the prior month. 

Overall, business applications rose in three of four U.S. regions last month and were higher across most industries. Among the handful of declining industries, the largest drop was in retail, which recorded a 4.6% decline, with smaller drops seen in the wholesale and healthcare and social assistance industries and the unclassified category.

The consumer index of the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce fell to 44.7 in May from 46.0 in April, when an outbreak emerged that has accounted for most of Thailand's overall COVID-19 infections and deaths.
A sluggish rollout of vaccines and political uncertainty had also undermined consumer confidence in drivers for an economic recovery, university president Thanavath Phonvichai told a briefing.
If the outbreak can be controlled this month, the economic impact is estimated at 500 billion baht to 800 billion baht this year, he said, adding a commerce confidence index also hit a record low in May.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale prices rose at their fastest annual pace in 13 years reflecting higher commodity costs, data showed on Thursday, a sign global inflationary pressures are pinching firms already struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.
With companies seen slow in passing on the higher costs on to households, the uptick in wholesale inflation is unlikely to prod the Bank of Japan into withdrawing its massive stimulus any time soon, analysts say.
""We're seeing emerging signs of cost-push inflation. If this is not accompanied by rising wages, we could see Japanese consumers' purchasing power decline,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for their goods, rose 4.9% in May from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday, more than a median market forecast for a 4.5% increase.
It followed a 3.8% gain in April and was the biggest annual increase since September 2008, when a global spike in food and raw material costs pushed up a range of prices in Japan.
China also saw factory gate prices rise at their fastest annual pace in over 12 years, underscoring the tricky balance policymakers face in supporting their economies while keeping unwelcome inflationary pressures at bay.
The rise in raw material costs is particularly damaging for Japan, where state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic are cooling consumption and making it difficult for retailers to charge households more for their goods.
Core consumer prices - the key benchmark the BOJ looks at in setting monetary policy - fell 0.1% in April from a year, marking the ninth consecutive month of decline.
""Rising commodities prices reflecting the global economic recovery is pushing up wholesale prices for a broad range of goods,"" Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told a briefing on Japan's wholesale price data.
""The data shows companies are starting to pass on rising costs, though the gain in wholesale prices is driven more by external factors rather than domestic demand,"" he said.
Oil and coal prices jumped 53.5% in May, while prices of nonferrous metals were up 41.6%, as robust U.S. and Chinese demand boosted raw material costs, the BOJ data showed.

Wood and lumber prices were also up 9.7%, reflecting a shortage of raw material and rising demand across the world, Shimizu said.
Investors are increasingly worried pandemic-driven stimulus measures could supercharge inflation and force central banks to tighten policy, potentially curbing the recovery.

In the latest sign of the heat in the housing market, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' price index - which reflects the proportion of surveyors reporting price increases - rose for a fourth month to +83 from +76 in April.
""With the economy performing better than could have been expected even a short while ago and the cost of money still at rock bottom levels, the principal drivers supporting demand will remain in place even after the expiry of the stamp duty holiday,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said. 
""More challenging is the question of supply, a theme coming back strongly from respondents to the survey.""
As in many other countries, demand for housing in Britain has soared since the coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in working from home and a jump in demand for bigger properties.
RICS said the mismatch between rising new buyer enquires and falling new instructions by sellers was the widest since November 2013.
However, there were signs that more properties would be coming onto the market as appraisals increased and 12-month sales expectations were flat.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak, seeking to soften the COVID-19 hit to the economy, last year exempted the first 500,000 pounds ($707,500) of property purchases in England or Northern Ireland from the stamp duty tax. In March he extended the incentive until the end of June after which there will be a 250,000 pound tax-free allowance until the end of September.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Tuesday that Britain's housing market was ""on fire"" which would probably aggravate wealth inequalities in the country.
Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden has said there was a ""risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure."" 
Rubinsohn at RICS said government measures to speed up home-building had not convinced the industry that the shortage of properties available for sale would ease any time soon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. wholesale inventories increased strongly in April as businesses replenished stocks to meet pent-up demand, but supply constraints could make it harder to maintain the current pace of inventory rebuilding. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale inventories rose 0.8% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers advanced 1.2% in March. Wholesale inventories increased 5.2% in April from a year earlier. 
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that April's increase in wholesale inventories would be unrevised. 
""There are downside risks for the inventory build,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. ""Supply chain disruptions could become an even bigger problem, choking off producers' ability to restock depleted inventories.""
Manufacturers are battling shortages of raw materials and labor in the wake of pent-up demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy as vaccinations ease COVID-19's intensity. The supply constraints are underscored by a global semiconductor shortage, which is undercutting motor vehicle production as well as output of electrical equipment, appliances and components, raising prices and hurting sales of these goods. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product also increased 0.8%. Economists maintained their lofty second-quarter GDP growth estimates, mostly in the double-digit zone, but cautioned that bottlenecks in the supply chain posed a downside risk. 
Though wholesale inventories of motor vehicles rose in April, they were down 3.3% on a year-on-year basis. Computer equipment stocks fell 1.1% in April. 
Businesses ran down inventories in the first quarter amid a burst in domestic demand. The inventory drawdown subtracted nearly three percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a robust 6.4% annualized rate after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. 

Sales at wholesalers rose 0.8% in April after accelerating 4.3% in March. At April's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, unchanged from March. That is the shortest period since September 2014. 
""It reflects the robust demand as economies reopen, alongside the constraints on inventories amid supply chain disruptions, micro chip shortages, and rising commodity costs,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian inflation jumped to its highest monthly rate for May in a quarter century and the annual rate scaled 8% for the first time in nearly five years, figures showed on Wednesday, almost certainly confirming another punchy interest rate hike from the central bank next week.
The monthly and annual rates of increase in consumer prices were faster than economists had expected, and are likely to cast further doubt on policymakers' insistence that much of the recent rise in inflation is down to temporary shocks.
The 0.8% monthly rate of inflation, driven by electricity and housing costs, was the highest for any May since 1996 and the 8.1% annual rate was the first reading above 8% since September 2016, statistics agency IBGE said.
The median forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists were for 0.7% and 7.9%, respectively.
""Overall, the sheer pace of inflation will make for uncomfortable reading at the central bank,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics.
""Policymakers have given a clear steer that a 75bp hike in the Selic rate to 4.25% next week is on the cards. We suspect that they will signal another 75bp hike in August,"" he said.
All nine categories surveyed by IBGE showed rising prices in May. Housing costs, including electricity prices, rose 1.8% and accounted for a third of the overall rise, while transport, including fuel, rose 1.2% and accounted for just under a third of the total increase, IBGE said.
Electricity prices jumped 5.4% in the month. Brazil's worst drought in nearly a century is putting upward pressure on prices because a large part of the country's power is hydro-generated.

The central bank's year-end inflation goal is 3.75%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side. May's data shows inflation running well above even the 5.25% upper limit of that range.
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Tuesday that policymakers are ""100% committed"" to meeting their inflation goals, and that they still think much of the recent rise is due to temporary shocks.

(Reuters) - U.S. applications for home mortgages declined last week as refinancing dropped to its lowest level since February 2020 with fewer homeowners able to take advantage of lower rates during a holiday-shortened week.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index fell 3.1% in the week ending June 4 from a week earlier. This reflected a 5.1% decline in applications for refinancing and was 27% lower than the same week one year ago.
The purchase index increased 0.3% from a week earlier. The week's data included an adjustment for the Memorial Day holiday.
""Home-price growth continues to accelerate, driven by favorable demographics, the recovering job market and economy, and housing demand far outpacing supply,"" Joel Kan, an economist at the MBA, said in a statement. 

Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales recently, and a record-low percentage of U.S. consumers believe now is a good time to purchase a home.

Investors are increasingly worried pandemic-driven stimulus measures could supercharge global inflation and force central banks to tighten policy, potentially curbing the recovery.
China's producer price index (PPI) increased 9.0%, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday, as prices bounced back from last year's pandemic lows. 
The PPI rise in May - the fastest on-year gain for any month since September 2008 - was driven by significant price increases in crude oil, iron ore and non-ferrous metals, the NBS said. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI to rise 8.5% after a 6.8% increase in April. 
Shortly after the inflation data, the National Development and Reform Commission said China will closely monitor price movements of commodities and step up price forecasts to maintain market order.
""The worry is PPI may hover at an elevated level for an extended period of time, which would create economic headaches if mid- or downstream firms fail to absorb higher costs,"" said Nie Wen, chief economist at Hwabao Trust. 
The PPI surge has yet to substantially feed through to consumer inflation, meaning the People's Bank of China is unlikely to worry for now. 
Consumer prices rose 1.3% in May - the biggest year-on-year increase in eight months - but came in below expectations for a 1.6% gain. Consumer inflation remained well below the government's official target of around 3%.
""Producer price inflation is probably close to a peak...we don't expect (consumer price inflation) to rise much above 2% in the coming quarters. As such, (the data) is unlikely to trigger any shift in monetary policy,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
But there are some signs Chinese factories, facing already tight margins, are passing on higher raw material costs to overseas clients, which could reinforce the global inflation loop.

On a monthly basis, the PPI rose 1.6%, up from a 0.9% uptick in April. 
Power plants also stocked up on thermal coal to meet surging electricity demand during summer, resulting in a 10.6% month-on-month increase in prices in the coal mining and washing sector, up from 2.8% the previous month, said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician at the NBS. 
Prices for commodities including coal, steel, iron ore and copper, which affect the PPI, have surged this year, fuelled by post-lockdown recoveries in demand and ample global liquidity. 
China's imports in value terms grew at their fastest pace in 10 years in May, boosted by Chinese purchases of raw materials. 
Chinese policymakers have pledged to take measures to cool commodity prices and prevent them from being passed on to consumers.
Recent gains in the yuan had stirred speculation over whether policymakers wanted a stronger currency to offset growing imported price pressures, but the central bank told Reuters this week it will not use the exchange rate as a tool.
NBS data also showed food inflation rose 0.3% in May from a year earlier on higher prices for freshwater fish and eggs, despite still falling pork prices. That compared with a 0.7% drop in food prices in April.

Non-food prices, including airfares, gasoline and diesel prices, accelerated to 5.5%, likely bolstered by China's Labour Day Holiday at the start of May.
On a monthly basis, rising factory input costs have started to be passed onto consumers in the sales of fridges, televisions, laptops, construction materials and summer clothes, but their price gains remained mild, NBS's Dong said.

Investing.com – China’s factory-gate prices jumped in May to their highest level since 2008 driven by surging commodity prices. Consumer prices also increased for the third consecutive month but at a lower-than-expected pace.
The producer price index (PPI) increased 9.0% year-on-year in May, higher than forecasts for 8.5% and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. The rise was also higher than the 6.8% growth during the previous month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The jump in PPI was driven by price surges in crude oil, iron ore and non-ferrous metals, said the NBS in a statement. Commodity prices, including coal, steel, iron ore and copper, surged in 2021 driven by demand recovery in post-lockdown areas and ample global liquidity.
China’s PPI is likely to climb through the second and third quarters due to higher commodity prices and low bases in 2020 before moderating later in 2021, said People’s Bank of China.
China’s policymakers have pledged to take measures to curb soaring commodity prices, including increasing supplies of raw materials and cracking down on speculation and hoarding.
However, soaring producer prices have yet to pass through to consumer prices.
The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.3% year-on-year in May, lower than forecasts for1.6%. The CPI contracted 0.2% month-on-month in May.
Higher metal prices have mainly impacted upstream industries involved in the mining and processing of raw materials, and have had minimal influence on downstream industries like furniture and textiles, said Bloomberg Economics in an analysis.
Meanwhile, competition among smaller businesses intensified due to the rise of ecommerce and decrease in domestic demand, indicating that China’s factories are absorbing rising input costs rather than passing them on to consumers."

That left the index up 14.5% on June last year when the country was emerging from a round of nationwide lockdowns. The index reading of 107.2 showed optimists still outnumbered pessimists, although the margin was narrowing.

The producer price index climbed 9% from a year earlier, following a 6.8% gain in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 8.5% increase. Consumer prices increased 1.3% from a year ago, missing an estimate of 1.6%.
Commodity prices have rallied this year as the global recovery strengthened, pandemic-induced supply shortages persisted, and governments around the world pumped in record amounts of stimulus. Chinese policy makers have taken targeted steps to curb soaring prices, including measures to expand supply of raw materials and crack down on speculation and hoarding, while also dialing up their rhetoric to curtail costs.
So far, the impact of higher metal prices has showed up mainly in upstream industries involved in the mining and processing of raw materials, while price increases in downstream industries like furniture and textiles have been minimal, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Economics.
The pass through from PPI to consumer prices has also been limited, given that the link between the two has weakened. Intense competition among smaller businesses, spurred by the rise of e-commerce, and weak domestic demand means China’s factories are absorbing rising input costs rather than passing them on to consumers at home.
Authorities have said PPI will likely continue to climb through the second quarter before moderating in the second half of this year. However, the central bank is likely to avoid hiking interest rates in response to the inflation data and also keep liquidity in the banking system tightly balanced, economists say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged by nearly one million to a new record high in April, while more people voluntarily left their employment, strengthening the view that a recent moderation in job growth was due to supply constraints.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday also showed layoffs hit a record low in April. Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home because of trouble securing child care, generous unemployment benefits and lingering fears over COVID-19 even as vaccines are widely accessible and the pandemic is subsiding.
""The evidence continues to grow that the lackluster job creation of recent months is a result of constraints on labor supply and that the labor market is tight,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 998,000 to 9.3 million on the last day of April, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. Vacancies rose in all four regions and were spread across nearly all industries as well as the government sector. 
Unfilled jobs in the accommodation and food services increased by 349,000. There were an additional 115,000 job openings in other services, while vacancies at manufacturers of long-lasting goods increased 78,000. But job openings decreased in educational services and mining and logging industry.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 8.3 million in April. The job openings rate shot up to an all-time high of 6.0% from 5.4% in March.
Hiring inched up to 6.1 million in April from 6.0 million in the prior month. The government reported last Friday that job growth picked up in May, with employers raising wages, but the pace of hiring was below economists' expectations for a second straight month.
Companies are struggling to find workers even as about 9.3 million people are officially unemployed. Economists expect the labor market disconnect will be resolved in the fall. Government-funded unemployment benefits will end in early September. Republican governors in 25 states, accounting for more than 40% of the workforce, are ending federal government unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly subsidy, starting on Saturday. 
Schools are set to fully reopen in the fall and more people are expected to be vaccinated against COVID-19. At least half of the adult American population is fully inoculated. 
The JOLTS report also showed 384,000 people voluntarily quit their jobs in April, lifting the total to a record 4.0 million. About 106,000 retail workers left their jobs, while professional and business services saw 94,000 resignations. 
In the transportation, warehousing and utilities industry, 49,000 workers quit. The number of quits rose in the South, Midwest and West regions. The quits rate increased to an all-time high of 2.7% from 2.5% in March.
The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But nearly 1.8 million women have left the labor force since February 2020 mostly because of problems related to child care.
With willing workers scarce, layoffs and discharges dropped by 81,000 to a record low 1.4 million. There was a 0.95 open job per unemployed person in April. Rising job openings and voluntary quits could pressure employers to raise wages.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
TRADE GAP NARROWS
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the reopening economy was leading to a shift in domestic demand back to services from goods, with the trade deficit retreating from a record high in April as imports fell.
The trade deficit dropped 8.2% to $68.9 billion in April. The gap widened to a record $75.0 billion in March. Economists had forecast a $69.0 billion trade deficit.
Goods imports dropped 1.9% to $232.0 billion. The decline was led by a $2.6 billion drop in imports of consumer goods, which reflected decreases in textile apparel, toys, games and sporting goods as well as household appliances. Imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines also fell. 
But imports of cell phones and other household goods increased. Imports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record as were of those of capital goods. Imports of services increased $0.7 billion to $41.9 billion in April. They were lifted by travel and transport services.
""With the pandemic coming under control, consumers are redirecting their spending towards domestically produced services and away from imports,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Exports of goods gained 1.1% to a record $145.3 billion, boosted shipments of civilian aircraft. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record, with crude oil shipments rising $1.0 billion. But exports of motor vehicles, parts and engines fell. Auto production has been hit by a global semiconductor shortage. 
Exports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record. Exports of services increased $0.7 billion amid small gains in travel, transport and charges for the use of intellectual property.
At $17.8 billion in April, the services surplus was the smallest since August 2012. Exports are likely to continue rising as global economic growth gains momentum.

When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $7.2 billion to $98.6 billion in April. 
Trade was a drag on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, after the economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the third quarter.

(Reuters) - U.S. small-business confidence edged lower last month, the first decline in four months, as a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries weighed on business owners' economic outlook, according to a survey released on Tuesday. 
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index fell 0.2 point to a reading of 99.6 in May after three straight monthly increases. Five of the 10 index components improved, three declined and two were unchanged.
""If small business owners could hire more workers to take care of customers, sales would be higher and getting closer to pre-COVID levels,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. ""In addition, inflation on Main Street is rampant and small business owners are uncertain about future business conditions.""
A net 27% of businesses plan to create new jobs in the next three months, up 6 points from April and a record high. Last week, the trade group said in its monthly jobs report that a record-high 48% of small-business owners reported unfilled job openings in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 44% in April.
The quality of labor ranked as businesses' ""single most important problem,"" with 26% of respondents selecting it from among 10 issues, near the survey high of 27%. Some 57% of respondents said they had few or no qualified applicants for open jobs, up from 54% in April.

The NFIB survey comes on the heels of Friday's employment report from the government, which showed the U.S. economy added 559,000 jobs in May and employers lifted wages to compete for workers as millions of Americans remain at home because of childcare issues, enhanced unemployment benefits and ongoing worries about COVID-19.
Businesses in the NFIB survey also flagged inflation as a worry, and a record 43% plan to increase prices in the next three months.

BERLIN (Reuters) -A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods drove an unexpected fall in German industrial output in April, a further sign that massive supply bottlenecks are hampering the recovery in Europe's largest economy.
The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output dropped 1.0% on the month after a downwardly revised increase of 2.2% in March. A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.5% rise in April.
The drop in the headline figure was driven by a decrease in consumer goods production of more than 3% and a plunge in construction activity of more than 4%.
The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
""Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry.
So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said.
The economy ministry said industrial output was being hampered by supply bottlenecks for intermediate products such as semiconductors and timber. But it added that business sentiment surveys were suggesting an improvement in coming months.
Germany's Ifo business sentiment brightened in May to hit a two-year high as COVID-19 curbs were eased and infections fell, suggesting a swift summer recovery after the economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter.
Investor sentiment in Germany fell in June but remained at a high level and expectations for a strong economic recovery for the next six months are intact, a survey by the ZEW economic research institute showed on Tuesday.
The ZEW's survey of investors' economic sentiment fell to 79.8 points from 84.4 in the previous month. But a separate ZEW gauge of current conditions surged to -9.1 points from -40.1.
""The economic recovery is progressing,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. ""The decline in expectations is probably largely due to the considerably better assessment of the economic situation, which is now back at pre-crisis levels.""
""The financial market experts therefore continue to expect a strong economic recovery for the next six months,"" he added.
Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics said the chip shortages were likely to continue to constrain the recovery but that it should be a temporary problem.
Industrial output should recover somewhat in May and June which should enable overall economic growth of at least 1% in the second quarter, Kenningham added.
In the first quarter, German GDP contracted by 1.8% on the quarter and by 3.1% on the year, significantly weaker readings than the euro zone average.

On Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the virtual opening of a Bosch semiconductor plant in Dresden that the chip shortages in manufacturing were complicating Germany's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
The problem has forced many German companies to announce short-time work and scale back production, with the scarcity of components also expected to lead to higher end-prices for consumers and overall inflationary pressures.

Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro contracted 0.3% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.3% year-on-year decline. These compared with estimates three weeks ago of respectively -0.6% and -1.8%.
Italy grew marginally, against a previous estimate of a dip, and France dipped, against an earlier estimate of growth. Germany was very slightly weaker, while a number of smaller countries were more positive. 
Eurostat said rising inventories added 0.7 percentage points to the overall quarterly figure in the January-March period and investment and trade each added another 0.1 points.
Falling household consumption, hit by pandemic lockdowns including of shops across Europe, subtracted 1.2 points and government spending was neutral.

The 0.3% GDP contraction comes after a 0.6% GDP quarterly fall in the previous three months, meaning the euro zone economy was in its second technical recession since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Eurostat said also employment fell 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in January-March and was down 1.8% year-on-year.

239,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>","BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's industries sentiment dropped for a second straight month in May, hitting an 11-month low, due to a third wave of coronavirus infections and a slow vaccine rollout, an industries group said on Tuesday.
The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) said its Thai industries sentiment index fell to 82.3 last month from 84.3 in April, when its biggest outbreak so far emerged.
The tourism-reliant country started its mass vaccination drive on Monday and is preparing a phased reopening to vaccinated foreign visitors later this year, dependent on its progress with inoculations.
""The third wave has yet resolved while new clusters continue to emerge, especially in factories, affecting the manufacturing sector. Vaccinations have also been slow,"" FTI chairman Supant Mongkolsuthree told a briefing. 
Thailand on Tuesday reported 2,662 new infections and 28 new deaths, with the current outbreak accounting for more than 80% of its total and about 93% of fatalities.

The index for the next three months, however, picked up from April on optimism over the government's economic stimulus packages and increased exports, a key driver of Thai growth.
The FTI urged the government to accelerate the vaccinations to create herd immunity, plus introduce additional financial measures to support smaller businesses, particularly in the tourism sector, which has yet to recover.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy shrank less than initially reported in the first quarter on smaller cuts to plant and equipment spending, but the coronavirus pandemic still dealt a huge blow to overall demand.
Separate data showed growth in bank lending slowed sharply in May, while real wages posted the biggest monthly jump in more than a decade in April, in signs that the world's third-largest economy was gradually overcoming last year's pandemic hit.
Among the mixed indicators are some reassuring signs for policymakers, who are worried Japan's recovery will lag major economies that have rolled out COVID-19 vaccines much quicker and are able to reopen faster.
The economy shrank by an annualised 3.9% in January-March, not as bad as the preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction, but still posting the first fall in three quarters, Cabinet Office data showed Tuesday.
The reading, which beat economists' forecast for a 4.8% decline, equals a real quarter-on-quarter contraction of 1.0% from the prior quarter, versus a preliminary 1.3% drop.
The revised gross domestic product (GDP) decline was mainly due to a smaller fall in public and capital spending, which both eased less than initially thought, offsetting a slightly larger fall in private consumption.
""Overall, capital spending and private consumption remained weak, which showed weakness in domestic demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The vaccine issue is the most important thing for the (economic) recovery,"" he said, adding that the vaccination rate would need to come to about 50% to boost economic recovery prospects.
Capital spending shrank 1.2% from the prior quarter, better than a preliminary 1.4% decrease, and matching the median forecast for a 1.2% loss. Government consumption fell 1.1%, a smaller drop than a preliminary 1.8% decline.
Private consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product, dropped 1.5% from the previous three months, worse than the initial estimate of an 1.4% drop.
However, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said spending could recover as consumers return to the streets.
""If infections subside, there'll be pent-up demand from not having been able to go eating out or travelling,"" Nishimura told reporters after the release of the data.
PANDEMIC IMPACT
Net exports - or exports minus imports - subtracted 0.2 percentage point from growth, while the hit to domestic demand pulled it down by 0.8 percentage point, not as bad as a preliminary contribution of minus 1.1 percentage point.
The better-than-expected revision comes after household spending and exports jumped in April, though the gains were inflated largely by the comparison to last year's deep pandemic-driven plunge.
Total lending by Japan's banks grew 2.9% in May from a year earlier, slowing at a record pace from a 4.8% increase in April, Bank of Japan data showed on Tuesday.
Inflation-adjusted wages, a barometer of household purchasing power, rose 2.1% in April on a year-on-year basis, the government said.
The bank lending slowdown was due largely to the base effect of a COVID-driven surge last year, while a drop in consumer prices and rebounds in overtime pay and compensation for part-time workers helped lift wages.
Separately, Japan's service sector index, based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff, fell one point from April to 38.1 in May, down for a second straight month, a Cabinet Office survey showed.

The government has come under political pressure to water down an already stretched fiscal target this year as the cost to combat the health crisis accumulates.
Some analysts expect Japan's economy will contract again in the current quarter - pushing it back into a technical recession - as an extension of coronavirus emergency curbs for Tokyo and other major areas hurts domestic demand.

National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s index of business conditions climbed 5 points to +37 in May, after jumping 8 points in April, with strength reported across all industries.
The survey's measure of confidence eased 3 points to +20, though that was still high historically.
""Conditions rose further, and in particular trading conditions are at a massive +47 index points,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""Confidence was slightly softer but remains very high and the pipeline of work as measured by forward orders held at a high level.""
The survey measure for trading, or sales, rose 6 points to reach +47, while profitability gained 6 points to +40 and employment 5 points to +25.
Capacity utilisation dipped slightly to a still high 85.1%, after surging in April, while forward orders held firm at +26.
""This was another very strong read for the business sector and forward indicators point to ongoing strength in the near-term,"" said Oster. ""The economy now appears to be entering a new period of growth after a very rapid rebound.""

Data out last week showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew a brisk 1.8% in the first quarter of the year to reach its pre-pandemic levels.
The NAB survey was conducted from 18-28 May, catching just the start of the Victoria lockdown on May 27 which will likely have some dampening impact on consumer spending.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages posted the biggest monthly rise in more than a decade in April as overtime pay and compensation of part-timers rebounded, although the gains were inflated due to the comparison with last year's pandemic-driven fall.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key measure of households' purchasing power, rose 2.1% in April year-on-year to post their largest monthly gain since July 2010, the labour ministry said on Tuesday.
The rise in inflation-adjusted real wages was partly due to a 0.5% drop in the consumer price index, as the health crisis caused prices to weaken, as well as a year-on-year rebound in compensation for part-time workers.
The figures especially underline how big an impact the coronavirus crisis has had on Japan's economy in the last year, although it is still leaving its mark on economic activity.
Nominal total cash earnings gained 1.6% in April from a year earlier, up for the second straight month, following a 0.6% rise in March, according to the data.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - rose for the fourth straight month, gaining 0.9%.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, jumped 6.4% in April compared the same month a year earlier, posting its first year-on-year rise since August 2019. Special payments rose 8.5% in April.

The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who were employed for more than one month at a company that employed more than five people, or 2) those who were employed on a daily basis or had less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted, at a company that employs more than five people.

The British Retail Consortium said total sales among its members, who include supermarkets and high-street chains, were 10.0% higher last month than in May two years ago.
This was the biggest increase in sales compared with 2019 for any month since the start of the pandemic.
""The rain in May failed to dampen consumer demand and shoppers continued to return to the high street,"" Paul Martin, head of retail at survey sponsor KPMG, said.
Compared with May 2020, when most non-food retailers were shut due to lockdown restrictions, total sales were 28.4% higher.
Clothes, shoes and furniture saw especially strong gains in sales, the BRC said, benefiting from shoppers being able to view goods in person since non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen in April after months of closure.
Relaxed restrictions on socialising also encouraged shoppers to buy new summer clothes.
Payment processor Barclaycard, which sees almost half of credit and debit card transactions, said consumer spending was 7.6% higher than in May two years ago.
Pubs and restaurants were able to serve customers indoors from May 17, though only at reduced capacity.

Barclaycard said spending at restaurants last month was still 54% below its level two years ago, while spending at pubs and bars was 19% lower. But this was an improvement from April when sales were down 74% and 67% respectively.
Foreign travel remains highly restricted. Spending with airlines was 74% lower than in May 2019, little better than April.

(Reuters) - A record-low percentage of U.S. consumers believe now is a good time to buy a home, with worries about surging prices and a small supply of houses on the market outweighing improved sentiment about their jobs and income, a survey from home financing giant Fannie Mae showed on Monday. 
The percentage of consumers who said it is a good time to buy a home declined in May to 35% from 47%, Fannie Mae said in its monthly survey of the U.S. housing market. This reading, the lowest since Fannie Mae began the survey about a decade ago, marked the second straight monthly decline and represented a drop of 18 percentage points since March. 
In comparison, the percentage of consumers indicating that now is a bad time to purchase a home increased to 56% from 48% last month. 
The data is part of Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI), which increased by 1.0 point to 80.0 last month and is up 12.5 points from a year earlier. The index's record high was 93.8 in August 2019.
""The 'good time to buy' component fell further - hitting another all-time survey low – as consumers appear to be acutely aware of higher home prices and the low supply of homes, the two reasons cited most frequently for that particular sentiment,"" Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan said in a statement.

The improvement of a U.S. economy that had been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic has left a challenging environment for home buyers.

248,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 08:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer sentiment rose last month to its highest level since April 2016, bolstered by expectations of greater job security and rising house prices, polling company YouGov said on Monday.
The YouGov/Cebr figures add to signs of a rapid rebound in Britain's economy in the second quarter when lockdown restrictions in place since the start of the year eased for many retailers, pubs and restaurants.
""Undeterred by the unusually wet weather last month, UK consumers have clearly made the most of their newfound freedoms and spent freely in shops and the hospitality sector,"" said Kay Neufeld, head of forecasting at economic consultants Cebr.
Economists polled by Reuters expect on average that April gross domestic product data due on Friday will show a 2.2% rise from March and will be a massive 27.6% higher than a year earlier, when Britain was in the depths of its first lockdown.
The biggest contribution to the increase in the YouGov/Cebr index came from components measuring house prices and expected job security.
Mortgage lender Halifax reported earlier on Monday that house prices last month were 9.5% above their level a year earlier, the biggest increase in nearly seven years.

Business surveys also point to a sharp bounce back.
But the picture is more muted from Britain's longest-running survey of consumer sentiment, which does not ask about house prices and places a greater weight on households' experience over the past year. This measure, published by GfK, shows sentiment back at roughly its pre-pandemic level in April.

249,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's imports grew at their fastest pace in 10 years in May, fuelled by surging demand for raw materials, although export growth slowed more than expected amid disruptions caused by COVID-19 cases at the country's major southern ports.
While a brisk recovery in developed markets has bolstered demand for Chinese products, a global semiconductor shortage, higher raw material and freight costs, logistics bottlenecks and a strengthening yuan have dimmed the outlook for the world's largest exporting nation.
China's exports in dollar terms in May grew 27.9% from a year earlier, slower than the 32.3% growth reported in April and missing analysts' forecast of 32.1%.
""Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the COVID cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that turnover at ports in Guangdong will likely remain slow in June.
Major shipping companies warned clients of worsening congestion at Shenzhen's Yantian port in Guangdong province after the discovery of several cases among port staff.
On the ground in Guangdong, factories have yet to report widespread capacity cuts over the outbreak but admitted efficiency issues as they tried to meet overseas demand. 
Chen Linsheng, chief operating officer at Anlan, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of skincare and beauty-care devices, told Reuters while there was no impact on production, staff are now subject to a series of COVID tests and not allowed back into the factory without a negative result.
""We are not allowed going out (of the city). We need to report in advance and cannot even go to Guangzhou or Foshan on our own,"" said Chen, adding that a lot of meetings have moved back online.
Besides the impact of COVID cases in Guangdong, the global chip shortage has started to hit all of China's export items related to semiconductors, said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING.
For example, auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4% from a year earlier, Pang added.
Two-year average growth for exports dropped to 23.4% in May from 36.3% in April, pointing to weaker export momentum as the reopening of developed economies reduce demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and work-from-home (WFH) products, analysts at Nomura said in a note.
At the same time, the currency's extended rally in recent weeks to near three-year highs against the dollar could further saddle U.S. consumers with higher prices.
PRICE-DRIVEN SURGE
Imports increased 51.1% on year last month in dollar terms, the fastest growth since January 2011 but slower than the 51.5% rise tipped by the Reuters poll.
However, that figure -- a gauge of import values, not volumes -- was partly flattered by hot raw materials prices with demand for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper driven by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said while import prices increased at a rapid pace, import volumes probably edged down in May.
""Once again, supply constraints are partly to blame – inbound shipments of semiconductors continued to drop back,"" he said. ""So too did imports of industrial metals.""

The Federal Statistics Offices said orders for industrial goods fell by 0.2% in seasonally adjusted terms, the first drop this year after three successive increases.
The reading confounded a Reuters forecast of a 1.0% rise and came after an upwardly revised increase of 3.9% in March. 
A breakdown of the data showed that domestic demand fell by 4.3% while foreign demand rose by 2.7%.
Both consumer and capital goods posted an increase while intermediate goods contracted by 1%, the data showed.
The German economy contracted by 1.8% in the first quarter as lockdown restrictions in place since November dampened household spending and raw material shortages created manufacturing bottlenecks.
The German economy has withstood the pandemic much better than in neighbouring France or in Italy, mainly as a result of an unprecedented rescue package introduced by Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition government and a decision to keep factories open during three waves of COVID-19.
Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, linked the slight drop in orders to supply chain disruptions that were exacerbated by the blockage of the Suez Canal in early April.
""After the very disappointing start to the second quarter, with retail sales dropping by 5.5% month-on-month in April, the second hard data point for the quarter suggests that the expected rebound of the German economy has been slower than expected,"" Brzeski wrote in a note.

""The rebound in German industry is set to continue, only not necessarily following a straight line,"" he added.
Germany holds a national election in September. Merkel's conservative bloc holds a slight edge in polls over the ecologist Greens and the two parties are tipped to form a coalition after the election.

Investing.com – Chinese imports grew at their fastest pace in a decade in May, boosted by the recent surge in commodity prices. However, export growth was lower than expected in the same month.
Trade data released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day showed that imports grew 51.1% year-on-year, just below the 51.5% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but above April's 43.1% figure. The growth was the fastest since January 2011.
Meanwhile, the data also said that exports grew 27.9% year-on-year, below both the 32.1% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and April’s 32.3% figure. The trade balance stood at $45.53 billion, below the $50.5 billion in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but above April’s $42.86 billion figure.
A recovery in demand in developed markets such as the U.S. continued to boost China’s economy, alongside COVID-19 disruptions in other manufacturing nations that also gave exports a boost. However, exporters faced the challenges of higher raw material and freight costs, logistics bottlenecks and a strengthening yuan.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have climbed in 2021, thanks to easing COVID-19 restrictive measures alongside abundant liquidity globally.
The yuan has also extended a recent rally that saw it climb to near three-year heights against the dollar. The Chinese currency’s strength has yet to make a dent in the country’s trade surplus but could mean continuously higher prices for U.S. consumers.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed total job ads jumped 7.9% in May from April, when they rose 4.9%.
At 213,894, ads were at their highest level since 2008 and up almost 220% on a year earlier when a national pandemic lockdown shut many industries. The latest shutdown in Victoria had yet to make an impact.
""The Victorian lockdown is unlikely to derail the state’s labour market recovery,"" said ANZ senior economist, Catherine Birch. 
""Even if we see some employment losses in June, as long as restrictions start easing from 11 June as currently planned, workers should be reinstated or find new jobs quite quickly, given the underlying strength in the labour market.""
Unemployment has fallen much quicker than policy makers expected to hit 5.5% in April, down from a pandemic peak of 7.5% reached in July last year.
ANZ see the jobless rate at 4.8% by year end and 4.4% at the end of 2022.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth and inflation after years of tepid gains.

The Resolution Foundation, a think tank that studies living standards, said low-paid workers were returning to their jobs from furlough leave in large numbers.
But the furlough scheme, which has a high concentration of low-paid workers in sectors like hospitality, is due to close in September - raising the risk that many of these workers will be left unemployed, the Resolution Foundation said. 
Its research showed workers ranked in the bottom fifth for pay were three times more likely to have lost jobs, hours or have been furloughed than the top-paid fifth.
""Big risks still lie ahead. Low-paid workers are most at risk from the expected rise in unemployment later this year, which also risks causing greater job insecurity,"" said Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.

""The government can salute the vital contribution of Britain's low-paid workers by offering them a new post-pandemic settlement – from better pay via a higher National Living Wage to greater security of working hours, and proper enforcement to tackle labour market abuses.""

(Reuters) - Fewer Americans are citing the coronavirus pandemic as the reason why they're not looking for work as more people are getting vaccinated and unemployment steadily declines. 
The Labor Department on Friday reported that 2.5 million people did not look for work in May because of COVID-19, down from 2.85 million the month before and 9.7 million a year ago. That represents about 2.5% of the roughly 100 million working-age Americans who were not in the labor force in May versus 9.5% of those not working or looking for a job a year ago. 
""With more ... of the U.S. adult population now fully vaccinated and daily case counts steadily declining, we believe hurdles related to COVID have continued to subside and led some workers to return to the labor force in May,"" said Shannon Seery, Economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Nearly 52% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination, according to a Reuters tally, while almost 42% have been fully vaccinated.
The figures on those not looking for work due to COVID came alongside the government's monthly employment report, which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 559,000 jobs in May after rising 278,000 in April. 
The Labor Department in May 2020 began asking households an additional set of questions about how COVID was affecting their ability to work, and last month's data showed a fourth straight monthly decline in those blaming the pandemic for keeping them on the sidelines of the job market.
""An improving health situation would make COVID less of a factor in individuals’ decision not to look for work,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics. 

Additionally, the report showed just 25.2 million Americans either teleworked or worked from home in May as a result of COVID, representing 16.6% of the nearly 152 million people working last month. That's down by roughly half from last May's 48.7 million people who were working remotely, then more than a third of all those employed. 
More employers have begun calling workers back to offices, and waves of businesses that need staff on site, like restaurants, have reopened in recent weeks as pandemic restrictions have eased.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers increased hiring in May and raised wages as they competed for workers, with millions of unemployed Americans still at home because of childcare issues, generous unemployment checks and lingering fears over COVID-19.
Though the pickup in job growth shown in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday missed economists' forecasts, it gave assurance that the recovery from the pandemic recession remained on track.
The economy is being supported by vaccinations against the virus, massive fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance. April's nonfarm payrolls count, which delivered about a quarter of the new jobs economists had forecast, caused handwringing among some analysts and investors that growth was stagnating at a time when inflation was rising.
""There are still a lot of people unemployed, but there does not seem to be a lot of eagerness to work,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""There would have been many more hires if employers could find more people.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 559,000 jobs last month after rising 278,000 in April. That left employment about 7.6 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 650,000 jobs created in May. About 9.3 million people were classified as unemployed last month. There are a record 8.1 million unfilled jobs.
With at least half of the American population fully vaccinated, authorities across the country have lifted virus-related restrictions on businesses, which nearly paralyzed the economy early in the pandemic. But the reopening economy is straining the supply chain.
Though women took 56.2% of the jobs created last month, they constitute a large share of the millions of workers still at home as most school districts have not moved to full-time in-person learning. Nearly 1.8 million women have left the labor force since February 2020.
Despite vaccines being widely accessible, some segments of the population are reluctant to get inoculated, discouraging some people from returning to work. Government-funded benefits, including a $300 weekly unemployment subsidy, are also constraining hiring.
Republican governors in 25 states, accounting for more than 40% of the workforce, are terminating this benefit and other unemployment programs funded by the federal government starting next Saturday.
The expanded benefits end in early September across the country, which together with more people vaccinated and schools fully reopening in the fall, is expected to ease the worker crunch.
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said claims that enhanced benefits were discouraging jobseeking were not supported by what workers were telling him.
""Working people across America are eager to work,"" said Walsh in a statement. ""But workers also told me about the challenges they and their families face, finding affordable childcare, caring for elderly parents and grandparents""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

WILLING WORKERS SCARCE
But labor shortages could remain a fixture. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey on Friday showed 61% of unemployed people were in no hurry to return to work. Three in 10 said they did not expect to resume working this year, with nearly half of those indicating they never plan to work again.
Average hourly earnings rose a solid 0.5% after shooting up 0.7% in April. That raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 2.0% from 0.4% in April. Wages in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped 1.3%, the third straight month of gains above 1%.
Postings on Poachedjobs.com, a national job board for the restaurant/hospitality industry, are showing restaurants offering as much as $30-$35 per hour for lead line cooks.
Sustained wage growth could strengthen the argument among some economists that higher inflation could persist rather than being transitory as currently envisioned by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. A measure of underlying inflation tracked by the Fed for its 2% target accelerated 3.1% on a year-on-year basis in April, the largest increase since July 1992.
Still, most economists do not expect the U.S. central bank to start withdrawing its massive economic support anytime soon.
""It is unlikely to convince Powell that progress has been 'substantial' enough just yet to start signaling tapering,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
The average workweek held steady at 34.9 hours. That together with strong wage gains lifted an income proxy 0.9%, matching April's gain. This bodes well for consumer spending, which could also get a powerful tailwind from the more than $2.3 trillion in excess savings amassed during the pandemic.
Economists are sticking to their forecasts for double-digit growth this quarter.
Last month's increase in hiring was led by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 292,000 jobs, with restaurants and bars accounting for 186,000 of those positions. Local government education employment rose by 53,000 jobs as the resumption of in-person learning and other school-related activities in some parts of the country continued.
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 23,000 jobs. But construction employment decreased by 20,000 jobs.
 
Graphic: Jobs by industry - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/jznpnrzdxpl/chart.png
 

The unemployment rate fell to 5.8% from 6.1% in April. The drop was in part due to 53,000 people leaving the labor force. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this problem, the unemployment rate would have been 6.1% and about 8.5% accounting for those outside the labor force.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 61.6% from 61.7% in April. Men dropped out of the labor force last month, while 204,000 women returned.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada lost more jobs than expected in May amid continued lockdowns to curb a harsh third wave of COVID-19, data showed on Friday, but economists were quick to predict a rush of hiring in June as those restrictions ease.
Some 68,000 jobs were lost in May, Statistics Canada said, more than the average analyst forecast for a loss of 20,000. The unemployment rate climbed to 8.2%, in line with expectations. Employment is now 3% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said.
""I am hopeful that this is the last down-print we have before we release a fury of hiring activity starting in June,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Market Economics at Scotiabank.
Many Canadian provinces are easing restrictions as new COVID-19 infections plummet and more Canadians get their jab. Canada has administered first doses to about 60% of its adult population, with just over 6% fully vaccinated.
That should bolster the reopening of ""high-contact"" service sectors, where employment remains furthest below pre-pandemic levels, with hiring set to ramp up in subsequent months as businesses respond to a surge of pent-up demand. 
""With households sitting on an exceptionally large stockpile of savings built up during the pandemic, that recovery could accelerate relatively quickly over the summer,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC, in a note.
While the Canadian economy has not weathered the third of wave of infections quite as well as it did the second, the expected second-half boom should allow the Bank of Canada to look past the disappointing May numbers, economists said.
""The Bank of Canada will fully look through it,"" said Holt. ""(The data) will be less choppy as we go into the second half of the year.""
The Bank of Canada is expected to taper its asset purchase program again in the third quarter and has signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as late 2022. 
Part-time and full-time employment both dropped in May, and jobs were lost in the goods sector for the first time since April 2020. 

Long-term unemployment held relatively steady, while the participation rate for core-age women fell for the second consecutive month in May, dipping back below pre-pandemic levels. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% higher at 1.2082 to the greenback, or 82.77 U.S. cents, as the U.S. dollar broadly lost ground.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders dropped 0.6% in April after increasing 1.4% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders slipping 0.2%. Orders surged 14.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services during the pandemic. But the strong demand is straining supply chains. The Institute for Supply Management reported this week that manufacturing activity picked up in May, but noted that companies were struggling to fill orders because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
Factory goods orders in April were weighed down by a 6.1% decrease in orders for motor vehicles and parts. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.7%.
Unfilled orders at factories gained 0.2% after rising 0.5% in March. The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, surged 2.2% in April instead of 2.3% as reported last month.

Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.9%, unrevised from last month's estimate. 
Business investment on equipment has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last three quarters, also driven by massive fiscal stimulus to soften the blow to the economy from the public health crisis.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy expanded in January-to-March 2020 at a faster pace compared to last year's fourth quarter, helped by investments, the country's statistics service (ELSTAT) said on Friday.
Seasonally adjusted data showed gross domestic product grew 4.4% from an upwardly revised 3.4% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The data showed the economy shrank at an annual 2.3% clip in the first quarter, at a slower pace from a downwardly revised 6.9% decline in the previous quarter.
""Looking at quarterly data, the impact of the pandemic continued to subside with the economy on an expansion track for the third consecutive quarter,"" said National Bank's senior economist Nikos Magginas.
Investments were the main driver behind the economy's performance in this year's first quarter with net exports continuing to weigh, he said.
The government's official projection is for a 3.6% rebound this year after last year's 8.2% economic slump. The European Commission's projection in February sees Greece's economy growing by 3.5% this year.
""Despite the high cost it incurred to confront the health crisis, the Greek economy showed endurance, stamina,"" Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said in a statement.

Earlier this week International Monetary Fund officials said the economy should grow by 3.3% this year and 5.4% in 2022, fuelled by European recovery fund investment, pent-up consumer demand and an expected return of tourism.
""Based on the first quarter's performance we see upside risks, the economy is likely to rebound by more than 4.7% on an annual basis, particularly if there is a positive contribution from the external sector, mainly tourism,"" Magginas said.

Eurostat said sales of non-food products, excluding fuel for cars, plunged 5.1% on the month though were a 42.6% higher than in April 2020. Sales of automotive fuel were 0.4% higher on the month and a massive 65.5% higher year-on-year.
Retail sales are seen as a proxy indicator for consumer demand. That is in turn key for trends in inflation, which the European Central Bank wants to keep below but close to 2% over the medium term. It already reached 2% in May and is likely to move higher, even if only temporarily, this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely shrank slightly less than initially estimated in the first quarter, a Reuters poll showed, though state of emergency curbs to combat the coronavirus pandemic are seen keeping any rebound in the current quarter modest.
Separate data due next week will also show wholesale prices continued to rise sharply in May, a sign rising raw material costs are squeezing corporate profits, the poll also showed on Friday.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data will likely show the world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 4.8% in January-March, less than a preliminary reading of a 5.1% drop, according to economists polled by Reuters.
The revision largely reflects a smaller-than-expected fall in capital expenditure, after incorporating the Ministry of Finance's quarterly corporate survey released after the preliminary GDP announcement.
Despite the upward revision, many analysts remain cautious about Japan's economic outlook as extended state of emergency curbs weigh on consumption, offsetting the boost to growth from robust exports.
""We expect Japan's economy to suffer two straight quarters of contraction in April-June as chip supply shortages hurt car output and state of emergency curbs weigh on consumption,"" said Saisuke Sakai, an economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies.
Automakers across the globe, including those in Japan, have suffered disruptions in output due to a shortage of semiconductors, which some makers blame on a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from the pandemic.
The government will release revised January-March GDP data on June 8 at 8:50 a.m. (June 7, 2350GMT).
Japan's wholesale prices likely rose 4.5% in May from a year earlier after jumping 3.6% in April, according to the poll.

While the increase is due partly to the base effect of last year's plunge caused by the pandemic, it also reflects rising energy and commodities costs that could worsen terms of trade for an economy heavily reliant on raw material imports.
The Bank of Japan will release the wholesale price data on June 10 at 8:50 a.m. (June 9, 2350GMT).

Although the statistical base effects of sharp declines seen a year ago are seen keeping trade growth elevated, real demand has also made a significant recovery.
Exports are expected to have risen 32.1% in May from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 economists, largely in line with a 32.3% gain in April.
Imports likely rose 51.5% in May versus a year ago, the poll showed, higher than the 43.1% growth in April. Analysts attributed the jump to surging commodity prices, revived domestic demand and a low base effect.
China's commerce ministry said on Thursday it expects outbound shipments to maintain good momentum in the first half of 2021.
""Demand in developed economies stayed elevated in May, and the resurgence of coronavirus cases in emerging markets has led to slow production and continued shift of orders to China,"" said analysts with China Minsheng Bank.
Solid demand was seen in U.S. and European factory surveys, which showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest clip in years.
However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs, logistics bottlenecks and a strengthening yuan, which diminishes trade competitiveness.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
China's policymakers have expressed concern about rising commodity prices in recent weeks and called for stricter management of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation.""
The yuan is near three-year highs against the U.S. dollar, having risen 1.4% over the past four weeks.
China's official PMI on Monday showed factory activity growth slowed slightly in May as raw materials costs shot up, weighing on the output of small and export-oriented firms. 
The trade surplus is expected to be $50.5 billion in May, widening from $42.86 billion in April, the poll showed. The data will be released on Monday.

""The pandemic-induced surge in China's share of global exports is likely to reverse in the coming quarters as virus disruptions fade and global consumption patterns return closer to normal,"" said analysts with Capital Economics.

(Reuters) - Nearly half of U.S. small business owners reported unfilled job openings in May, marking the fourth consecutive month of record-high readings as finding qualified applicants remains a lingering challenge, a trade group said on Thursday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said in its monthly jobs report that 48% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 44% in April. May's reading is 26 points higher than the 48-year average of 22%.
Furthermore, the report showed that 93% of owners looking to hire reported few or no “qualified” applications for the positions they were trying to fill last month.
Forty percent of small businesses surveyed currently have job openings for skilled workers and 27 percent have openings for unskilled labor, up 3 points and 7 points, respectively. 
“Small business owners are struggling at record levels trying to get workers back in open positions,” NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. “Owners are offering higher wages to try to remedy the labor shortage problem. Ultimately, higher labor costs are being passed on to customers in higher selling prices.”
The report comes as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 400,000 last week for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began more than a year ago.

Additionally, hiring seems to have strengthened in May. The ADP National Employment Report showed on Thursday that private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs, which was the largest increase since June 2020, after rising by 654,000 in April.
The Department of Labor will release data on nonfarm payrolls on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls increased by 650,000 jobs in May after rising by just 266,000 in the previous month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped below 400,000 last week for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago, pointing to strengthening labor market conditions.
That was underscored by other data on Thursday showing private payrolls increasing by the most in 11 months in May, spurred by robust demand amid a rapidly reopening economy. The data supported expectations that job growth accelerated last month, though shortages of workers and raw materials continue to loom over the labor market recovery.
""The economic reopening is continuing and should be positive for job growth,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But supply and demand imbalances are creating frictions in the labor market that could be a headwind in the near term.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 for the week ended May 29. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 390,000 applications for the latest week.
The fifth straight weekly decrease in claims was led by Texas and Florida. 
The pandemic is subsiding because of vaccinations, allowing authorities to lift restrictions on businesses and accelerating the economy's reopening. That has led to a surge in demand that is pushing against supply constraints.
Though claims remain well above the 200,000-250,000 range that is associated with healthy labor market conditions, they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
They could decline further as Republican governors in 25 states, including Florida and Texas, are cutting off unemployment programs funded by the federal government for residents starting next Saturday. 
These states account for more than 40% of the workforce. About 4 million workers will be affected. The benefits being terminated early include a weekly $300 unemployment subsidy, which businesses say is discouraging the jobless from seeking work. The expanded benefits will end in early September across the country. Economists estimate unemployment benefits payments totaled $35.1 billion in May. 
Some doubt that an early termination of these benefits will lead to a surge in hiring and warn economic growth could slow. 
""We don't know if cutting this lifeline for some jobless workers is going to lead to greater payroll employment gains,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Less money paid out as unemployment benefits will slow economic growth if it does not lead to new paychecks quickly.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
HIRING PICKING UP
But hiring appears to have improved in May, with the ADP National Employment Report showing private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs, the biggest increase since June last year, after rising 654,000 in April. Economists had forecast private payrolls would increase by 650,000 jobs in May.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report for May on Friday. It, however, has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the employment report because of methodology differences.
According to a Reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely increased 650,000 jobs in May after rising only 266,000 in April. But this forecast is tempered by widespread worker and raw material shortages documented in business surveys.
In a third report on Thursday the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a record high of 64 in May from a reading of 62.7 in April. But businesses in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, complained about the dearth of workers. Some reported offering ""cash incentives of $50"" for people who show up for an interview. 
The findings mirrored an ISM survey on manufacturing this week showing shortages of parts and workers were forcing short-term shutdowns at factories. 
The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed on Wednesday that ""it remained difficult for many firms to hire new workers, especially low-wage hourly workers, truck drivers, and skilled tradespeople.""
Workers are scarce despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed. The expanded unemployment benefits, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus, even with vaccines widely accessible, as well as pandemic-related retirements have been blamed for keeping workers home.
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid increased 169,000 to 3.771 million during the week ended May 22. These so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, are being closely watched for signs on how quickly hiring will pick up. There were about 15.4 million people on unemployment benefits under all programs in mid-May. 

""This reminds us that a full recovery of jobs lost during the pandemic will be a more uneven process,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
A fourth report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers rose 7% last month to 24,586. Layoffs were, however, down 93.8% from May 2020. Employers have announced 192,185 job cuts this year, down 86% compared to the same period in 2020.

268,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity rebounded solidly in the first quarter, the government confirmed on Thursday, also noting that labor costs grew instead of contracting as previously reported.
Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an unrevised 5.4% annualized rate last quarter, the Labor Department said. Productivity fell at a 3.8% rate in the fourth quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would be raised to a 5.5% rate. 
Productivity shot up early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020. Economists attributed the jump to the hollowing out of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which they said tended to be less productive.
Compared to the first quarter of 2020, productivity rose at an unrevised 4.1% rate. 
Hours worked increased at a 3.0% rate last quarter, revised slightly up from the 2.9% pace estimated last month.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - increased at a 1.7% rate. They were previously reported to have dropped at a 0.3% pace. Unit labor costs surged at a 14.0% rate in the fourth quarter. They rose at a 4.1% pace from a year ago, instead of at a 1.6% rate as previously reported. 

They have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.
Hourly compensation increased at a 7.2% rate last quarter, rather than the previously reported 5.1% pace. That followed a 9.7% growth pace in the fourth quarter. Compensation increased at an 8.3% rate compared to the first quarter of 2020, revised up from the previously estimated 5.8% pace.

Private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Thursday, the biggest increase since June last year. Data for April was revised down to show 654,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 742,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 650,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report for May on Friday. However, it has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the employment report because of methodology differences.
The ADP report overestimated private payroll gains in April's employment report, after understating growth throughout much of the jobs recovery, which started in May 2020, leaving economists cautious about reading too much into the report.
""The inconsistencies comparing the ADP and government data make it very hard to use the ADP figures to predict the first prints of the government data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 600,000 jobs in May after rising only 218,000 in April. With government hiring expected to have increased by about 50,000, that would lead to overall payrolls advancing by 650,000 jobs in May. The economy created 266,000 jobs in April.

The forecasts were tempered by data on Tuesday showing a moderation in hiring at factories, with manufacturers complaining that worker absenteeism and short-term shutdowns because of shortages of parts and workers was limiting the sector's potential. 
An easing in the COVID-19 pandemic's grip due to vaccinations has allowed authorities to lift restrictions on businesses, accelerating the economy. The ensuing pent-up demand is, however, pushing against supply constraints.

Initial claims in regular state programs decreased by 20,000 to 385,000 in the week ended May 29, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 387,000 applications. The prior week’s reading was revised down to 405,000.
The labor market continues to gain steam as remaining pandemic restrictions are eased and more fully-vaccinated Americans look to resume travel and socializing. U.S. companies added 978,000 private payroll jobs in May, the most in nearly a year, according to a separate report by ADP Research Institute on Thursday.
The numbers come ahead of Friday’s Labor Department employment report, which is expected to show the economy added 655,00 jobs in May, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, more than 20 states have recently announced plans to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether generous aid is making it more difficult for employers to hire.

271,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 07:55AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector expansion slowed in May, a private sector survey showed on Thursday, with weaker overseas demand and increased costs putting pressure on businesses.
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.1 in May, down from 56.3 in April but still well in expansionary territory. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The survey attributed part of the slowing expansion to a fall in overseas demand as COVID cases abroad hurt business activity. A gauge of export orders slipped into contraction.
The Caixin PMI contrasts with an official survey released earlier this week, which showed activity in China's services sector expanded at a faster pace in May.
Though slower to recover from the epidemic than manufacturing, a gradual improvement in consumption has stimulated activity in China's services sector, which includes many smaller and private companies.
Growth in total new orders slipped and services firms increased their staffing levels for the third straight month, but at a slower pace, the Caixin survey showed.
Inflation pressures worsened with input costs rising at a sharper rate in May and reports of more expensive raw materials, energy, staff and transport, the survey found.
Even though firms were able to raise selling prices for the 10th straight month, the increases have yet to catch up with the inflation in input costs.
""Services supply and demand continued their upward trends for the 13th consecutive month, though both expanded at a slower pace than in the previous month,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.

""Inflationary pressure was enormous as price gauges continued to rise. Both the measures for input costs and the prices service providers charged rose to their highest points of the year."" 
The Caixin China General Composite PMI came in at 53.8 in May, weaker than 54.7 the previous month.

Inflation had quickened to 17.14% in April, the highest since mid-2019, due to the lira's sharp fall after President Tayyip Erdogan sacked a hawkish central bank governor in March. 
The currency weakened further in May, raising expectations of higher inflation due to imports priced in hard currencies. The median estimate in a Reuters poll for annual inflation was 17.25%.
Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 0.89%, the Turkish Statistical Institute said, compared to a Reuters poll forecast of 1.46%. Graphic: Turkish inflation drops from two-year peak, https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/INFLATION/yzdvxmnqypx/chart.png 
Turkey was under lockdown in the first half of May aimed at slowing the spread of new COVID-19 cases. Economists said a ban on the sale of some items during the lockdown curbed price rises but that hikes would be implemented in June.
""The limited price rises in groups other than food due to reduced demand because of the lockdown had a large impact on the drop in annual inflation,"" said Haluk Burumcekci, of Burumcekci Consulting.
The rise in clothing prices was far below last year's level, he said.
POLICY
The month-on-month rise was driven by increases in transportation, clothing and footwear, while the annual rise was driven by health, household equipment and transportation.
The producer price index rose 3.92% month-on-month in May, the data showed, for an annual rise of 38.33%. That is expected to contribute to headline inflation in coming months, as the input costs are reflected on consumer prices.
The central bank had said inflation would peak in April, and Governor Sahap Kavcioglu told investors on Wednesday that inflation would enter a significant downward trend at the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth.
Erdogan's frequent calls for rate cuts and his sacking of three central bank governors in less than two years has seriously eroded the bank's credibility. 
Erdogan said this week that he spoke to Kavcioglu and urged him to cut rates in the next two months, sending the lira tumbling to a record low against the dollar on Wednesday.
But Kavcioglu sought to ease concerns of premature easing during Wednesday's meeting with investors, saying they were ""unjustified"".

Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the central bank has in the past begun easing policy once inflation passed its peak.
""We think that the CBRT will heed President Erdogan's recent calls for monetary easing by August,"" he said in a note. ""And as inflation drops sharply towards the end of the year, aggressive interest rate cuts seem likely.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business activity surged in May as the easing of some coronavirus related restrictions injected life into the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed, echoing data on Tuesday which showed factories had their best month on record.
An acceleration of vaccine programmes across the region and a fall in reported daily cases has allowed governments to remove some measures imposed to stop the spread of the virus.
That meant IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, jumped to 57.1 last month from April's 53.8, its highest level since February 2018. 
May's final reading was ahead of a preliminary 56.9 indication and comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index covering the service industry soared to a near three-year high of 55.2 from 50.5, just beating the 55.1 flash estimate.
""The euro zone composite and services PMIs for May came out in line with expectations and continue to show that confidence is high,"" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton. 
""With ongoing government support and loose policy from the ECB it should be expected that the recovery will remain robust and also fed by the pick-up in activity around the world.""

Suggesting the upswing would continue, the services new business index was the highest since early 2018 the overall composite new orders reading bounced to a near record 58.4 from 53.4 - its highest since June 2006 - as pent-up demand was released.
German services returned to growth in May, helped by falling coronavirus infections and a loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, lifting overall private sector output in Europe's largest economy.
French business activity surged as an easing of the coronavirus lockdown fired up the service industry while in Spain the service sector expanded at the fastest pace since 2015. Meanwhile, Italy showed signs of recovery.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, the services sector recorded the biggest jump in activity in 24 years, after pubs and restaurants were allowed to resume serving customers indoors following months of lockdown. [GB/PMIS]
Alongside the recovery in services, euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at a record pace in May, according to a sister survey on Tuesday which suggested growth would have been even faster without supply bottlenecks that have led to an unprecedented rise in input costs. [EU/PMIM]
The euro area was expected to emerge from a double-dip recession this quarter and expand 1.5%, a Reuters poll found. 

Following a slow start, vaccination drives across the region have picked up pace and with restrictions being eased optimism about the year ahead increased. The services business expectations index rose to 71.2 from 68.4, its highest since January 2004.

The final composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 56.2 in May from 55.8 in the previous month.
Both readings were in line with flash estimates released last month.
""Germany's service sector started to revive in May, buoyed by the partial easing of lockdown measures and a surge in new business as progress in the vaccine rollout helped spur confidence and demand,"" IHS economist Phil Smith said.
The survey revealed growing cost pressures in the service sector which are expected to push up overall consumer price inflation in the coming months.

""While more services firms are starting to raise prices, the full extent of the cost pressures across sector is by no means reflected in the rate of output charge inflation,"" Smith said.
Many services businesses have so far absorbed higher costs but they are now facing a rapid rebound of pent-up demand which should enable them to pass on increased costs to consumers through higher prices, he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector recorded the biggest jump in activity in 24 years last month, after pubs and restaurants were allowed to resume serving customers indoors following months of lockdown, according to a closely watched business survey.
Thursday's data adds to signs that Britain is enjoying a very rapid initial rebound as lockdown rules relax.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 62.9 in May from 61.0 in April, taking it to its highest since May 1997 and above an initial estimate of 61.8.
""The latest survey results set the scene for an eye-popping rate of UK GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021, led by the reopening of customer-facing parts of the economy after winter lockdowns,"" IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore, said.
The composite PMI, which includes previously released manufacturing data, rose to its highest since the series began in January 1998 at 62.9, up from April's reading of 60.7.
Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Britain would see the fastest growth of any major economy this year. 
But the scale of Britain's economic slump last year - the biggest in over 300 years - means it will take longer than the United States, Germany or Japan for output to return to pre-crisis levels.
And the Bank of England has said initial rapid growth as the economy reopens will give few clues to the medium-term prospects for both growth and inflation, which it expects will revert to subdued pre-pandemic trends.
In the short term, however, inflation is rising sharply. The PMI showed that the biggest rise in prices charged by services businesses since the survey began in 1996 due to a jump in staffing costs, transport bills and the price of raw materials.

Staff numbers rose by the most in just over six years, as businesses brought workers back from furlough and hired new ones. Some reported staff shortages and had to raise pay offers as a result.
However, demand was very much domestically driven and the survey showed services exports fell. Businesses blamed this on a mix of COVID travel restrictions and post-Brexit restrictions on their ability to sell services in the European Union.

Investing.com – China’s services sector grew at a slower pace in May due to decreasing overseas demand and rising input costs for businesses.
Data released earlier in the day said Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index  in May fell to 55.1, below April’s 56.3 but above the 50-mark indicating growth. The reading follows Tuesday’s release of the Caixin manufacturing PMI, which increased to 52 in May, the highest level since December 2020.
Earlier this week, official data released by the National Bureau of Statistics said the manufacturing PMI in May fell to 51, while the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 55.2.
The sector's slowdown was partly due to decreasing demand in global markets as the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in several countries limited business activities, said the Caixin survey, adding that a gauge of export orders fell into contraction.
Although the economic recovery from COVID-19 of services sectors was slower than that of the manufacturing sector, improvement in consumption has promoted activities in China's services sector, including smaller and private firms.
Total new orders increased, and services firms hired more employees for a third consecutive month, but both at a slower pace. Input costs also rose sharply in May, while raw materials were more expensive, leading to worsening price pressures, the survey added.
""Services supply and demand continued their upward trends for the 13th consecutive month, though both expanded at a slower pace than in the previous month… inflationary pressure was enormous as price gauges continued to rise. Both the measures for input costs and the prices service providers charged rose to their highest points of the year,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release."

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.4 in May from 55.2 in April, its fastest pace of growth since January. It signalled a robust improvement in business conditions and approached the series average of 56.9.
Saudi Arabia's economy, the largest in the Arab world, is expected to grow 2.1% in 2021 after shrinking 4.1% last year amid the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and lower oil prices, the IMF said in a recent report.
The output subindex, a measure of business activity, climbed to 62.0 in May from 58.7 in April, its strongest pace since late 2017. That reading, above the series average of 61.5, indicated a rapid increase in output as firms noted rising new orders and increased marketing activities.
""Most firms continued to operate with unchanged workforce numbers, suggesting a focus on boosting productivity back to pre-COVID levels. On the plus side, inventories were increased at the quickest pace in a year-and-a-half as firms prepare for a further recovery in demand over the coming months,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Saudi Arabia last month eased some health safety restrictions, allowing foreign visitors to fly in without quarantining as long as they are vaccinated against COVID-19, though 20 countries remained banned.

""After falling in each of the prior four months, the Future Output Index ticked up to indicate a slight strengthening of business expectations in May. That said, the level of optimism for the next 12 months was still far below the series average,"" the PMI report said.

The coronavirus crisis hit the Gulf state hard last year, both via the shock of low oil prices and the huge toll it took on vital non-oil economic sectors such as tourism.

Output, a measure of business activity, also expanded for the sixth straight month, but did so at its slowest pace since February, softening to 53.6 in May from 55.4 in April. It was well below the series average of 57.3.
""Employment numbers continued to disappoint in May, falling for the fourth month in a row. With backlogs starting to rise and demand strengthening, it is hoped that businesses will start to raise their staffing levels soon to support overall growth,"" Owen said.
Employment expanded in only one of the past 17 months, in January this year. The contraction in May was marginal, however, and only roughly 1% of the firms surveyed reported job losses, the PMI report said.
""The Future Output Index continued to make steady gains in May, rising for the sixth month running and pointing to the highest degree of optimism since July 2020,"" the report said.

But only around 14% of survey respondents expected output to rise in the next 12 months, while 84% expected no change due to continued uncertainty about the pandemic's trajectory.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian auto sales have boasted their best May on record as cashed-up consumers splash out on big-ticket items, a hopeful sign spending had the resilience to weather a COVID-19 lockdown in the state of Victoria.
Some 100,809 new vehicles were sold in May, according to Thursday's data from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, a rise of 68% on last year during the depths of a pandemic recession.
Leading the pack were the pick-up trucks favoured by sole traders taking advantage of generous tax breaks, pointing to another month of robust business investment.
Government data out on Thursday showed shoppers had already been out in force in April. Retail sales climbed 1.1%, from March, putting them a huge 25% higher than last year when much of the economy was in lockdown.
The strength of consumption suggested the economy maintained its momentum from the first quarter when gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.8% to surpass its pre-pandemic levels.
""A raft of factors are supporting spending from record-low interest rates to excess savings, rising employment, the best job security levels in a decade, healthy confidence and rising wealth,"" said CommSec chief economist Craig James.
""Also the ongoing concerns about COVID-19 continue to motivate people to drive themselves from A to B, in preference to taking public transport.""
Sales likely did hit a pothole in recent days as the entire state of Victoria locked down to combat a coronavirus outbreak, effectively shutting in its 6.7 million consumers.

Yet the strength of employment is giving consumers spending power even as wages remain subdued. Some 292,000 new jobs were created in the past six months to hit a record high.
Surging home prices were also boosting household wealth. National home prices climbed 9% in the three months to May, lifting the median value of a house in Sydney by A$1,359 a day.

Intermediate goods' prices rose the most in April against March, rising 1.8% with energy costs registering the second biggest increase of 1.0%. But in year-on-year terms, energy contributed the most, with prices surging 20.4% against April 2020 and intermediate goods up 6.9%.
Without the volatile energy, the monthly rise of producer prices was exactly as expected by economists -- 0.9% -- and only 3.5% in year-on-year terms.
Changes in producer prices are often passed on directly to consumers and Eurostat's first estimate of consumer inflation in May showed last Tuesday an acceleration to 2.0% year-on-year from 1.6% in April, also driven by surging energy costs.

The ECB wants to keep consumer price growth ""below but close to 2%"" over the medium term.
The bank has warned that the spike in energy prices will temporarily take inflation above target this year, but from next year inflation will be below target again for years to come, especially since wage growth, a necessary component of durable inflation, remains anaemic.

282,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British mortgage lending slumped in April as a government decision to prolong a tax break on property sales came too late to influence buyers that month, but housing market activity looks on course to rebound, Bank of England data showed. 
Net mortgage lending by British lenders slumped in April to 3.3 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) from a record 11.5 billion pounds the month before, an even sharper drop than the fall to 6.6 billion pounds forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The recent variability is likely to reflect the reduction in the stamp duty tax, which was initially expected to end in March, but has now been extended to the end of June,"" the BoE said.
Sunak announced he would extend the tax break in his March 3 budget. But many buyers were already rushing through transactions to complete them before the earlier deadline.
The cut in stamp duty land tax began in July last year to spur housing transactions after a slump at the start of the pandemic.
House prices have boomed since then, despite the economic damage wrought on other sectors by the COVID pandemic, with prices in May up 10.9% on a year ago according to lender Nationwide, the biggest jump since 2014.
Another key factor pushing up prices has been greater demand for spacious housing outside city centres from people who are now able to work from home.
Mortgage approvals - which adjusted faster than lending to the tax change - rose to 86,921 in April from 83,402 in March, though they are below November's high of more than 103,000.
Households continued to pay down personal debt, largely reflecting reduced spending opportunities during the lockdown, which was still largely in place in April.

Net repayments totalled 377 million pounds, well below economists' average forecast for a net 500 million pounds in new borrowing. April's net consumer lending was 5.7% below its year-ago level, compared with an 8.8% shortfall in March.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's economy raced ahead last quarter as consumers and businesses spent with abandon, lifting output back above where it was last year when pandemic lockdowns tipped the country into its first recession in three decades.
The economy expanded by a real 1.8% in the three months to March, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Wednesday. Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a 1.5% rise following an upwardly revised 3.2% gain in the fourth quarter.
The solid back-to-back quarterly growth helped annual output climb 1.1% to A$525.7 billion ($408.05 billion), a major turnaround from last year's recession low of $468.3 billion.
The better-than-forecast figures pushed Australia's benchmark share index to record highs while supporting the local dollar near a one-week top. 
Australia is in rare company here with only five other countries boasting an economy that’s larger than before the pandemic, said Kristian Kolding, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics. 
On average, Australia's rich world peers are 2.7% smaller than they were before the pandemic, Deloitte's research found, with the United Kingdom shrinking almost 9%, the European Union contracting by 5% and the United States 1% smaller.
Australia announced strict social distancing rules in late-March 2020 to curb the coronavirus pandemic, forcing businesses from retailers to cafes and restaurants to down shutters while leading hundreds of thousands to queue up for welfare payments.
But the A$2 trillion economy has since staged a remarkable comeback by keeping virus numbers in check which has allowed businesses to reopen with confidence. Hefty and timely monetary and fiscal stimulus have been beneficial too. 
""Today’s numbers show Australia’s recovery is becoming more broad-based,"" Deloitte's Kolding said. 
""Families are spending locally, and businesses continue to invest, making the most of record low interest rates and tax offsets,"" Kolding added.
Wednesday's data showed the first-quarter expansion was driven by private investment which contributed 0.9 percentage points to growth with machinery and equipment investment clocking its strongest quarterly rise since December 2009. 
A surge in dwelling activity also helped while household spending added 0.7 percentage points to growth. 
""Underpinning all of that is continued strength in jobs numbers,"" Kolding added.
OUTLOOK CAUTIOUS
Australia's employment is higher than before the pandemic while measures of underemployment and unemployment have slipped rapidly though they are still above levels the country's central bank believes is needed to spark wage pressures. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has welcomed recent strength in data but has reiterated it will not raise the cash rate from its record low of 0.1% until inflation was sustainably within its 2-3% target band.
For that to occur, the RBA says the jobless rate will need to fall to or below 4% from 5.5% currently and wage growth will have to double to at least 3%, conditions the central bank believes are unlikely to be met before 2024 at the earliest. 
Analysts were circumspect about the outlook given slow COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the nation and an extension of a seven-day lockdown in Australia's second-most populous city Melbourne by another week to stop a rapidly-spreading coronavirus strain.
""This lockdown will be the first lengthy one without JobKeeper so we need to be a bit more cautious about how the recovery may look,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note, referring to a government welfare payment.
Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday hinted at some fiscal support for Victoria, which has been under lockdown since last week. A lockdown in the capital city Melbourne has been extended, while some restrictions will persist elsewhere in the southern eastern state.

KPMG economists say the lockdown is costing the Victorian economy A$125 million a day.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's consumer inflation accelerated to a more than nine-year high in May, reinforcing calls for gradual monetary tightening, though the increase was mainly due to a low base effect and rises in oil and agricultural prices.
Consumer prices rose 2.6% in May from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday, logging the fastest growth since April 2012 and matching a median estimate for a 2.6% increase in a Reuters survey. It grew 2.3% in April.
In May 2020, South Korea fell into deflation as the coronavirus pandemic struck demand and supply chains.
The country's finance minister said that the impact from the low base and temporary supply disruptions for some agricultural products and oil prices will ease going forward.
""The government will prepare against the inflation risk from materialising, prevent excessive inflation expectations and take measures to stabilise living costs,"" Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said.
Wednesday's data showed the cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and petroleum surged 12.1% and 23.3%, respectively.
Core CPI, which excluded volatile energy and food prices, came at 1.2% year-on-year, posting the sharpest increase since November 2018.
Month-on-month inflation was 0.1%, slower than a 0.2% increase in April.
Last week, the central bank kept its base rate at a record low of 0.50%, but upgraded its economic outlook and projected high consumer inflation.
The bank's governor said it is preparing to pull back on the extraordinary stimulus extended during the pandemic in the face of accelerating inflation and a build-up of dangerous imbalances.
""Although the central bank's policy messaging has turned more hawkish recently, clear signs that COVID-19-related risks are fading are likely to be a prerequisite for policy tightening,"" ANZ Research said in a note.

""Our base case is for the Bank of Korea to kick-off policy normalisation in the first quarter of 2022 ... we acknowledge that a faster-than-anticipated pace of vaccination could pave the way for the first rate hike to come as soon as the fourth quarter of 2021.""
The BOK currently sees inflation standing at 1.8% for the whole of 2021 and 1.4% for 2022.

286,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy expanded faster than economists forecast in the first three months of the year as households tapped some of their savings and businesses boosted investment.
Gross domestic product advanced 1.8% from the final quarter of 2020, when it rose a revised 3.2%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney Wednesday. Economists had forecast a first-quarter gain of 1.5%. From a year earlier, the economy expanded 1.1 % vs an estimated 0.6% increase.
“The economic recovery in Australia is stronger than earlier expected and is forecast to continue,” Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said Tuesday after keeping stimulatory policy settings in place. It’s being supported by “fiscal measures and very accommodative financial conditions,” he said.
Australia’s rapid rebound has been underpinned by its ability to limit Covid-19 to isolated flare ups, boosting consumer and business confidence. A massive fiscal-monetary injection strengthened the financial position of households and firms during the lockdown, and consumers are now spending savings built up.
“Australian economic activity has recovered to be above pre-pandemic levels,” Michael Smedes, head of National Accounts at the ABS, said in a statement. “Machinery and equipment investment recorded its strongest quarterly rise since December 2009, driven by the continued improvement in business confidence and support from government tax incentives.”
The Australian dollar was little changed after the release, trading at 77.68 U.S. cents at 11:50 a.m. in Sydney.
Today’s report showed:
Unemployment in Australia has steadily declined as the recovery gathered pace, reaching 5.5% in April from a pandemic peak of 7.4%.
Some pandemic support has now been withdrawn, such as loan repayment deferrals and the government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy that expired just before the end of the first quarter. Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy said in testimony Tuesday that partial data showed around 56,000 workers had lost their jobs in the four weeks following the conclusion of JobKeeper on March 28.
A potential risk to the outlook is Australia’s sluggish rollout of a Covid vaccine, which has been heightened by a renewed outbreak of the virus in Melbourne that prompted a weeklong lockdown in the nation’s second-largest city.
“An important ongoing source of uncertainty is the possibility of significant outbreaks of the virus, although this should diminish as more of the population is vaccinated,” Lowe said yesterday.
Australia’s government and central bank have worked closely to support the economy through the pandemic. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unveiled further stimulus measures in his May budget, joining forces with Lowe in trying to push the economy to maximum employment and revive sluggish inflation.
The central bank is due to decide next month on rolling over its yield target to a later maturity and whether to extend its quantitative easing program.

Inflation from a year earlier reached 2.6% from April’s 2.3%, data from the statistics office showed Wednesday. Economists had also expected consumer prices to rise 2.6%.
Inflation is rising globally as surging commodity costs feed into higher consumer prices and trigger debates about when central banks might start to raise interest rates again. For the Bank of Korea, faster price gains also reflect a broadening economic recovery that adds pressure on the bank to normalize monetary policy.
The reading marks the second straight month the headline inflation exceeded the central bank’s 2% target. The rise was partly buoyed by the negative reading in May 2020.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a trade surplus of $9.3 billion in May, Economy Ministry figures showed on Tuesday, as record exports for that month helped fuel the second largest overall surplus ever.
The $9.3 billion surplus was almost exactly in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a $9.2 billion surplus, and up almost 30% from the $6.8 billion surplus in May last year.
It is the second highest on record following April's $10.3 billion surplus, Refinitiv figures show, meaning the April-June surplus will almost certainly be the highest quarterly surplus on record.
Exports in May totaled a record $26.95 billion for that month and imports were $17.7 billion, the ministry said, adding that total trade flows of $44.6 billion in the month were up 50% from a year earlier.
These figures mean Brazil's trade surplus in the first five months of the year totaled $27.5 billion, sharply up from the $15.8 billion surplus a year ago.

Exports in the January-May period totaled $109.1 billion, up 31% on the year, while imports of $81.5 billion were 21% higher than a year ago, ministry figures showed.
Economy Ministry officials have said the 2021 surplus could reach a record of almost $90 billion, and the central bank is forecasting a $70 billion surplus this year. Both would be significantly higher than last year's $53 billion.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to 47.6 in May from 48.4 in April, remaining below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction. The index has been clawing its way higher gradually after plummeting to 35.0 in April 2020, by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-year history.
""PMI data for May suggested that Mexican manufacturers continued to struggle, with new orders again undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Factories in Mexico operated below capacity again in May, with goods producers reporting reduced working hours and the termination of temporary employment as sales remained weak, De Lima said.
Mexico's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in April from 4.4% in March, the national statistics agency said on Thursday.
De Lima said that ""adding to the challenges faced by manufacturers were rising input prices as raw material shortages pushed up cost burdens.""
A Bank of Mexico board member said on Wednesday that inflation, which stood at 5.80% in the year through the first half of May, has risen partly because of a low base of comparison and that some inflationary pressures are coming from higher costs and prices of raw materials.

On a positive note in May companies were more upbeat towards the year-ahead outlook for production. 
""Optimism was, however, pinned on hopes that the COVID-19 pandemic will be brought under control,"" said De Lima.

The bank's monthly IMACEC economic activity index encompasses about 90% of the economy tallied in gross domestic product figures.
Economic activity dropped 1.4% versus March, however, as much of the South American nation was locked down in April amid a fierce second wave of contagions that followed the southern hemisphere summer.
Commercial activity nonetheless soared 33.1% in April versus the previous year, while services jumped 16.3%. The production of goods rose 3.8%, mainly supported by manufacturing, the bank said. 
""This result was explained, in part, by a greater adaptation of homes and companies to the health emergency associated with COVID-19,"" the bank said.
In April last year, economic activity had plunged 13.8% year-on-year as the Chilean government moved early to stave off the fast-spreading virus.
Finance Minister Rodrigo Cerda said demand had recovered well despite the lingering pandemic, but also highlighted other signs of a longer-term uptick in growth.
""Imports of capital goods, a key indicator for investment, also continue to expand at very high rates, leading us to believe we have new momentum that will allow us to maintain high growth,"" he added.
Scotiabank said in a note that the strong April numbers supported revising upwards the Central Bank's official estimate for full-year 2021 growth, from a range of 6-7% to 7-8%.

Scotiabank did, however, note that rising cases in recent days in Chile were reason for ""caution"" in the short-term.
Chile is among the world leaders in vaccination against COVID-19, but cases have soared among the country's youth, who have yet to be vaccinated, once again raising the specter of renewed lockdowns.

The paper looked at 26 labor market measures that typically move in tandem and found that during the current recovery they are giving wildly divergent signals about the health of the job market.
The job openings rate, for instance, suggests the job market is much tighter than the unemployment rate; the labor force participation rate points to much more slack than detected in the unemployment rate.
Because the pandemic has forced so many people out of the workforce, ""negative signals such as the low labor force participation rate provide a better read than do the positive signals,"" the researchers argued. ""Overall, our findings reveal that the labor market situation is worse than some headline numbers suggest.""
U.S. central bankers are debating how tight the U.S. labor market has become amid widespread reports from employers about hiring difficulties even as the economy still has 8 million fewer people working than before the pandemic. 

The question matters because the Fed says it could start reducing its support for the economy once inflation and the labor market have made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment. It hasn't, however, laid out exactly how it will measure that progress. 
The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.1% in April and a reading for May is due out on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in May as pent-up demand amid a reopening economy boosted orders, but unfinished work piled up because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday found companies and their suppliers ""continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand,"" noting that ""record-long lead times, wide-scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products are continuing to affect all segments"" of manufacturing. 
According to the ISM, worker absenteeism and short-term shutdowns because of shortages of parts and workers continued to limit manufacturing's growth potential. 
""Strong demand is a good problem to have, but that demand is increasingly straining manufacturers' ability to keep pace,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.2 last month from 60.7 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 60.9 in May.

A shift in demand to goods from services as the COVID-19 pandemic kept Americans at home strained supply chains, with the virus also disrupting labor at manufacturers and their suppliers, leading to raw material shortages across industries. 
More than half of adults in the United States are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing authorities to lift pandemic-related restrictions on businesses. That is whipping up demand across the economy, as is massive fiscal stimulus. There is no sign the supply bottlenecks are easing, even as demand is reverting back to services.
Sixteen manufacturing industries, including furniture, machinery, transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth last month. Only the printing and related support activities industry reported a contraction.
In the computer and electronic products industry, manufacturers complained about poor supplier performance, adding that ""demand is high, and we are struggling to find employees to help us keep up."" Similar complaints were echoed across other industries. Food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers said ""delays at the port continue to strain inventory levels.""
Makers of fabricated metal products reported they did not expect the supply chain constraints to improve ""until possibly the fourth quarter of 2021 or beyond.""
Supply challenges are likely holding back the construction sector, with spending on projects rising only 0.2% in April after surging 1.0% in March, a separate report from the Commerce Department showed. 
Graphic: Construction spending - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/bdwvkxdzkpm/constspend.png 
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 just shy of its record peak. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S Treasury prices were lower.
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME DEMAND BOOM
The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index jumped to 67.0 from a reading of 64.3 in April. Inventories at factories are barely growing and business warehouses are almost empty. 
A measure of factory employment dropped to a six-month low. According to the ISM, ""an overwhelming majority"" of companies are hiring or attempting to hire, ""with more than 50% of them expressing difficulty in doing so."" 
Labor is scarce despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed. Generous unemployment benefits funded by the government, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus, even with vaccines widely accessible, as well as pandemic-related retirements have been blamed for keeping workers home.
Lack of workers and shortages of raw materials such as semiconductors used in the production of motor vehicles and electronic goods led to a further increase in backlogs of uncompleted work. 
Suppliers took much longer to deliver to manufacturers last month, with the supplier deliveries index jumping to 78.8. That was the highest reading since April 1974 and followed 75 in April. A reading above 50 suggests slower deliveries. With constraints mounting, production at factories grew at its slowest pace since last June.
""This has to be infuriating for factories seeing a once-in-a-lifetime demand surge but are unable to take full advantage of it for lack of parts,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The shortages are also keeping input prices elevated, fanning inflation. The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers hovered near levels last seen in July 2008, when the economy was in the throes of the Great Recession. 
The government reported on Friday that a measure of underlying inflation tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% target accelerated 3.1% on a year-on-year basis in April, the biggest increase since July 1992. 
Most economists and Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintain that higher inflation will be transitory.
There are concerns that persistently higher commodity prices could squeeze profit margins, though lower inventories give businesses ample pricing power. The slowdown in hiring at factories last month could temper expectations for an acceleration in job growth in May after nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 in April. 

According to an early Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 664,000 jobs last month. The government is due to publish May's employment report on Friday.
""We doubt these labor supply constraints will ease significantly before September and could hold back payrolls growth again this Friday,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's economy grew by 1.2% in the first quarter, data showed on Tuesday, faster than economists had expected, as rebounding services and investments took Latin America's largest economy back to is size at the end of 2019, before the pandemic hit.
It was the third consecutive quarter of growth. While the rebound has slowed, underlying figures suggest strong foundations for a continued recovery, prompting upward revisions to full-year forecasts and a surge in Brazil's currency.
""This makes the outlook for the coming quarters very positive,"" said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management in Sao Paulo, calling the data ""a really good set of numbers, especially fixed business investment."" 
Brazil's real rose to 5.15 per dollar, on track to close at its strongest this year. It is up 0.5% since Dec. 31, a sharp rebound since being down more than 10% year-to-date against the dollar in March.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said growth this year will likely be ""very strong"", and economists at Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) jacked up their 2021 gross domestic product growth forecasts to 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. 
""We expect the economy to recover visibly in coming quarters in tandem with further progress on the Covid vaccination front, gradual reopening of the economy, renewed fiscal stimulus, (and) recovering consumer and business confidence,"" Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs said.
Brazil's economic recovery has also helped accelerate inflation, prompting aggressive interest rate hikes. The central bank has raised its benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points at each of its last two policy meetings, to 3.50%, and has indicated it will do so again next month.
Brazil's first-quarter growth was driven by services, industry and fixed business investment, official statistics agency IBGE figures showed. Agriculture grew by 5.7% in the quarter, its fastest pace in four years.
Government spending fell and manufacturing contracted. Household consumption fell less than expected, according to Vieira at Infinity, and is expected to stay surprisingly strong for the rest of the year.
The 1.2% growth rate in the January-March period from the previous three months was more than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for 1.0% growth. 
The range of forecasts from 27 economists was wide, indicating difficulty in assessing the impact of the end of emergency government aid payments to the poor on Dec. 31 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic's second wave.
Industry expanded by 0.7%, the dominant services sector grew 0.4% and fixed business investment rose 4.6% in the quarter, IBGE said.
Household consumption slipped 0.1% and government spending fell 0.8%, one of the biggest quarterly declines in years. Within industry output, the manufacturing sector shrank by 0.5%.
Compared with the same period a year earlier, GDP grew by 1.0%, IBGE figures showed, also more than the 0.8% rise forecast in a Reuters poll. 

IBGE figures show economic activity is back to its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2019 but still 3.1% below its peak in 2014.
Economists warned, however, that tight fiscal policy, rising interest rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and government's economic reform agenda were risks that point to much more subdued growth next year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy is on track to register ""very strong"" growth this year, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Tuesday, as the accelerated roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations and protocols help the economy build on its solid performance in the first quarter.
Guedes was speaking after figures showed that Latin America's largest economy grew faster than expected in the January-March period on a quarterly and year-on-year basis, taking it back to its pre-pandemic size in 2019.
Guedes told a lower house education commission that the economy had been growing perhaps as much as 2.5% in the first quarter of last year before the pandemic struck. 
""So if we are growing faster than the first quarter of last year ... it is possible that we are actually growing at much higher rates,"" he said, adding that the 1.2% quarterly pace of expansion in the first quarter bodes well for the year.
The Economy Ministry said that high frequency indicators show the recovery is continuing but warned that the drought affecting the country, one of the worst in decades, could hamper electricity supply and ultimately wider economic activity.
In a statement, the ministry also said that the strength of first quarter growth figures vindicates the government's cautious fiscal stance, and repeated its view that fiscal consolidation, debt reduction and pro-market reforms are fundamental to Brazil's long-term growth prospects.

In the near term, the main positive factors supporting activity are a favorable global scenario, a strong rebound in investment led by the private sector, increased savings, credit growth and job creation as social distancing measures ease, the ministry said.
On the flip side, the main factors that warrant close attention are political risks surrounding the need to continue fiscal austerity and approve economic reforms, uncertainties related to the pandemic, and the nationwide drought, it added.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel plans to open an economic attache office in Abu Dhabi this summer to attract foreign investment and boost economic relations with Gulf states and the broader Arab world, the Economy Ministry said on Tuesday.
This follows a U.S.-brokered normalisation of ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last September that has led to a number of bilateral banking deals and direct flights between the two countries.
On Monday, an Emirati embassy opened in Tel Aviv while Israel's Finance Ministry said Israel and the United Arab Emirates signed a tax treaty to spur business development between the countries.
Economy Minister Amir Peretz said he saw ""enormous economic potential"" in strengthening Israeli-Emirati relations.
""Opening the economic attache office will give a significant boost to the various initiatives already underway,"" Peretz added.
Israel's Foreign Trade Administration (FTA), a part of the Economy Ministry, operates in more than 50 business centers around the world. It opened a branch in Manila last year.
Aviad Tamir will be the economic attache in the UAE, the ministry said.
The FTA last year identified significant economic potential for Israel's economy from relations with the UAE, including strengthening aviation ties between Israel and the Gulf, oil imports, energy solutions, diamond exports, exports of medical equipment water technologies, and exports of financial and cyber security technologies.

The new branches in the UAE ""will yield significant returns in light of the great interest arising from Emirates interested in a long line of Israeli technologies as well as in light of the large capital in the UAE that may be translated into significant investments in Israeli economy and industry,"" said FTA director Ohad Cohen. 
Israel has also recently normalised relations with Bahrain.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy likely contracted in April, the first decline in a year, due to widespread lockdowns amid a third wave of coronavirus infections, slowing the country's march toward recovery, data showed on Tuesday.
In a preliminary estimate, Statistics Canada said the economy contracted 0.8% in April. By contrast, real GDP had grown 11 months in a row through March, when it grew 1.1%.
Economists said the April decline was largely expected and is unlikely to change the Bank of Canada's outlook for interest rate hikes. 
""They were talking about the output gap and inflation getting back to target by late 2022. That's still a long way from here,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The Bank of Canada last month signaled rates could begin to rise in 2022, noting the economy had rebounded more quickly than it had expected.
The Canadian economy grew 5.6% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, as restrictions were eased between the second and third waves of COVID-19, and buoyed by strong housing investment and more mortgage debt. The gain missed analyst expectations of 6.7%. 
Still, the economy is in a good position to hit the Bank of Canada's GDP forecast of 6.5% for the year, said economists, meaning it will likely ease some stimulus this year.
""I think the Bank of Canada is going to regard this as roughly in line with their forecast,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. 
""It's going to leave us on track for more tapering in July, and in October, and ultimately going to no more QE (quantitative easing) once we get to 2022.""

Many Canadian provinces imposed strict public health measures and closed many non-essential business in April amid a harsh third wave of COVID-19 infections. With April's contraction, economic activity was likely about 2% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. 
The Canadian dollar steadied at about near 1.2030 per U.S. dollar, or 83.13 U.S. cents, up 0.3% on the day.

297,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending increased less than expected in April as gains in private homebuilding were blunted by losses in outlays on nonresidential structures and public projects.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending rose 0.2% after surging 1.0% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.5%. Construction spending, which accounts for about 4% of gross domestic product, jumped 9.8% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Spending on private construction projects rose 0.4%, lifted by investment in single-family homebuilding. Demand for housing remains robust, though expensive building materials, especially lumber, are constraining builders' ability to ramp up construction. 
The government reported last month a plunge in homebuilding in April, with the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started increasing to the highest level since 1999.
Outlays on residential projects increased 1.0% in April. Spending on private nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling dropped 0.5% in April. 

Business investment in nonresidential structures fell in the first quarter for the sixth straight quarter as a rebound in mining exploration, shafts and wells was offset by a drop in commercial and healthcare buildings.
Spending on public construction projects fell 0.6% in April. State and local government outlays slipped 0.2%, while federal government spending declined 6.2%.

298,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",,,,,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone inflation surged past the European Central Bank's elusive target in May, heightening a communications challenge for policymakers who will happily live with higher prices for now but may face a backlash from irate consumers. 
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 2% in May from 1.6% in April, driven by higher energy costs to its fastest rate since late 2018 and above the ECB's aim of ""below but close to 2%"", data from Eurostat showed on Tuesday.
The figure is also above expectations for 1.9% in a Reuters poll, likely intensifying talk that structural forces, not just transient factors, may be behind a surge.
""Everyone saw it coming, but still it is starting to make a lot of people sweat,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said. ""Inflation is returning rapidly at the moment at a time when news about economies is increasingly upbeat and labour markets are profiting from the reopening.""
May is unlikely to be the peak, however. Inflation could be closer to 2.5% late in the year as the recovery from a pandemic-induced double-dip recession and recent commodity price increases add to price pressures. 
Still, getting through this period is more a communications exercise for the ECB. The bank has already made clear that this is not the sort of inflation it is looking for after nearly a decade of undershooting its target, so policy will remain loose for years to come.
For one, the surge in inflation is temporary, even the most conservative policymakers argue. The drivers of price growth will fade early next year and inflation will be below target for years to come, especially since wage growth, a necessary component of durable inflation, remains anaemic. 
Although unemployment fell to 8% in April from 8.1% in March, according to separate data, it remains well above the pre-crisis rate and government subsidies still likely keep it artificially low. 
Higher oil prices also mask weak underlying trends and inflation for services and durable goods, more meaningful measures for central bankers, remains weak, rate setters argue. 
Indeed, core inflation, or prices excluding volatile food and energy costs, only picked up to 0.9% from 0.8%. A more narrow measure, which excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 0.9% from 0.7%. 
ECB policy is also ineffective against short-term price movements, providing yet another reason for the bank to look past this year's surge.

All this supports arguments for the ECB to keep policy ultra easy when rate setters next meet on June 10, even if they face a potential public backlash, especially in Germany, where inflation will exceed 3% later this year as a tax hike and statistical effects add to price pressures.
Already the biggest critics of ECB policy, some conservative Germans fear that the central bank is excessively complacent about inflation and its easy money policy could herald a new period of higher prices.

299,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at a record pace in May, according to a survey on Tuesday which suggested growth would have been even faster without supply bottlenecks that have led to an unprecedented rise in input costs.
The bloc's economy has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic over the past year, with governments forcing much of the region's dominant service industry to close. But factories largely remained open, and restrictions in various countries have gradually been eased.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 63.1 in May from April's 62.9, above an initial 62.8 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and is seen as a good guide to economic health, eased from April's 63.2 to 62.2. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey.""
Disruptions caused by the global coronavirus pandemic are still having a huge impact on supply chains, making it a sellers' market for the raw materials that factories need.
The input prices index soared to 87.1 from April's 82.2, easily the highest reading on record, and while factories passed on those costs at the fastest pace in the survey's history, some of the burden was absorbed by manufacturers.
Still, inflationary pressures might be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who have not managed to get inflation anywhere near their goal despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy.
The euro area was expected to emerge from a double-dip recession this quarter, a Reuters poll found, but a projected rise in price pressures this year was not expected to be sustainable, with inflation forecast to ease substantially. [ECILT/EU]
""We expect price pressures to moderate as the disruptive effects of the pandemic ease further in coming months and global supply chains improve,"" Williamson said.

Struggling to get the materials they need to meet booming demand - or not wanting to pay the price, factories built up backlogs of work at a rate not seen in the survey's history.
After a slow start, vaccine programmes are accelerating in the euro zone so optimism remained high and factories increased headcount at one of the fastest rates since the survey began.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factory activity powered ahead in Europe last month and stayed strong in Asia as demand grew, surveys showed, but rising raw material costs and supply bottlenecks posed a headache for business and weighed on the recovery in export-driven economies.
European manufacturers ramped up activity at the fastest monthly pace in PMI survey history but a spike in COVID-19 infections in some countries continued to disrupt supply chains.
Euro zone manufacturing activity would have been even faster without those constraints, but IHS Markit's final euro zone manufacturing PMI still rose to 63.1 in May from April's 62.9. [EUR/PMIM]
That was above an initial 62.8 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
In Britain, a deluge of new orders helped drive a record increase in factory growth, and its IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 65.6, the highest since the survey started in 1992. [GB/PMIM]
""The business surveys continue to suggest the economy, and particularly the manufacturing sector, is going gangbusters, and are consistent with our view that the recovery will be very strong in Q2 and the second half of the year,"" said Andrew Kennigham at Capital Economics.
""That said, the hard data may come in a bit less strong than the surveys imply, not least due to the evident supply bottlenecks."" 
The euro area was expected to emerge from a double-dip recession this quarter, a Reuters poll found, but a projected rise in price pressures this year was not expected to be sustainable, with inflation forecast to ease substantially. [ECILT/EU]
Disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic are having a huge impact on supply chains, making it a sellers' market for the raw materials that factories need, and leading to huge increases in input costs.
""Supply shortages will lead to some upward pressure on inflation but it will not be huge and will be short-lived,"" Kenningham added. 
In the euro zone, the input prices index was easily the highest reading on record and official data on Tuesday showed inflation surged past the European Central Bank's target of just below 2% last month.
INDIA SLUMP 
China's factory activity meanwhile expanded at the fastest pace this year on solid demand at home and overseas, sharp rises in input prices there and strains in supply chains crimped some firms' production.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI, which focuses on smaller firms, rose to 52.0 last month, the highest since December and inching up from April's 51.9.
China's official PMI on Monday showed factory activity in the world's second-largest economy slowed slightly in May on surging raw material costs.
Factory activity in Japan and South Korea moderated in May, underscoring the fragile nature of their recoveries.
""A spread of new (COVID) variants is already having a negative impact on supply chains. If this situation persists, it would hit Asian manufacturers that had been scrambling to diversify supply chains out of China,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Asia's recovery has been driven more by external than domestic demand. If companies have trouble exporting enough goods, that bodes ill for the region's economies."" 
The effects of surging infections on manufacturing were most prominent in India, where factory activity growth slowed to its weakest in 10 months, the PMI for the country showed.
India's coronavirus outbreak has infected 28 million, killed more than 300,000 and forced many states to impose restrictions on economic activity.
Factories in Taiwan and Vietnam were so far holding up despite rising infections there. 
Japan's au Jibun Bank PMI dropped in May as a global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions hit car production, causing output growth to miss expectations in April.

South Korea's PMI slowed from April and although growth extended into an eighth straight month the pace of input price increases hit a 13-year high.
The recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy remained robust with South Korean exports logging their sharpest expansion in 32 years in May, fuelled by stronger consumer demand globally as many economies start to reopen.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.34% in May from a month earlier, quickening slightly from 0.23% in April, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
The number of cities that reported monthly price rises picked up to 80 in May from 77 in April, with small cities in the Yangtze River Delta showing the greatest strength.
""The volume of new residential home projects supplied by developers remained elevated in May,"" said China Index Academy Research Director Cao Jingjing. 
Cao added property owners looking it buy a larger home have led demand for new projects, fuelling price gains.
Prices of second-hand homes rose 0.5% in May from previous month, unchanged from the pace in April. Existing home prices in tier-1 cities ticked up 0.95% on-month in May, with the pace more than doubling the average growth in other lower tier cities. 
Separately，a private survey published on Tuesday showed that China's average home rental prices in large and medium-sized cities in May rose 0.78% month-on-month, the biggest increase since January 2019.
Against a year ago, rents fell 0.61% in May, the smallest decline since May 2020, as a vast number of college graduates led to a surge in rental demand, the Chinese property data provider Zhuge House Hunter said. 
Chinese authorities have since this year intensified their campaign to rein in the relentless rise in home prices and drive speculators out of the market. Local policies include capping prices set by developers and preventing some real estate agencies from setting excessively high second-hand home prices. Banks in major cities also hiked mortgage rates.

Transactions in 18 major cities tracked by the institute remained flat in May compared with April, with tier-1 cities logging 20% drop while tier-3 towns seeing 33% rise.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 65.6 in May from 60.9 in April. While a little lower than the preliminary ""flash"" reading of 66.1, it still marked the highest since the survey started in 1992.
The index levels represent the pace and breadth of growth rather than the amount of output, however, and the sector likely has some way to go to get back to where it was before the lockdown.
The survey's gauges of growth in new orders and employment also hit record highs, although so too did the measure of input cost inflation paid by factories for goods as they cited poor harvests, port disruption and Brexit.
Price pressures are on the radar of the Bank of England, though the central bank has said it is likely to look through price rises caused by short-term disruptions.
The BoE said last month that the world's fifth-biggest economy was on course to grow by 7.25% in 2021, its fastest since World War Two, after a near 10% contraction last year.

Tuesday's survey showed that export orders increased at the fastest rate on record, although survey compiler IHS Markit said this was driven mainly by larger companies, with smaller manufacturers seeing less demand.

The surprisingly solid job market data is supporting expectations for a consumer-driven recovery over the summer months as households are ready to splash out after months of limited possibilities to spend due to COVID-19 restrictions.
The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 15,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.739 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 9,000.
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate remained unchanged at 6% for the fifth consecutive month.

""There are first signs of a comprehensive improvement on the labour market in May. The impact of the coronavirus crisis is still visible very clearly, but it is becoming a bit smaller,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, reached 64.4, below March's record high 66.6 but up from a flash reading of 64.0. The index stood at 66.2 in April.
Factories in Europe's biggest economy have been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by lockdowns that have impacted the services sector. Activity accelerated early this year on strong demand from the United States and China.
But supply shortages and rising costs pose a growing threat, the survey compilers said.
""The disruption from supply shortages has continued to spread, with now almost four-in-five manufacturers reporting increased lead times on inputs and a growing number also citing an impact on output and new orders due to forced downtime,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""The disruption to supply comes hand in hand with a further surge in cost pressures, with 90% of manufacturers – far more than ever before in the survey's 25-year history – reporting increased input prices in May,"" he added. 

""Strong demand fundamentals mean that manufacturers are able to pass on some of the burden of higher costs through unprecedented price increases of their own.""
The survey also found that activity expectations for the year ahead remained close to record high levels and manufacturers were hiring at a faster pace to meet rising demand.

That was even slightly better than a preliminary reading of 59.2 and took the index further above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
Manufacturers ramped up production a notch as the country emerged from its third national lockdown in the middle of the month, with backlogs at their highest point since November 2006.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's home prices are expected to grow faster this year than anticipated a few months earlier fuelled by hot demand in major cities and easy liquidity, despite Beijing's heightened cooling measures, a Reuters poll showed.
As China's economy recovers from the COVID-19 shock, authorities have stepped up curbs on the property sector to guard against financial risks as concerns mount over speculative behaviour in some parts of the market. Home prices, however, extended a rising streak in recent months with heat spilling over into some smaller towns from metropolises.
Average residential property price growth is estimated to grow 5% in 2021, according to 11 analysts and economists surveyed by Reuters.
The forecast topped a 3.3% gain tipped in a February survey, and slightly higher than around 4.9% gain in 2020. Home prices are seen slowing to 3% in the first half of 2022.
Despite stepped-up market restrictions, prices are on a rising trajectory, said Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, a Beijing-based property research institute. Climbing land prices are also expected to buoy housing prices, she said.
Zhao Ke, analyst at China Merchants Securities, said muted prices in tier-3 and 4 cities were likely to drag down overall gains.
Chinese authorities have since this year intensified their efforts to rein in the relentless rise in home prices and drive speculators out of the market. Local policies include capping prices set by developers and preventing some real estate agencies from setting excessively high second-hand home prices. Banks in major cities also hiked mortgage rates.
Property sales volume is expected to be flat from last year, unchanged from the previous poll, and versus a 2.6% gain in 2020.
Housing investments are estimated to rise 7% this year, in line with the pace in 2020, and marginally higher than 6.4% in the February poll. 
""We expect new construction investment to revive in the third quarter on fast work resumption and rising raw material prices,"" China Merchants Securities' Zhao said.
""Home project construction investment will be the major pillar of overall property investment, which will also be likely driven by rental housing construction,"" China Index Academy's Huang said. 
Most survey respondents forecast it will take a long time before China enacts broad property tax, but some predicted some bigger cities with frothy housing markets might see pilot schemes come into force in the coming year.
Speculation has risen recently that China plans to expand property tax reforms beyond Shanghai and Chongqing in efforts to cool prices. State media have cited experts saying the southern tech hub of Shenzhen and the resort island of Hainan could be next to roll out pilot schemes.

Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale, with 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, analysts' median answer was 7, in line with the last poll.

Almost seven in 10 homeowners considering a move said they would be doing it even without the extension of a tax incentive by finance minister Rishi Sunak, Nationwide said, citing a survey it conducted in late April.
Shifting housing preferences were ""continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic,"" Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said.
Tuesday's figures are the latest to show the scale of the surge in house prices which hit a new record high at an average of 242,832 pounds ($345,355.67), according to Nationwide.
Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said in an interview published on Tuesday there was a ""risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure.""
""We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators,"" he told the Guardian newspaper. 
Nationwide said house prices were 1.8% higher than in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 9.2% in annual terms and by 0.8% from April. 
Nationwide said there was scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, given how weak the housing market was in early stages of the pandemic.
But if unemployment rises sharply later in 2021 - when Sunak's jobs protection programme is due to expire - there was scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, it said.

Less timely but broader official data from the Office for National Statistics has shown that house prices in March jumped by just over 10%, the largest annual rise by that measure in nearly 14 years.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the sector rose to 51.9 in May from 50.4 the previous month, staying above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the fifth month in a row. 
""Russian manufacturers saw a modest improvement in operating conditions in May, and the sharpest since March 2019,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.

The fastest output growth rate since February and an uptick in new business led to the sharpest rise in job creation since December 2018.
New export orders rose in May, although only fractionally, following four months of contraction, while supply shortages pushed up average cost burdens across the Russian goods-producing sector. 

Manufacturers were the least optimistic they have been about the outlook since January, although their overall view remained positive thanks to renewed order growth, new product development and hopes for an end to COVID-19-related restrictions.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea exports logged their sharpest expansion in 32 years in May, marking another robust month of shipments fuelled by stronger consumer demand globally as many economies start to reopen.
Surging chip and car shipments helped power a 45.6% surge in South Korea's exports from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, posting the fastest growth since August 1988 and extending their expansion to a seventh month in a row. 
Exports growth, however, slightly missed a consensus of a 48.5% gain in a Reuters poll.
Asia's fourth-largest economy is the first major exporting economy to report monthly trade data that includes key IT products and the strength of its exports could further build confidence in a global economic recovery.
""Robust U.S. consumer spending means demand (for Korean products) will remain strong, and suggests May trade data for China and Japan will also be robust,"" said Park Sung-woo, an economist at DB Financial Investment said.
While the pace of shipments growth is set to slow as base effects from the coronavirus fade, the outlook for exports remains bullish.
""The base effect will keep exports growth strong through June and the pace will slow down in the third quarter. Annual exports growth will probably be double-digit,"" Park said.
In South Korea's largest port of Pusan, port congestion is so bad that the Pusan Newport International Terminal, one of the largest terminals in the country, has begun accepting container boxes only if they are due for shipment within five days, down from seven previously.
Separate data on the nation's factory activity showed activity extended growth into an eight straight month in May. The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for May stood at 53.7, compared with 54.6 in April, with a reading above the 50-mark meaning an expansion in activity.
Reflecting the robust business activity, vice finance minister Lee Eog-weon on Tuesday said there are clearer signs of inflation, and that consumer inflation is likely to accelerate further in May. 
South Korea's Kospi inched up for a third straight session, up 0.52% by 0130 GMT at 3,219.98 as heavyweights across chips, cars and petrochemical sectors all gained. 
The export data showed shipments of chips gained 24.5% on-year, rising for an 11th month in a row, while shipments of cars soared 93.7%. Petrochemical products exports surged 94.9% from a year earlier.

Average exports per working day grew 49.0% in May, far outperforming a 29.5% increase of April when shipments gained 41.2%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices surged in May while approvals to build new houses reached record highs, helped by super-low rates, adding yet another challenge for the country's central bank, which wants to keep rates low until inflation revives.
Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Tuesday showed national home prices climbed 2.2% in May, their second fastest increase since the late 1980s and the eighth straight monthly gain.
Separate figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed approvals to build private houses skyrocketed 67.4% in April from a year ago while total dwelling approvals soared nearly 40%. 
Record low borrowing rates together with a government ""HomeBuilder"" incentive has pushed up housing demand, which is likely to extend despite the conclusion of the fiscal scheme. The red-hot market has provided a much-needed windfall to consumer wealth and confidence.
Buyers have been further encouraged by the outlook for borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) repeatedly saying rates were likely to remain at a historic low of 0.1% until at least 2024.
The RBA announces its monthly monetary policy decision at 0430 GMT at which it is widely expected to hold rates and reiterate its dovish stance despite exuberance in recent data, as there are few signs of inflation and wage pressures. [AU/INT]

Other figures from the ABS out on Tuesday showed Australia's current account surplus hitting a record of A$18.3 billion, suggesting the A$2 trillion ($1.6 trillion) economy may have expanded at a faster pace than previously thought.
Yet, exports looked likely to detract 0.6 percentage points from March quarter GDP led by solid import volumes.
Importantly, business inventories climbed 2.1% confounding expectations for a 0.2% increase and implying a 0.7 percentage point contribution to GDP.
First-quarter GDP data is due on Wednesday where economists have forecast a brisk 1% quarterly rise, which would take annual output back to its pre-pandemic level.
The better-than-expected numbers were still unlikely to shake the RBA's dovish stance, in contrast to its New Zealand counterpart which has signalled interest rate hikes from as early as next year.

""The absence of any lived experience of price or wage inflation will likely see the RBA continue with the application of historically high levels of monetary accommodation, at least in the very near-term,"" said GSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies cut spending on plant and equipment for the fourth straight quarter in January-March, as the economy struggles to shake off the drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
Weak business spending is likely to worry policymakers hoping strong domestic demand can help make the country's economic recovery more sustainable.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Tuesday showed capital expenditure in the first quarter fell 7.8% from the same period last year, pulled down by weaker investments in transportation equipment, electrical machinery and real estate.
It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of annual decline in capital expenditure, after a 4.8% contraction the final quarter of last year.
""The figure gives a weak impression, but GDP was originally weak already,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
A separate, private-sector survey on Tuesday showed Japan's factory activity expanded in May, largely thanks to strong external demand, but at a slower pace.
The world's third-largest economy slumped back into decline in the first quarter as a slow vaccine rollout and repeated emergency curbs to halt a resurgence of infections hurt domestic demand.
The finance ministry's capex data, which will be used to update gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first quarter due out June 8, was unlikely to impact the growth estimate in a major way, analysts said.
Some firms were seen putting off unnecessary investments in favour of holding onto cash, a finance ministry official said.
""Non-manufacturers have likely been building up cash positions rather than committing to spending for reinforcing safety, pushing back their capital expenditure plans beyond the fiscal year-end,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
RECOVERY SLOWING
After bouncing from last year's slump, driven by a strong export recovery, some analysts worry Japan's economy could slip back into recession in the current quarter due to extended coronavirus curbs.
A preliminary estimate found Japan's economy shrank an annualised 5.1% in the first quarter as households curtailed spending and export growth slowed sharply.
The latest MOF survey showed manufacturers' business spending fell 6.4% from a year earlier, posting a smaller contraction than the previous quarter's 8.5% drop.
That of service-sector firms dropped 8.5% year-on-year, up from a 2.6% decline in the previous quarter.
Weaker-than-expected factory output and retail sales figures on Monday showed that the economic recovery remained dependent on overseas demand.

Capital expenditure lost 0.4% in January-March from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the MOF data showed.
Corporate recurring profits gained 26.0% in January-March from a year earlier, up for the first time in eight quarters, while sales were down for a seventh consecutive quarter, declining 3.0%.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.0 last month, the highest level since December and inching up from April's 51.9.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to remain at 51.9. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
New orders rose at the strongest pace so far this year and a gauge for export orders was the highest since November, but the output reading, while still solid, was slightly lower than the previous month.
""Rapidly rising commodity prices began to disrupt the economy as some enterprises began to hoard goods, while some others suffered raw material shortages. Supply chains were also significantly affected,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said in comments released alongside the survey's findings.
A sub-index for input costs expanded at the fastest pace since 2016.
Manufacturers passed on some of the pressure to their customers, with a gauge for output prices rising at the quickest pace in a decade. Charges for exported goods rose at the fastest rate in three years.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by the lifting of pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
China's policymakers have repeatedly expressed concern about rising commodity prices in recent weeks and called for stricter management of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation."" The warnings have prompted some pullback in metals prices but analysts are unsure how long such a correction may last given improving global demand.
Firms continued to hire but at a slower pace, with some enterprises saying they were trying to reduce costs.
Earnings at China's industrial firms grew at a slower pace in April, with high commodity prices and weaker performance in the consumer goods sector limiting overall profitability from manufacturing.

China's economy posted record growth in the first quarter as it recovered quickly from the pandemic although analysts expect the brisk expansion to moderate later this year.
Officials warn the foundations for economic recovery are not yet secure amid problems like higher raw material costs.

Overseas shipments increased 45.6% from a year earlier, the trade ministry said Tuesday, compared with economists’ forecasts for a 48.9% increase. Exports to China rose 22.7% while total semiconductor shipments increased 24.5%.
While export growth was in part inflated by last year’s 24% plunge, the outsized gains reinforce the view that global commerce is recovering from the pandemic and fueling Korea’s economic expansion. Increased vaccinations in major economies like the U.S. have allowed business regulations to be further relaxed and bolstered consumer confidence.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's annual economic growth rate picked up in January-March compared with the previous three months, but economists are increasingly pessimistic about this quarter after a huge second wave of COVID-19 infections hit the country last month.
A slow vaccination drive and local restrictions after a massive second wave of infections and deaths across the country have hit economic activities like retail, transport and construction while putting millions out of work.
India has recorded 28 million COVID-19 infections, second only to the United States, and 329,100 deaths as of Monday, although the rise has begun to slow.
Gross domestic product grew 1.6% in January-March compared with the same period a year earlier, mainly driven by state spending and manufacturing sector growth, data from the statistics ministry showed on Monday.
Economists said the country faces a slowdown in consumer demand as household incomes and jobs have declined, with limited scope for the government to offer growth stimulus due to its rising debt.
Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC bank, said while the year-on-year numbers for the April-June quarter might look upbeat due to a low base, the sequential growth is likely to contract.
""With the spread of the virus more acute in rural areas in this wave, rural demand and sectors dependent on the rural economy might come under stress.""
Economists have cut their growth forecast for the fiscal year that began in April to 8%-10% from an earlier 11%-12%.
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - rose 2.7% year-on-year in January-March following a revised 2.8% fall the previous quarter, data showed.
Annual growth of 6.9% in manufacturing and 14.5% in construction during the three months to March reflected signs of a recovery before the second wave hit the country. 
Investments rose 10.9% compared with growth of 2.6% the previous quarter, while state spending jumped 28.3% after almost no growth in the October-December period, data showed.
India also revised its annual GDP estimates for the fiscal year, predicting a 7.3% contraction, narrower than its earlier forecast for a downturn of 8.0%.
SLOW VACCINATION
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has faced criticism for the slow pace of his four-month-old vaccination campaign, which has inoculated fewer than 4% of India's 1.38 billion people.
The central bank, which has kept monetary policy loose while boosting liquidity to the economy, said last week the country's growth prospects will depend on how fast India can arrest infections.
Analysts warn that the slow rollout could pose medium-term risks to growth, especially if the country were to experience a third wave of COVID-19.
Unemployment soared to a near one-year high of 14.7% in the week ending May 23, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based private think tank.

Krishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economic adviser at the finance ministry, said that some growth momentum had been lost after a surge in virus cases.
""India continues to need monetary and fiscal policy support,"" he said after the release of data.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.4% in May, up from 2.1% in April. A Reuters forecast had pointed to a May reading of 2.5%.
The ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, said earlier this month the bank had a ""lot of work to do"" to raise inflation back to its 2% goal and market talk of rapidly rising prices is misplaced.
Euro zone inflation is approaching 2%, its fastest rate in years, on the back of fiscal support and the unwinding of last year's oil price crash, prompting some commentators to predict a new era of inflation.
But Lane pushed back on this narrative, arguing that the labour market will take years to get back to its pre-crisis level, corporate balance sheets are depleted and the economic rebound is still predicated on copious central bank and government support.

The ECB will next meet on June 10 and must decide whether to ease up on its stimulus given the prospect of rapid growth over the rest of the year as economic restrictions are lifted and the services sector rebounds.
""The ECB is unlikely to be disturbed by the short-term fluctuations in the inflation rate and will only slowly return its policy to normal,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said.

Investing.com –China’s factory activities growth slowed in May as Chinese firms struggled with higher raw material costs.
Data released earlier in the day said the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in May was 51.0, below the 51.1 reading in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and April’s reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 55.2, above the previous month’s 54.9 reading. Both indexes remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
Although China continues its economic recovery from COVID-19, officials warn that the foundations of the recovery are not secure due to higher raw material prices and the outbreak of COVID-19 in parts of the world.
""External demand will likely remain flat"" as economic recoveries in the U.S. and parts of Europe will possibly be ""offset by increasing COVID-19 cases in ASEAN, which is the biggest trade partner of China,"" Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said in a note.
Meanwhile, China’s Guangdong province is facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with producers in the city facing challenges including continued semiconductor chip shortages and high commodity prices.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have soared this year due to demand growth in post-lockdown cities.
The rising commodity prices have reportedly caused concerns among China’s policymakers who have called for tightened scrutiny of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation.""
""We expect commodity prices to stabilize in the coming months,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told Reuters. He added China’s firms will get released following the stricter scrutiny on spot and futures markets, as well as increased global commodity supply in the second half of 2021.
Meanwhile, the appreciation of Chinese currency and high shipping costs also added pressure on Chinese factories."

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched lower to 51.0 in May, against analyst expectations that it would remain unchanged from April at 51.1, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, has stood above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for over a year.

A sub-index for new export orders stood at 48.3 in May, down from 50.4 in the previous month and slipping sharply into contraction.
A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 72.8 in May, up from April's 66.9 and hitting the highest level since 2010.

Tougher oversight on spot and futures markets and increased global commodity supply in the second half of 2021 should help reduce cost pressures on China's firms, he said.
In addition to surging raw material prices, Chinese factories are struggling with high shipping costs and an appreciating Chinese currency. Some are able to pass on the higher costs to overseas customers, while some small firms are stopping taking orders to avoid losses. 
A sub-index for the activity of small firms stood at 48.8 in May, sharply down from April's 50.8. 
Firms continued to lay off workers and at faster pace, the official data also showed.
In the services sector, activity expanded for the 15th straight month, and at a faster pace, with the non-manufacturing PMI index rising to 55.2 from 54.9 the month before.
China posted a record 18.3% growth in the first quarter, but analysts expect the brisk expansion to moderate later this year.

Policymakers have pledged to support job-creating small firms that were hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank is trying to cool credit growth to help contain debt risks, but is treading warily to avoid hurting the economic recovery.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output extended gains in April as manufacturers benefited from a recovery in appetite for capital goods, especially in key overseas markets.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to grow in the current quarter at a much slower pace than previously thought after the government extended coronavirus emergency measures in Tokyo and other major areas.
Separate data on Monday showed retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, surged in April, thanks largely to favourable statistical base effects from a year earlier, when the country was under an even stricter coronavirus curbs.
Official data released on Monday showed factory output grew 2.5% from the previous month in April, as higher production of general-purpose and electrical machinery offset a contraction in cars and transportation equipment output.
The rise in output was better than the previous month's 1.7% gain, but much weaker than a 4.1% advance forecast in a Reuters poll of economists as car production fell largely due to supply issues with semiconductors.
""It confirmed Japan's output has been improving steadily due to export-driven gains,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""But it's hard to get excited by the overall picture as domestic conditions are very stagnant due to the coronavirus.""
Shipments of capital goods such as production machinery to the United States and China rose, a government official said, highlighting growing foreign demand for capital equipment as a global economic recovery picks up.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to lose 1.7% in May, followed by a sharp 5.0% rebound in June.
Factory output had posted a surprise increase in March, as a jump in car production helped keep the economic recovery on track. Hopes of a recovery in capital spending at home and in overseas markets and demand for tech-making equipment underpinned the outlook for output.
Some analysts worry that Japan's economy could fall into recession in the current quarter, after the government extended a COVID-19 emergency for Tokyo and other major areas until June 20, which is hurting consumer spending.
After emerging from last year's slump, the economy contracted in the first quarter as a slow vaccine rollout and repeated emergency measures put in place to halt a resurgence of infections dealt a blow to consumption.

In April, retail sales soared 12.0% year-on-year, the government said on Monday, mainly due to statistical base effects but also strong appetite for general merchandise and clothing.
Retail sales, however, shed 4.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to the previous month, as consumer sentiment struggled with the most recent measures to stem a halt in coronavirus infections.

321,"<span>May 30, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of China’s manufacturing industry steadied in May, suggesting the economy’s recovery momentum might have peaked. The services and construction sectors strengthened.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slowed slightly to 51 in May from 51.1 in the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, lower than the median estimate of 51.1 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, climbed to 55.2, above the 55.1 projected by economists. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in output.
The official manufacturing reading pointed to a stabilization in output, with the fewer working days in the month compared to April possible affecting the results. External demand likely remained strong in May due to the reopening of some nations such as the U.S., but recent rapid increases in commodity prices are weighing on the profitability of companies, especially those that purchase raw materials like metal ores or coal.
The data confirms that “the pace of the economic recovery in China has been slowing,” Qu Hongbin, co-head of economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We are already past the peak of recovery momentum in China.”
Input prices for manufacturers jumped to 72.8 in the month, the highest since 2010.
A sub-index of new export orders for factories fell into contraction, down to 48.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month, while new orders were at 51.3.

The service sector recovery has been recovering this year with further reductions in domestic travel restrictions releasing some pent-up demand such as a surge in Chinese travel over the May Labor Day holidays, which exceeded pre-pandemic levels. However, that pickup in domestic consumption is still lagging behind the pickup in the industrial sector.
The construction sector strengthened, reversing its decline from a peak in March. A sub-index of manufacturing employment was at 48.9, the same as non-manufacturing employment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices surged in April, with a measure of underlying inflation blowing past the Federal Reserve's 2% target and posting its largest annual gain since 1992, because of pent-up demand and supply constraints as the economy reopens.
The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. 
The U.S. central bank slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero last year and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. It has signaled it could tolerate higher inflation for some time to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its target, a flexible average.
The supply constraints largely reflect a shift in demand towards goods and away from services during the pandemic. A reversal is underway, with Americans flying to vacation destinations and staying at hotels among other activities. Year-on-year inflation is also accelerating as last spring's weak readings drop from the calculation. 
""Many goods are in short supply amid very strong demand and supply chain disruptions, and some services prices are up sharply as consumers start to go out again,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Shortages of labor in some industries are also contributing to higher prices. But many of these factors will prove transitory, and inflation will slow in the second half of 2021."" 
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.7% last month amid strong gains in both goods and services. That was the biggest rise in the so-called core PCE price index since October 2001 and followed a 0.4% gain in March.
In the 12 months through April, the core PCE price index vaulted 3.1%, the most since July 1992, after rising 1.9% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core PCE price index rising 0.6% in April and surging 2.9% year-on-year.
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, though gains were capped by the rising price pressures. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
""Inflation is up, but real yields are still low,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""This is basically the transitory sweet spot.""

INCOME PLUNGES
Some economists are not convinced that higher inflation will be temporary.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers' one-year inflation expectations shot up to 4.6% in May from 3.4% in April, hurting household sentiment. Their five-year inflation expectations rose to 3.0% from 2.7% last month.
""Concerns about the future can cause households to become more conservative in their spending,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is guessing that the rise in inflation will be temporary, and it better be correct.""  
Though consumer spending moderated last month as the boost to incomes from stimulus checks faded, households have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, which should underpin demand. Wages are also rising as companies seek to attract labor to increase production.
Generous unemployment benefits funded by the government, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus, even with vaccines widely accessible, as well as pandemic-related retirements have left companies scrambling for labor.
That is despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month. Data for March was revised higher to show spending surging 4.7% instead of 4.2% as previously reported. 
The rise in spending was in line with expectations. Spending was held back by a 0.6% drop in outlays on goods. Though purchases of long-lasting goods such as motor vehicles rose 0.5%, spending on nondurable goods tumbled 1.3%. Outlays on services increased 1.1%, led by spending on recreation, hotel accommodation and at restaurants. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending slipped 0.1% after jumping 4.1% in March. Despite last month's dip in the so-called real consumer spending, March's solid increase put consumption on a higher growth trajectory in the second quarter.
Personal income plunged 13.1% after surging 20.9% in March. With spending exceeding income, the saving rate dropped to a still-high 14.9% from 27.7% in March. Wages increased 1.0% for a second straight month.
Consumer spending powered ahead at a 11.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, contributing to the economy's 6.4% growth pace. Most economists expect double-digit growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

Growth prospects for the second quarter were bolstered by another report from the Commerce Department showing the goods trade deficit narrowed 7.3% to $85.2 billion in April, with exports rising and imports declining. 
But inventory at retailers fell 1.6%, pulled down by a 7.0% plunge in automobile stocks as the sector struggles with a global semiconductor shortage.

That was in line with the median forecast among economists polled by Reuters.
""Consumer confidence remained largely unchanged at the reduced level recorded at mid-month,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. ""It is hardly surprising that the resurgent strength of the economy produced more immediate gains in demand than supply, causing consumers to expect a surge in inflation.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 89.4 from April's 97.2, and also down from May's preliminary reading of 90.8.

The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slid to 78.8 in May from April's 82.7, but up modestly from the mid-month reading of 77.6.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation remained unchanged from May's preliminary reading of 4.6 percent, while the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook eased to 3.0 percent from 3.1 percent.

That PMI reading would be unchanged from April, when China's factory activity growth slowed as supply bottlenecks and rising costs weighed on production and overseas demand lost momentum.

Officials warn the foundations for the economic recovery are not yet secure amid problems like higher raw material costs and the epidemic situation overseas. 
In April, earnings at China's industrial firms grew at a slower pace, with high commodity prices and weaker performance in the consumer goods sector limiting overall profitability from manufacturing.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by post-lockdown recoveries in demand and easing liquidity globally.
China's policymakers have repeatedly expressed concern about rising commodity prices in recent weeks and called for stricter management of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation.""

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Monday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Tuesday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip slightly to 51.7 from April's 51.9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output is expected to have risen for the second straight month in April on brisk exports and solid demand for electronic goods, a Reuters poll showed, a sign a rebound in overseas growth was cushioning the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Household spending is also set to show an increase in April from year-before levels, according to the poll, though the outlook is clouded by a likely extension of the current state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic.
Industrial production was forecast up 4.1% in April from the previous month, as manufacturers benefited from rising demand for machinery and electronic goods.
""A chip shortage may weigh on automobile production. But exports are strong thanks to a recovery in overseas growth, which likely drove up production of machinery,"" said analysts at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Household spending likely rose 9.3% in April from a year earlier, the poll also showed, though the gain is due largely to the base effect of last year's slump caused by the pandemic.
Compared with the previous month, household spending is expected to have fallen 2.2% in April.
""Consumption likely slowed from the previous month due to the declaration of the third state of emergency, which dealt a blow mainly on service spending,"" said analysts at Shinkin Central Bank.

The April output data is due out at 8:50 a.m. on May 31 (2350GMT, May 30) and the household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on June 4 (2330GMT, June 3).
Japan's economy shrank in the first quarter and many analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as renewed state of emergency curbs hurt consumption.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's unemployment rate crept up and job availability slid in April, data showed on Friday, underscoring the pain the country's prolonged battle with COVID-19 is inflicting on the economy.
Separate data showed core consumer prices in Tokyo fell in May, reinforcing expectations inflation will remain well below the central bank's 2% target for the time being.
The government is looking to extend state of emergency curbs to combat at the pandemic by about three weeks to June 20, a cabinet minister said on Friday, clouding the outlook for the fragile recovery.
Japan's jobless rate rose to 2.8% in April from 2.6% in March, government data showed on Friday, exceeding a median market forecast of 2.7%.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio stood at 1.09, down from the previous month's 1.10, which was also the Reuters poll forecast.
""Job offers may have dipped again in May due to the third round of emergency declarations. That may further hold back the recovery in employment,"" said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics.
""But further ahead we still expect both employment and the labour force to return to pre-virus levels in the second half of the year as vaccines allow the economy to return to full health.""
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, considered a leading indicator of nationwide figures, fell 0.2% in May from a year earlier, separate data showed on Friday, matching a median market estimate.
Japan's economy shrank in the first quarter and many analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as renewed state of emergency curbs hurt consumption.

Weak domestic demand has stoked fears of a return to deflation even as other major economies see inflation tick up, keeping the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain massive stimulus.
The expected extension of state of emergency curbs to combat COVID-19 heightens the chance the BOJ will push back the current September deadline for a package of measures to cushion the economic blow from the health crisis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped more than expected last week as layoffs subsided, with companies desperate for workers to meet surging demand unleashed by a rapidly reopening economy.
The economy, which in the first quarter notched its second-fastest growth pace since the third quarter of 2003, is gaining speed, with other data on Thursday showing business spending on equipment accelerated in April. Activity is being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic's easing grip and nearly $6 trillion in relief provided by the government over the past year. 
""The economy is off and running,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Going forward growth will be supported by the pent-up savings that households have amassed during the pandemic."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 406,000 for the week ended May 22, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020 and marked the fourth straight weekly decline in applications. 
The decrease was led by Washington state, Florida and New Jersey. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 425,000 applications for the latest week. Though claims remain well above the 200,000 to 250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions, they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Pandemic-related restrictions on businesses have been rolled back, with more than half of adults in the United States fully vaccinated against COVID-19, leaving factories, construction sites, restaurants and bars, among many, clamoring for workers. 
The labor shortage, despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed, has been blamed on the safety net, strengthened during the pandemic by the government, to provide a temporary lifeline following the unprecedented economic and human carnage caused by the virus. (Graphic: Jobless claims, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznpnrygmpl/joblessclaims.png) 
Republican governors in at least 23 states, including Florida and Texas, have announced they are ending unemployment programs funded by the federal government next month, including a weekly $300 subsidy, which businesses say are discouraging the jobless from seeking work.
There is, however, no consensus that the generous unemployment benefits are keeping people home. According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Daniel Silver, an analysis of unemployment rates, wage growth and labor force participation rates in the 23 states suggested the early termination of the special benefits programs was motivated by politics rather than economics.
""While some of these states have tight labor markets and strong earnings growth, many of them do not,"" said Silver. ""It therefore looks like politics, rather than economics, is driving decisions regarding the early ends to these programs.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
BACK AT WORK
A survey by Poachedjobs.com, a national job board for the restaurant/hospitality industry, found most had returned to work, with a full schedule of 30-40 hours a week. 
For others, uncertainty about future restrictions on indoor dining and fears of contracting the virus, whether they are vaccinated or not, were keeping them away.
Fewer than 100,000 people filed claims last week under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs. The early termination of PUA and broadening economic re-engagement could push claims even lower and shrink the jobless rolls in the months ahead.
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 96,000 to 3.642 million in the week ending May 15. The so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May's employment report. 
The decline strengthens expectations that hiring picked up this month, though raw material shortages across industries could be a constraint. The dearth of workers and scarcity of inputs were blamed for the modest 266,000 jobs created in April, a slowdown from the 770,000 added in March.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department confirmed that gross domestic product increased at a 6.4% annualized rate last quarter. The unrevised estimate followed a 4.3% growth rate in the fourth quarter.
Before tax corporate profits slipped $0.2 billion after decreasing $31.4 billion in the October-December period. A rise in domestic nonfinancial corporation profits was offset by lower domestic financial corporation and international profits.
""Over the year, profits should be boosted more directly by services industries as we expect consumer spending to transition back to the much-larger services category,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Graphic: GDP, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgaqdqpq/gdp.png) 
The strong growth momentum held early in the second quarter, with another report from the Commerce Department showing orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 2.3% in April.
These so-called core capital goods orders increased 1.6% in March. Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.9% after rising 1.5% in March.

With households sitting on at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings, demand booming, inventories low and profits rebounding, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production, supporting manufacturing.
""Supply chain bottlenecks and shortages of certain materials are holding back some producers, but firms are clearly investing in increased capacity,"" said Chris Low, economist at FHN Financial in New York.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 2.3% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders increased 1.6% in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 1.0%. Orders shot up 14.7% year-on-year in April. 
Business investment on equipment has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last three quarters thanks to a shift in demand towards goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and massive fiscal stimulus to soften the blow to the economy from the public health crisis. 
Though demand is starting to revert back to services as vaccinations allow for broader economic re-engagement, appetite for goods remains healthy. But manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is experiencing shortages of labor and raw materials, impacting production at some industries.
Last month, core capital goods orders were lifted by machinery, primary and fabricated metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.9%.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.9% after rising 1.5% in March. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
With households sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings, demand booming and inventories low, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dropped 1.3% in April after rising 1.3% in March. They were pulled down by a 6.7% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 3.1% decrease in March.

Orders for civilian aircraft increased 17.4%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received only 25 aircraft orders last month, mostly 737 MAX jets, compared to 196 in March. The U.S. government late last year lifted a 20-month grounding of the aircraft that was put in place after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 6.2% in April after rising 3.8% in March. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products has also been impacted. Unfilled durable goods orders rose in April for a third straight month.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Earnings at China's industrial firms grew at a slower pace in April, with high commodity prices and weaker performance in the consumer goods sector limiting overall profitability from manufacturing.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose 57% year-on-year in April to 768.63 billion yuan ($120.22 billion), down from 92.3% in March, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday.
For the January-April period, industrial firms' profits grew 106% from the same period a year earlier to 2.59 trillion yuan, bolstered by a virus-related plunge in activity early last year.
""The improvement of corporate performance is still uneven,"" said NBS official Zhu Hong in a statement accompanying the data.
""The profitability of some consumer goods industries has not yet recovered to pre-epidemic levels; coupled with the high prices of bulk commodities, this has increased the pressure on the production and operation of midstream and downstream industries.""
Chemical products and metals processing firms recorded some of the highest year-on-year profit increases over the first four months, according to NBS data, recovering from the COVID-19-induced slump in economic activity in the same period last year.
Profits surged 484% over January-April in the non-ferrous metals smelting and pressing industry. Synthetic fibre manufacturing posted a 650.2% profit increase.
Fast profit growth for metals processing has been spurred by higher metal prices, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
""But this good time may not last as the government is clamping down on high commodity prices,"" she said.
China's government watchdogs warned industrial metals companies to maintain ""normal market order"" during talks on significant gains in metals prices this year, China's top economic planner said on Monday.
Weaker garment and textile manufacturing profits reflect a still gradual global economic recovery amid uncertainties about COVID-19 cases in Asia, said Pang.
China's economy posted record growth in the first quarter as it emerged from the pandemic although analysts expect the brisk expansion to moderate later this year.
Officials warn the foundations for economic recovery are not yet secure amid emerging problems, including pressures on firms caused by higher raw material costs as international commodity prices rise. 
From the start of the year through mid-May, prices for China's steel rebar, hot-rolled steel coil and copper - vital for the construction of machinery, buildings, appliances and vehicles - surged more than 30%.
Exports accelerated in April, as a brisk U.S. recovery and stalled factory production in virus-hit countries including India boosted overseas orders from China.
However, growth in factory activity and output slowed in April, with companies facing challenges such as chip and container shortages, problems in international logistics and rising freight rates.
Liabilities at industrial firms increased 8.6% year-on-year at end-April, down from 9.0% growth as of end-March.

The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy added just under 121,000 formal jobs in April, official figures showed on Wednesday, lifting the total new positions created in the first four months of the year to almost 1 million.
The pace of job creation, however, appears to be slowing. The 120,935 net new positions in April was lower than the 172,500 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and aside from a shock slump in December it was the lowest in 10 months.
Economy Paulo Guedes put that down to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic peaking. Compared to April last year when the first wave peaked and almost 1 million jobs were cut, Guedes said the outlook remains bright.
""The solution is to proceed with economic reforms and mass vaccinations, to ensure a safe return to work,"" Guedes said in an online address. ""It is hugely important that we maintain this rate of job growth to ensure we don't have economic scarring.""
Some 1.38 million positions were created in April and 1.26 million were cut. This means Brazil created a net 957,889 new formal jobs in the first four months of the year, the most for any Jan-April period in at least a decade.
These figures do not include the near-40 million undocumented workers in Brazil who do not have formal employment registration.
The figures for April were led by the services sector, which created a net 57,610 new positions, around half of the total. Construction accounted for 22,224 net new positions and industry 19,884, the ministry said.
The total number of formally registered workers in Brazil rose to 40.3 million in April, the highest April reading since 2015, according ministry figures.

Earnings rose too, with the average monthly salary of new jobs created up 2.5% in real terms from the prior month to an unadjusted 1,855.52 reais ($350).

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications decreased last week as fewer homeowners sought to refinance their loans, offsetting a modest rise in applications for loans to buy homes.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 4.2% in the week ended May 21 from a week earlier, reflecting a 7.2% decline in applications for refinancing. 
The purchase index increased 1.7% from a week earlier.
""Demand is robust throughout the country, but homebuyers continue to be held back by the lack of homes for sale and rapidly increasing home prices,"" Joel Kan, an economist at the MBA, said in a statement.
New home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 863,000 units in April as prices surged amid a tight supply of houses, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence hovered at a 14-month high in May as optimism over jobs tempered concerns about rising inflation and diminishing government financial support.
Though the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday suggested the pace of economic growth remained robust in the second quarter, the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which started in February 2020, is bumpy.
The housing market, one of the star performers, is showing signs of fatigue, with new single-family homes sales dropping in April amid a dearth of properties, which is boosting prices at the fastest pace in more than 15 years.
""Economic activity is getting back to where it was before the pandemic hit,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""So why aren't people more exuberant? We might want to start blaming inflation.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.2 this month from 117.5 in April, the highest level since February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 119.2.
Effective May, the Conference Board switched to an online from a mail survey. Data from January through April was revised to reflect the results of the online survey. The dip mirrored other sentiment surveys, which were pulled down by worries that rising inflation would erode consumers' purchasing power. 
Inflation is bubbling as the economy's reopening after coronavirus-related restrictions and massive fiscal stimulus unleash pent-up demand, which is pushing against supply constraints, leading to price hikes for most goods.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to a 14-month high of 144.3 from 131.9 last month. 
But the expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, fell to 99.1 from 107.9 in April. Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months jumped to 6.5% from 6.2% last month. 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
(Graphic: Consumer confidence, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvnrrgxvl/consconf.png) 
JOBS PLENTIFUL
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, raced to a reading of 34.6 in May from 21.6 in April. 
This measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report, is just below its 38.3 peak in August 2019. The jump in the so-called labor market differential this month likely reflected a record 8.1 million job openings.
It offers hope that job growth picked up this month. A labor shortage is hampering job growth, even as nearly 10 million Americans are officially unemployed. The worker shortage has been blamed on generous unemployment benefits, including a weekly $300 subsidy from the government.
Lack of child care facilities, with most schools offering partial in-person learning, as well as lingering fears of the virus and pandemic-related retirements are also believed to be contributing to the worker shortage, which curbed hiring in April. The government-funded benefits, part of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, expire in early September and school districts are expected to resume in-person classes in the fall, which economists hope will boost the labor pool.
Fewer consumers planned to buy homes, cars and major household appliances over the next six months, relative to April. However, the link between these purchasing plans and consumer spending is weak.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 863,000 units last month. March's sales pace was revised lower to 917,000 units from the previously reported 1.021 million units. Sales vaulted 48.3% on a year-on-year basis. 
(Graphic: New home sales, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmypmeernpr/nhs.png) 
The market for new homes is being boosted by near record low inventory of previously owned houses, especially entry level homes. The pandemic has fueled demand for spacious and more expensive accommodations as millions of Americans work from home and take classes remotely. 
But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials, limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes to plug the inventory gap.
Demographics favor the housing market. People between the ages of 26 and 34 years account for about 12.5% of the U.S. population.
""A growing number of millennials are aging into their prime household formation years, which will remain a fundamental tailwind over the next few years,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index rose 13.2% in March from a year ago, the largest increase since December 2005, after rising 12.0% in February. 
(Graphic: Case Shiller, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yxmpjmmwgvr/caseshiller.png) 
Boiling house price inflation was underscored by a fourth report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index jumped a record 13.9% on a year-on-year basis in March after advancing 12.4% in February. 
The White House said on Tuesday it was monitoring the soaring house prices, saying they raised concerns about ""affordability and access to the housing market.""

Economists and Federal Reserve officials do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday he didn't see the leverage in the housing market ""going to excess levels yet.""

On month-to-month basis, the 20-city composite index rose 1.6% from February. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a 1.2% increase.

March's sales pace was revised lower to 917,000 units from the previously reported 1.021 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for a small share of U.S. home sales, at a rate of 970,000 units in April.
New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales surged 48.3% on a year-on-year basis in April. Monthly sales declined in the populous South, the Midwest and Northeast, but rose in the West.
The market for new homes is being boosted by near record low inventory of previously owned houses, especially entry level homes. The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled demand for spacious and more expensive accommodations as millions of Americans work from home and take classes remotely.

That is limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes to plug the inventory gap. The input shortages are raising new home prices as well. The National Association of Realtors reported last week that home resales dropped for a third straight month in April as prices surged to a record high because of the tight supply.
The median new house price soared 20.1% from a year earlier to $372,400 in April. Sales were concentrated in the $200,000-$399,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for a mere 2% of transactions last month.

There were 316,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 304,000 in March. At April's sales pace it would take 4.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.0 months in March. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The survey among some 9,000 firms in manufacturing, the service sector, trade and construction showed that businesses were more satisfied with their current situation and optimistic regarding the coming six months.
It pointed to a quarterly growth rate of 2.6% from April to June and 2.8% from July to September, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
In the first quarter, GDP contracted by 1.8% quarter on quarter and by 3.1% on the year, significantly weaker readings than the euro zone average, Federal Statistics Office data showed earlier on Tuesday.
Coronavirus curbs in force during those months also spurred consumers to put more money than ever into savings, with the savings rate ballooning to an unprecedented 23.2%.
German households' disposable income increased slightly as the government ploughed billions of euros into job protection schemes and extra child benefits, but household spending fell by 5.4% on the quarter as curbs linked to containing the pandemic crimped consumption.
'SPLASHING OUT'
VP Bank Group economist Thomas Gitzel called that drop ""colossal"", but also said falling infection rates and progress in inoculations meant the economy would soon be back on a healthier footing as restrictions were eased and then lifted altogether.
""We're heading towards a relaxed summer in which retailers in German cities can expect consumers to splash out,"" he said.
Company investments in machinery and equipment fell slightly in the first quarter, though construction activity rose, the GDP data showed.
Wohlrabe said rising costs due to supply bottlenecks in manufacturing and construction were now increasingly being passed on.
In construction, two out of five firms reported difficulties procuring raw materials, and ""more and more companies indicate that they want to increase their sales prices,"" he said.
KfW bank economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib said her bank had raised its 2021 growth forecast to 3.5% from 3.3% ""despite the poor start to the year.""

Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer said his bank continued to expect German GDP to grow by 4.0% in 2021.
""A post-corona boom is emerging – even if the air is starting to get thin in the manufacturing sector, where business sentiment is already at a very high level,"" he added.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions spurred householders to put more money than ever into savings, data showed on Tuesday.
Europe's largest economy contracted by 1.8% quarter on quarter and by 3.1% on the year, the Federal Statistics Office said. The readings, for which a Reuters poll had forecast drops of 1.7% and 3.0% respectively, were significantly weaker than the euro zone average.
German households' disposable income increased slightly as the government ploughed billions of euros into job protection schemes and cash handouts such as extra child benefits. But curbs linked to containing the pandemic also made it harder for consumers to spend it.
""The drop in consumption is colossal,"" VP Bank Group economist Thomas Gitzel said.
Household spending fell by 5.4% on the quarter as the savings rate rose to a record high of 23.2%.
Company investments in machinery and equipment fell slightly, though construction activity rose.
Exports increased by 1.8% on the quarter helped by strong demand from the United States and China, while imports rose 3.8%, meaning net trade pushed down overall growth as well.
The quarter-on-quarter GDP data compared with a euro zone average of -0.6 percent, and growth of 0.4% in France, while the economy of the United States - whose vaccination programme has progressed more rapidly - grew 1.6%.
Year on year, the euro zone economy shrank 1.8%.

VP Bank's Gitzel said falling infection rates and progress in inoculations meant the German economy would soon be back on a healthier footing as COVID-19 curbs were eased and then lifted.
""We're heading towards a relaxed summer in which retailers in German cities can expect consumers to splash out,"" Gitzel said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's massive public borrowing began to head downwards last month for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstered by a brightening economic outlook that pointed to a potentially faster improvement in public finances. 
Public sector net borrowing in April totalled 31.7 billion pounds ($44.9 billion), official figures showed on Tuesday, down from a record 47.3 billion pounds a year earlier when the government finances felt the greatest impact of the pandemic.
Britain's government has spent heavily over the past year on health measures to limit the impact of COVID-19 as well as wage guarantees to stop unemployment rising significantly during the sharpest economic downturn in more than 300 years.
Borrowing in the 2020/21 financial year was 300.3 billion pounds or 14.3% of annual economic output, the highest share on this measure since the end of World War Two but slightly below an initial estimate a month ago.
British government forecasters predicted in early March that borrowing would fall to 10.3% of GDP this financial year.
However the growth outlook has improved since then thanks to a rapid roll-out of COVID vaccines, and monthly borrowing has come in below government predictions, prompting some economists to see a faster improvement in the public finances.
""The government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted only two months ago, reinforcing our view that the tax hikes and spending cuts that most fear may be avoided,"" Capital Economics's senior UK economist Ruth Gregory said.
Public sector net debt as a share of GDP is at its highest since 1962 at 98.5%, equivalent to 2.171 trillion pounds and up from around 1.8 trillion pounds before the pandemic.
But unlike earlier decades, interest rates are far lower, reducing both debt servicing costs and the urgency to lower debt levels that previous governments felt.
After the data, finance minister Rishi Sunak reiterated his plan ""to keep the public finances on a sustainable footing by bringing debt under control over the medium term"", while supporting short-term growth. 

Accountancy firm KPMG said revenue from corporation tax fell to the lowest in a year in April, which it linked to a temporary 'super-deduction' designed to boost growth by giving businesses tax credits worth 130% of new investment in plant and machinery.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's economy expanded more than first thought in the first quarter and the government maintained its growth forecast for the year, but struck a cautious note about recovery due to uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Tuesday, higher than the 0.2% growth seen in the government's advance estimate.
Manufacturing, finance and insurance and wholesale trade supported the expansion over the quarter. Analysts had expected a 0.9% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
MTI maintained its GDP growth forecast for 2021 at 4% to 6% for now but warned of a larger-than-usual degree of uncertainty caused by the pandemic as well as new domestic curbs against the virus. The outlook will be reviewed in August.
Authorities had last month said growth could exceed the upper end of the forecast range, recovering from the recession induced by the pandemic in 2020, its worst on record.
While it is possible that the Singapore economy will outperform the growth forecast for 2021 if external demand exceeds expectations, there are also significant downside risks, said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
""The pace of recovery of the various sectors of the economy is likely to be more uneven than earlier expected,"" he said.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded 3.1% in the first quarter.
Separate data showed April factory output rose 2.1% year-on-year for the sixth straight month of growth, but it was the slowest gain since October and missed analysts' forecasts.
The city-state is often seen as a bellwether for global growth as international trade dwarfs its domestic economy.
The government has pumped more than S$100 billion ($75.34 billion) into the economy to cope with the fallout. The central bank maintained its accommodative monetary policy at its last meeting in April.
""The accommodative, supportive impulse from both fiscal and monetary policy continues to flow through the system,"" said Edward Robinson, deputy managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
He said the policy stance remained appropriate and the MAS would review it in October, as scheduled. 
The central bank will consider factors that may affect ""inflation dynamics, as well as considerations of growth,"" he said.

Singapore this month re-imposed some restrictions on social gatherings, the toughest since exiting a lockdown last year, to combat a recent spike in local COVID-19 infections.
""A lot of the exuberance we had in the first quarter, that's kind of being rolled back a little bit,"" said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's economy grew 0.5% in the first quarter, lifted by higher crude production and oil prices, the country's statistics office said on Sunday, as activities slowly gain momentum after the gradual easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
Africa's largest economy, exited its second recession since 2016 in the fourth quarter, despite a full-year contraction in 2020.
Nigeria had been grappling with low growth before the coronavirus pandemic triggered a recession and created large financing gaps, including dollar shortages and inflation.
""The Q1 2021 growth rate was slower than the 1.87% growth rate recorded in Q1 2020 but higher than 0.11% recorded in Q4 2020, indicative of a slow but continuous recovery,"" The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
Nigeria is inoculating its 200 million citizens, but last month directed its regions to stop giving first doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines once they use half their current stock, to safeguard supply for a second dose.
The NBS said the non-oil sector, which the government is trying to make the main growth sector, rose 0.79% in the first quarter. Telecoms, crop production, real estate, food manufacturing and construction lifted growth in the quarter.
Crude prices rose above $70/barrel on Tuesday but fell on Wednesday on renewed demand concerns as COVID-19 cases in Asia rose and fears that rising inflation might lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates, which could limit growth.
Oil, which accounts for around two-thirds of Nigerian government revenue and 90% of foreign exchange, contracted 2.21% in the first quarter as crude production rose to 1.72 million barrels per day from the fourth quarter.
With weak growth, few expect Nigeria's central bank to alter interest rates next week. 

The bank has pursued an accommodative stance by leaving interest rates on hold. However, dollar shortages have stoked inflation to a more than 4-year high, while a shrinking labour market and mounting insecurity have pressured households. 
""While this points to the likelihood of firmer growth from the second quarter, it still does not allow for a more robust policy response to inflationary pressures,"" Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Dallas Fed survey meant to track U.S. employment trends pointed to potentially weak job growth in May, a sign that bottlenecks in the labor market may be continuing.
The online survey conducted the week of May 9 through 15 showed the estimated employment rate among adults dipped to 71.1% from 71.8% in the April survey, with unemployment rising and a drop in the share of adults either working or looking for work.
The statistics in the ""Real Time Population Survey"" are not meant to duplicate exactly the monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the U.S. unemployment rate.
But it uses questions that closely track that survey, and is timed to provide a mid-month estimate of national employment trends. It was developed because of the pandemic in an effort to give officials more frequent updates on the state of the labor market.
It registered a big jump in March, when the economy ended up adding nearly a million new jobs, and dipped in April when job growth disappointed at just 266,000. 

The May outcome will be watched closely for signs that workers are ready to move off the sidelines into the record number of new jobs posted by companies.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists have estimated the U.S. will add about 488,000 new positions next month, still below the million or more per month that Fed officials and others were expecting as the economy ramps up.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity gathered speed in early May amid strong domestic demand, but backlogs of uncompleted work are piling up as manufacturers struggle to find raw materials and labor, boosting costs for both businesses and consumers.
Though other data on Friday showed sales of previously owned homes dropping to a 10-month low in April as an acute shortage of houses drove prices to a record high, they remained well above their pre-pandemic level. The housing market and manufacturing have led the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020.
""The economic recovery continues,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 61.5 in the first half of this month. That was the highest reading since October 2009, and followed a final reading of 60.5 in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 60.2 in early May. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
Demand shifted to goods from services as the pandemic kept Americans at home, causing supply constraints. The virus also disrupted labor at manufacturers and their suppliers, leading to raw material shortages across industries.
More than a third of the population has been vaccinated, allowing the broader economy to reopen. While that, together with nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief provided by the government over the past year, is unleashing pent-up demand for services, appetite for goods remains healthy. 
According to IHS Markit ""manufacturers highlighted that strain on capacity and raw material shortages are expected to last through 2021."" It noted that the supply crunch was raising production costs for manufacturers, who ""made efforts to pass higher cost burdens on to clients.""
The IHS Markit survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers rose to the highest level since July 2008. 
Federal Reserve officials generally view the supply chain bottlenecks as transitory and expect them to temporarily drive inflation above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. There is also acknowledgment that the bottlenecks could take longer to ease. 
Minutes of the Fed's April 27-28 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed ""a number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly,"" and that this ""could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year. These officials also ""noted that in some industries, supply chain disruptions appeared to be more persistent than originally anticipated.""
According to IHS Market, backlogs of work accumulated early this month at the fastest pace in 14 years. Its measure of new orders increased. Though factories tried to recruit more workers, the pace of hiring was the slowest in five months.
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
RECORD HOUSE PRICES
In a separate report on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.85 million units last month, the lowest level since June. The third straight monthly decline in sales came as transactions fell in the Northeast, West and the densely populated South. Sales rose in the Midwest.
Economists had forecast sales rebounding 2.0%. Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. housing sales, were up 20% in the first four months of this year, compared to the same period in 2020. The housing market is being driven by demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations after the pandemic forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely. But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials.
That is limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes, keeping in place an inventory shortage that is boosting prices and threatening to sideline first-time homebuyers from the market. The government reported this week that homebuilding tumbled in April. 
There is hope that the reopening economy could encourage more homeowners to put houses on the market. Some elderly Americans likely delayed downsizing because of the pandemic. 
The median existing house price shot up 19.1% from a year ago to an all-time high of $341,600 in April. 
Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
""The people buying homes have the income and down payments as they are often trading one home for another,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""And economic growth should remain strong through this year, and while next year it may moderate, it is not expected to falter significantly.""  

There were 1.16 million previously owned homes on the market in April, down 20.5% from a year ago. At April's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
Houses typically remained on the market for 17 days in April, down from 27 days a year ago. Eighty-eight percent of the homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month. First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in April, down from 36% a year go.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over three years in May, a survey showed on Friday, but European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said an uncertain recovery still needed emergency support from the ECB. 
After a slow start to vaccinations the pace is picking up, allowing some restrictions imposed to quell the spread of the coronavirus to be lifted, and a strong resurgence in the bloc's now-reopening service industry added to the impetus from a booming manufacturing sector.
As the economy rebounds and confidence improves, some policymakers are making the case for the ECB to start giving up its emergency measures and revert to more traditional forms of stimulus.
But others are more cautious, warning the fledgling recovery is predicated on copious ECB support and that a recent rise in borrowing costs to two-year highs is already a major drag. 
""We are committed to preserving favourable financing conditions. It's far too early and it's actually unnecessary to debate longer-term issues,"" Lagarde said on Friday.
""I have repeatedly said that policymakers needed to provide the right bridge across the pandemic, well into the recovery, so we can actually deliver on our mandate.""
Alongside that, euro zone finance ministers will continue to support their economies but were upbeat on Friday about prospects for the post-pandemic recovery.
With more businesses reopening - or at least adapting to lockdowns - IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed to 56.9 in May from April's final reading of 53.8. 
That was its highest level since February 2018 and comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, as well as the more modest increase to 55.1 predicted in a Reuters poll.
""We don't think today's euro area PMI data will cause the ECB to taper the PEPP next month,"" said George Buckley at Nomura.
The bloc's economy will expand 1.4% this quarter, according to a Reuters poll last week that also found forecasts for the rest of the year had been downgraded from last month. [ECILT/EU]
""May's increase in the euro zone Composite PMI reflects the further lifting of virus restrictions in many parts of the region and suggests that the economic recovery is now underway,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
In Germany, Europe's largest economy, services activity rose by the most in nearly a year, helped by a loosening of restrictions. But supply bottlenecks in manufacturing led to production problems at a growing number of factories.
The lifting of a lockdown in France unleashed a business boom there, with activity surging past expectations to set the stage for an economic rebound.
A deal agreed by the European Union on Thursday to open up tourism across the 27-nation bloc this summer should provide a boost to tourism-dependent economies that were hammered by restrictions last year.
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
A preliminary PMI covering the 19-country euro zone's dominant service industry bounced to 55.1 from April's 50.5, well above the 52.3 median forecast in the Reuters poll and its highest since June 2018.
Services firms benefited from the release of pent-up demand. The new business index - which has been below 50 almost throughout the pandemic - soared to 56.7 from 49.7, its highest since January 2018.
The manufacturing industry has weathered the coronavirus crisis much better than services as factories largely remained open. Its flash PMI dipped from April's record high of 62.9 to 62.8 but was ahead of the 62.5 Reuters poll estimate.
An index measuring output that feeds into the composite PMI dropped to 61.9 from 63.2.
But supply-side issues have made it a seller's market for purveyors of raw materials and factories faced a record increase in input costs. The sub-index soared to 86.5 from 82.2, its highest since the survey began in June 1997.
""The combination of demand returning quickly for services and input shortages emerging are creating a perfect environment for surging pipeline inflation,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.

Hopes the vaccine rollout is successful and that the worst of the pandemic is behind the bloc pushed overall optimism to its highest since IHS Markit began collecting the data in July 2012. The composite future output index rose to 69.7 from 68.9.
Consumer confidence in the bloc improved more than expected this month, official data on Friday showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell for a third straight month in April as an acute shortage of properties drove prices to a record high.

Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 33.9% on a year-on-year basis.

LONDON (Reuters) -British shoppers splashed out on new clothes in April after shops reopened following months of lockdown closures, adding to signs of a robust economic recovery, official data showed on Friday.
Sales volumes in April jumped 9.2% month on month - twice the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the biggest rise since June - after rising 5.1% in March. Clothing sales soared by almost 70%.
""Fashion retailers (were) the ultimate beneficiaries of beer gardens reopening and the 'rule of six' night out returning,"" said Aled Jones, head of retail at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank.
Bank of England policymakers are keeping a close watch on retail sales, expecting a surge in spending as wealthier households spend savings built up during lockdowns. 
The central bank forecast this month that the economy would grow by 7.25% this year after slumping by nearly 10% in 2020, its biggest decline in more than 300 years.
But unlike after previous recessions, unemployment has stayed low so far, thanks to a costly government furlough programme that has benefited millions of employees.
Separate data on Friday, from Britain's longest-running survey of consumer sentiment, showed that morale in May was back at where it was just before the country first went into lockdown in March 2020.
The Office for National Statistics said retail sales in April were 10.6% above their pre-pandemic level. However, many high-street shops have suffered badly from repeated lockdowns that accelerated the shift to online commerce.
Department store Debenhams closed its last store this month after more than 240 years of trading and its brand name was bought by online retailer Boohoo.
Retailers such as clothing and furniture stores that the government classed as non-essential were unable to reopen to shoppers in England until April 12, after being forced to close in early January.
Online retail's share of spending dropped to 30.0% in April from 34.7% in March, its lowest since December. Spending at supermarkets also fell slightly on the month as restaurants reopened for outside dining. 
Sales volumes last month were 42.4% higher than in April 2020, when they collapsed during Britain's first coronavirus lockdown, the ONS said.

Consultants Capital Economics said sales growth was likely to level off now that spending was above pre-crisis levels.
""Economic recovery will continue. It's just it will be driven by a surge in spending in the pubs, restaurants and cinemas rather than the shops,"" Capital Economics' chief UK economist Paul Dales said.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the services sector jumped to 52.8 from 49.9 in April. That beat a Reuters poll forecast of 52.0 and was the highest reading since last July.
""The improved performance in services comes at a crucial time, making up for a further loss of momentum in manufacturing due to worsening supply issues,"" said Phil Smith at IHS Markit.
The flash PMI for manufacturing eased to 64.0 from 66.2 in the previous month. The figure came in weaker than expected, but was still well above the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.
As a result, the preliminary composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 56.2 in May from 55.8 in the previous month.
While factories still enjoyed strong demand, more companies reported supply shortages curbing production and weighing on new orders due to forced downtime at customers, the survey showed.

The supply bottlenecks also pushed up factory input prices at a rate never seen before in the survey's history, Smith said.
""Inflationary pressures are increasingly spreading to services as well, pushing the overall measures of input costs and output prices both to record highs,"" he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell for the ninth straight month in April as a record slump in cellphone fees offset rising energy prices, suggesting that weak demand and higher costs will weigh on a fragile economic recovery.
Separate data showed firms facing rising input costs and a slower expansion in factory activity in May, highlighting risks to an economy heavily reliant on the manufacturing sector.
The data underscores the challenge policymakers face in combating a resurgence in COVID-19 infections without hobbling an economy already lagging other major trading partners emerging from the pandemic-induced slump.
""Inflation fell in April but that was almost entirely due to a plunge in mobile phone tariffs,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Looking past temporary distortions, we think underlying inflation will continue to rise a bit further, though unlike in some other advanced economies.""
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes the effect of volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.1% in April from a year earlier, smaller than a median market forecast for a 0.2% drop, government data showed on Friday and in line with March's decline.
A record 26.5% in cellphone charges knocked 0.5% off core CPI, the data showed, as carriers heeded Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's calls to ease the burden on households.
By contrast, energy prices rose 0.7% in April, marking the first gain since January 2020 due to recent rises in crude oil costs and the base effect of last year's slump.
Any decline in manufacturers' profits would be a huge risk to firms' capital expenditure plans and leave the economy without a driver as the country wrestles with the hit to consumption, analysts say.
Manufacturers saw the pace of input prices increases accelerate, while output price growth eased slightly, causing the widest gap between the two measures in nearly a decade, a private sector survey showed on Friday.

Japan's economy shrank in the first quarter and analysts expect any rebound in April-June to be modest as new COVID-19 infections forced the government to re-introduce state of emergency curbs, hurting already weak consumption.
Inflation has barely picked up in Japan as companies remain wary of passing on higher costs to households, even as supply bottlenecks and labour shortages stoke inflation fears in the United States and some other advanced economies.

The GfK Consumer Confidence Index improved to -9 in May from -15 in April, matching its level in March 2020 before the full force of the coronavirus pandemic hit the country.
The index has been rising since January as Britain rolled out Europe's fastest COVID vaccines programme.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped further below 500,000 last week, but jobless rolls swelled in early May, which could temper expectations for an acceleration in employment growth this month.

But businesses in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware increased employees' work hours, suggesting problems finding workers. Labor and raw material shortages were likely behind the significant slowdown in the pace of growth in output at the region's factories this month.
The supply constraints follow pent-up demand unleashed by the economy's reopening after being severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic for more than a year. 
""If the data are taken at face value, it would suggest both a reduction in layoffs and a slowing in hiring, which given the rising level of labor demand could only be explained by a reduction in labor supply,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor a Brean Capital in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 444,000 for the week ended May 15, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020 and held claims below 500,000 for two straight weeks. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 450,000 applications for the latest week. Claims remain well above the 200,000 to 250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. They have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Applications are likely to decrease further in the weeks ahead after Republican governors in at least 21 states announced they would withdraw next month from unemployment programs funded by the federal government. These included a weekly $300 subsidy, which businesses say are encouraging the jobless to stay at home instead of seeking work.
From manufacturing to restaurants and bars, employers are scrambling to find workers, even as nearly 10 million Americans are officially unemployed. The enhanced unemployment benefits give more than most jobs paying minimum wages, which range from as low as $7.25 per hour to as high as $15.
Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after a three-day slide. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS 
Lack of child care facilities, with most schools offering partial in-person learning, as well as lingering fears of COVID-19 and pandemic-related retirements are also believed to be contributing to the worker shortage, which curbed hiring in April. The government-funded benefits expire in early September and school districts are expected to resume in-person classes in the fall, which economists hope will boost the labor pool.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's April 27-28 policy meeting published on Wednesday acknowledged reports of businesses
""having trouble hiring workers."" They noted some of the factors behind the worker scarcity ""were seen as likely to remain significant while pandemic-related risks persisted.""
But some economists, including at the White House, disagree that the generous benefits are a deterrent to work.
""Unemployment aid is not keeping workers on the sidelines,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation. ""Emergency unemployment aid is doing what it is meant to do, serving as a temporary lifeline while workers search for and return to work.""
The claims data included the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of May's employment report. The economy created 266,000 jobs in April after adding 770,000 in March.
To get a better picture of how hiring fared in May, economists will await data next week on the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid. The so-called continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.
Continuing claims increased 111,000 to 3.751 million during the week ended May 8. There were about 16 million people on unemployment benefits under all programs on May 1.
""The overall trend in labor market conditions remains positive, even though it is unclear how that will translate quantitatively into next month's employment data,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Jersey City.
With more than a third of the population vaccinated, restrictions on services industry businesses are being lifted. The economy is also being underpinned by nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief provided by the government over the past year.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business activity index fell to 31.5 this month from 50.2 in April. A reading above zero indicates growth in the mid-Atlantic region's manufacturing sector. 
Its measure of new orders received by factories grew at a slower pace in May relative to April as did shipments. But backlogs of uncompleted work continued to pile up, testament to the inputs shortage. The survey's gauge of factory employment dropped to a reading of 19.3 from 30.8 in April. The average workweek index jumped six points to 35.5.

Despite the bottlenecks in the supply chain, the economy is powering ahead. A third report from the Conference Board showed its gauge of future economic activity surging above its pre-pandemic level in April.
""The economy is solidifying at a high level of growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers reported the fastest growth in orders since December 2017 in May but fear supply-chain bottlenecks will cause their costs to rise sharply, according to a survey which adds to signs of a rebound for factories. 
The Confederation of British Industry's industrial orders balance - measuring the proportion of firms reporting order volumes above or below normal - rose to +17 from -8 in April.
Overall output growth over the past three months was the highest since December 2018 and represented the first material growth in almost two years, the CBI said.
""The industrial sector is booming ... for now,"" Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Export orders lagged behind domestic demand, which Tombs said reflected new post-Brexit trade barriers. Demand for goods was also likely to soften later in 2021 as spending shifted more towards services as the economy reopened.
Official data for March released last week showed factory output was 2% below its level in February 2020, before Britain went into its first COVID lockdown which caused output to slump briefly by 30%.
Other surveys of manufacturers, such as the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index, have also pointed to strong growth. April's PMI showed the biggest rise in new orders since November 2013.
However, the pandemic is still having a knock-on impact on global supply chains, with shortages of everything from micro-chips to building supplies. Last month carmaker Jaguar Land Rover temporarily stopped production at two factories in Britain due to a lack of semi-conductors.

""Firms are still feeling the chill as supply shortages fuel cost pressures, reflected in expectations for strong output price inflation in the coming quarter,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
The survey's price balance rose to its highest since January 2018 at +38 in May, up from April's +27 and well above its average of +3.

(Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed down in May after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 31.5 from 50.2 in April. That was shy of economists' expectations for a reading of 43.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out June 1.
Factories have struggled to keep up with demand in recent months as the economy shows signs of emerging from the COVID-19 recession and consumers flush with cash from recent stimulus programs ramp up spending. In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since April 1973.
The bank's employment index decreased to 19.3 from 30.8 the previous month.
Additionally, the price paid index rose to 76.8 from 69.1 in the month prior.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell to a new post-pandemic low last week, adding to evidence of a steady recovery in the labor market as the economy reopens.
Initial jobless claims fell to 444,000, from a total of 478,000 the previous week, which was revised upward by 5,000. 
The number of continuing claims, which are measured with a one-week time lag to initial ones, rose however by over 100,000 to 3.751 million. 
The broadest measure of all those claiming unemployment-related benefits, however, corroborated the general downward trend. It fell by some 900,000 to 15.975 million as of the week ending May 1, the Labor Department said.
The numbers will do little to change perceptions of a job market recovery that is still closer to its start than its end. The presence of 16 million Americans still claiming some sort of dole is likely to carry huge weight with  Federal Reserve officials who have consistently argued that they should not withdraw monetary stimulus until the labor market has made ""substantial progress"".
At the margins, the rise in continuing claims may reinforce concerns about mismatches between the supply of labor and the demand for it, as the jobs destroyed by the pandemic are replaced by new ones requiring different skills. That issue was seen as largely responsible for the disappointing labor market report for April, which saw hiring rebound much more weakly than expected.
""While the ongoing improvement in initial claims is encouraging, the progress in continuing claims has slowed significantly in the last few weeks,"" said Daniel Zhao,. senior economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter. He warned to be on the lookout for any other signs of a slowing market recovery ahead of the May jobs report in just over two weeks' time. "

The rise in producer prices followed a 3.7% year-on-year increase in March and compared with a Reuters poll forecast of 5.1%.
Compared to the previous month, producer prices were up 0.8% in April, the federal statistics office said.
The index looks at factory gate prices, meaning before products or components are further processed or go on sale. It can therefore give an early indication of the development of overall consumer price inflation.
""Price pressures continue to point upwards also at the producer level,"" LBBW economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch said.
""At the moment, it's difficult to say how much of the costs companies will actually be able to pass on to consumers,"" he added.

The supply bottlenecks and overall economic recovery are expected to push up price pressures in Germany, with the government forecasting consumer price inflation to jump to 2.2% this year and to ease to 1.5% next year.
Still, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel told German broadcaster ARD on Wednesday that the surge in euro zone inflation is temporary and consumer prices should fall sharply next year.

Exports to the United States, Germany's biggest sales market outside the European Union, soared by 60.4% year-on-year in April to 10.1 billion euros ($12.31 billion), preliminary trade figures from the statistics office showed.
Exports to China, Germany's second largest exports destination outside the EU's single market, rose by 16.3% to 8.4 billion euros, the office said.
Exports to Britain jumped by 58.6% on the year to 5.1 billion euros.
Overall, exports to non-EU countries rose by 35.6% on the year to 50.8 billion euros.
The statistics office said that the year-on-year figures for April were strongly impacted by the first coronavirus wave in 2020 which had pushed down exports compared to April 2019.
It added that exports to non-EU member states, also called third countries, accounted for roughly 47% of overall exports. This means that more than half of Germany's exports still go to clients within the EU's single market despite Britain's exit.
""When comparing with the same month of the previous year, it should be noted that German exports to third countries in April 2020 fell by 27.1% compared to April 2019 in the wake of the coronavirus crisis,"" the statistics office said.

The statistics office will release its full trade figures for April, including sales to other EU countries, on June 9.

Online property portal Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said flats are now the most in-demand property type for the first time in at least 10 years, with buyer interest up 39% since January - based on the number of times people contacted estate agents about properties. 
Demand for city-centre housing in general has risen by 35%, compared with a 32% rise in demand for housing in villages.
The survey adds to signs that the British property market's pandemic boom has persisted with help from finance minister Rishi Sunak. In March's budget he extended a cut to property purchase taxes and announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers who cannot afford large deposits.
""These are early signs but they certainly point to some good news for city centres across Great Britain, with a number of agents now telling me they've seen a marked uptick in demand from first-time buyers,"" Rightmove's director of property data, Tim Bannister, said.
Rightmove said buyer demand for flats in April stood 51% above pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.
Official data published on Tuesday showed house prices rose in March by more than 10% in annual terms - the biggest increase since August 2007. The Office for National Statistics also said prices of detached houses rose by 11.7% in the year to March, compared with an increase of 5.0% for flats and maisonettes.

Since then, Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants to reopen. Almost all restrictions are due to end in late June.
""People starting to venture into their local high streets and once again experiencing the buzz of their city centres, along with greater mortgage availability for first-time buyers, means city centres are staging a much-needed comeback,"" Bannister said.

Japanese exports jumped again, climbing in April by more than a third from last year’s dismal level, as recovering global trade gave a needed boost to an economy that’s stalling at home amid new waves of the coronavirus.
Surging car and auto parts shipments helped power a 38% rise in Japan’s exports from a year earlier, according to figures Thursday from the finance ministry that beat all but one forecast from 26 surveyed analysts. The consensus was for a 30.8% gain.
Although the data give an inflated view of the strength of exports because they’re based on a comparison with 2020’s terrible figures, the report still shows trade bouncing back -- a major positive for the global economy and Japan. Shipments climbed almost 8% compared with 2019.
A separate report showed Japanese machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital spending, gained in March from the prior month.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports grew the most since 2010 in April while capital spending perked up on surging global demand for cars and electronics, lifting hopes that an improvement in trade could help lead the world's third-largest economy back to growth.
Also brightening the outlook, confidence among the nation's manufacturers hit a more than two-year high in May on the back of solid overseas orders, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
While the stronger exports and imports are partly helped by the favourable statistical base effects from the major plunge in trade seen a year earlier, real demand is also on the mend.
Global appetite for cars and electronics has picked up since last year, driven by a recovery in the U.S. and Chinese economies -- Japan's key markets -- although global chip shortages put a drag on overseas shipments in recent months.
Exports rose 38.0% in April from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, compared with a 30.9% increase expected by economists and following a 16.1% rise in March. That was the fastest gain since April 2010, led by U.S.-bound shipments of cars and car parts and Chinese demand for chip-making equipment.
""The trade data confirmed that exports were recovering steadily. Particularly car exports, which fell a lot last year, are picking up,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
""In Japan, capital spending tends to move in sync with external demand, so an export recovery is encouraging for machinery orders and capital expenditure.""
By destination, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 33.9% year-on-year in April, led by shipments of chip-making equipment, hybrid cars and scrap copper.
U.S.-bound exports grew 45.1% in the year to April, the fastest gain since 2010, on the back of demand for automobiles, car parts and ship engines.
Separate data from the Cabinet Office showed Japan's core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.7% in March from the previous month.
The rise in core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric utilities, compared with a 6.4% increase seen in a Reuters poll of economists, the data showed.
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment on machinery orders, saying that a pick-up is stalling.
Japan's economy fell back into decline in the first quarter and economists have sharply revised down estimates for growth this quarter as emergency curbs hobble consumer spending that makes up more than half the economy.

""Export growth is welcome for the Japanese economy, but that doesn't mean the whole of Japan can benefit from it,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""What's important now is a recovery in service-sector activity helped by a progress on coronavirus vaccination.""

(Reuters) - U.S. applications for home mortgages increased last week on a pickup in homeowners seeking to refinance their loans, but requests for loans to purchase a house fell to a three-month low amid an acute shortage of housing stock that is driving up prices.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index increased 1.2% from a week earlier, reflecting a 4% rise in applications for refinancing. Refinancing activity has ticked higher in recent weeks as mortgage interest rates have pulled back from their recent highs. 
The purchase index decreased 4% from a week earlier to the lowest level since February, which may signal further headwinds for home sales in the months ahead.
""A decline in purchase applications was seen for both conventional and government loans,"" Joel Kan, an economist at the MBA, said in a statement. ""There continues to be strong demand for buying a home, but persistent supply shortages are constraining purchase activity, and building material shortages and higher costs are making it more difficult to increase supply.""
The housing market has been a strong performer in the economy throughout the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020. But supply constraints are slowing momentum. U.S. existing home sales fell to a seven-month low in March, but may have steadied in April, data due out Friday is expected to show. 

The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 3.15% last week from 3.11% in the prior week, but rates remain roughly 20 basis points below their recent highs from early April. 
""Despite still relatively low rates, scarce inventory and soaring home prices are eroding affordability and putting homebuying out of reach for many households,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence hit a more than two-year high in May, as firms benefited from stronger overseas demand, a sign that the export-driven economic recovery remained intact, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
Sentiment among service sector firms turned optimistic for the first time since early last year, according to the Reuters Tankan poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
""Orders to the United States and Europe are recovering as a trend, as coronavirus vaccinations are starting to progress,"" a manager at a paper maker wrote in the survey.
Still, the improvement in confidence was somewhat patchy, with firms saying they were feeling the drag from the coronavirus pandemic. Much of Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, are under a state of emergency until the end of the month to try to counter COVID-19 infections.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers improved to 21 from 13 in the previous month, hitting its highest since December 2018, the poll conducted May 6-17 showed.
The service sector index expanded for the first time since February last year, rising to 2 from minus 3 in April, according to the survey of 482 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 236 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.
""Competition among rivals has been increasing due to a decrease in private order volumes,"" a manager at a construction firm said. 
Another manager, at a services firm, said projects had been delayed or cancelled due to lower private-sector investor appetite, while public works orders were being held back in the greater Tokyo area due to the Olympics.
Japan is preparing to host the games in July although there are mounting concerns it could fuel a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Manufacturers' business confidence was especially boosted by improvements among chemicals, metal products and machinery, as well the electric machinery sectors, while the auto industry saw its sentiment expand at a less rapid rate.
""Production of new products coming about due to changes related to the coronavirus is making progress,"" a manager at a chemical maker said. ""Orders for parts related to such products are on the rise.""

Among non-manufacturers, the positive assessment of conditions was mainly due to an improvement among transport and utility firms, while the mood among retailers and wholesalers as well as other services firms remained negative, according to the survey.
Manufacturers' business confidence was seen unchanged at 21 in August, while that of service-sector firms was forecast to rise to 13, the poll showed.

366,"<span>May 19, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumer prices in Canada climbed in April at the fastest pace in a decade, beating estimates and potentially fueling concerns that the country is entering a period of persistent inflation.
Annual inflation accelerated to 3.4% in April, compared with 2.2% in March, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday in Ottawa. That beat economist predictions for a 3.2% annual pace. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.5% versus the 0.2% economists were expecting.
The annual reading -- the highest since May 2011 -- may raise some worries that price pressures could be stronger than predicted by the Bank of Canada, which has been cautioning against over-reacting to an inflation spike it expects will be only transitory. If inflation proves more durable, however, that could force the central bank to bring forward interest rate increases that investors aren’t anticipating until later next year.
Core inflation -- often seen as a better measure of underlying price pressures -- rose to 2.1% from 1.9% in March. That’s the highest reading since 2012.
The annual CPI reading is distorted because the year-ago period used as comparison coincided with broad demand and price declines at the beginning of the pandemic, a phenomenon known as the base effect. A similar effect also drove inflation higher in the U.S. last month to an annual 4.2% pace. Unlike in the U.S., inflation in Canada is rising at a slower pace because much of the country was still in some form of a Covid-related shutdown last month, stunting demand for goods and services.
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem had predicted that inflation would rise to about 3% because of these base effects, but he also said he believes that underlying price pressures remain depressed because of continued slack in the economy. In its latest forecasts released last month, the central bank forecast inflation to average 2.9% in the second quarter before returning near its 2% target by the end of the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation more than doubled in April, the start of a likely climb in prices this year as rich economies recover from pandemic lockdowns, but one that the Bank of England hopes will prove temporary.
After U.S. inflation last week hit its highest level since 2008 and prompted Federal Reserve officials to say they were in no rush to raise interest rates, Britain's consumer price index rose by 1.5% in April.
That was a sharp jump from the 0.7% rise seen in March and marked the highest CPI reading since March 2020, driven by higher power and fuel bills as global oil prices climb from their pandemic lows of 2020.
April's inflation reading was, however, only a touch above the 1.4% rise seen in a Reuters poll of economists and was still below the Bank of England's 2% target.
This should give the central bank confidence, for now, that it won't have to pull the plug early on the trillion dollar bond-purchasing programme it rolled out to support the British economy through the crisis.
Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the comparisons with the coronavirus slump fades, most analysts say.
""If we're right in thinking the crisis won't leave a big scar on the economy, then the burst of inflation caused by reopening the economy should prove temporary,"" said Ruth Gregory, economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
Kallum Pickering, economist at Berenberg Bank, sounded a more cautionary note.
""We do not believe that higher inflation will be fully transitory as many in markets contend and as global central bankers seem to presume,"" he said. ""The rebound marks a turning point for inflation across the advanced economies following more than a decade of disinflation.""
The pound and interest rate futures markets were largely unmoved after the data. [GBP/] 
BOE WATCHING ""EXTREMELY CAREFULLY""
Higher electricity and gas bills - which jumped by more 9% in April - and rises in clothing and footwear prices helped to push British inflation up in April, along with the cost of petrol.
Core inflation, which excludes energy prices and other volatile items, increased less sharply than the headline figure, rising to 1.3% in the 12 months to April from 1.1% in March, the Office for National Statistics said.
The BoE says inflation will hit 2.5% at the end of 2021, pushed up in large part by the rise in oil prices and the expiry in September of COVID emergency cuts to value-added tax in the hospitality sector.
It thinks inflation will then slip back to 2% in 2022 and 2023.
But the BoE's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said earlier this month that the BoE needs to ""start tightening the tap to avoid the risk of a future inflationary flood,"" shortly after he cast a lone vote to scale back the BoE's bond-buying programme.
Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday there had been little sign so far that higher costs for producers had fed much into consumer prices in Britain but the central bank was ""watching this extremely carefully and we will take action when we think it's appropriate to do so, no question about that.""

Wednesday's data showed prices paid by manufacturers for their inputs rose by 9.9%, the most since February 2017, while the prices they charged rose by 3.9%, the biggest increase in two-and-a-half years.
Separate ONS data showed rampant inflation in house prices: a 10.2% annual increase in March marked the strongest growth in house prices since August 2007.

Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.6% month-on-month for a 1.6% year-on-year increase, up from 1.3% year-on-year in March.
The European Central Bank wants to see inflation even closer to 2% over the medium term but has warned that the faster growth is mainly due to comparison effects with very low energy prices a year earlier.
Prices of energy, such as oil and gas, rose 10.4 year-on-year in April, adding 0.96 percentage point to the final inflation figure. On the other hand, costs of unprocessed food, another volatile component, fell 0.3% year-on-year in April.

Without these two sharply changing factors, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices went up 0.5% in the month and 0.8% from a year earlier, slowing from the 1.0% annual growth in March.
But prices of services, which account for almost two thirds of euro zone gross domestic product, went up 0.9% year-on-year in April, adding 0.37 percentage point to the final inflation number, continuing a strong trend since the start of the year.

The DIHK's updated growth forecast compares with its previous estimate of 2.8% projected in February and is based on the latest findings of the association's survey among more than 27,000 companies from various sectors of the economy.
The DIHK forecast is less optimistic than the government's projection of 3.5% GDP growth this year. The German economy shrank by 4.8% last year due to the pandemic.
""There is cautious optimism among export-oriented industrial companies due to economic catch-up effects, but there is still a considerable amount of scepticism, particularly among the sectors affected by the lockdown, due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions,"" DIHK said in a summary of its survey.
Among the companies most upbeat were manufacturers of vehicles, machinery and electrical engineering products.
""One possible reason is the economic recovery in important sales markets such as China and the United States, which is boosting demand for ""Made in Germany"" goods,"" the DIHK said.
The survey revealed supply shortages of semiconductors and other industrial components which two out of five companies described as one of the biggest risks for their growth outlook.

""Delivery bottlenecks, trade restrictions and high global demand are currently causing prices to rise sharply, for example for wood, plastics, building materials and steel,"" DIHK said.
The DIHK survey chimes with the findings of the smaller, but more frequent Ifo business sentiment survey that showed how the third wave of COVID-19 infections and supply bottlenecks are complicating the economic recovery.

According to the report by the respected German Economic Institute, reported by Handelsblatt newspaper on Wednesday, 40% of industry groups surveyed reported severe short-term supply disruption. A further third were seeing more modest disruption.
Sectors reporting severe disruptions, to inputs ranging from microchips and wood for construction, included the car and plastics industries as well as the textile, leather and construction industries.

The rapid pace of vaccination in Europe's largest economy, which would likely unleash sharp demand growth, might end up highlighting the supply problems, the institute warned.
""Especially with social and economic normalisation once again on the agenda thanks to progress on vaccination unleashing pent-up consumer demand, these bottlenecks could slow the recovery,"" the report said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in April, likely pulled down by soaring prices for lumber and other materials, but construction remains supported by an acute shortage of previously owned homes on the market.
The plunge in homebuilding reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday was concentrated in the single-family housing market segment. The number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started increased to the highest level since 1999, suggesting hesitancy on the part of builders.
""Builders are delaying starting new construction because of the marked increase in costs for lumber and other inputs,"" said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. ""These supply-chain constraints are holding back a housing market that should otherwise be picking up speed, given the strong demand for buying fueled by an improving job market and low mortgage rates.""
Housing starts tumbled 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.569 million units last month. Data for March was revised lower to a rate of 1.733 million units, still the highest level since June 2006, from the previously reported 1.739 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would fall to a rate of 1.710 million units in April.
Starts surged 67.3% on a year-on-year basis in April. Groundbreaking activity dropped in the Midwest and the densely populated South, but rose in the Northeast and West. 
Demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely, has fueled a housing market boom. But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, leading to shortages of lumber and other raw materials, boosting prices and threatening to sideline first-time homebuyers from the market.
U.S. stocks were trading mixed and the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
LOW INVENTORY
The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows. Tariffs on steel imports are also adding to building costs. Lumber prices surged 89.7% on a year-on-year basis in April, according to the latest producer price data.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders holding steady in May. The NAHB noted that ""some builders are slowing sales to manage their own supply chains.""
According to an Institute for Supply Management survey published early this month, businesses in the construction industry reported challenges finding and retaining skilled and unskilled workers, with some companies saying ""we are not accepting all the work that we could if we had the labor.""
Permits for future homebuilding rose 0.3% to a rate of 1.760 million units in April. They soared 60.9% compared to April 2020, and are running ahead of starts, which suggests a rebound in homebuilding in the months ahead.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, dropped 13.4% to a rate of 1.087 million units in April. It retreated further below the more than 14-year high scaled in December, a sign that builders could be holding back because of the more expensive materials and lack of labor. 
Building permits for single-family homes fell 3.8% to a rate of 1.149 million units. The number of housing units authorized to be built but not started surged 5.0% to a rate of 232,000 at the end of April, the highest since the government started tracking the series in January 1999.
""It is currently somewhat uncertain when exactly supply issues could be resolved,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Eventually, however, we expect that backlogs of demand could keep housing activity supported into the end of the year.""
The housing market has been the star performer in the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020. Residential construction investment has enjoyed double-digit growth since the third quarter of last year. Most economists expect housing will have a neutral impact on gross domestic product growth in the second quarter.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 0.8% to a pace of 482,000 units in April. Building permits for multi-family housing projects accelerated 8.9% to a rate of 611,000 units. With more than a third of the American population vaccinated against COVID-19 and restrictions on services businesses being lifted, people are flocking back to cities.
Housing completions fell 4.4% to a rate of 1.449 million units last month. Single-family home completions edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.045 million units. 

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction increased 0.6% to a rate of 1.312 million units last month.

The survey’s headline business activity index increased by nine points to 38.8, but not all businesses saw gains. 
""Just over half of respondents reported that conditions improved over the month, while 12% said that conditions worsened,"" according to the report.
The New York area was hit hard by closures, reduced travel and the shift to remote working during the pandemic but the report showed that conditions are improving as the economy recovers. 

Optimism for the future also surged in early May, with the index for future business activity and future employment both reaching record highs of 67.8 and 51.8, respectively.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said GDP in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the Jan-March period, for a 1.8% year-on-year fall. 
The figures were in line with the initial flash estimate on April 30. Together with the GDP decline in the fourth quarter of 2020, of 0.7% in the quarter and 4.9% from a year earlier, the euro zone was in its second technical recession since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
The economies of Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands all contracted. France's grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter.
Eurostat also said that employment fell 0.3% on the quarter in the first three months of 2021 after a 0.4% quarterly rise in the previous quarter. This equated to a 2.1% year-on-year decline.
In separate release, Eurostat showed imports from Britain were down by more than a third in the first quarter of 2021 following the British exit from the EU single market.
The 27-nation bloc's trade surplus with Britain rose to 35.8 billion euros ($43.73 billion) as exports were down by a more modest 14.3%. The decline in exports and imports was most marked in January and less acute in March.
Eurostat said the euro zone's unadjusted trade surplus with the rest of the world fell to 15.8 billion euros in March from 29.9 billion euros in March 2020.

Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade surplus with the rest of the world was 13.0 billion euros in March from 23.1 billion euros in February as exports fell 0.3% on the month while imports rose 5.6%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter as a slow vaccine rollout and new COVID-19 infections hit spending on items such as dining out and clothes, raising concerns the country will lag others emerging from the pandemic.
Capital expenditure also fell unexpectedly and export growth slowed sharply, a sign the world's third-largest economy is struggling for drivers to pull it out of the doldrums.
The dismal reading and extended state of emergency curbs have heightened the risk Japan may shrink again in the current quarter and slide back to recession, defined as two straight quarters of recession, some analysts say.
""Global chip shortages caused a marked slowdown in exports, putting a drag on capital spending as well,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Consumption will probably remain stagnant, raising risks of an economic contraction in the current quarter.""
The economy shrank an annualised 5.1% in the first quarter, more than the forecast 4.6% contraction and following an 11.6% jump in the previous quarter, government data showed on Tuesday.
The decline was mainly due to a 1.4% drop in private consumption as state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic hit spending for clothing and dining out.
But the bigger-than-expected contraction also reflected a surprise 1.4% drop in capital expenditure, which confounded market expectations for a 1.1% increase as companies scaled back spending on equipment for machinery and cars.
While exports grew 2.3% thanks to a rebound in global demand for cars and electronics, the pace of increase slowed sharply from the previous quarter's 11.7% gain, a worrying sign for an economy still reeling from weak domestic demand.
Domestic demand knocked 1.1% point off gross domestic product (GDP), while net exports shaved off 0.2 point, the data showed.
""That domestic demand is weak shows the adverse effects from the coronavirus haven't been shaken off at all,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Despite massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, Japan's economy slumped a record 4.6% in the fiscal year that ended in March, the data showed.
""There will undoubtedly be fiscal money poured on this problem to soften the blow, though after so much already, it is difficult to see this having more than a fairly marginal effect,"" analysts at ING wrote in a research note, adding they expect the economy to shrink again in the current quarter.
""And the Bank of Japan seems to be out of fresh policy stimulus ideas currently, so we don't anticipate anything new from them apart from extending existing measures.""
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura blamed the weak GDP reading mainly on the curbs to combat the pandemic, adding the economy still had ""potential"" to recover.
""It's true service spending will likely remain under pressure in April-June. But exports and output will benefit from a recovery in overseas growth,"" he told reporters.

Japan's economy expanded for two straight quarters after its worst postwar slump in April-June last year due to the initial hit from the pandemic.
The export-driven recovery came to a standstill as consumption took a hit from a spike in new virus strains that forced the government to re-impose curbs just 10 weeks before the Tokyo Olympic Games.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's unemployment rate fell again to 4.8% between January and March, when the country was under a tight lockdown, and hiring rose further in April, according to data that showed employers gearing up for the easing of curbs.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to hold at 4.9%, and the reading added to signs that the labour market will escape the severe hit feared at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, thanks mostly to government jobs subsidies.
Some of the fall in the unemployment rate - the third in a row - was due to a rise in people not looking for work, with inactivity rate among men hitting a record high, echoing a pattern seen during Britain's first lockdown last year.
But analysts said the data showed the labour market was preparing for the end of many of the curbs imposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in January, thanks to the country's swift COVID-19 vaccination programme.
""As the economy prepares to re-open fully and economic activity picks up, businesses have increased their hiring to meet the rise in demand,"" Yael  Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
The unemployment rate was likely to peak at 5.9% in the three months to December, after a jobs furlough programme ends in September, she said.
The number of people in employment in the first three months of 2021 jumped by 84,000, the first increase since the pandemic hit Britain and a bigger rise than the Reuters poll forecast of a 50,000. Those classed as unemployed fell by 121,000.
APRIL HIRING INCREASE 
Separate data for April showed a further improvement in the labour market with people on company payrolls up 97,000 from March.
The rise was driven by hiring in the administration and support and the finance and insurance sectors, although the fall in hospitality - which partially reopened for outdoor service in April - was the smallest during the pandemic.
That narrowed the drop in payrolls numbers from February 2020 to 772,000, the Office for National Statistics said.
The Resolution Foundation think tank said that gap, combined with an estimated drop of 270,000 self-employed workers and 3.1 million workers still on furlough, meant Britain still had a 4.2 million 'COVID employment gap' to fill.
The payrolls data chimed with other recent signs of a hiring pick-up and there was a rise in job offers in hospitality and entertainment. 
However, some employers are struggling to fill vacancies with many foreign workers no longer in the country after the on-off closing and reopening of many firms over the past year, and as a result of Brexit.
The Bank of England this month slashed its forecasts for unemployment to show a peak of 5.4% in the third quarter after finance minister Rishi Sunak extended his jobs protection programme - which has cost more than 60 billion pounds ($85 billion) so far - until the end of September.
Britain's budget forecasters projected unemployment of 10% made shortly after the epidemic began.
Britain's headline measure of pay growth, including bonuses, rose 4.0% in the three months to March, slowing from 4.5% in the three months to February due to lower bonuses than a year ago.

The ONS said total pay growth, adjusted for a drop in the number of lower-paid and part-time jobs which have been hit hard by the pandemic, stood at 2.5%.

Gross domestic product shrank an annualized 5.1% from the prior quarter in the three months through March, ending a two-quarter streak of double-digit growth amid falling consumer spending and a drop in government outlays, the Cabinet Office reported Tuesday. Economists had forecast an overall contraction of 4.5%.
The worse-than-expected result comes at a critical time for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government as it struggles to contain virus cases with a targeted approach that limits the damage to the economy and a slow vaccine rollout.
Key Insights
“Looking ahead to 2Q, we see GDP resuming a slow pace of growth, assuming the latest state of emergency ends at the end of May as planned. Beyond that, the strength of the recovery will depend on how quickly vaccinations proceed and whether the Tokyo Olympics are held.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian home sales, prices and starts all fell in April compared with the previous month, as some of the frenzy of recent months began to unwind, though activity remains strong, data showed on Monday.
Canadian home sales fell 12.5% in April from March, while the average selling price was down 2.9% in April from the previous month, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).
Housing starts, meanwhile, fell 19.8% in April compared with March on a sharp decline in multiple urban starts, though starts remain well above pre-pandemic levels, separate data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) showed.
""While housing markets across Canada remain very active, there is growing evidence that some of the extreme imbalances of the last year are beginning to unwind,"" said CREA chair Cliff Stevenson in a statement.
Stevenson added that the decline in sales came amid a third wave of COVID-19 cases and fresh restrictions, which could somewhat obscure underlying levels of supply and demand.
Canada's housing market has been on tear in recent months, with home prices escalating sharply amid investor activity and fear of missing out. Even small cities and towns are grappling with red-hot markets usually reserved for major urban centers. 
Actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, rose 256% in April from a year earlier, CREA said. Sales and prices in April 2020 were sharply impacted by the first wave of COVID-19 and a strict nation-wide shutdown.
The national average selling price of a Canadian home was C$696,000 ($575,064) in April, falling 2.9% from March, but up 41.9% from a year earlier - again skewed by the ""base effect"" of the April 2020 decline, the industry group said. 
CREA's Home Price Index, which smoothes average price fluctuations, was up 23.1% on the year and up 2.4% from March.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts fell to 268,631 units in April from a revised 334,759 units in the previous month, the CMHC said. Analysts had expected 280,000 unit starts in April.

""Housing starts remained hot in April, just not at the scorching temperature from March,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, adding starts could continue to decelerate on high building costs and rising interest rates.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index was unchanged at 83 in May. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.
""Builder confidence in the market remains strong due to a lack of resale inventory, low mortgage interest rates, and a growing demographic of prospective home buyers,"" NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. 
""However, first-time and first-generation home buyers are particularly at risk for losing a purchase due to cost hikes associated with increasingly scarce material availability.""
Demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely, has fueled a housing market boom.
But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, leading to shortages of lumber and other raw materials. Tariffs on steel imports are also adding to building costs. Lumber prices surged 89.7% on a year-on-year basis in April, according to the latest producer price data.
""Policymakers must take note and find ways to increase production of domestic building materials, including lumber and steel, and suspend tariffs on imports of construction materials,"" Fowke said. 
According to the NAHB, aggregate residential construction material costs increased 12% on an annual basis in recent months, and appeared to have risen further.

""Some builders are slowing sales to manage their own supply chains, which means growing affordability challenges for a market in critical need of more inventory,"" said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.
Builders in many markets were also facing worker and land shortages, which could keep home prices elevated through this year. The survey's measure of current sales conditions was unchanged at 88, but its gauge of sales expectations over the next six months rose one point to 81. The component measuring traffic of prospective buyers fell one point to 73.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factories slowed their output growth in April and retail sales significantly missed expectations as officials warned of new problems affecting the recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
While China's exporters are enjoying strong demand, global supply chain bottlenecks and rising raw materials costs have weighed on production, cooling the blistering economic recovery from last year's COVID-19 slump.
Factory output grew 9.8% in April from a year ago, in line with forecasts but slower than the 14.1% surge in March, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday. Retail sales, meanwhile, rose 17.7%, much weaker than a forecast 24.9% uptick and the 34.2% surge in March.
NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said while China's economy showed a steady improvement in April, new problems are also emerging, notably the rise in international commodity prices.
""The foundations for the domestic economic recovery are not yet secure,"" Fu told a news briefing in Beijing on Monday.
""For companies as a whole, price increases are conducive to the improvement of corporate efficiency, but the pressure on downstream industries needs to be paid attention to,"" he added.
China's factory price inflation hit its highest pace since October 2017 in April. That could rise further in the second and third quarters, according to a report from the central bank last week.
The slower growth rates in the April activity indicators were also due in part due to the fading base effects as year-on-year comparisons rolled away from very sharp declines seen when the coronavirus shut down much of the country in early 2020.
In the factory sector, motor vehicle production growth fell sharply to 6.8% from 69.8%, due in part to the base effect as well as critical shortages of semiconductors used in car systems.
Growth in the production of cement slowed in April, and coal production fell on year, although aluminium and crude steel output hit record highs, helped by firm demand.
""China's economy shows signs of unbalanced recovery: strong exports and domestic investment on one hand, but weak consumption on the other,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note. 
Sectors related to travel, leisure and entertainment are large employers and still held back by COVID-19 uncertainty, he said.
Home appliances sales growth dropped particularly sharply in April from the month before, falling from 38.9% growth on year in March to 6.1%, NBS data showed.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note said month-on-month retail sales growth fell well below its pre-pandemic pace.
""Looking ahead, we think the rebound in consumption should gather pace again in the coming months as the labour market continues to tighten,"" he said.
TIME TO REASSESS?
China's economy expanded by a record 18.3% in the first quarter and many economists expect growth will exceed 8% this year.
Exports accelerated in April, thanks to strong demand for Chinese goods amid a brisk U.S. economic recovery and stalled factory production in other countries.
However, April also saw factory activity slow amid supply bottlenecks and rising costs and policymakers have acknowledged some of the recent weaknesses seen in the economic recovery.
""The cost of production has definitely increased, leading to a decrease in profits,"" said the manager of an automobile accessories factory in China's eastern Zhejiang province, surnamed Xu.
Sales are increasing but relatively slowly, and the factory plans to decrease production accordingly, he said.
A top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party said last month the country will encourage manufacturing and private investment to recover as quickly as possible.
The Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping also warned China's economic recovery remained uneven and that its foundation was not yet solid.
The activity indicators on Monday also showed fixed asset investment increased 19.9% in the first four months from the same period a year earlier, slowing from January-March's 25.6% increase.

Growth in real estate investment, property sales by floor area and new construction starts by floor area all cooled in the first four months compared to the first quarter, NBS data showed, amid increased scrutiny from policymakers on developers' financing activities.
""The government may put the monetary policy tightening on hold for now and observe the pace of recovery,"" Zhang from Pinpoint Asset Management said.

Investing.com – Chinese industrial output continued to improve in April but retail sales missed forecasts, in an indication of a lag in consumer spending.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day said that industrial production growth was 9.8% year-on-year in April, which matched the forecast prepared Investing.com but was lower than March’s 14.1%.
Meanwhile, retails sales increased 17.7% in April year-on-year, below both the 24.9% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 34.2% growth.
“We did see that retail sales continued to disappoint,” Jian Chang, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc told Bloomberg.
The drop is consistent with data over the week-long public holiday at the beginning of the month, which indicated people’s willingness to travel has recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels but actual spending was still lagging, she added.
Industrial output in China continued to improve as stimulus measures and accelerating vaccination rates boosted a global demand. However, the growth slowed in April due to supply shortage, rising raw material prices, as well as a push cut output to lower pollution in sections like steel and coal.
China's economy continued to improve in April but new problems are emerging, the NBS said in a statement alongside the data.
Top Chinese leaders have recently described the recovery as “unbalanced and unstable,” and pledged further efforts to boost domestic demand.
There is still a gap between actual and potential growth, indicating the economic recovery from COVID-19 still has a long way to go, NBS vice head Sheng Laiyun said earlier in the month.
The Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo warned in a meeting in April that China’s economic recovery was uneven and that its foundation was not yet solid. It also added that the government will promote manufacturing and private investment to recover as quickly as possible.
However, the party also pledged to gradually slow down the monetary and fiscal stimulus measures rolled out in 2020 during COVID-19, but with no sharp turn in policy."

Industrial output rose 9.8% in April from a year earlier versus the median estimate for a 10% increase. Retail sales expanded 17.7% in the period, far slower than a projected 25% rise. Fixed-asset investment grew 19.9% in the first four months of the year, in line with forecasts. The unemployment rate was lower at 5.1%.
While China’s economy has stabilized at a firmer footing in April, it’s still challenged by the pandemic and an uneven recovery globally as well as a fragile basis for recovery at home, the NBS said in a statement.
The nation’s top leaders recently described the recovery as “unbalanced and unstable,” pledging further efforts to drive a rebound in domestic demand. Sheng Laiyun, a vice head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said earlier this month there’s still a gap between actual and potential growth, suggesting the recovery has still some way to go.
“We did see that retail sales continued to disappoint,” Jian Chang, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc told Bloomberg TV. That’s consistent with data over the Labor Day public holiday at the beginning of May, which indicated people’s willingness to travel has recovered to pre-Covid levels but actual spending was still lagging, she said.
Manufacturing Investment
China’s stock benchmark CSI 300 Index extended gains to as much as 1.8%, with consumer discretionary and information technology sub-gauges leading the rally.
Industrial production remained robust on the back of a recovery in global demand, with fiscal stimulus and faster vaccine rollouts in many places helping to keep export growth strong. Rising raw material prices was likely a constraint in some areas, as is the push to cut output in sectors like steel and coal to lower pollution.
On a two-year average basis, which corrects for distortions from base effects, manufacturing investment was down 0.4% in the first four months of the year, while infrastructure investment was up 2.4% and property grew 8.4%. Retail sales growth on an average two-year basis softened to 4.3% in April from 6.3% in March, with the consumption of goods and catering services both turning weaker.
A separate report from the NBS suggests the property market remains strong, with home prices rising at the fastest pace in eight months in April.
Authorities have pledged a gradual scaling back of the monetary and fiscal stimulus pumped into the economy last year, with no sharp turn in policy. Recent data shows a notable slowdown in credit in April, suggesting the exit might be materializing at a faster-than-expected pace. The central bank injected medium-term cash into the financial system Monday to match the amount falling due, a move largely expected by analysts.
In March, the People’s Bank of China told banks to curtail loan growth in the coming months and keep it at roughly the same level as last year. The pace of local governments’ debt sales to finance infrastructure projects also slowed sharply in January to April compared to the same period in previous years, according to Bloomberg calculations.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale prices rose in April at their fastest annual pace in six and a half years, data showed on Monday, a sign that rising energy and commodities costs were pinching corporate margins.
With the COVID-19 pandemic weighing on domestic consumption, there is uncertainty about whether companies would pass on higher costs to households and help the central bank achieve its elusive 2% inflation target, analysts say.
""The rise is driven mostly by solid global demand that is pushing up commodities prices,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's division in charge of price statistics, adding that prices of goods sensitive to domestic demand were rising only modestly so far.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge one another for goods and services, rose 3.6% in April from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, faster than a median market forecast for a 3.1% gain.
The rise, which followed a 1.2% increase in March, was the fastest pace of gain since September 2014 and was inflated partly by the base effect of last year's pandemic-related plunge.
April's increase was driven largely by higher commodities costs, with oil goods prices up 39.3% from a year earlier and nonferrous metals prices up 35.2%, the data showed.
In a sign the effect of rising U.S. housing demand was spreading globally, lumber and wood goods prices were up 4.7%.
Of the 744 items in the index, 339 saw prices rise, compared with 289 items that saw prices drop from the same period last year.
The number of components that saw prices rise exceeded that of those with falling prices for the first time in seven months.

Japanese companies have been slow in passing on higher costs to consumers, who are sensitive to price increases because of soft wage growth. That has hampered the BOJ's efforts to fire up consumer inflation to its 2% target.
The central bank's challenge has been made tougher by Japan's struggle to contain the pandemic. The world's third-largest economy is set to grow much more slowly than hoped this quarter because of extended state of emergency curbs to combat a resurgence in infections, a Reuters poll showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some initial U.S. jobs data for May are showing signs of weakness, raising the possibility that April's disappointing employment report was not just a one-time blip. 
The closely watched May jobs report will be based on surveys that will ask businesses about levels of payroll employment as of this week. 
Hiring has recently stalled at a group of small businesses, according to high frequency data collected through May 9 by Homebase, which has been tracking employee time during the pandemic at a sample of around 54,000 restaurants, independent retailers and other small businesses. 
Measures of shift work at around 35,000 firms both large and small that are tracked by time management firm UKG foreshadowed the weak April jobs report. 
UKG data into May have shown work in the manufacturing, retail and health sectors all down. (Graphic: Jobs in real time Jobs in real time, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPENING/azgvoaggdvd/chart.png) 
""We should be prepared for another month of modest job creation,"" predicts UKG vice president Dave Gilberston. 
""People have spent the last 14 months rebuilding their lives around the pandemic. They’ve made alternative childcare and schooling arrangements, budgeted for reduced household income, and adjusted their lifestyle. While there seem to be 'help wanted' signs everywhere you look, it could be as late as September before we see hiring numbers truly surge.""
U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, likely restrained by shortages of workers and raw materials, to just 266,000 jobs, far short of the nearly one million expected. 
The economy is still more than 8 million jobs short of where it was before the pandemic, and if such halting progress continues it will be years before the labor market recovers. (Graphic: The jobs hole facing Biden and the Fed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/xlbpgygrnpq/chart.png) 
Economists generally are still expecting strong job growth in the months to come, as people return to more normal activities - a prospect given a boost this week when U.S. health officials said those vaccinated against the coronavirus could stop wearing masks in most circumstances.
Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Gregory Daco said that at this point he expected 500,000 to 750,000 new jobs to be added in May, and ""it may pick up.""
Other preliminary indicators about the strength of hiring and the economy overall are mixed. 

Jobless claims for the week ending May 8 fell slightly, but have been making only slow progress in recent weeks.
Consumer sentiment in early May tumbled as people worried about rising prices. Inflation expectations for the year ahead and over the next five years rose to their highest in more than a decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly stalled in April as the boost from stimulus checks faded, but an acceleration is likely in the coming months amid record savings and a reopening economy.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the unchanged reading in retail sales last month followed a 10.7% surge in March, an upward revision from the previously reported 9.7% increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 1.0%. Retail sales surged 51.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Last month's unchanged reading in sales came as a 2.9% rise in motor vehicles purchases was offset by declines in spending elsewhere. Sales at clothing stores tumbled 5.1%. There were also decreases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at building material stores slipped 0.4%. Online retail sales fell 0.6%.
But consumers increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 3.0% rise in receipts. That followed a 13.5% jump in March. Sales at restaurants and bars are 116.8% higher compared to April 2020. 
Economists expect demand to swing back to services from goods as vaccinated Americans venture out to places like restaurants and bars after being cooped up at home for more than a year. Receipts at electronics and appliance stores rose 1.2%. Sales at furniture stores dropped 0.7%. 
Many qualified households received additional $1,400 checks in March, which were part of the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package approved early that month. 
Retail sales account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. Households have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, which should underpin spending this year.
U.S. stocks were set to open higher. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
Coming on the heels of news this month that hiring slowed in April amid a shortage of workers, the weak sales could cause anxiety about the economic recovery. Though more than a third of Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, fears about the virus linger and schools have not fully reopened for in-person learning, keeping many workers at home.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dropped 1.5% last month after an upwardly revised 7.6% increase in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have shot up 6.9% in March.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 10.7% annualized rate in the first quarter, adding 7.02 percentage points to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace. 
Much of the surge in consumer spending last quarter occurred in March, which set a higher growth base for consumption heading into the second quarter.

The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell 5.5 points to a reading of 82.8, pulling back from the highest level in roughly a year in April. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for a reading of 90.4, which would have marked the third straight monthly gain. 

Consumers' assessment of their current situation and their future outlook both soured, while their estimates for inflation shot up to 4.6% for this year and to 3.1% for the next 5 years - the highest in more than a decade for both.
""The average of net price mentions for buying conditions for homes, vehicles, and household durables were more negative than any time since the end of the last inflationary era in 1980,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, said in a statement.

Business inventories rose 0.3% after increasing 0.6% in February, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. March's gain was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories were unchanged on a year-on-year basis in March.
Retail inventories decreased 1.4% in March as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% gain in February.
Motor vehicle inventories plunged 6.1% as previously reported. Motor vehicle stocks are dwindling as a global semiconductor shortage weighs on auto production.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.6% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted in the first quarter amid a burst in domestic demand, fueled by a reopening economy and massive fiscal stimulus. Inputs shortages at factories as well as a scarcity of workers at ports to offload imported consumer goods could make it difficult for businesses to rebuild stock.
The inventory drawdown subtracted 2.64 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a robust 6.4% annualized rate in the March-January period after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Wholesale inventories rose 1.3% in March. Stocks at manufacturers gained 0.7%.
Business sales rebounded 5.7% in March after dropping 1.6% in February. At March's sales pace, it would take 1.23 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.30 months in February.

Manufacturing production rose 0.4% last month after surging 3.1% in March, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Manufacturing production remains a touch below its pre-pandemic level.
""An important contributor to the gain in factory output was the return to operation of plants that were damaged by February's severe weather in the south central region of the country and had remained offline in March,"" the Fed said. 
""The weather-induced drop in total industrial production in February and the subsequent rebound in March are now estimated to have been larger than reported last month.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would increase 0.4% in April. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by massive fiscal stimulus and a shift in demand to goods from services because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
But the demand boom has led to a shortage of raw materials across the industry. The pandemic also is keeping some workers at home, adding to the supply constraints. 
A global semiconductor crunch has forced automakers in the United States to slash production. Output at auto plants dropped 4.3% in April. Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.7%.
The rise in manufacturing output combined with a 2.6% increase in utilities to lift industrial production by 0.7% last month. That followed a 2.4% increase in March. Mining production gained 0.7%.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose to 74.1 from 73.8 in March. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector was up 0.5 percentage point to 74.9%. It is 4.7 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

Investing.com -- Fears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.
Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.
Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.
James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.
The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.
By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 
March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""
Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued.

The world's third-largest economy has recovered largely due to solid overseas demand that has boosted output and exports, even as a resurgence of coronavirus infections are dampening consumption.
Next week's key data include machinery orders and consumer and wholesale prices, as well as first-quarter gross domestic product figures that will be released on Tuesday.
Exports likely surged 30.9% in April from a year earlier, which would mark the sharpest monthly rise since May 2010, the poll of 18 economists showed.
Imports were forecast to have grown 8.8% in April from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 140.0 billion yen ($1.28 billion).
""Tightness in supply and demand of semiconductors seems to have a minor impact on exports so far,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Export values increased greatly, by 32.2%, in early and mid-April, in part in reaction to a sharp downturn in the same month last year.""
A slump in global trade due to supply chain disruptions from coronavirus lockdowns around the world delivered a heavy blow to Japan's trade-reliant economy in April last year.
The finance ministry announces trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
Core machinery orders data, which exclude those for ships and electrical utilities, are also set to be released on Wednesday.
The poll showed core machinery orders in March were expected to have decreased 2.6% from year-ago levels, and to have gained 6.4% compared to the previous month.

The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have fallen 0.2% in April compared to the same month a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy is set to grow much slower than previously hoped this quarter, hobbled by extended emergency measures put in place to halt a rise in coronavirus infections, a Reuters poll showed.
It is likely to expand an annualised 1.7% this quarter, less than half the 4.7% projected last month, according to the poll of 33 economists conducted May 6-13.
Nearly all of the economists polled believe the government will compile an extra budget to support the world's third-largest economy, with 60% expecting it to come before the end of the third quarter.
A surge in infections due in part to new variants led to the government's decision to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and three other areas until the end of the month and to expand it to two more prefectures, hitting consumer spending and broader activity.
""The pace of recovery appears to have been sluggish since the start of the year,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at the Japan Research Institute.
""But it's hard to imagine Japan's economy will fall into a deep contraction as attempts to suppress people's movements have become less effective.""
The economy likely shrank around 4.5% on an annualised basis in the first quarter, the poll showed. Preliminary GDP data is due on Tuesday.
For the full year, expectations have been revised down to a 3.6% growth from 3.9%, with economists also noting the slow pace of Japan's vaccination programme compared to other countries. For the next fiscal year, economists expect on average 2.4% growth.
""The vaccine rollout is pretty awful if you look at it from a global context. It's far behind that in Europe,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Japan has inoculated just 3% of its population, the lowest rate among the Group of Seven nations.
EXTRA BUDGET
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has faced growing calls from lawmakers, including ruling party heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai, to increase spending to support the economy. But he has so far expressed caution due to Japan's huge public debt and as the government has already compiled three pandemic-specific packages worth a combined $3 trillion.
Projections for the size of the economic package showed 12 economists expect it to range between 5 trillion yen to 10 trillion yen ($45 billion - $90 billion), 11 expect a package of 10-20 trillion yen while nine forecast 5 trillion yen or less.
Some economists said the timing of the extra budget would depend on the timing of a lower house election that has to be held by late October.
In years with major elections, Japan's government typically rolls out a stimulus package before or around the election to appeal to voters.
Eighty percent of analysts in the poll expected the Bank of Japan's next policy move to be an unwinding of stimulus with most not expecting this to happen until 2023 or later. That was roughly on par with last month's poll.
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food prices, are set to only rise 0.3% this fiscal year, the poll showed, down from 0.4% projected in the previous month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 14-month low last week as companies held onto their workers amid a growing labor shortage that helped to curb employment growth in April.
The scramble for workers comes as the reopening economy is experiencing a boom in demand, resulting in widespread shortages of inputs at factories and fanning inflation. Producer prices increased more than expected in April, leading to the biggest annual gain since 2010, other data showed on Thursday. 
The worker shortage is despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed, a disconnect that economists expect will resolve in the coming months as increased vaccinations ease COVID-19 stress and enhanced unemployment benefits expire, allowing some workers to return to the labor market.
""With demand for workers high and layoffs relatively low, we should see strong hiring in the months to come, as barriers to employment, such as lack of childcare, lessen,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""For many, especially low-wage workers, returning to a job is a puzzle in which several pieces, such as transportation, wage levels and benefits must fall into place.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 473,000 for the week ended May 8, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 490,000 applications for the latest week. The decrease in claims was led by Michigan, New York and Florida. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, but remain well above the 200,000 to 250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. 
Some economists believe the enhanced unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 government subsidy, could be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved.
The economy created 266,000 jobs in April after adding 770,000 in March, which was partly blamed on the generous unemployment benefits. There are a record 8.1 million open jobs.
Several states in the South and Midwest, such as Tennessee and Missouri, that have unemployment rates below the national average of 6.1% have recently announced they will end federally funded pandemic unemployment benefits next month.
Economists cite the still-bloated jobless rolls as supporting the thesis that unemployment checks were keeping some workers home. There were 3.655 million people receiving benefits after an initial week in the week ended May 1, down 45,000 from the prior week. A total 16.9 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs at the end of April.
The government-funded benefits end in early September.
Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said on Thursday, ""the question of how to unclog the labor market is going to be a critical one,"" in keeping the recovery on track.
Stocks on Wall Street rebounded on the claims data after declining for three straight sessions. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
DEMAND BOOM
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. More than a third of the population has been fully vaccinated, leading many states to lift most capacity restrictions on businesses.
The resulting pent-up demand is pushing against supply constraints. In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.6% in April after surging 1.0% in March. 
A 0.6% increase in the cost of services accounted for about two-thirds of the rise in the PPI. Services, which increased 0.7% in March, were last month driven by higher prices for portfolio management, airline tickets and food retailing as well as physician care.
Goods prices gained 0.6%, lifted by an 18.4% jump in steel mill products. In the 12 months through April, the PPI shot up 6.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since the series was revamped in November 2010 and followed a 4.2% jump in March.
Part of acceleration in the PPI was due to last spring's weak readings dropping out of the calculation. The report followed on the heels of news on Wednesday that consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April.
Though rising prices have spooked investors, the Federal Reserve has signaled it could tolerate higher inflation for some time to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its 2% target, a flexible average. 
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday it would be ""some time"" before the economy is healed enough for the U.S. central bank to consider scaling back its support. The Fed slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero last year and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. Its preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is at 1.8%.

""Each big inflation report for the next several months will test the Fed's approach to seeing through these issues it promises to be transitory,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Based on the CPI and PPI data, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is forecasting that core PCE increased 0.49% in April and 3.38% year-on-year.

Initial claims in regular state programs fell by 34,000 to 473,000 in the week ended May 8, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 490,000 claims. The prior week’s figure was revised up to 507,000.
The labor market continues to improve as more Americans get vaccinated and consumer demand picks up, helping spur economic activity. As more businesses and states lift remaining pandemic restrictions, hiring is expected to continue to accelerate.
Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, several states including South Carolina and Montana have recently said they plan to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether generous aid is playing a role in why businesses are having a hard time hiring workers.

Online job adverts hit 107% of their pre-pandemic February 2020 level on May 7, up by four percentage points from two weeks earlier, figures from jobs website Adzuna showed.
Most sectors saw an increase in job ads with the biggest rise in hospitality, which has seen a 46 percentage-point leap in job ads since early April - before the sector reopened for outdoor customers.
Indoor service is due to resume on Monday, representing a big boost for the industry which has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic and the government's lockdowns to slow it.
There was also strong demand for workers in transport, logistics and warehousing which rose by 18 percentage points over the two weeks to May 7 to 235% of its February 2020 level, adding to a rise since the start of the year.
""It is thought that jobs within this sector are taking longer to fill and accumulating, which is contributing in-part to the higher overall vacancy numbers for this category,"" the ONS said.
Other figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed spending on British credit and debit cards in the week to May 6 was 106% of its February 2020 level, up from 99% a week earlier.
The ONS said the figures showed consumers were spending more on travel, eating out and other activities that are being freed up from coronavirus rules.
The Bank of England expects a rise in spending by consumers, who accumulated savings during lockdowns over the past year, will help drive growth of more than 7% in Britain's economy in 2021 after its almost 10% slump in 2020.

The proportion of the workforce on the government's job-protecting furlough scheme was 11% in the period between April 19 and May 2, down from a previous reading of 13%, the ONS said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A measure of British house price inflation hit its highest level since the late 1980s in April as buyers raced to take advantage of an extended tax break just as sellers retreated from the market, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' gauge of house prices - which reflects the proportion of surveyors reporting price increases - jumped in April to +75, its highest level since 1988, from +62 in March.
Other indicators have also shown that a surge in the housing market was given fresh momentum by finance minister Rishi Sunak's announcement on March 3 that he was extending temporarily a cut to a tax on property purchases.
Sunak also announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers who cannot afford large deposits.
RICS said new buyer demand was positive across every region for the first time this year. But new instructions from owners looking to sell slumped to -4 from +21 in March.
""Housing supply, or more pertinently, the shortfall in supply relative to demand is the key theme coming through loud and clear,"" Simon Rubinsohn, RICS's chief economist, said.
""While it may be simplistic to assume that higher numbers alone can redress the affordability issue, particularly in a low interest rate environment, an uplift in delivery does have a role to play.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government said on Tuesday it would create a simpler and faster planning system to speed up the construction of new homes, a frequent promise of British governments.
Sunak cut the stamp duty purchase tax last year as part of his emergency measures to help the economy through its coronavirus slump. 
Demand for bigger homes after the experience of lockdown has also driven a surge in demand since last spring, a phenomenon seen in other countries too.

RICS said there were signs that the renewed rush to buy homes would ease off when the tax break is scaled back in June and ends completely in September.
Only a net 12% of respondents in its survey thought the sales volumes would rise over the next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector confidence fell at the sharpest pace in a year in April, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Thursday, as curbs aimed at containing a resurgence of COVID-19 infections depressed consumer spending. 
Japan put in place a third state of emergency in Tokyo and some other areas late last month and has extended the measures until the end of May as the country struggles to contain a fourth wave of infections.
Analysts expect gross domestic product data due next Tuesday to show the world's third largest economy shrank in January-March as the curbs hit face-to-face service activity hard.
As private consumption accounts for more than half of the economy, the outlook for the current quarter appears dark as well.
""Household sentiment turned out particularly weak as more and more people have refrained from unnecessary outings and shopping,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
Thursday's survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called the ""economy watchers"" index for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions fell 9.9 points from the previous month to 39.1 in April.
It was the first decline in three months.
All the component indexes measuring sentiment at households, businesses and employment worsened, the survey showed. 
The Cabinet Office cut its view on the survey for the first time in three months, saying that the economy remains severe due to the pandemic and a pick-up will be weak. As for the outlook, it said anxiety is mounting over virus developments.
A year ago the index plunged to 7.9, the lowest level since the survey began in 2000, as the economy took a hard hit from the first wave of the pandemic and suffered its worst post-war slump.

The outlook index, indicating the level of confidence in future conditions, fell 8.1 points to 41.7 in April, down for a second straight month.
""Given the latest emergency, private consumption will likely remain stagnant in May as well,"" Nomura's Kuwahara said.

The Treasury Department said that the deficit for the first seven months of fiscal 2021 still hit a new record of $1.932 trillion, a 30% increase from the same period of fiscal 2020.
April receipts rose 82% from a year earlier to $439 billion, but the increase is partly due to last year's deferral of income tax payments to July. The Treasury deferred tax payments this year by only one month, until May 17, with no deferral for corporate taxes.

April outlays were $665 billion, a decrease of 32% from April 2020, as that month contained the bulk of payments to individuals in the first round of coronavirus rescue aid. Payments under President Joe Biden's stimulus plan this year were mainly sent in March.
Year-to-date receipts for fiscal 2021 totaled $2.143 trillion, up 16% from the year-ago period, while year-to-date outlays totaled $4.075 trillion, up 22%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April as booming demand amid a reopening economy pushed against supply constraints, which could add fuel to financial market fears of a lengthy period of higher inflation.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed a strong buildup of underlying price pressures, extending a stocks selloff on Wall Street. Most economists were, however, unwavering in their belief that the surge in prices would be temporary, noting that the main drivers of the bigger-than-expected inflation increase were hotels and airlines, industries that were hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Bottlenecks in the supply chain, which led to a record jump in prices of used cars and trucks last month, were expected to ease. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has similar views.
""This is not a sign of an inflation problem,"" said Robert Barbera, director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Financial Economics. ""We have the capacity to produce this stuff, we simply need time to get things back on line.""
The consumer price index jumped 0.8% last month, the largest gain since June 2009. The CPI rose 0.6% in March. A 10.0% surge in prices of used cars and trucks, the most since the series started in 1953, accounted for over a third of the increase in the CPI last month. That followed a 0.5% rise in March. Motor vehicle production has been hampered by a global semiconductor chip shortage, boosting demand for used automobiles. 
Food prices increased 0.4%, lifted by rises in the cost of fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meats, fish and eggs. Households also paid more to dine out. But gasoline prices fell 1.4% after accelerating 9.1% in March. 
A sharp rebound is likely after hackers shut down the Colonial Pipeline on Friday, leaving gas stations from Florida to Virginia running dry and prices at the pump surging this week.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would climb 0.2%. In the 12 months through April, the CPI shot up 4.2%. That was the largest gain since September 2008 and followed a 2.6% increase in March. The jump mostly reflected the dropping of last spring's weak readings from the calculation. 
Those so-called base effects are expected to push annual inflation even higher in the months ahead.
Stocks on Wall Street fell, building on the previous session's losses, as investors worried that surging inflation could force the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than expected. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
""At the very least, this report demands extra work from the Fed to assuage markets it is standing its ground and why,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. (Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yzdvxzqdrvx/inflation.png) 
BROAD PRICE INCREASES
The U.S. central bank slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero last year and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. It has signaled it could tolerate higher inflation for some time to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its 2% target, a flexible average.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday it would be ""some time"" before the economy is healed enough for the central bank to consider scaling back its support.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index is at 1.8%.
Demand is being driven by nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States in March 2020 and the vaccination of more than a third of the population. There are concerns inflation could linger amid reports that companies are raising wages as they compete for scarce workers.
Though job openings are at a record 8.1 million and nearly 10 million people are officially unemployed, companies are scrambling for labor. Generous unemployment benefits, fears of contracting the virus, parents still at home caring for children and pandemic-related retirements have been blamed for the disconnect. Average hourly earnings jumped in April.
Economists are keeping an eye on fairly high inflation expectations, which some say could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI soared 0.9% last month, the largest gain since April 1982. The so-called core CPI rose 0.3% in March. 
It was boosted by a 10.2% surge in prices of airline tickets as well as an 8.8% jump in the cost of rooms in hotels and motels. The cost of renting a car soared 16.2%. Rental companies offloaded their fleets at the height of the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage is making it harder to restock.
Further increases are likely as these tourism categories remain below their pre-pandemic levels. Prices for new motor vehicles increased 0.5%. Consumers also paid more for recreation, motor vehicle insurance and household furnishings. But healthcare costs edged up 0.1% for a second straight month.

In the 12 months through April, the core CPI jumped 3.0%, also boosted by base effects. That was the biggest increase since January 1996 and followed a 1.6% advance in March.
""Put together with potentially higher wage inflation, higher inflation may be stickier than the Fed expects,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in New York.

Investing.com -- U.S. inflation surged to its highest rate since the eve of the 2008 financial crisis in April, as last year's collapse in oil prices and a nascent economic recovery combined to generate the kind of number that many market participants have feared.
The consumer price index rose 4.2% from a year ago, according to government data released on Wednesday, well above consensus forecasts for 3.6%. However, the 0.8% rise in prices in April alone made clear that the spike wasn't entirely a result of distortions from last year, when crude oil prices briefly dipped below zero against a Covid-19-driven collapse in demand. 
Even when stripped of some of their more volatile elements, the data were ugly: the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.9% on the month, its biggest monthly rise since the early 1980s. That left core inflation running at a rate of 3.0%.
The biggest factor behind the jump appeared to be a 10% rise in prices for used cars and trucks, which was in turn due to various factors such as the reopening of more of the economy, an aversion to using mass transit amid lingering infection risks, and a shortage of inventory from the auto industry because of the global chip shortage. That rise was the biggest since the government started tracking it in 1953 and it accounted for over a third of the seasonally-adjusted increase in the overall price level.
Other items that the Department of Labor Statistics said had a big impact on the numbers were housing, airline fares, recreation, vehicle insurance, and household furnishings.
The data had an immediate impact on expectations for monetary policy, despite repeated assurances from the Federal Reserve that it will 'look through' what it considers to be a transitory spike in prices. Reuters reported that short-term interest rate futures now reflect 100% certainty that the Fed will hike rate by the end of next year, rather than wait until 2023, as its official guidance indicates.  The yield on the 10-Year Treasury bond meanwhile rose some 5 basis points to 1.66%, a two-week high. The Treasury is due to auction some $41 billion of 10-year notes later Wednesday.
The Fed has indicated it doesn't expect a problem with the general level of prices, which it sees as different in nature from the abrupt shifts in relative prices for certain categories of goods and services as consumer spending patterns adapt to the reopening of the economy. For the present, it is more concerned about the level of slack in the labor market, where over 16 million people are still claiming benefits related to unemployment, and the pace of hiring fell well short of expectations in April
“The outlook is bright, but risks remain, and we are far from our goals,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday. “Remaining patient through the transitory surge (in prices) associated with reopening will help ensure that the underlying economic momentum that will be needed to reach our goals . . . is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions. ”The numbers come against a backdrop in which a growing number of data points suggest greater price pressure ahead. Commodity prices have been on a tear all year, with lumber – a key input for housing construction costs – more than doubling since the start of the year.
However, analysts argue that the Fed is unlikely to be swayed, not least since the central bank prefers to take its cues from a different measure of inflation, the personal consumer expenditures price index. This index responds more quickly to shifts in consumer spending patterns and is more correlated to the experience of those on lower incomes.
“Trend PCE (inflation) is still below 2%,” said Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro and a former Fed staffer, via Twitter. “The Fed won’t be impressed, even aside from temporary factors.”"
402,"<span>May 12, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices climbed in April by the most since 2009, amid a record increase in used-car costs and signaling a build-up in inflationary pressures as burgeoning demand gives companies latitude to pass on higher costs.
The consumer price index increased 0.8% from the prior month after a 0.6% gain in March, according to Labor Department data Wednesday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core CPI rose 0.9% from March.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.2% in the CPI and a 0.3% gain in the core measure.
The annual CPI figure surged to 4.2%, distorted by the comparison to the pandemic-depressed index in April 2020. This phenomenon -- known as the base effect -- will skew the May figure as well, likely muddling the ongoing inflation debate.
While Federal Reserve officials and economists acknowledge the temporary boost, it’s unclear whether a more durable pickup in inflationary pressures is underway against a backdrop of soaring commodities costs, trillions of dollars in government economic stimulus and incipient signs of higher labor costs.
The core CPI measure, which was also biased higher by the base effect, rose 3% from 12 months ago. For the last year the annual core inflation metric has held below 2%.
Wednesday’s report offers insight into bubbling price pressures across parts of the economy. Wages have shown signs of picking up, and supply chain challenges have elongated delivery times and driven materials prices higher.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pandemic-battered economy grew more strongly than expected in March as it gathered speed for a bounce-back from its coronavirus slump of 2020, official data showed on Wednesday.
The 2.1% growth from February was led by the reopening of schools which, alongside COVID-19 testing and vaccinations, pushed up activity in the public sector and by retailers as consumers spent some of their lockdown savings.
There was also a burst of work in the construction sector ahead of the expiry of a tax break for home-buyers.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected monthly growth of 1.3% for world's fifth-biggest economy.
""Businesses and the government alike will feel this data marks a turning point,"" Ana Boata, head of macroeconomic research at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, said.
""With the ongoing easing of restrictions, confirmed this week by the prime minister, there’s hope that this could be the start of a long hot summer for British businesses."" 
Over the first three months of 2021, when the country was under a third lockdown, gross domestic product shrank by 1.5%, the Office for National Statistics said.
Although a less severe hit than initially feared, Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it meant Britain almost certainly remained the laggard among the Group of Seven rich countries for the fourth quarter in a row.
However, British GDP looked on course grow by 5% in the April-to-June period ""which should mean that the UK finally hands over the wooden spoon to another G7 economy.""
The BoE said last week it expected the economy would recover quickly as the country speeds ahead with Europe's fastest vaccination programme and coronavirus restrictions are lifted.
Its forecast for 7.25% growth in 2021 would be the fastest since a Second World War rush to rearm although by comparison GDP collapsed by 9.8% in 2020, its deepest slump in over three centuries.
""Despite a difficult start to this year, economic growth in March is a promising sign of things to come,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
""As we cautiously reopen the economy, I will continue to take all the steps necessary to support our recovery.""
Britain's economy remained 8.7% smaller than at the end of 2019. The BoE expects it will be back to its pre-pandemic size by the end of this year.

MORE REOPENING AHEAD
Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed non-essential shops to reopen and outdoor hospitality to resume in April in England and there have been signs that the economy accelerated in response.
Further relaxations are due to take place next week before the lifting of almost all remaining restrictions in late June.
The ONS data showed Britain's dominant services industry grew by 1.9% in March from February, its strongest growth since last August, while manufacturing and construction also grew more strongly than expected by analysts in the Reuters poll. 
Separate trade figures showed Britain imported more goods from non-EU countries than EU countries during the first quarter for the first time since records began in 1997.
The ONS warned it was too soon to say if this was the start of a trend or just short-term disruption.

""Exports of goods to the EU continued to increase in March and are now almost back to their December level,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said. ""However, imports from Europe remain sluggish.""
Business investment fell by almost 12% in the January-March period. The ONS said some companies brought forward investment plans to late 2020 to avoid disruption caused by leaving the EU's Single Market while others delayed plans for early 2021 to take advantage of a new tax break that launched in April.

Sales reached 2.25 million vehicles in April, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.

Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, maintained their strong sales momentum, jumping 180%, with 206,000 units sold in the month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in March, further evidence that a shortage of workers was hampering job growth, even as nearly 10 million Americans are looking for employment.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday also showed layoffs dropping to a record low in March. The report could put pressure on the White House to review government-funded unemployment benefits programs, including a $300 weekly supplement, which pay more than most minimum wage jobs. 
The benefits were extended until early September as part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic relief package approved in March. Alabama, Montana and South Carolina are ending government-funded pandemic unemployment benefits for residents next month. Those benefits cover the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance programs. 
""As more restrictions are lifted throughout the country, more businesses are opening up,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, there seems to be a mismatch between businesses' eagerness to return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normality and many workers' hesitation to step back into the workforce.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped 597,000 to 8.1 million on the last day of March, the highest since the series began in December 2000. The surge was led by the accommodation and food services sector, with 185,000 vacancies opening up. There were an additional 155,000 job openings in state and local government education. 
In the arts, entertainment and recreation industry, vacancies increased by 81,000 jobs. Vacancies also increased in manufacturing, trade, transportation and utilities industries as well as in finance. Job openings rose in the Northeast and Midwest regions. But vacancies dropped in the healthcare and social assistance industry.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 7.5 million in March. The job openings rate shot up to 5.3% from 5.0% in February. 
Companies are scrambling for labor to meet pent-up demand that has been unleashed by the massive fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health. A separate report from the NFIB on Tuesday showed small businesses reported record-high vacancies in April. The openings were for both skilled and unskilled labor. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

LAYOFFS AT RECORD LOW
The disconnect between the high unemployment and worker shortages has also been blamed on fears of contracting the virus even though all adult Americans can now access the COVID-19 vaccine. Some parents are still at home caring for children as schools gradually return to in-person learning. 
There have also been coronavirus-related retirements and others are making career changes because of the pandemic.
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs in April after rising 770,000 in March. Employment is 8.2 million jobs below its peak in February 2020 and 9.8 million people were recorded as officially unemployed in April.
Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday that while it was ""true that with the extension of the unemployment benefits people are in a financial position so that they can make those hard choices about whether they feel comfortable reentering or not,"" the benefits themselves are not causing the problem.
Mester said health concerns with vaccinations still nowhere near full uptake, difficulties accessing childcare and school closures were the key issues. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also pushed back against criticism that unemployment checks were keeping people at home. 
According to the JOLTS report, there were 1.2 unemployed people for every open job in March. That compares to 0.82 on the eve of the first wave of the pandemic lockdowns 13 months ago. 
Graphic: Job openings to unemployed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOLTS/azgpogkqxpd/chart.png 
The JOLTS report showed hiring increased to 6 million in March from 5.8 million in the prior month. State and local government education hiring rose. There were also gains in educational services as well as mining and logging. The hiring rate climbed to 4.2% from 4.0% in February.
Economists expected the job openings and unemployment disconnection to resolve when the extended benefits lapse, companies raise wages and more Americans get vaccinated, though some worried raw material shortages could hold back hiring.
""Before long many more workers will come back into job-search as it becomes increasingly safe to pursue these public facing jobs ... and as wages rise to compensate for the extra risk of working in face-to-face places during the lingering pandemic,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. 
Graphic: Labor market index Labor market index, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/LABORINDEX/nmopaoxozpa/chart.png 
Layoffs dropped to a record low 1.5 million in March from 1.7 million in the prior month. Layoffs decreased by 93,000 in construction, which has been buoyed by strong demand for housing. The layoffs rate dropped to 1.0% from 1.2% in February. 

The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs rose to 3.5 million from 3.4 million in February. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.4%. 
The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But the pandemic has forced millions of women to drop out of the labor force mostly because of problems related to child care.

406,"<span>May 11, 2021 03:20AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers bought warm clothes to meet friends and family outdoors - part of a broader rise in retail spending last month as many shops re-opened - and people booked more summer holidays in the United Kingdom, surveys showed on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium said total sales were 7.3% higher in April than in the same month two years ago.
The BRC said comparisons with April 2019 gave a better sense of trends in the sector than its usual year-on-year sales measure which showed a jump of more than 50%, reflecting how the retail sector was largely shut in April 2020.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said fashion retailers saw sales rise, particularly in outerwear and knitwear, as the public braved the cold spring weather to meet outdoors as pubs and restaurants partially reopened from April 12.
Furniture sales, which have risen due to increased home-working and booming residential property sales, were also up.
""However, this sales growth is fragile,"" Dickinson said. ""There is little competition for share of spending while parts of hospitality, leisure, and tourism remain restricted and inner cities and town centres continue to perform poorly as many people continue to work from home."" 
Separate figures from payment processor Barclaycard showed debit and card spending last month was 0.4% higher than April 2019, the first growth this year by that measure.
Spending on essential items rose 10.1%, the strongest growth since August last year, pushed up by an 18.5% jump in supermarket shopping.
Resorts and accommodation saw growth of 1.6% as many people considered taking their summer holidays in Britain while airlines and travel agents reported declines of more than 80% with foreign trips largely prohibited.
Spending on fuel showed a smaller decline as more people travelled to see friends and family.
Barclaycard was unable to provide comparisons with spending in April last year. 

Barclaycard's measure of consumer confidence in the economy rose to 36% in April from 28% in March, its highest since February 2020 which was shortly before the onset of the pandemic, echoing the latest GfK survey on consumer confidence. 
The consumer confidence survey was based on interviews with 2,000 people between April 24-26.

Germany let firms that were struggling with the crisis delay filing for bankruptcy from March last year - though critics said the policy would only end up propping up ""zombie companies"" with no viable future.
Insolvencies duly fell, hitting their lowest level since 1999 last year. But since October, Berlin has phased out the scheme. This year only firms awaiting state aid provided since November were exempt from filing - until this month.
The Statistics Office said the February figures meant ""that the economic problems of many businesses due to the coronavirus crisis were not yet reflected by an increase in reported business insolvencies.""
Tuesday's data release also showed a let-up in insolvencies making their way through the legal system in Europe's largest economy after a sharp increase in recent months.
The number of new insolvency proceedings, which give an indication of the future path of actual insolvencies, fell 17% in April from the prior month, provisional data showed. That followed a 37% increase in March.

The European Union's top economic watchdog said last month EU governments must step in to avert a wave of insolvencies by healthy companies that are struggling due to the pandemic.
But local critics who say the fall in insolvencies over the past year is proof in itself the state has done more than enough and that excessive support risks impeding what economic liberals hail as ""creative destruction"", the term popularised in the 1940s by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe unviable firms folding to make way for more dynamic newcomers.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory gate prices rose at the fastest rate in three and a half years in April as the world's second-largest economy gathers momentum after strong first-quarter growth, but economists downplayed the risks to inflation. 
Investors globally are increasingly worried that pandemic-driven stimulus measures could spark a rapid rise in inflation and force central banks to raise interest rates and take other tightening measures, potentially holding back economic recovery.
China's producer price index (PPI), a gauge of industrial profitability, rose 6.8% in April from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said, faster than a 6.5% rise tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts and a 4.4% rise in March.
However, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by a mild 0.9% on year, held down by weaker food prices, and analysts said the rising costs from soaring producer prices were unlikely to be fully passed on to consumers. 
""We still expect much of the recent surge in upstream price pressure to prove transitory, with industrial metal prices likely to drop back later this year as a tighter policy stance weighs on construction activity,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.
""We don't think inflation will rise to the point where it triggers a major policy shift"" by China's central bank, they added.
Chinese authorities have repeatedly said they will avoid sudden policy shifts that could derail economic recovery, but are slowly normalising policy and clamping down on property speculation in particular.
The sharp jump in producer prices included an 85.8% surge in oil and natural gas extraction from a year ago, while ferrous metals processing rose 30%, said Dong Lijuan, senior NBS statistician in a statement accompanying the data release.
Consumers could see some price rises ahead from a global chip shortage affecting goods such as home appliances, cars and computers, said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING.
""We believe that the chip price increase has already pushed up prices of fridges, washing machines, TVs, laptops and car prices in April, which increased 0.6%-1.0% month-on-month,"" she said.
CPI STILL MILD
April's 0.9% CPI increase was up on a 0.4% rise in March, driven mostly by gains in non-food prices as the services sector recovered. It missed analysts' expectations for a 1.0% rise. 
Sheng Laiyun, a deputy director at NBS, said on Friday that China's full-year CPI is likely to be significantly below the official target of around 3%. 
Sheng attributed China's likely muted inflation to currently slow core inflation, economic fundamentals where supply has outstripped demand, relatively restrained macropolicy support, recovering pork supply and a limited pass-through effect from PPI to CPI. 
Food inflation remained weak. Prices dropped by 0.7% from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous month, weighed by falling pork prices as supply increased.

China's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a record 18.3% in annual terms in the first quarter as the country recovers from the devastating impact of COVID-19. 
Many economists expect China's GDP growth to exceed 8% in 2021, although some warn that continuing global supply chain disruptions and higher comparison bases will sap some momentum in coming quarters.

Investing.com – China’s producer price jumped in April, but consumer inflation saw modest gains, as soaring commodity prices increased concerns about inflation.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China’s producer price index (PPI) grew 6.8% year-on-year in April, the highest since October 2017. It exceeded the 6.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 4.4% growth.
Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% month-on-month in April, lower than the 0.2% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but above March’s 0.5% decrease. The CPI grew 0.9% year-on-year, slightly below the 1.0% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com while remaining above March’s 0.4% growth.
The widening gap between the CPI and PPI “suggests an uneven recovery of the economy,” said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd.
“Despite the commodity boom, the service sector has yet to catch up... wages are lagging and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will likely keep its policy stance 'largely neutral,'""  he added.
Investors are also concerned that a commodities boom in the world’s biggest exporter, which was driven by increasing global demand and supply shortages, will lead to inflation globally as manufacturers start passing on higher prices to retailers.
Some central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, maintain the view that any inflation is temporary. However, Chinese policymakers insist that it can limit the impact of commodity prices on the domestic economy and control price growth. Meanwhile, the government also pledged to limit costs to firms by taking further measures to control the raw materials market.
The PBOC is also looking to slow down its stimulus measures rolled out as COVID-19 spread in 2020, due to concerns over the buildup of debt. Economists also expect a slowdown of credit expansion instead of interest rate growth.
Meanwhile, the Communist Party’s Politburo said in April that it will not hand down any sharp reversal of macroeconomic policies.
While China targets to keep its consumer inflation at around 3% this year, the index is expected to be “significantly lower” than the official aim in 2021, said an NBS official."

The commodities boom, fueled by rising global demand and supply shortages, has stoked concerns about inflation around the world. As the world’s biggest exporter, rising PPI in China is another risk to global inflation as manufacturers start passing on higher prices to retailers.
Central bankers from the U.S. Federal Reserve on down maintain that price gains are temporary. In China, policy makers insist the impact of commodity prices on the domestic economy will be limited and that price growth remains generally under control. Still, officials have pledged to strengthen controls on the raw materials market to limit costs to companies.

Consumer inflation remained relatively amid lower pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket.
The People’s Bank of China is seeking to scale back the stimulus it pumped into the economy during the pandemic last year, worried by the build up of debt. Economists expect policy makers to slow the pace of credit expansion rather than raise interest rates. The Communist Party’s Politburo, the top decision-making body, said last month there won’t be any sharp reversal of macroeconomic policies.
China aims to keep its consumer inflation at around 3% this year, but an NBS official said in a recent interview that the headline index is expected to be “significantly lower” than the official target in 2021.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending posted its biggest monthly gain in 18 months in March, data showed on Tuesday, as consumer demand rebounded strongly from the heavy blow it took from the worsening impact of the coronavirus pandemic last year.
But an extension of new state of emergency restrictions and slow vaccine rollouts are clouding the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, and was likely to keep spending under pressure.
Household spending surged 6.2% in March from a year earlier, after a 6.6% decline in February, government data showed, and was stronger than a median market forecast for a 1.5% gain in a Reuters poll.
The jump marked the biggest gain since September 2019, and was the first advance in four months.
The overall spending gain was mainly due to a rebound from last year's contraction, a government official said, when the health crisis wreaked havoc on economic activity.
The month-on-month figures were also positive, posting a 7.2% rise compared with a forecast of a 2.1% gain.
""The number of infections increased rapidly in April, so there will likely be a decline again,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
That was likely to be followed by a moderate pickup in spending in May and June, he said.
Demand for travel services rebounded strongly compared to a year earlier, but remained at a relatively low level, the data showed, as COVID-19 continued to weigh.
""Department stores were closed in April and people refrained from travelling,"" Minami added.
The data was unlikely to dispel worries that Japan's economic recovery lags that of other major economies after the government last week expanded emergency curbs to halt the latest rise in COVID-19 infections.

The Japanese government has already deployed huge monetary and fiscal stimulus to help the economy withstand a blow to global trade from the health crisis, and the heavy toll it has taken on consumer sentiment which has hurt services spending.

Consumers surveyed in April said they expect inflation to rise by a median of 3.4% over the next year - the highest level since September 2013. Expectations for inflation over the next three years were unchanged at 3.1%. 
Fed officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, say they expect near-term pricing pressures to diminish as supply bottlenecks are resolved and distortions related to sharp price declines at the start of the pandemic last year fade from inflation calculations.
The findings from the New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations suggest some people also expect the inflation bump to be short-lived. 
The housing boom fueled by low interest rates and a desire for more living space is expected to continue, with median year-ahead price growth expectations at a new series high. 
Rental cost expectations increased for the fifth consecutive month and are now expected to rise by 9.5% over the next year, also reaching a series high. 
Some modest relief is expected in gas prices, which are now expected to rise by a median of 9.2% over the next year, down from a high of 9.9% in March. 

The survey is based on a rotating panel of about 1,300 households.
Consumers lowered their expectations for future earnings and spending. Income growth expectations dropped across age groups and education levels to a median of 2.4% in April. Spending growth expectations dropped slightly to a median 4.6% in April from a six -year high level of 4.7% in March.

Business confidence climbed to 26 points from an upwardly revised 17 in March, NAB said in a statement Monday. The conditions index -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- jumped to 32 points from a revised 24.
“It looks like we have moved past the rebound phase of the recovery and are now seeing healthy growth in most of the economy,” said Oster, chief economist at NAB. “It is increasingly likely the expectations for business investment we have seen in our surveys and the Australian Bureau of Statistics data will materialize. It should also result in ongoing employment growth.”
The Reserve Bank of Australia closely monitors sentiment surveys and will likely be encouraged by the positive signal for higher investment and hiring. The central bank and government pumped stimulus to help shield the economy from the pandemic and have pledged to keep up support as they bid for maximum employment to revive wage growth and inflation.
The RBA says it’s likely to keep interest rates near zero until at least 2024 as it tries to achieve those goals. The government meantime is expected to announce more infrastructure and employment-heavy aged care spending in Tuesday’s budget as it also maintains support for hiring.
“Price pressures appear to be building with survey measures trending higher, but for now official measures and the inflation outlook remain soft,” NAB said in the release.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, likely curbed by shortages of workers and raw materials as rapidly improving public health and massive government aid fueled an economic boom.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday, which showed a plunge in temporary help jobs - a harbinger for future hiring - as well as decreases in manufacturing, retail and courier services employment, sparked a heated debate about the generosity of unemployment benefits. 
The enhanced jobless benefits, including a government-funded $300 weekly supplement, pay more than most minimum wage jobs. The benefits were extended until early September as part of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic relief package approved in March. Montana and South Carolina are ending government-funded pandemic unemployment benefits for residents next month. 
Economists say some workers could still be fearful of returning to work even as all adult Americans are now eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. Others also cited problems with child care as in-person classes remain limited in many school districts. Labor and input shortages have been well documented by business surveys.
""The employment gain is understated in part because of the generous largess from Washington,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""Short-staffed restaurant owners are working overtime, truck drivers are impossible to find even after a hefty increase in hourly wages and loading docks at warehouses are keeping trucks idle as there aren't enough workers."" 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs last month. Data for March was revised down to show 770,000 jobs added instead of 916,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would advance by 978,000 jobs. 
That left employment 8.2 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the government to scrap the weekly unemployment subsidy, but the White House dismissed complaints the generous unemployment checks were causing worker shortages.
""It's clear that there are people who are not ready and able to go back into the labor force,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. ""I don't think the addition to unemployment compensation is really the factor that is making a difference."" 
Graphic: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdvzowqkpw/nfpr.png 
Twelve months ago, the economy purged a record 20.679 million jobs as it reeled from mandatory closures of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. That plunge could have thrown off the model that the government uses to adjust the data for seasonal fluctuations, resulting in the April payrolls number being below forecasts.
Unadjusted payrolls increased by 1.089 million jobs after rising by 1.176 million in March.
""We have warned frequently that the COVID-19 shock last spring would echo through the seasonally adjusted data and cause significant volatility,"" said Scott Ruesterholz, portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York. ""That is likely what is happening with this report.""
The report did not change expectations that the economy entered the second quarter with strong momentum and was on track for its best performance this year in almost four decades. Timely labor market indicators, like new claims for jobless benefits, which last week dropped below 500,000 for the first time since the pandemic started, suggest payrolls will pick up.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
ROBUST DEMAND
With more Americans vaccinated, many states have lifted most restrictions on businesses. That, together with $1,400 stimulus checks sent to qualifying households in March, unleashed pent-up demand. Supply chains were already strained by the shift in demand toward goods from services during the pandemic. 
The burst in demand contributed to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace in the first quarter, the second-fastest since the third quarter of 2003. With households sitting on at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings, economists were steadfast in their expectations for double-digit growth this quarter.
""The only thing keeping job gains down is supply, not demand,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The economy is racing forward and that is what we should focus on.""  
Graphic: U.S. labor market by sector - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/xegpbagnqvq/USA-ECONOMY-LABOR-SECTOR.jpg 
Leisure and hospitality gained 331,000 jobs in April, with hiring at restaurants and bars accounting for more than half of the increase. Government employment picked up as some school districts hired more teachers for in-person learning. 
But temporary help services employment dropped by 111,400 jobs. Manufacturing employment fell by 18,000 jobs, with payrolls at motor vehicle manufacturers dropping 27,000. A global semiconductor chip shortage has forced production cuts. 
In the transportation and warehousing industry, employment for couriers and messengers fell by 77,000. Retail employment dropped by 15,300 jobs. Construction payrolls were flat. With workers scarce, employers boosted wages and increased hours for employees. Average hourly earnings jumped 0.7% after dipping 0.1% in March. The average workweek rose 0.1 hour to 35 hours.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in April from 6.0% in March as 430,000 people entered the labor force. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 6.4% in April. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, climbed to 61.7% from 61.5% in March. It was, however, lifted by men. Women, who account for most of the at least 4 million people still outside the labor force, dropped out.

That could bolster President Joe Biden's plan to spend another $4 trillion on education and childcare, middle- and low-income families, infrastructure and jobs. It also supports the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance.
""The road to full employment may be a bit longer than we all thought,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories increased 1.3%, instead of 1.4% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers gained 1.0% in February. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product increased 1.3% in March.
Wholesale inventories shot up 4.5% in March from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers jumped 4.6% after being unchanged in February.

Overall, business inventories were depleted in the first quarter amid a burst in domestic demand. The inventory drawdown subtracted 2.64 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a robust 6.4% annualized rate in the March-January period after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
At March's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in February.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada lost more jobs than expected in April as fresh restrictions to contain a variant-driven third wave of COVID-19 weighed on employers, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday. 
Some 207,100 jobs were lost in April, more than the average analyst prediction for a loss of 175,000. The unemployment rate climbed to 8.1%, missing analyst expectations of 7.8%. Employment is now 2.6% below pre-pandemic levels.
""This episode seemed to be a little more impactful in that it led to a big decline in full-time jobs and specifically in private-sector employment,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
""There were some heavy hits in education and culture and recreation. So it seems like the third wave bit into other sectors a little bit more deeply than the second wave."" 
Full-time employment was down by 129,400 while part-time employment fell by 77,800 positions. 
With many retailers shuttered in April and the restrictions also hitting hotels, food services and entertainment, service sector employment plunged by 195,400 jobs. Employment in the goods sector fell by 11,800.
As COVID-19 infections surged in April, a number of Canadian provinces imposed fresh restrictions, including shuttering or limiting non-essential businesses and closing schools. Cases are beginning to decline, but reopening is still weeks away and economists expect further job losses in May.
Canada has so far fully vaccinated just over 3% of its nearly 38 million residents, while more than 36% have received a first dose. By the end of June, Canada expects to have received 40 million doses.
Long-term unemployment increased by 4.6% to 486,000 people, which suggests some labor market scarring is beginning to show, said Leah Nord, a senior director at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
""The job prospects for displaced workers grow slimmer with every month in lockdown as more businesses throw in the towel,"" she said in a statement. 
Total hours worked fell 2.7% in April, while the number of people working less than half their usual hours jumped 27.2% to 288,000. 
""The hours worked numbers were I think weaker than had been expected,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategists at TD Securities. ""I think it suggests a weaker April than the Bank of Canada would have had penciled in.""

The Bank of Canada in April sharply boosted its outlook for the Canadian economy and signaled interest rates could start to rise in 2022.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% lower at 1.2187 to the greenback, or 82.05 U.S. cents, after touching on Thursday its strongest level in 3-1/2 years at 1.2141.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired far fewer workers than expected in April, likely frustrated by labor shortages, leaving them scrambling to met booming demand as the economy reopens amid rapidly improving public health and massive financial help from the government.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs last month after rising by 770,000 in March, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 978,000 jobs.
The jobs report, the first since the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package was approved in March, will probably do little to change expectations that the economy entered the second quarter with strong momentum and was on track for its best performance this year in almost four decades. 
Twelve months ago, the economy purged a record 20.679 million jobs as it reeled from mandatory closures of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. New claims for unemployment benefits have dropped below 500,000 for the first-time since the pandemic started.
Americans over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, leading states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to lift most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
But the resulting burst in demand, which contributed to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace in the first quarter, the second-fastest since the third quarter of 2003, has triggered shortages of labor and raw materials.
From manufacturing to restaurants, employers are scrambling for workers. A range of factors, including parents still at home caring for children, coronavirus-related retirements and generous unemployment checks, are blamed for the labor shortages. The moderate pace of hiring could last at least until September when the enhanced unemployment benefits run out. 

The labor market remains supported by very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. President Joe Biden plans to spend another $4 trillion on education and childcare, middle- and low-income families, infrastructure and jobs. The Federal Reserve has signaled it intends to leave its benchmark interest rate near zero and continue to pump money into the economy through bond purchases for a while.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in April from 6.0% in March. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Millions of Americans remain out of work and many have permanently lost jobs because of the pandemic.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy created far fewer jobs in April than estimated, casting doubt over the strength of the economic recovery. 
The Labor Department said only 266,000 net nonfarm payrolls were added through the middle of last month, compared to expectations for a number just under 1 million. In addition, the March payrolls gain was revised down by a whopping 146,000 to 770,000.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% of the workforce from 6.0% in March. Analysts had expected it to fall to 5.8%.
There was no indication as to why the government's data were so starkly at odds with other evidence in recent days and weeks suggesting a more vigorous recovery. Data collection for ADP's private-sector hiring survey generally has the same cut-off date as the government's, and ADP had reported a net increase of 742,000 private-sector jobs in the month, compared with the government's estimate of only 218,000. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing payrolls fell by 18,000 month-on-month, something that stands at odds with the ISM's monthly survey, whose employment index has been well above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction all year.
Some economists, at least, were skeptical of the figures' accuracy.
""Ignore the hot-takes and emails dissecting the data. Just put on your steepener and clock out for the weekend,"" said Robin Brooks, an economist with the Institute for International Finance in Washington, DC. ""This negative NFP surprise is just noise and doesn't invalidate for a second that U.S. GDP is booming hugely.""
A steepener is a trade that bets on shorter-dated bonds outperform longer-dated ones, reflecting expectations of higher inflation at a time of low official interest rates.
Market reaction to the news was abrupt, as cyclical stocks, oil and bond yields all headed lower.
However, Nasdaq futures gained on expectations that the Federal Reserve will resist any temptation to consider easing off on its asset purchases this year. Earlier this week, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan had become the first senior Fed official to suggest that the time to discuss tapering bond purchases had already arrived.
For the Fed, we suspect that means it will be a many months before it judges the economy has made “substantial further progress” towards its “broad based and inclusive” full employment goal,"" Michael Pearce, senior economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ""That means any talk of tapering, let alone rate hikes, is still some way off.""
By 8:50 AM ET (1250 GMT), Dow Jones futures, which have outperformed in recent weeks as ‘reopening trades’ have brought beaten-down cyclical names back into fashion, were down 0.1%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China extended its impressive trade performance in April, with exports unexpectedly accelerating and import growth hitting a decade high, in a boost to the world's second-largest economy.
A brisk U.S. economic recovery and stalled factory production in other countries hit by coronavirus have propped up demand for goods made in China, analysts say.
Exports in dollar terms surged 32.3% from a year earlier to $263.92 billion, China's General Administration of Customs said on Friday, beating analysts' forecast of 24.1% and the 30.6% growth reported in March.
""China's export growth again surprised on the upside,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that two factors - the booming U.S. economy and the COVID-19 crisis in India, causing some orders to shift to China - likely contributed to the strong export growth.
""We expect China's export growth will stay strong into the second half of this year, as the two factors above will likely continue to favour Chinese manufacturers. Exports will be a key pillar for growth in China this year.""
The numbers helped push the yuan and stocks in China and other Asian markets higher.
Imports were also impressive, rising 43.1% from a year earlier, the fastest gain since January 2011 and picking up from the 38.1% growth in March. It was also slightly faster than the 42.5% rise tipped by the Reuters poll, bolstered by higher commodity prices.
But Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management, said it remains to be seen if strong import growth, mainly driven by price inflation, could be sustained as China winds down its fiscal policy support.
""It must be noted that the fast year-on-year growth today was largely due to the negative growth a year ago. The two-year average growth was only about 10%, which is not that strong.""
Indeed, import volumes for some products are starting to level off. China's iron ore imports fell 3.5% in April from a month earlier, while copper imports dropped 12.2% on the month.
China's trade surplus of $42.85 billion was wider than a $28.1 billion surplus tipped in the Reuters poll.
SLOWING MOMENTUM
However, analysts still expect China's economic growth to slow from the record 18.3% expansion in the January-March quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts global supply chains, slowing movement of goods and driving up shipment costs.
""Despite the upbeat demand outlook and policy support, supply-side constraints including the global chip shortage, shipping disruption, container shortages, and skyrocketing freight rates are expected to persist for some time,"" said Christina Zhu, Economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in a note on Thursday.
A persistent shortage of semiconductors needed for a wide range of products including consumer electronics and cars is also starting to hurt manufacturers, weighing on production.

Etelec electronics, a Zhongshan-based manufacturer of LED lights, stopped taking on new orders from April 26, due to a shortage in integrated circuits, the company announced in a statement seen by Reuters.
China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index last week showed factory activity growth slowed in April from a month earlier as supply bottlenecks hit production.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 61.6 in April from 61.7 in March, despite the survey's gauge of new orders rising to its highest level since September 2014.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 62.3.
""The UK construction sector is experiencing its strongest growth phase for six-and-a-half years, with the recovery now evenly balanced across the house building, commercial and civil engineering categories,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at data company IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
Overall the survey added to signs that the economy is on track for a swift rebound. On Thursday the Bank of England said Britain's economy, which last year shrank by almost 10%, would grow by the most since World War Two this year.
The all-sector PMI, which combines the PMI surveys for manufacturing, services and construction surveys, rose to 60.8 in April from 56.8 in March, the highest since October 2013.
IHS Markit said that in the construction sector, civil engineering showed its fastest growth since 2014 while the expansion cooled off in the commercial and housebuilding sectors. The latter was boosted by a housing market boom spurred in part by a temporary cut to property purchase tax.
Cost pressures for construction firms increased at the sharpest rate since records started 24 years ago.

""Supply and demand imbalances for construction items, alongside higher transport costs, resulted in severe price pressures across the board during April,"" Moore said.
Employment growth in construction companies was the highest since late 2015, the survey showed - chiming with a Recruitment and Employment Confederation report that showed a rapid increase in demand for staff from employers.

Investing.com – China’s services activities expanded at their highest speed in four months in April, with a little help from a huge trade surplus.
Data released earlier in the day said that the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for April was 56.3, higher than March’s 54.3 reading.
The figure comes after disappointing data released during the previous week, including the Caixin manufacturing PMI for April was 51.9, above the 50.8 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 50.6 reading. Additional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that the manufacturing PMI for April was 51.1, lower than both the 51.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 51.9 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 54.9, also below its March reading of 56.3.
The growth was attributed to the successful curb of COVID-19 cases in the country and ever-increasing demand due to the first global business growth in three months. Meanwhile, total new orders lead to new hiring in services firms.
However, the survey warned that inflation worsened due to a sharper rate of input costs in April, which was driven by higher labor costs and raw material prices.
“Inflation will be a focus in the future. Inflationary pressure was evident as input costs and output prices in manufacturing and services have continued to increase for several months,” said Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note.
“In the coming months, rising raw material prices and imported inflation are expected to limit policy choices and become a major obstacle to the sustained economic recovery,” the note added.
Meanwhile, China’s trade sector also contributed to the growth of the economy.
NBS data said that exports grew 32.3% in April year-on-year, higher than the 24.1 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 30.6% growth. Imports jumped 43.1%, higher than both the predicted 42.5% and March’s 38.1% growth.
The trade surplus was $42.86 billion for the month, higher than the forecast $28.10 billion and March’s $13.80 billion.
The jump in exports was accredited to some countries introducing stimulus measures and global reliance on China's role as the world’s biggest exporter. Meanwhile, imports rose due to a low base in 2020, as well as strong domestic demand and higher commodity prices.
China also pledged to accelerate recovery in domestic demand, which is neither even nor solid, during the previous week’s Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo meeting.
“Looking beyond the pandemic, we think China will continue to rebalance in order to rely more on domestic demand in the longer term and while gradually upgrade itself in the global supply chain,” Liu Peiqian, a China economist at Natwest Group Plc., said in a note."

Non-essential retailers in England reopened on April 12 along with pubs and restaurants operating outdoors, and from May 17 more restrictions are due to be lifted to allow indoor hospitality, performances and sporting events.
While the labour market remains a long way from its pre-pandemic state, the REC survey adds to signs that a swift recovery is underway, helped by Britain's swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines.
""We are bouncing back from a record low – and many people are still struggling – but the data shows that job creation is firing up again,"" said Neil Carberry, REC's chief executive.

""The message for government and employers alike is that the long-term challenge is less likely to be high unemployment than attracting and training enough staff to keep our economy firing.""
The survey came a day after the Bank of England said it now expected unemployment to rise only slightly to a peak of 5.4% in the third quarter of this year.

Still, the solar sector is among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. energy industry, driven by demand from governments and businesses seeking to source cheap, emissions-free power to satisfy customer, taxpayer and investor demands to address climate change.
There were 231,474 workers in the U.S. solar industry in 2020, according to the annual report from the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group, down from 248,034 in 2019.
Stay-at-home orders and a weakened economy slowed demand for solar, particularly in the labor-intensive residential sector, it said. 
Labor productivity also rose 19% and 32% in the residential and utility-scale markets, respectively, due to shifts to online selling and an increase in the average size of projects.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the association, said she expected the decline to be temporary.
""We will see lots more jobs created this year,"" she said.
President Joe Biden has pledged to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050, including the power sector by 2035. It will take 900,000 solar workers to meet that goal, the analysis found.
While Biden has promised his clean energy push will create union jobs that pay well, skeptics note that solar jobs currently come with lower wages and are less likely to be union-represented than those in the oil and gas industries.

About 10% of the solar industry is unionized, the report found, just below the U.S. average.
In addition to SEIA, the report was published by the non-profits The Solar Foundation and the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, as well as the workforce research firm BW Research.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 500,000 last week for the first since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago, signaling the labor market recovery had entered a new phase amid a booming economy.
That was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing U.S.-based employers in April announced the fewest job cuts in nearly 21 years. The reports added to other upbeat employment data in suggesting that the economy enjoyed another blockbuster month of job growth in April. 
But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with about 16.2 million people still collecting unemployment checks.
""Although unemployment remains elevated, the labor market is rapidly recovering,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 92,000 to a seasonally adjusted 498,000 for the week ended May 1, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020, when mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 540,000 applications for the latest week. The decline in claims was led by Virginia, Florida, New York and California.

The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. Americans over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, leading states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to lift most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
The massive fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health situation are unleashing pent-up demand, resulting in a scramble for workers by companies. 
Reports on Wednesday showed private employers hired the most workers in seven months on April, while a measure of services industry jobs rose to more than a 2-1/2-year high. Consumers' perceptions of the labor market are the strongest in 13 months.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower, led by vaccine makers after President Joe Biden announced plans to back intellectual property waivers on COVID-19 shots. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

PRODUCTIVITY REBOUNDS
In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers fell 25% in April to 22,913, the fewest since June 2000. Planned layoffs so far this year are down 84% from the same period in 2020. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 978,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. That would leave employment about 7.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
Estimates range from as low as 656,000 to as high as 2.1 million jobs. The Labor Department will publish April's employment report on Friday. 
Jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They are, however, well above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. 
Part of the elevation has been blamed on fraud as well as the enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, which could be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 605,884 people filed for claims last week. These benefits and the weekly subsidy end in early September. They have been blamed for worker shortages across many industries.
""The government is paying more to be on the unemployment rolls than the private sector is paying to work at their businesses,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The choice is clear, at least until the enhanced benefits run out.""

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 37,000 to 3.690 million in the week ended April 24. About 5.0 million people were on government-funded extended benefits during the week ended April 17. Another 453,653 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid.
There were 16.2 million people receiving benefits under all programs in mid-April. With economic activity strengthening, worker productivity is rebounding, which should help to protect profits as companies face higher input costs caused by the robust demand and a shortage of materials and labor. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rebounded at a 5.4% annualized rate last quarter. Productivity contracted at a 3.8% rate in the final three months of 2020, the sharpest since the fourth quarter of 1990.
""We expect productivity to strengthen in coming quarters and remain well supported as the economy experiences a mini-boom in activity and the labor market lags the overall economic recovery,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 

""Stronger productivity gains should buffer companies' bottom lines against rising input costs and further boost profit growth this year amid an expected surge in companies' sales.""
Gross domestic product is expected to rise above its pre-pandemic level this quarter, while most economists expect a full recovery in employment in the second half of 2022.

426,"<span>May 06, 2021 09:36AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity rebounded in the first quarter, depressing labor costs growth, but the data has been severely distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a clear trend.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 5.4% annualized rate last quarter. Data for the fourth quarter was revised higher to show productivity falling at a 3.8% rate instead of the previously reported 4.2% pace. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would rebound at a 4.3% rate. Productivity shot up early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020. Economists attributed the surge to the hollowing out of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which they said tended to be less productive. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2020, productivity rose at a 4.1% pace. Hours worked increased at a 2.9% rate last quarter, slowing from a 10.0% growth pace in the October-December period.

Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - fell at a 0.3% rate. They grew at a 5.6% pace in the fourth quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 1.6% rate from a year ago. They have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.
Hourly compensation rose at a 5.1% rate last quarter. That followed a 1.6% growth pace in the fourth quarter. Compensation increased at a 5.8% rate compared to the first quarter of 2020.

Investing.com -- The number of initial claims for jobless benefits dropped to a new post-pandemic low last week in a further sign that the economic recovery is gaining strength.
Initial claims fell to 498,000 from an upwardly revised 590,000 the week before. Analysts had expected a figure of 540,000. The revision to last week's figures all but neutralized the positive 'surprise' on this week's number.
The number of people making continuing claims for regular state benefits rose unexpectedly to  3.690 million from 3.653 million. These numbers are reported with a one-month lag to the initial claims numbers. The broader measure of people claiming under all unemployment-related benefit programs, including those set up to deal with the pandemic emergency, fell by just over 400,000 to 16.157 million. These numbers are reported with an additional week's lag. 
The Labor Department's data are consistent with the pattern in ADP's private payrolls survey for April, which showed 742,000 net job additions last month, the most since September. 
""This is a large acceleration in improvement from Feb–Mar to now—a positive sign,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter.
The reopening of the hospitality sector in particular has eased the pressure on labor-intensive industries in recent weeks. According to ADP, some 237,000 people were hired by the sector last month. Although the numbers don't map exactly, ADP's figures are a good omen for the government's official labor market report for April, which is due for release on Friday.
Separately on Thursday, a regular but not exhaustive survey of layoffs across the country showed jobs being shed at their slowest rate since 2000. Challenger, Gray and Christmas' monthly report showed fewer than 23,000 job cuts last month, down from nearly 31,000 in March and a peak of 671,000 last year."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector recorded its fastest growth in more than seven years last month as hospitality businesses and retailers began to reopen to the public after months of lockdown.
IHS Markit said its monthly Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector rose to 61.0 in April from 56.3 in March, above an earlier flash estimate of 60.1.
Both the services PMI and a composite PMI which includes the smaller manufacturing sector were the highest since October 2013. New orders rose at the fastest pace since December 2013.
""A surge of pent-up demand has started to flow through the UK economy following the loosening of pandemic restrictions,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
The Bank of England is expected to revise up its growth forecasts for 2021 later on Thursday, reflecting the rapid roll-out of COVID vaccines in Britain and a very sharp drop in the number of new deaths and infections from the disease.
Non-essential retailers reopened to in-store shoppers across Britain last month and pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers seated outside. 
Indoor dining is expected to be allowed to resume in England on May 17 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government aims to remove most social distancing rules by late June.
""The roadmap for reopening leisure, hospitality and other customer-facing activities resulted in a sharp increase in forward bookings and new project starts across the service sector,"" Moore said.
Britain's economy suffered its biggest fall in output in more than 300 years in 2020 with a contraction of nearly 10% - bigger than most other advanced economies - and may take until early 2022 to recover to its pre-pandemic size.

Rapid growth - and ongoing global disruptions from COVID-19 and Brexit - is also creating inflation pressures. 
The PMI showed the biggest rise in costs for businesses since February 2017 and the strongest hiring in more than five years, creating staff shortages for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Strong domestic demand for consumer goods propelled a bigger than expected jump in German industrial orders in March, data showed on Thursday in a sign that manufacturers will support a recovery once supply and delivery bottlenecks are overcome.
The German economy, Europe's largest, shrank by 1.7% in the first quarter as restrictions to contain the coronavirus stifled private consumption and chip shortages held back production in the automobile industry.
The data published by the Federal Statistics Offices showed orders for industrial goods 'Made in Germany' jumped on the month by 3% in seasonally adjusted terms.
This easily beat a Reuters forecast of 1.7% and came after an upwardly revised increase of 1.4% in February and a rise of 0.8% in January.
Domestic orders rose by 4.9% in March on the month while foreign bookings increased by 1.6%. The strong increase was driven by an unusually large number of major contracts. Without this effect, orders were up by 1.6%, the office said.
""The demand for German industrial goods is unbroken. This time, however, orders for big-ticket items also helped a lot,"" said Alexander Krueger from Bankhaus Lampe.
""The dilemma remains that orders are distributed faster than processed,"" Krueger said, pointing to the supply and delivery bottlenecks at automakers which have led to production cuts.
Looking at industrial sectors, the increase in the headline figure was mainly driven by strong demand for consumer goods which jumped by 8.5%, the economy ministry said.
Bookings for intermediate goods were up by 2.8% and those for capital goods rose by 2.5%.
Orders were particularly high in the sectors of mechanical engineering, manufacturing of data processing equipment and electronic and optical products, the ministry said.
In a sign that manufacturers are partly overcoming supply bottlenecks with semiconductors and other industrial components, real industrial sales rose by 2% on the month in calendar-adjusted terms, the statistics office said.
This points to an equally solid increase in industrial output for which data is due on Friday and economists forecast a 2.3% increase.
The continued positive trend in incoming orders is laying the foundation for a solid economic recovery in the coming months, Thomas Gitzel from VP Bank said.
""The shortage of materials is slowing down production for the time being, but once the materials are available again in sufficient quantities, there will be strong catch-up effects,"" Gitzel said.

The German government last week lifted its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.5% from 3% previously, counting on a rebound of household spending once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted in the course of the summer.
Still, the Bundesbank's chief economist told Reuters on Friday that he expected the supply bottlenecks in German industry to worsen in the second quarter which could lead to an overall weaker recovery this year.

430,"<span>May 06, 2021 01:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports growth likely lost some momentum in April on moderating overseas demand and the fading base effect of the trade slump seen early last year, while higher commodity prices are expected to have kept a brisk pace of imports.
Exports are expected to have risen 24.1% in April from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 economists, slower than the 30.6% jump in March.
The forecast comes amid concerns recent stellar export growth will face short-term challenges as production in other exporting countries disrupted by the coronavirus resumes.
""The continued recovery in global demand that we expect will mostly benefit services rather than world goods trade, which is already above pre-virus levels,"" said analysts with Capital Economics. ""And China's share of global exports is likely to drop back as vaccines allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns.""
They noted China's export strength concentrated in shipments of electronics, furniture and recreational goods for home use, which have benefited from demand from the pandemic-induced lockdowns. 
Some exporters are also grappling with surging prices of raw materials, which are threatening to drag on profits and deter them from taking on new orders.
In another sign of the weaknesses to come, official factory surveys showed a gauge for new export orders slipped in April from the previous month.
Imports likely rose 42.5% in April versus a year ago, the poll showed, higher than the 38.1% gain in March.
""Import growth may surge in April from March mainly on a very low base, the ongoing domestic demand recovery, higher commodity prices and strong RMB appreciation since late May 2020,"" said analysts with Nomura.

China's trade surplus is expected to be $28.1 billion in April, following a surplus of $13.8 billion in March, the poll showed. The data will be released on Friday.
""Over the medium-term, we expect the downtrend of export growth to continue in coming months and the pace of its slowdown to be more significant in the second half of this year,"" Nomura analysts said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls surged by the most in seven months in April as companies rushed to boost production amid a surge in demand, suggesting the economy gained further momentum early in the second quarter, powered by massive government aid and rising COVID-19 vaccinations.
Strengthening labor market conditions were reinforced by other data on Wednesday showing a measure of services industry employment increased last month by the most in more than 2-1/2 years. The reports bolstered expectations for another month of blockbuster employment growth in April.
""The job market is picking up steam in the spring as consumers are more comfortable going out given vaccinations and stimulus checks,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Private payrolls rose by 742,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since last September, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Companies hired 565,000 workers in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 800,000 jobs in April.
The acceleration in hiring was across the board, with the leisure and hospitality sector adding 237,000 jobs. Manufacturers hired 55,000 workers and payrolls in the construction sector increased by 41,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. It, however, likely understates the pace of job growth. 
Since the recovery from the pandemic started, ADP has underestimated the private payrolls count in the government's more comprehensive, and closely watched, employment report because of methodology differences. 
""The April ADP report is consistent with accelerating job growth, especially because the ADP panel methodology likely undercounts workers returning to their previous employers,"" economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. ""We continue to expect larger gains in the official payroll measure.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.

WORKERS SHORTAGES 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its measure of services industry employment increased to a reading of 58.8 last month, the highest since September 2018, from 57.2 in March. 
The ISM survey suggested that hiring could have been even stronger if not for worker shortages. According to the ISM, businesses in the accommodation and food services industries reported ""competition for labor as more restaurants begin easing their restrictions and returning to normal levels.""
In construction, companies complained that ""finding and retaining labor, skilled and unskilled, is highly challenging and frustrating,"" and that ""as the challenges continue, we are not accepting all the work that we could if we had the labor."" 
Tight labor supply and shortages of inputs led to overall activity in the services industry growing at a slightly slower pace in April. The pandemic has shifted demand towards goods, leading to a shortage of raw materials. 
For a graphic on ISM PMI:

The labor market has improved significantly, with new claims for unemployment benefits dropping to the lowest level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Consumers' perceptions of the labor market are the strongest in 13 months. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 978,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. The Labor Department will publish April's employment report on Friday. But the scarcity of workers across industries could restrain hiring.
""The biggest downside risk to Friday's jobs report is the difficulty employers are having finding workers,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The broadening economic re-engagement is unleashing pent-up demand, which is expected to keep consumer spending robust, after it accelerated sharply in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate last quarter following a 4.3% pace of expansion in the fourth quarter.
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. Americans over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Many states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, are lifting most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7% this year. That would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

""As states increasingly ease mitigation protocols and the U.S. flirts with herd immunity this summer, consumer spending will become less skewed in favor of goods consumption, which will help alleviate shortages of materials,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""Further vaccine progress will reduce fears of contracting and spreading COVID-19, which is holding back some 4 million adults from re-joining the workforce."" 
 
"
432,"<span>May 05, 2021 10:22AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity grew at a slightly slower pace in April, likely restrained by shortages of inputs amid a burst of demand that is being driven by massive fiscal stimulus and a rapidly improving public health environment.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 62.7 last month from 63.7 in March, which was the highest on record.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 64.3 in April.
The findings mirrored the ISM's manufacturing survey published on Monday showing bottlenecks in the supply chain constraining factory activity in April. The economy is experiencing a boom in demand, thanks to the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to all adult Americans.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week the U.S. central bank expected the bottlenecks would be resolved as workers and businesses adapted, adding ""we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy."" The Fed has slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through bond purchases.
Inventories at businesses were drawn down in the first quarter as consumer spending soared. The economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the January-March quarter after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy for growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.
Demand for services could surge in the coming months as vaccinated Americans go on vacations and visit theaters, among other activities. Many states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are lifting most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to 63.2 in April from an all-time high of 67.2 in March. Backlogs of uncompleted work increased strongly, underscoring the impact of the supply constraints. 
Inventories contracted and businesses boosted imports. They continued to pay more for inputs. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 76.8, the highest reading since July 2008, from 74.0 in March.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market continued its rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in April, although a closely-watched survey suggested its progress was slightly weaker than expected.
Payrolls processor ADP said 742,000 people found nonfarm jobs in the private sector last month, the strongest monthly gain since September. The number was some 58,000 below expectations, albeit the previous month’s number was revised up by 48,000 to 565,000.
Net of revisions, the figure is only marginally below consensus forecasts and unlikely to change many market opinions on the pace of the U.S. economy’s recovery.
ADP’s figures come two days before the government’s official labor market report for the month through mid-April, a period in which dozens of states were relaxing restrictions on businesses in response to falling infection rates for Covid-19. Anecdotal reports suggest that the hospitality sector in particular has been quick to rehire. According to ADP, the hospitality accounted for 237,000 of the net jobs added.
At the same time, the Institute of Supply Management’s employment index for the manufacturing sector returned to a level last seen before Donald Trump stepped up his trade war with China in 2018. The ISM’s employment index continued to indicate robust job growth this month, but at a slightly slower pace.
The generally close correlation between ADP numbers and the government's numbers weakened markedly during the pandemic, but the numbers are still widely seen as a good proxy for overall trends in the labor market. The Labor Department is expected to announce on Friday that the economy overall added 978,000 jobs during the month through mid-April, up from 916,000 the previous month.
The Federal Reserve, which has made the labor market the labor market recovery the most important factor in its formulation of monetary policy, estimates that the economy is still currently more than eight million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.
""ADP has tended to understate the official payroll numbers since the middle of last year, so this reading is consistent with a headline number Friday of about 1.1 million,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note to clients. ""That would be a welcome uptick from the 916K increase in March, but the best is yet to come; we look for much bigger gains in May and - especially - June and July, by which point we expect the whole economy to be fully open."""

The jobless rate fell to 4.7% from 4.9% in the fourth quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday in Wellington. Economists expected 4.9%. Employment rose 0.6% from the previous three months, twice the 0.3% median forecast.
New Zealand business confidence rebounded in late 2020 after a V-shaped economic recovery, encouraging firms to hire more workers. While the jobless rate never hit the highs feared when the Covid-19 pandemic first hit, it is well short of the 4% levels attained in 2019. This adds to signs that the central bank will want to keep providing stimulus to the economy for some time.
The kiwi dollar jumped after the report. It bought 71.67 U.S. cents at 10:56 a.m. in Wellington from 71.50 cents immediately before the release.
The Reserve Bank, which is required to support maximum employment as well as stable inflation, has said it will require considerable time and patience to deliver those objectives.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a record high in March amid roaring domestic demand, which is drawing in imports, and the gap could widen further as the nation's economic activity rebounds faster than its global rivals.
Manufacturers lack the capacity to satisfy the surge in demand because of resource constraints and bottlenecks in the supply chain. Inventories are very lean. Demand is being driven by a rapidly improving public health situation and massive government aid to households and businesses to cushion the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The widening of the trade gap will likely be a persistent feature of the economy this year as domestic demand outstrips the U.S. economy's productive capacity,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
The trade deficit increased 5.6% to an all-time high of $74.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The trade gap was in line with economists' expectations. 
Imports soared 6.3% to a historic $274.5 billion in March. Goods imports shot up 7.0% to $234.4 billion, also an all-time high. Imports of consumer goods were the highest on record, as were those for food and capital goods. 
The nation imported a range of goods including apparel, furniture, toys, semiconductors, motor vehicles, petroleum products and telecommunications equipment. But imports of civilian aircraft and cellphones fell. 
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. Americans over the age of 16 years are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Demand during the pandemic shifted to goods from services, with Americans cooped up at home. The economic boom is also being boosted by the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
EXPORTS GAIN GROUND
The bulk of imports in March came from China, boosting the politically-sensitive goods trade deficit with Beijing to $27.69 billion from $24.62 billion in February, reversing a tariffs-driven improvement during the Trump administration.
""The widening in the trade balance with China over the last few months has erased the tightening that occurred over 2019 as a result of tariffs,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Imports from Mexico hit a record high in March, as did those from South Korea. 
Exports accelerated in March, but continued to lag the growth in imports. Exports surged 6.6% to $200.0 billion. Exports of goods vaulted 8.9% to $142.9 billion. 
They were led by industrial supplies and materials and capital and consumer goods. The pandemic remained a drag on trade services, especially travel. At $17.1 billion in March, the services surplus was the smallest since August 2012. 
Exports are expected to pick up later this year as global economic growth gains steam, allowing foreigners to buy more American goods. The resumption of international travel and in-person learning at U.S. universities in the fall is likely to result in an improvement in services trade.
""As vaccinations gain more momentum abroad and the global recovery gains pace, trade should begin to normalize,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Export growth should begin to rival import growth, which will remain supported by a surge in domestic consumer and business demand.""
Robust demand is boosting manufacturing. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed factory orders increased 1.1% in March after falling 0.5% in February. Business spending on equipment was also stronger than initially thought. 
Despite the widening of the trade deficit, the economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, the second-fastest gross domestic product growth pace since the third quarter of 2003, fueled by pent-up domestic demand. That followed a 4.3% growth pace in the fourth quarter. 

Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7% in 2021, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.
""The U.S. economy is poised to re-emerge from the pandemic early and forcefully thanks to a swift vaccination campaign,"" said Evan Karson, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Overall, companies based in Europe's largest economy have a greatly improved view of how business is going, the survey found, with 45% saying it was going well and only 14% saying it was going badly. Just over half expect business conditions to improve over the next 12 months.
The main tailwind is coming from problems in the supply chain: 40% of internationally active companies report problems obtaining components, a 9 percentage-point rise from last autumn.

""Over recent months, production outages and problems with shipping and a shortage of containers has led to disruptions in world trade,"" the Chambers of Commerce said. ""That has raised transport costs and lengthened delivery times.""
Some 71% of companies were planning changes to their supply chains in order to tackle this problem, the survey found.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders increased 1.1% in March after falling 0.5% in February. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rebounding 1.3%. Orders rose 6.6% on a year-on-year basis.
The White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to all adult Americans have led to a boom in demand, which is pushing against supply constraints. 
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in April, restrained by shortages of inputs. Robust consumer spending helped to lift gross domestic product growth at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, which followed a 4.3% growth pace in the final three months of 2020.
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years. 
Factory goods orders in March were boosted by strong demand for machinery, motor vehicles, fabricated and primary metal products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components decreased. Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.4% after surging 0.9% in February.

The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, jumped 1.2% in March instead of increasing 0.9% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 1.6%. They were previously reported to have rebounded 1.3% in March. Business spending on equipment recorded a third straight quarter of double-digit growth in the first quarter.

Inflation rose to 2.3% in April, data from the statistics office showed Tuesday, rapidly increasing from the 1.5% gain in March. Economists expected consumer prices to rise 2.1% from a year earlier.
The inflation boost was driven by rising commodity and energy prices, which had plunged during the same period a year earlier when the pandemic spread across the world. Rising consumer demand and confidence amid an economic recovery are also favorable for prices.

The availability rate for office space in Manhattan rose for the 11th consecutive month in April to a record 16.5%, according to Colliers International. Availability above 10% on the island is considered a renter's market.
Leasing activity in Manhattan decreased 46% from March and was 75% lower from the monthly average in the banner year of 2019, suggesting the market still has a long way to recover.
In a sign of a market potentially on the mend, available sublet space, now representing almost 24% of all available space, fell for the first time since May 2020. When sublet space surpasses 25% of all available space, it is considered a glut.
""It’s difficult to draw any long-term trends with one month of data,"" said Frank Wallach, senior research director in New York at Colliers. ""April began to show early inklings of a possible thaw in the wave of sublet space.""
Despite the glimmer of an uptick, other data showed a market still in the grip of the pandemic.
The average asking rent in Manhattan decreased 0.4% to $72.97 a square foot, the lowest since December 2017. Since the downturn began in March 2020, the average has fallen by 8.2%.

Only one lease was for more than 100,000 square feet, a transaction for 109,000 square feet (10,126 square meters) leased by software company Schrödinger's at 1540 Broadway.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in April, restrained by shortages of inputs as rising vaccinations against COVID-19 and massive fiscal stimulus unleashed pent-up demand.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed record-long lead times, wide-scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products across industries. 
The pandemic, now in its second year, has severely disrupted supply chains. The ISM noted that ""companies and suppliers continue to struggle to meet increasing rates of demand due to coronavirus impacts limiting availability of parts and materials."" It cautioned that worker absenteeism, short-term shutdowns due to part shortages and difficulties in filling open positions could limit manufacturing's growth potential.
""Manufacturing is struggling to keep up with roaring demand,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 60.7 last month after surging to 64.7 in March, which was the highest level since December 1983. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to 65 in April.
The White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to all adult Americans have led to a boom in demand, which is pushing against supply constraints. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week the U.S. central bank expected the bottlenecks would be resolved as workers and businesses adapted and ""we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy.""
Inventories at factories and customers are extremely lean, which should keep production humming.
""There is little reason to think conditions are softening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
U.S. stocks rose as upbeat earnings strengthened hopes for sustained profit growth for companies. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

""CRAZY HIGH"" STEEL PRICES 
All 18 manufacturing industries continued to expand in April, with furniture manufacturers reporting that ""market capacity in most areas is oversold"" and expected that ""demand will continue to strengthen, leading to more significant disruptions."" In the plastics and rubber products sector lead times were the longest in 35 years for some factories.
Manufacturers also complained about steel prices, which makers of fabricated metal products described as ""crazy high."" Imported steel prices have been boosted by tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump to protect domestic industries from what he said was unfair competition.
Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers reported ""it's getting much more difficult to supply production with materials that are made with copper or steel,"" noting ""lots of work on the floor.""
In the automobile industry, a global semiconductor chip shortage has forced cuts in production. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said last week the scarcity of chips slashed production in half in its second quarter. Technology companies are also feeling the heat. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned last week that the chip shortage could dent iPads and Mac sales by several billion dollars. 
Demand for goods like motor vehicles and electronics has surged during the pandemic as Americans shunned public transportation and millions worked from home and took classes remotely. Robust consumer spending helped to lift gross domestic product growth at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter.
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers rose last month to the highest reading since July 2008, when the economy was in the midst of the Great Recession. That bolsters expectations for higher inflation this year.
""Yet unlike in 2008, demand is far from wavering,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That has put manufacturers in a better position to pass on costs than see their margins squeezed."" 
The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to 64.3 after racing to 68.0 in March, which was the highest reading since January 2004. 
Backlogs of uncompleted work increased as did export orders. Manufacturers started drawing down on inventories last month to meet demand. Business warehouses are almost bare.
The survey's manufacturing employment gauge fell to 55.1 after shooting up to 59.6 in March, which was the highest reading since February 2018. The index was well below the 61.5 forecast in the Reuters poll, with the slowdown in hiring probably due to a scarcity of workers. 
Companies across many industries are struggling to find workers, even as employment is 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. The worker shortage could hurt expectations for another month of blockbuster job growth in April. 
According to an early Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 980,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. The government is due to publish April's employment report on Friday. 
A separate report on Monday from the Commerce Department showed construction spending gained 0.2% in March after falling 0.6% in February.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone factory activity growth surged to a record high in April, boosted by burgeoning demand and driving a rise in hiring, although supply constraints led to an unprecedented rise in unfulfilled orders, a survey showed.
While a third wave of coronavirus infections in Europe has forced some governments to shutter much of their dominant service industries, factories have largely remained open.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 62.9 in April from March's 62.5, albeit below the initial 63.3 ""flash"" estimate but the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and that is seen as a good guide to economic health, edged down from March's record high of 63.3 to 63.2. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The euro zone was late out of the gates in terms of its economic rebound but it does seem to be starting. Looking at where we are now the numbers are encouraging,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""It is a foregone conclusion that Q2 will be much stronger than Q1 was.""
The backlogs of work index soared to 61.5 from 60.4, a survey high.
French manufacturing growth eased off a little from March's peak as bottlenecks weighed on the recovery but Italian factory activity grew at its fastest rate on record, sister surveys showed.
German factories have been humming along during the pandemic, almost undisturbed by the related lockdowns, and activity accelerated in Europe's biggest economy early this year on strong demand from the United States and China.
Its latest PMI was only just below March's high at 66.4.
China's factory activity growth slowed and missed forecasts as supply bottlenecks and rising costs weighed on production, a survey showed on Friday, while figures due later on Monday are expected to show an acceleration in U.S. factory growth.

COST PRESSURES
With the cost of raw materials rising at a near record pace, factories were forced to raise their own prices at the sharpest pace since IHS Markit began collecting the data.
""There has been an increase in cost pressures, mainly for manufacturers. Inputs ranging from energy prices to commodity prices are rising and shortages in all sorts of parts of the economy are starting to have an impact on prices,"" Colijn said.

""It does look like that will start to have an impact on goods inflation over the course of this year.""
Inflationary pressures might be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who have not managed to get inflation anywhere near their goal despite ultra-loose monetary policy.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed total job ads grew 4.7% in April from March, when they rose 7.8%.
At 196,612, ads were at their highest level since 2008 and up almost 200% on a year earlier when a pandemic lockdown shut many industries.
ANZ senior economist, Catherine Birch, said the strength of ads was welcome given the ending of the government's JobKeeper support programme could see 100,000-150,000 out of work.
""We've also seen almost 160,000 additional people employed over the past two months,"" said Birch. ""Strong labour demand should mean that many, but not all, will be able to find work elsewhere relatively quickly.""
Unemployment has fallen much quicker than policy makers expected to hit 5.6% in March, down from a pandemic peak of 7.5% reached in July last year.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth and inflation after years of tepid gains.

Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Monday showed national home prices climbed 1.8% in April, after a 2.8% jump in March that had been the largest gain in 32 years. Prices were up 7.8% on last year, and 6.8% in just the three months to April.
Sydney prices raced up 2.4% in April, while Melbourne added 1.3%, Brisbane 1.7% and Perth 0.8%.
The red-hot market has provided a much-needed windfall to consumer wealth and confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of homes rose A$258 billion in the December quarter to hit A$7.7 trillion, and that was before the latest surge.
Still, CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless, said the pace of gains could slow as inventory levels rise and affordability becomes a bigger constraint.
""With housing prices rising faster than incomes, it's likely price sensitive sectors of the market, such as first home buyers and lower income households, are finding it harder to save for a deposit and transactional costs,"" Lawless said.
The trend toward houses continued with prices in the capital cities up 8.6% in the first four months of the year, twice the gain for apartments. 
Demand for property outside the cities saw regional prices jump a record 1.9% in April, giving an annual rise of 13%.

Buyers have been encouraged by the outlook for borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia repeatedly saying rates were likely to remain at a historic low of 0.1% until at least 2024.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.23% in April from a month earlier, up marginally from 0.2% in March, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
The strength was mainly contributed by tier-2 and 3 cities in the eastern and southern coastal regions. Monthly new home price growth in 10 major cities including Beijing and Shanghai cooled slightly last month, the data showed, as waves of stringent curbs took some heat out of the market.
""In Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, as core cities instituted tighter restrictions, the demand is now flowing into nearby tier-3 and 4 cities with a large population base and promising industries,"" said China Index Academy Research Director Cao Jingjing.
Price growth in second-hand homes, a market more opaque and less regulated than the new home sector, quickened to 0.5% in April from previous month, compared with 0.44% in March.
The month saw authorities in a dozen of cities intensifying their campaign to drive speculators out of the property market, taking more targeted steps like capping sales prices set by developers and preventing some real estate agencies from setting excessively high second-hand home prices. 
China's top leaders on Friday also vowed to boost the supply of rental housing and affordable public housing, and prevent speculation in various property markets including school district homes.

Separately, another survey by Chinese property data provider Zhuge House Hunter showed growth in China's average home rental prices quickened in April at the fastest pace since February 2020, driven by rising demand in first-tier cities as the country's economy steadily recovered from the coronavirus shock last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rebounded in March amid a surge in income as households received additional COVID-19 pandemic relief money from the government, building a strong foundation for a further acceleration in consumption in the second quarter.
Other data on Friday showed labor costs jumped by the most in 14 years in the first quarter, driven by a pick-up in wage growth as companies competed for workers to boost production. The White House's massive $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health are unleashing pent-up demand.
""While we aren't completely out of the woods yet, today's report shows the beginning of an economic rebound,"" said Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking at Citizens in Boston. ""Assuming no setback in the continued rollout of the vaccines, U.S. consumers are well-positioned in the second half of the year to stimulate strong economic growth across the country.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 4.2% last month after falling 1.0% in February, the Commerce Department said. The increase was broadly in line with economists' expectations.
The data was included in Thursday's gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which showed growth shooting up at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year after rising at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending powered ahead at a 10.7% rate last quarter.
Most Americans in the middle- and low-income brackets received one-time $1,400 stimulus checks last month which were part of the pandemic rescue package approved in March. That boosted personal income 21.1% after a drop of 7.0% in February. 
A chunk of the cash was stashed away, with the saving rate soaring to 27.6% from 13.9% in February. Households have amassed at least $2.2 trillion in excess savings, which could provide a powerful tailwind for consumer spending this year and beyond.
The government's generosity and expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to include all American adults is lifting consumer spirits, with a measure of household sentiment rising to a 13-month high in April.
Wages are also increasing, which should to help to underpin spending when stimulus boost fades.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, jumped 0.9% in the first quarter. That was the largest rise since the second quarter of 2007.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Last quarter's increase was driven by a 1.0% rise in wages, also the biggest gain in 14 years.
Wages in the accommodation and food services industry, hardest hit by the pandemic, soared 1.7%.
Despite employment being 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, businesses are struggling to find qualified workers as they rush to meet the robust domestic demand.
U.S. stocks were lower after a recent rally. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
INFLATION RISING
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the worker shortage saying ""one big factor would be schools aren't open yet, so there's still people who are at home taking care of their children, and would like to be back in the workforce, but can't be yet."" 
Economists agree and expect the rising wages to contribute to higher inflation this year. 
The strengthening demand and the dropping of last year's weak readings from the calculation lifted inflation last month. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component increased 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in February. In the 12 months through March, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.8%, the most since February 2020. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, which is a flexible average. 
Powell reiterated on Wednesday that he expected higher inflation will transitory. But some economists have doubts.
""While labor costs are hardly getting out of hand, there is clearly more wage pressure in the economy at present than the early stages of the past cycle,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""Stronger labor cost growth even before the economy hits full employment is a reason to think that even after the reopening-fueled pop this year, inflation is likely to settle above the anemic rate of the past cycle.""
Households last month spent more on motor vehicles and recreational. They also visited restaurants. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rebounded 3.6% last month after falling 1.2% in February. The rebound in the so-called real consumer spending sets consumption on a higher growth trajectory heading into the second quarter.

Most economists expect double-digit growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, jumped 0.9% last quarter after gaining 0.7% in the October-December quarter. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.6% from 2.5% in the fourth quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI rising 0.7% in the first quarter.
Wages and salaries shot up 1.0% after advancing 0.8% in the fourth quarter. They were up 2.7% year-on-year. Economists expect wages will increase further in the second quarter as companies compete for scarce workers. 
Despite employment being 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, businesses are struggling to find suitable workers as they rush to meet robust domestic demand. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the worker shortage saying ""one big factor would be schools aren't open yet, so there's still people who are at home taking care of their children, and would like to be back in the workforce, but can't be yet.""

As the coronavirus wreaked havoc on the global economy, global FDI flows dropped 38% in 2020 to $846 billion, the lowest level since 2005, according to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
That represented only 1% of global gross domestic product, a level not seen since 1999.
A recovery in cross-border mergers and acquisitions activity in the latter part of 2020 and so far this year could fuel a rebound in FDI in 2021, the OECD said.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro contracted 0.6% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.8% year-on-year fall.
This put the single currency area in a technical recession after a 0.7% quarterly GDP fall in the last quarter of 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.8% quarterly and a 2.0% annual decline. 
The euro zone's first quarter contraction was mainly caused by a 1.7% quarterly slump in its biggest economy Germany, though mitigated by 0.4% quarterly growth in second biggest France.
Separately, Eurostat estimated euro zone consumer prices rose 0.6% month-on-month in April for a 1.6% year-on-year gain, as expected by economists polled by Reuters. 
The rise was mainly caused by a 10.3% year-on-year surge in energy prices, which offset the 0.4% year-on-year fall in the costs of unprocessed food.
Without these two most volatile components, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices rose 0.5% month-on-month for a 0.8% year-on-year increase, a deceleration from the 1.0% year-on-year core inflation rate the month before.
The core inflation drop reinforces calls by European Central Bank doves to maintain the stimulus to the economy and hold off on tapering the pandemic bond purchases until the growth rebound fully materialises. 

Eurostat also said that euro zone unemployment fell in March to 8.1% of the workforce, or to 13.166 million people, from a downwardly revised 8.2% in February or 13.375 million people, defying expectations of a rise to 8.3%.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a decade in the first three months of 2021 as the ""work from home"" boom sparked strong global demand for the island's hi-tech exports. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 8.16% in January-March from a year earlier, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Friday, up from the fourth quarter's 5.09% rise. The reading was well above the 6.1% increase forecast in a Reuters poll and was the fastest pace since growth of 11.54% in the third quarter of 2010.
Compared with the fourth quarter, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth was 12.93% in the first quarter. The government attributed the strong growth to surging demand for electronics, driven by new technologies such as 5G and by people working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Total exports rose 24.58% in the first quarter year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, while exports of electronics components rose 28.37% and those of communication and audio-visual products leapt 29.67%, the agency said.
""Demand for 5G and high-performance computing continues to increase, and orders for communications and electronic products are booming,"" it added.
Statistics official Wu Pei-hsuan said exports and investment numbers were far better than expected, saying it wasn't only chip firms expanding their production but sectors like petrochemicals. too.
Domestic consumption also performed well, Wu added.
Revised GDP figures, including growth estimates for the full year, will be released later in May.
Capital Economics increased its growth forecast for this year to 8% from the previous 5% after the data was published. The tech-powerhouse island, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), has benefited from global demand for smartphones, tablets and computers from people forced to study and work from home in large parts of the world.

A global shortage of chips for everything from cars to consumer electronics has also bolstered demand for made-in-Taiwan semiconductors, where producers are busy expanding capacity.

""The coronavirus crisis caused another decline in economic performance at the beginning of 2021,"" the Federal Statistics Office said. ""This affected household consumption in particular, while exports of goods supported the economy."" A Reuters poll had pointed to a first-quarter contraction of 1.5%.
The economy had expanded by an upwardly revised 0.5% in the last three months of last year as strong demand for German goods from China and the United States help the manufacturing sector offset headwinds created by subdued consumption.
Economists said that equation failed to materialise in the first three months of the year as the manufacturing sector is facing its own challenges in the form of production capacity problems and chip shortages affecting the automotive sector.

""Until now industry had compensated for losses in the services sector,"" Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank Group wrote in a note. ""This is no longer the case. Industry suffered and is suffering from a shortage of material.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British house prices jumped by 2.1% in April, their biggest monthly rise in more than 17 years, after finance minister Rishi Sunak unexpectedly extended a tax break on property sales, mortgage lender Nationwide said on Friday.
House prices are now 7.1% above their level last April, a growth rate which is just shy of the six-year high of 7.3% recorded in December, as COVID-19 lockdowns and increased home-working continue to boost demand for more spacious housing.
""Just as expectations of the end of the stamp duty holiday led to a slowdown in house price growth in March, so the extension of the stamp duty holiday in the Budget prompted a reacceleration in April,"" Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said.
The tax break had been due to expire at the end of March. But the first 500,000 pounds ($697,050) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland will now remain exempt from stamp duty land tax until the end of June, and there will be a 250,000 pound tax-free allowance until the end of September.
Sunak introduced the tax break in July last year, in a bid to kick-start the housing market after a collapse in home sales during the initial months of the pandemic.
Demand surged when restrictions eased. Many buyers sought bigger homes further away from city centres, as they began to work from home rather than commute into an office.
The most recent data from the Office for National Statistics, as opposed to Nationwide numbers, shows that house prices in February were 8.4% above their level a year earlier, the largest annual rise since 2014.
Nationwide said there was scope for house prices to rise further in the coming months due to a fairly fixed supply of housing and a continued desire to move as a result of the pandemic, which reduced demand for small city-centre homes.
But Gardner said activity could slow later this year, perhaps sharply, if unemployment increased as expected.
Howard Archer, economist at consultants EY ITEM Club, forecast that annual price growth would tail off towards the end of the year and that prices could fall on a quarterly basis.

""We believe the strength of the housing market is excessive relative to the economic fundamentals, and the level of prices increases will ultimately prove unsustainable,"" he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Ishwinder Kaur and her husband spent more than two years looking to buy their first home in Singapore, hoping property prices would dip during the hunt.
The couple finally bought their apartment in December after prices rose in all but one quarter last year, even as the city state posted its worst recession during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""We got really worried because we saw that people were snapping up homes left, right and centre,"" said Kaur. 
House prices rose again in the first quarter, with the private home market up 3.3%, its steepest rise in nearly three years, fueling expectations the government is likely to intervene soon to calm the market. 
(Graphic: Singapore home prices rising - https://graphics.reuters.com/SINGAPORE-PROPERTY/SINGAPORE-PROPERTY/qzjvqzrnopx/Singapore%20private%20home%20prices%202021.JPG)
Driven by low interest rates, confidence in property's long-term safety and a fear of missing out, the boom is putting buyers increasingly at odds with the government, which has been warning that purchasers should exercise caution.
Authorities in Singapore, where real estate is a safe haven investment for wealthy foreigners, keep close tabs on property prices to ensure housing remains affordable for locals and stays in step with economic fundamentals.
They began advising prudence late last year, with Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam warning again in April that home buyers should exercise caution given the risk of rising interest rates. Instead, some buyers are trying to get ahead of any intervention, further driving up sales. 
""Considering that only property value seems to be growing steadily, and extra stamp duties may kick in soon to cool the market, it is better to invest in a new house at this time,"" said sales engineer Faye Zhou, who is looking for a condominium.
Government tools to cool the market include boosting stamp duties on foreign buyers and investors with multiple homes, or increasing the proportion of downpayments. It can also increase land supply through tenders.
Private home prices fell 11.6% from a 2013 peak over a span of 15 quarters after the government took steps to curb a housing market boom as Singapore emerged from the global financial crisis.
The government last tightened curbs in 2018 after prices rose about 9% over a year and analysts expect it to act again as the city-state's economic recovery from the pandemic is uneven and near-term wage growth remains muted.
Foreign demand is also returning, according to property consultants OrangeTee, helping boost sales of luxury homes to their highest since the third quarter of 2017.
Total transactions in the first quarter nearly doubled from a year ago, touching their highest in at least two years.
The housing loan booking at DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY), Singapore's biggest bank, has been at record levels. 
""Some of it is because of people's view that you might see some cooling measures. So people are trying to get ahead of that,"" CEO Piyush Gupta said in the bank's results call with reporters.
INVENTORY SQUEEZE
Further out, supply is set to tighten in both the private and public housing markets due to pandemic-driven delays in construction.
The inventory of uncompleted homes with developers is dwindling and had fallen by 40% as of the first quarter compared with two years ago.
Developers will likely seek to acquire land to replenish their inventories, either sites from the government or existing apartments blocks that can redeveloped. Analysts expect intense competition for land, which may, in turn fuel further price rises. 
Property in land-scarce Singapore has long attracted the super-rich from around Asia, with political uncertainty in rival Hong Kong helping boost that appeal.
And even if prices fall in the near-term from recent highs, buyers are confident they will not stay low forever. 

""Property prices in Singapore will certainly still grow steadily in the long term ... there's limited land but more people are coming into Singapore,"" said Sky Chen, a 30-year-old architect who bought his apartment in November.

The country's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.1 in April from 51.9 in March, data from the national Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis but was below the 51.7 expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""Some surveyed companies report that problems such as chip shortages, problems in international logistics, a shortage of containers, and rising freight rates are still severe,"" NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement accompanying the official PMI.
That contrasted with a private-sector survey, also released on Friday, which showed factory activity in April expanded at the fastest pace in four months although businesses in that release also reported a sharp surge in input costs.
""With the economy already above its pre-virus trend and the policy stance less supportive, growth momentum will wane this year,"" analysts from Capital Economics said in a note on the PMI.
China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter of the year with record growth of 18.3%, shaking off the hit from last year's COVID-19-induced slump. Analysts now expect the world's second-largest economy to grow 8.6% in 2021.
The robust economic recovery has outpaced rebounds seen in manufacturing competitors such as India, which are still struggling to contain new waves of coronavirus outbreaks.
Policymakers in Beijing have signalled they are keen to avoid sudden policy changes that could derail the recovery.
""We expect that an export demand recovery will help factory orders and that the May holiday will help the services sector,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, in a note, referring to China's labour day vacation due to start on Saturday.
Overseas demand should also pick up as COVID-19 is brought under control in major markets like the United States and Europe, she said, but chip shortages could continue for several quarters and push up prices of electronic goods.
From delayed car deliveries to a supply shortfall in home appliances, businesses and consumers across the globe are facing the brunt of an unprecedented shortage in semiconductor microchips, exacerbated by sanctions against Chinese tech companies.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed businesses again laid off workers in April after increasing hiring the month before for the first time in nearly a year. A sub-index for employment slipped to 49.6 from 50.1 in March.
A gauge for new export orders stood at 50.4 in April, slipping from 51.2 a month earlier.
Riding the broader economic recovery, surging demand for raw materials fuelled Chinese industrial firms' robust profit growth in March as profits upstream outperformed those in downstream sectors.

A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 66.9 in April, easing from March's 69.4 but maintaining a rapid clip.
In the services sector, activity expanded for the 14th straight month, but at a slower pace, dragged down by a sub-index for construction activity.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4% in the first three months of the year from the fourth quarter, when it had shrunk 1.4%, the INSEE stats agency said.
That compared with an average forecast of 0.1% growth in a Reuters poll of 33 economists' expectations, which ranged from 1.0% to -1.3%.
The government progressively tightened curbs during the first quarter and France entered a third national lockdown at the end of March as infections spiked and pressure on hospitals increased.
Consumer spending grew 0.3% in the quarter despite the measures, recovering from a 5.7% slump in the fourth quarter, when France faced a month-long national lockdown in November.
Business investment proved particularly strong, gaining 2.2% in the quarter, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter.
While domestic demand added 0.9% percentage points to the growth rate, a slump in exports meant that foreign trade represented a 0.4% drag, INSEE said.
Under pressure from business and a weary public, President Emmanuel Macron announced a four-phase plan on Wednesday to wind down the current lockdown.
In particular, France will start relaxing a nightly curfew and allow cafes, bars and restaurants to offer outside service from May 19.

The lockdown has had less impact than in the past on the economy, with business and consumer sentiment surveys largely holding up and even improving in the industrial sector.

Investing.com – China’s manufacturing activity accelerated at a slower-than-expected pace in April, indicating the economy continues to recover but at a slower pace on the back of strong demand.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day said that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for April was 51.1, lower than both the 51.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 51.9 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 54.9, also below its March reading of 56.3. However, both remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
In the private sector, the Caixin manufacturing PMI for April was 51.9, above the 50.8 in forecasts prepare by Investing.com and March’s 50.6 reading. Investors now await the Caixin services PMI, due in the following week.
The figures showed “China’s economy continued to recover steadily,"" but “some surveyed companies said problems such as chip shortages, poor international logistics, shortages of containers, and rising freight rates are still serious,” NBS economist Zhao Qinghe said in a note.
The note added that a slowdown in manufacturing supply and demand, as well as rising cost pressures, also remain as challenges.
Meanwhile, stronger consumer confidence is boosting services industries as the country lifted travel restrictions earlier in the year.
On the construction side, however, the outlook is more complicated as the government eased debt sales to finance infrastructure projects. It also approved fewer fixed-asset projects which dropped sharply in the first quarter compared with 2020. The real estate market is also facing stricter financing rules.
The “services PMI slowed more than manufacturing PMI due to deleveraging reform in the real estate sector, and this will continue,” Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank NV in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg.
However, she projected a rebound due to a five-day holiday starting Saturday.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japanese industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in March, higher than the 2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 1.3% contraction. The Tokyo core Consumer Price Index contracted 0.2% year-on-year in April, as per expectations but lower than March’s 0.1% contraction."

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.9 in April from an 11-month low of 50.6 in March, beating analyst expectations for a smaller uptick to 50.8. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
That contrasted with China's official PMI on Friday, which showed factory activity expanding at a slower-than-expected pace in April.
Both output and new orders increased at the fastest pace this year, the survey showed, while overseas demand improved. Manufacturers also increased their staffing levels for the first time in five months.
But the private survey showed factories reported a sharp increase in input costs, which surged at their fastest clip since 2017. Some pressure was passed onto customers as output prices continued to rise, although at a slower pace than the month before.
""Raw material prices kept pushing up manufacturers' costs. The prices of industrial metals — especially steel — and chemical raw materials continued to surge,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
""Rising raw material prices and imported inflation are expected to limit policy choices and become a major obstacle to the sustained economic recovery.""
Earlier in April, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stressed the need to strengthen market regulation of raw materials to ease the cost pressure on enterprises amid rising global commodities prices, China's official Xinhua news agency reported. 
China's factory gate prices rose 4.4% in annual terms last month, at their fastest pace since July 2018. April data will be released on May 11.
Firms' outlook for the year ahead edged down but remained highly optimistic due to hopes of an end to the pandemic and the release of more demand, the survey showed.
The Caixin survey focuses on small, private and export-oriented firms while the official survey, also released on Friday, typically polls large and state-owned manufacturers.
Beijing has successfully curbed the domestic transmission of the COVID-19 virus, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back as life returns to normal.
Economic growth quickened sharply in the first quarter to a record 18.3%, driven by stronger demand at home and abroad and supported by a low comparison base the previous year due to COVID-19 disruptions.

China has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, which is lower than the analyst consensus but makes allowances for uncertainties. Premier Li Keqiang has warned against any sharp turn in policymaking.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output posted a surprise increase in March, as a jump in car production helped keep an economic recovery from last year's deep coronavirus slump on track.
The output rise will likely ease worries about the impact the health crisis is having on the manufacturing sector in the world's third-largest economy, which is recovering thanks to strong overseas demand, especially from China.
Separate data showed the jobless rate fell from the previous month in a sign of strength in employment conditions, while Tokyo consumer prices fell unexpectedly in April due to cuts in mobile phone fees by major carriers.
Government data released on Friday showed factory output grew 2.2% from the previous month in March, lifted by a sharp jump in car production and higher output of organic and inorganic chemicals.
The output rise, a reversal from the previous month's 1.3% decline, was much better than a 2.0% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
""The worry is whether this trend can continue,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""It is necessary to pay attention to whether reduced demand is putting downward pressure on future output as a state of emergency has been declared in Tokyo and Osaka.""
The data showed manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to rise another 8.4% in April, followed by a 4.3% decrease in May.
Factory output had dropped in February as weakening production across sectors such as cars and electrical machinery outweighed better demand for tech-making equipment that has been a major output driver.
Japan's economy is expected to take a hit from a third state of emergency for Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures called by the government last week in response to a resurgence of COVID-19 infections.
The measures, which are scheduled to last until May 11, are expected to especially hurt the services sector as households are seen cutting down on travel, leisure and dining out activities, likely signalling a domestic demand slowdown.
DIVERGENCE
Japan's factory activity expanded in April at the fastest pace since early 2018, a separate private sector survey showed on Friday, underlining the tailwind manufacturers have been getting from strong global demand.
The country's economy has emerged from last year's deep recession on strong exports, though a slow vaccine rollout and repeated emergency measures called in response to an infection resurgence have hurt consumption.
A growing divergence between manufacturers profiting from a global economic recovery and service sector firms facing tepid consumption at home is posing a challenge for policymakers.
""The divergence will likely continue this year,"" said Sera. ""At its earliest, it may take until the middle of next year for the economy to recover to pre-coronavirus levels.""
Other official data out on Friday showed the country's seasonally adjusted jobless rate fell to 2.6% in March, beating the median estimate of 2.9%.
The labour ministry said the jobs-to-applicants ratio was 1.10 in March, up from 1.09 in the previous month and also above a Reuters poll forecast of 1.09.

Government data on Friday also showed Tokyo's core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food, dropped 0.2% in April due to the mobile phone fee cuts, making the central bank's 2% inflation target increasingly out of reach.

The activity expansion highlights the tailwind manufacturers have been getting from strong external demand, particularly from China, which forms the basis for keeping intact the economic recovery from last year's steep coronavirus drop.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.6 in April, its most robust expansion since February 2018.
That was up from a flash reading of 53.3 and the previous month's final of 52.7. It meant manufacturing activity came in above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the third straight month.
The PMI survey showed output also grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, while the taking on of new graduates at the start of the country's fiscal year in April and higher capacity needs due to increased orders boosted the rate of job creation.
Manufacturers saw input prices rising for an 11th month on high demand for intermediate goods used for producing cars and electronics, with the rate of input cost inflation coming in at its fastest since late 2018.
Businesses reported a positive medium-term activity outlook, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. 
It was too early to say exactly what impact a third state of emergency for Tokyo and other prefectures declared last week to contain the pandemic would have on manufacturers in the months ahead.
The survey showed firms' output expectations for the year ahead were in line with an IHS Markit forecast for 7.7% industrial production growth this year, Bhatti said.
""This does not fully recover the output lost to the pandemic in 2020,"" he said.

""Further disruption to the manufacturing sector cannot be ruled out as COVID-19 restrictions are reintroduced as infections rise once again.""

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy strengthened in the first quarter of 2021, as Covid-19-related lockdowns started to ease, allowing a partial recovery to take hold. 
Government data released on Thursday showed gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 6.4% in the first quarter, up from 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and faster than consensus forecasts of a 6.1% rate.
The acceleration was due in large measure to the $1.9 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress earlier in the year that distributed a new round of stimulus checks to households. Real consumer spending grew at an annualized result of 10.7% as a result.
More up-to-date checks on the state of the economy also showed steady progress, with initial claims for jobless benefits inching down to a new post-pandemic low of 553,000 last week. However, the previous week's number was revised up by nearly 20,000 to 566,000. Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, were effectively flat at 3.660 million.
The dollar and 10-Year Treasury yields ticked down on the news, as the market zeroed in on a below-forecast reading for a data series that is the Federal Reserve's favored metric for inflation. Core personal consumer expenditures, which track changes in consumer spending patterns more quickly than the official consumer price inflation index, rose at an annual rate of only 2.3% in the quarter, slightly below the 2.4% consensus. 
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had batted away concerns that loose monetary policy and a strong economic rebound could soon lead to runaway inflation, saying that the current rise in prices and the factors behind it were ""transitory"".
Powell stressed again at his press conference that the economy ""is still some way"" from the Fed's goal of full employment, as he again shunned invitations to speculate on when the central bank will start to tighten its policy. 
That focus on the labor market was reflected in Labor Department figures that showed a total of over 16 million people still claiming unemployment-related benefits under various state and federal programs. However, the pattern of progress was repeated again last week, with the number of total claimants dropping by nearly 846,000.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Euro zone economic sentiment surged in April as vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus gathered speed, with sharp gains across all sectors of the economy that economists said marked the end of the pandemic-induced recession.
The European Commission's monthly sentiment survey for the 19 countries sharing the euro on Thursday showed optimism rising to 110.3 points in April from 100.9 in March, beating consensus estimates in a Reuters poll of a 102.2 reading.
""The services sector now also in expansion mode. We can now declare the Covid-19 recession over. Inflation expectations also continue to increase,"" ING bank economist Peter Vanden Houte wrote in a note to clients.
The mood became much more upbeat in industry, rising to 10.7 points from 2.1 in March, far exceeding consensus expectations of an increase to 4.0. In services, the euro zone's biggest sector responsible for more than two thirds of gross domestic product, the reading went up to 2.1 points from -9.6 in March, also far above expectations.
Consumer optimism rose to -8.1 from -10.8, in line with an initial estimate published last week, and in retail trade to -3.1 from -12.2. 
The optimism translated into manufacturing industry's selling price expectations rising to 24.1 points in April from 17.5 in March, coming very close to the highest reading since 2000, which was 25.5 points in March 2011.
Consumers also began to expect higher inflation over the next 12 months, with the reading going up to 19.6 in April from 18.6 in March, moving above the average reading since 2000.
""The big question is how temporary these price increases will be,"" Vanden Houte said.
""Will they disappear once some of the supply chains problems are resolved? With strong demand to be expected in the second half of the year and a further inventory build-up in the offing, we doubt that price tensions will disappear quickly,"" he said.

He said that while it was too early to expect a price-wage spiral, if there is a strong recovery in the coming months as suggested by the April sentiment data, the European Central Bank may become less inclined to keep up its bond buying scheme.
""The chances of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme being lengthened after March 2022 are getting slimmer by the day and the central bank could even suggest that it will not fully spend the current envelope,"" he said.

465,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:09AM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Confidence in the euro-area economy improved sharply in April as the region’s vaccination campaign picked up speed, paving the way for a lifting of coronavirus restrictions in the coming months.
A European Commission sentiment index increased to 110.3, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The highest reading since 2018 reflects improvements across all parts of the economy and the European Union’s six largest members.
The data add to signs that the region is starting to recover from the pandemic even as infection rates in some countries remain high. Immunizations have accelerated after early stumbles, allowing governments to plot an exit from restrictions that almost certainly tipped the bloc into a double-dip recession in the first three months of the year.
The German government this week raised its growth forecast for the year to 3.5% and expressed confidence that consumer spending will take off once the pandemic is under control. Manufacturing has also held up well, though the sector is now facing supply shortages that are threatening to hold back the recovery.
Industrial confidence hit a record high in April, with production expectations reaching unprecedented levels while stocks were scarcer than ever. The mood in services improved for a second consecutive month, driven by optimism about future demand.
Consumers assessed both the general economic situation and their personal conditions as more positive. Employment plans rose in all surveyed business areas.
A separate report on Thursday showed unemployment in Germany unexpectedly increased this month after nearly six months of lockdowns -- despite generous government subsidies enabling businesses to retain workers.
The European Central Bank has repeatedly pointed to downside risks for the economy in the short term, arguing that prospects will improve in the second half.
By then, countries are set to see the first disbursements from the EU’s 800 billion-euro ($969 billion) recovery fund. Plans for how to use the money are being submitted to the European Commission this week.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employees returned to work and shoppers stepped up spending on clothes and furniture after lockdown restrictions eased across most of the country earlier this month, official figures showed on Thursday.
The proportion of employees on furlough between April 5 and April 18 dropped to 13%, down from 17% in the previous two-week period, according to a survey of businesses conducted by the Office for National Statistics.
Shops selling 'non-essential' goods reopened in England and Wales on April 12, and English pubs and restaurants were able to serve customers outdoors. COVID restrictions are also easing this month in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The ONS said spending on what it calls 'delayable' goods such as clothes and furniture rose to 10% above pre-pandemic levels in the week to April 22, up by 21 percentage points from the week before when shops began to reopen.
Overall spending on credit and debit cards was now 98% of its level in February 2020, up from 91% the week before, based on high-value CHAPS payments data from card processors collected by the Bank of England, the ONS said.
However dining and drinking outdoors - during a period of chilly weather for the time of year - has been less appealing.

After a rush of demand on the first day that pubs and restaurants reopened, the level of reservations on April 24 was 62% of its level on the same Saturday two years earlier, similar to the 60% seen a week before.
Pubs and restaurants in England are expected to be allowed to resume indoor service, subject to social distancing requirements, on May 17.

Twenty percent of respondents in the poll by Kantar Public said they had increased their savings because of restrictions on travel, shopping and socialising, while 21% said their savings had fallen and 41% said they had not changed.
Older people were more likely than younger ones to have saved money.
Of those people who did save money as a result of the lockdowns, only 3% intended to spend it all by the end of the year. Some 9% said they would spend most of it and 7% said they would spend half of it.
The biggest share, 38%, said they would spend some of their new savings while 18% said they would spend none at all.
The Bank of England has said the speed with which people spend lockdown savings will be a key variable for determining how fast the economy recovers after it slumped by nearly 10% last year.
The poll also found that 62% of respondents said their personal income had not been impacted by coronavirus, up from 56% in March and 49% in January.

Kantar said it interviewed 1,115 people between April 22 and April 26.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve left rates unchanged Wednesday, and appears to be in no rush to rein in its accommodative stance even as vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus have bolstered the recovery.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and maintained its monthly pace of bond buying at $120 billion.
""Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement,"" the Fed said in a statement.
Despite the improving economic backdrop and faster pace of reopening, the pandemic continues to weigh on the outlook, according to the Fed. ""The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remain.""
In the press conference that followed the policy statement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell continued to signal that the current stand on policy will remain steady for some time.   
""We continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current zero to one quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate until labour market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2%, and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time.""
Still, market participants remain wary of an unexpected shift in the Fed's policy. Incoming economic data continue to point to a robust recovery as inflation steps up pace.
The 10-year inflation ""breakevens,” a key measure of inflation expectations over the next decade, topped 2.4% on Tuesday, the highest level since April 2013. The PCE index, the Fed's preferred inflation measures, was at 1.6% for February.
The central bank has not turned a blind eye to the increasing pace of inflation, but continues to suggest the post-reopening boom in inflation will be short-lived, or transitory. ""Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors,"" the Fed said in a statement.
""[W]e are likely to see some upward pressure on prices and but those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process and one-time price increases as the economy reopens,"" Powell said. ""It is not likely to lead to persistently higher year over year inflation into the future,"" he added. 
On the labor market, the Fed chief said the economy is a ""long way from full employment"" as unemployment remains above pre-pandemic levels. ""We've got a long ways to go,"" Powell added."

Retail sales for new vehicles in April are forecast to reach 1.3 million units, up 110.6% compared with last year, said the statement.
Total auto sales for April, including retail and non-retail, are projected to reach 1.5 million units, a 107.1% increase compared to the same period in 2020.
""With the sales pace exceeding the rate at which vehicles are being produced, compounded by significant production disruption due to microchip shortages, there is a growing risk to the industry's ability to sustain the current sales pace in the coming months,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average transaction prices are expected to rise 6.8% to $37,572, the highest ever for April, while the average incentive spending per unit is expected to fall to $3,191 from $4,953 last year.
King said low inventories ""have enabled manufacturers and retailers to reduce discounts"", and consumers were willing to buy vehicles closer to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) and more expensive vehicles.

The total seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 18.1 million vehicles, while it was 16.4 million units in 2019, the report said.

The trimmed mean core inflation gauge advanced 0.3% from the final three months of last year, compared with economists’ estimates of a 0.5% gain, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. Trimmed mean rose 1.1% in the first quarter from a year earlier versus an estimated 1.2% increase.
“The introduction, continuation and conclusion of a number of government schemes remained a factor in the March quarter,” said Michelle Marquardt, head of Prices Statistics at the ABS. “The fall in new dwelling prices was due to the impact of the Federal Government’s HomeBuilder grant and similar grants by the Western Australian and Tasmanian state governments.”
The Australian dollar fell 0.4% after the release to trade at 77.29 U.S. cents at 11:35 a.m. in Sydney.
The headline consumer price index advanced 0.6% from the final three months of last year, compared with economists’ estimates of a 0.9% gain. It increased 1.1% from a year earlier versus an estimated 1.4% increase.
Australian prices have been hit by cross-currents caused by fallout from Covid-19. The Reserve Bank of Australia adjusted its inflation framework to allow the economy to run a little hotter, saying it won’t raise interest rates until consumer prices are actually -- not forecast to be -- sustainably within its 2-3% target.
Governor Philip Lowe says achieving that goal will require wage gains of more than 3% for an extended period. That’s likely to take time given wages are currently around record lows. The RBA doesn’t expect to raise rates until 2024 at the earliest.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 14-month high in April as increased vaccinations against COVID-19 and additional fiscal stimulus allowed for more services businesses to reopen, boosting demand and hiring by companies.
The upbeat survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday, which also showed a strong increase in vacation plans, suggested the economy continued to power ahead early in the second quarter after what appears to have been robust growth in the first three months of the year, believed by many economists to have been the second strongest since 2003. Growth this year is expected to be the best in nearly four decades.
""Consumers are seeing the light at the end of the COVID tunnel,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""Led by strong spending as households return to eating out, traveling and visiting stores, the economy should surge ahead starting the second quarter and likely carrying into 2022."" 
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index raced to a reading of 121.7 this month. That was the highest level since February 2020, just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and followed a reading of 109.0 in March. It was the fourth straight monthly increase in the index.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would increase to a reading of 113.0 in April.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, soared to a reading of 139.6 from 110.1 last month. But the expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, ticked up to 109.8 from 108.3 in March.
The United States has expanded vaccination eligibility to American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over a third of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. 
Easing anxiety about the virus and the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package have allowed for greater economic re-engagement. Retail sales surged to a record high in March and employers hired the most workers in seven months. Businesses are also investing in equipment to boost production. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
BULLISH LABOR MARKET VIEWS
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, vaulted to a reading of 24.7 - the largest in 13 months and up from 8 in March. 
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report, and suggested another month of blockbuster job gains in April. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has dropped to a 13-month low. 
Federal Reserve officials meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday are likely to acknowledge the improving economic climate, but the U.S. central bank is expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance as employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
The government's snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Thursday will likely show the economy grew at a 6.1% annualized rate during the first three months of the year, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the second-fastest growth pace since the third quarter of 2003 and would follow a 4.3% rate of expansion in the final three months of 2020 and a 33.4% surge in the third quarter of last year.
The Conference Board survey showed the share of consumers expecting an increase in income over the next six months rose to 17.9% from 15.4% in March. The proportion anticipating a drop fell to 10.9% from 12.6% last month. It also showed more Americans planned to go on vacation over the next six months, with that share rising to 43.3% from 34.0% back in February when households were canvassed on the subject. 
Many intended to fly to their destinations, mostly in the United States. This could provide a powerful boost to the services industry, which was disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Consumers also planned to buy big-ticket items like cars and houses, though fewer intended to purchase major appliances relative to March. 
Strong house-buying intentions suggest demand for homes could remain supported and continue to drive up prices as supply remains tight. The housing market is being powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. Demographics also point to a strong housing market, with people between the ages of 26 and 34 accounting for about 12.5% of the U.S. population. 
""This suggests a noticeable tailwind for demand as the average first-time home buyer is in their early 30s,"" said Brady Seitz, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index jumped 12% in February from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after rising 11.2% in January.

Accelerating house price inflation was corroborated by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index shot up a record 12.2% on a year-on-year basis in February after increasing 12.1% in January.

Latin America's second largest economy posted a $2.906 billion trade deficit last month when adjusted for seasonal swings. The deficit was $3.004 billion in non-seasonally adjusted terms.
""The weak performance of auto exports in February-March reflects to some extent supply chain disruptions caused by gas supply restrictions in parts of the U.S. and Mexico and scarcity of semiconductors,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a note.
Automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have cut production this year due to a global semiconductor chip shortage.
Manufacturing exports, which account for roughly 30% of Mexico's gross domestic product, jumped by 9.9% in March versus a year earlier and increased by 2.2% during the first three months of the year on an annual basis, according to INEGI data.
That was weighed down in March by a 5.2% drop in auto exports, which account for roughly a third of all manufacturing shipments, and a 4.8% drop in January to March shipments of cars.
The reactivation of Mexico's manufacturing sector ""will be slower than previously expected due to the problem with a chip"" shortage in the automotive sector, economist Jose Luis De la Cruz said.

He added, though, that a low base of comparison in April and May 2020 should boost figures over the next couple of months.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile expects the soaring price of its main export copper to boost growth and underwrite the nearly $16 billion in stimulus the country expects to have handed out to its citizens during the coronavirus pandemic.
Finance Minister Rodrigo Cerda told lawmakers during a presentation of the government's quarterly public finance report that Chile expects the copper price to average $3.99 per pound in 2021, a big increase over its January prediction of $3.35. 
Sky-rocketing copper prices, combined with a major bump in economic activity expected as a result of its fast-paced vaccination drive could see Chile's gross domestic product jump 6% in 2021, up from a previous estimate of 5%, Cerda said.
The world's biggest copper producer reaps an additional $60 million in taxes and royalties for every penny the copper price rises, based on official estimates.
The minister said Chile could also thank copper revenues for helping to stabilize debt in 2021 despite rising expenditures. 
""The price of copper, now much higher, gives us more income, and permits us, of course, to more rapidly contain debt levels,"" Cerda said in the presentation.
Chile's copper output has continued without much disruption during much of the pandemic as most of its large mining companies adjusted early, stepping up sanitary measures and working with limited staff.
The country is also far ahead of regional neighbors in its vaccination drive, an advantage it hopes will prime the economy for a major rebound in the second half of 2021, Cerda said. 
Domestic demand is expected to grow 10.7% in 2021, up from a previous estimate of 8.8%, amid expectations that the pandemic will soon subside as more Chileans are innoculated.
Health ministry statistics show that more than half of a target population of 15 million Chileans has been vaccinated.

The finance report also noted that consumer prices would rise 3.4%, up slightly from a prior forecast of 3.0%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday will continue his push for a national $15 minimum wage with an executive order that raises pay to at least that level for hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers, according to senior White House officials.
The move will increase the current minimum wage of $10.95 by nearly 37% by March of next year and continue to tie future increases to inflation. 
It will apply to federal workers from cleaning and maintenance staff to food service contractors and laborers, sweeping in tipped workers who were previously left out of the last increase under former President Barack Obama. 
White House officials insist it won't increase costs for taxpayers because of benefits including increased worker productivity.
Biden has expressed his belief that strong unions and higher wages can resurrect America's middle class while helping bridge economic and racial inequities, and the executive order is his latest step in support of the organized labor movement.
Biden has often been called the most pro-union president ever by labor groups.
On Monday, he signed another order to create a White House task force that will promote unions and labor organizing, which will be headed by Vice President Kamala Harris. The move was a significant attempt to use the federal government's resources to help stem a decline in union membership in the country.
Since taking office, Biden has also ousted government officials whom unions have called hostile to labor and reversed Trump-era rules that weakened worker protections. He even appeared in a video alluding to workers in an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) facility in Alabama to vote to form a union - an effort that did not end in success. 
Biden tried to insert a federal $15 minimum wage into the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill signed in March, but it was tossed on a procedural matter by the Senate parliamentarian. 
The move to hike base wages for federal contractors was an ask Biden made of his administration in the first few days after taking office and he has vowed to keep pushing for it. 
It builds on an order issued by former President Obama, which required federal contractors to be paid $10.10 an hour indexed to inflation. That rate now stands at $10.95 an hour.
""This would not lead to reduced employment...but would enhance worker productivity and then create higher quality work by boosting workers' health, morale and effort,"" a senior administration official said.

The administration official said the order's impact was reviewed by Biden's Council of Economic Advisors which found the decision would help employers reduce turnover and lower recruitment and training costs.
Biden's latest executive order will require all federal agencies to include the increase in new contract solicitations by January 30, 2022. Two months from then they will be required to implement the base wage into new contracts.
The order also indexes the raise to inflation after 2022, and ends the tipped minimum wage for workers such as those offering seasonal recreational services, food servers and shuttle bus drivers. It also ensures $15 an hour for federal contractors with disabilities.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported the sharpest upturn in sales since 2018 this month as non-essential began to reopen after months of closure, adding to signs of an economic rebound as COVID restrictions ease, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The Confederation of British Industry said its monthly retail sales volume balance jumped to +20 in April from -45 in March, its highest level since September 2018.
Part of the increase reflected the effect of comparing with a year earlier, when Britain was in the midst of its first, most stringent COVID lockdown.
But a separate measure of sales volumes for the time of year also rebounded strongly to its highest since June 2018 and is expected to remain high in May.
Most economists expect Britain's economy to grow by more than 5% this year after shrinking almost 10% in 2020, the sharpest decline in over 300 years.
Shops in England and Wales selling non-essential goods reopened on April 12 after more than three months of closure, while those in Scotland returned to business on Monday. Northern Irish shops are due to welcome customers back on April 30. 
Official retail sales data showed that sales volumes in March had exceeded pre-crisis levels, reflecting a big shift to online shopping which now accounts for more than a third of spending, up from less than a quarter before the pandemic.
However, the CBI said many high-street stores continued to struggle, especially in hard-hit sectors such as clothing.
""Despite progress along the roadmap, the impact of COVID-19 restrictions are still biting hard,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.
""The improvement in retail sales this month was driven by sectors that have performed relatively well during the pandemic, with little immediate rebound expected for more embattled sectors such as clothing, footwear and department stores,"" he added.

The CBI survey took place between March 25 and April 15, and covered 60 retail chains.

LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC Holdings PLC beat quarterly profit forecasts and released $400 million it had set aside to cover bad loans caused by the pandemic, as rapid vaccine rollouts in the United States and Britain raise hopes for an economic recovery.
Europe's biggest bank by assets cautioned, however, that high levels of uncertainty meant it was keeping the bulk of the $3 billion it set aside a year ago to cover potential bad debts.
""We are still being relatively cautious, and we've retained about 70% of the reserve build up we did last year,"" Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters.
HSBC reported on Tuesday profit before tax of $5.78 billion for the three months to March 30, up from $3.21 billion a year ago and well above analysts' average forecast of $3.35 billion as compiled by the bank. 
However, this compared with $6.21 billion in the same period in 2019, showing the lender has some way to go to get back to pre-pandemic profit levels.
HSBC, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, said its credit losses for 2021 were likely to be below the medium-term range of 30-40 basis points it forecast in February.
Despite a plan to shift more business to Asia, Chief Executive Noel Quinn said the lender had no immediate plans to move its headquarters from Britain to the region.
London is still ""a good place for the head office of an international bank,"" Quinn told reporters. 
HSBC shares rose 1.7 % in London, the best performers in the benchmark FTSE index and reflecting earlier gains in its Hong Kong-listed shares.
""We are more optimistic than we were back in February, we expect GDP to rebound in every economy in which we operate this year,"" Quinn told Reuters, citing the successful rollout of vaccines in the United States and Britain as a key factor. 
RATES SQUEEZE
HSBC's improved outlook and profits paled in comparison to U.S. rival JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which earlier this month reported a 400% increase in quarterly profit and released more than $5 billion in bad loan provisions.
That partly reflected the European lender's heavy reliance on global interest rates to make money, which it said in February it would try to address by shifting to more fee-based business, such as wealth management. 
Hibor, the benchmark lending rate in HSBC's most profitable market of Hong Kong, was near 10-year lows for much of the quarter, and the lender's revenue overall fell 5% as such low rates compressed income from lending.
""HSBC is not alone in feeling the squeeze of net interest margins, which tightened again slightly over the quarter, but other banks with huge investment banking arms have been able to capitalise on the trading surge over the past year,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at online investment platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
While HSBC lagged U.S. peers in its performance, it at least avoided losses from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos that blighted European rival UBS's results.
HSBC had no direct or indirect exposure to Archegos, Quinn told reporters.

HSBC also said it was continuing negotiations for the sale of its French retail banking business, but no final decision had been taken. Reuters reported last month that HSBC had entered negotiations to sell the business, which has 270 branches, to private equity firm Cerberus.
The lender likewise had no update on progress to dispose of its similarly underperforming U.S. retail banking business.

Gross domestic product grew 1.6% during January-March from the previous quarter, the Bank of Korea said Tuesday, higher than the economists’ consensus for a 1.1% expansion. That pushed GDP above its level a year ago for the first time since the start of 2020.
Korea has been one of the better performers throughout the pandemic, thanks to strong overseas demand for its products ranging from chips to cars. BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol said earlier this month he expects growth to reach mid-3% this year, higher than the 3% expected in February.
While Tuesday’s release supports Lee’s optimism, risks to the recovery are growing from worsening local outbreaks. Korea has found it more difficult to peg back fresh infections this year and inoculations are yet to start for the broader public. That suggests social distancing restrictions will remain stringent to tame outbreaks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rose solidly in March and shipments surged, cementing expectations that economic growth accelerated in the first quarter as massive government aid and improving public health boosted demand.
The strength in business spending reported by the Commerce Department on Monday joined upbeat data on retail sales and the labor market in setting up the economy for what analysts expect will be its best performance this year in nearly four decades.
Economists saw little impact on investment from President Joe Biden's push for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax system to make rich people and big companies pay more and help foot the bill for the White House's ambitious economic agenda, including upgrading the nation's crumbling infrastructure. 
Details of the tax proposal could be released before Biden's address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. Economists said there was no evidence that former President Donald Trump's deep corporate tax cuts boosted business investment.
""It is hard to fathom how partially rolling back the Trump cuts to pay for the infrastructure plan will meaningfully impede business investment,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""There is little relationship between the effective corporate tax rate and changes in real business equipment spending. Most U.S. corporations have no trouble getting cheap capital and they pay among the lowest effective tax rates in the world.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.9% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders fell 0.8% in February after bitterly cold temperatures gripped large parts of the country. 
Though last month's increase was below the 1.5% jump that had been anticipated by economists in a Reuters poll, core capital goods orders surged 10.4% year-on-year in March.
Reports this month showed retail sales raced to a record high in March while the economy created the most jobs in seven months. Factory activity measures are at multi-year highs, indicating continued strength in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
The Biden administration's massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations against the virus have allowed for broader economic re-engagement, unleashing pent-up demand, for both goods and services. Biden has also proposed a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure plan.
Stocks on Wall Street rose. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
STRONG GROWTH
In March, core capital goods orders were boosted by machinery, primary and fabricated metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components dropped 1.5%.
Shipments of core capital goods rebounded 1.3%, recouping February's 1.1% drop. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
Based on the latest data, economists are forecasting strong business spending on equipment in the first quarter.
""The response of capital spending to the COVID pandemic, with both orders and shipments of core capital goods at a record high, is encouraging for the outlook for 2021,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
With households sitting on at least $2 trillion in excess savings, demand booming and inventories low, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production, though raw material and input shortages could be an issue.
""There's still a gap between orders and shipments as producers ramp up capacity and adjust to increasing demand,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The increase in the orders backlog is especially bad in core capital goods, suggesting accelerating capital spending."" 
The government's snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Thursday will likely show the economy grew at a 6.1% annualized rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the a second fastest growth pace since the third quarter of 2003 and would follow a 4.3% rate of expansion in the final three months of 2020. 
The economy grew at a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter of 2020 after contracting at a historic 31.4% rate in the April-June period. Growth is expected to top 7.0% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984. It would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rose 0.5% in March after falling 0.9% February. They were restrained by a 1.7% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 2.0% drop in February.
Orders for civilian aircraft tumbled 46.9%. That was despite Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting on its website that it had received 196 aircraft orders last month compared to 82 in February. Last month's orders included 185 737 MAX jets. The U.S. government late last year lifted a 20-month grounding of the aircraft that was put in place after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts shot up 5.5% in March after plunging 9.1% in February. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products also has been impacted.

Unfilled durable goods orders rose in March for the third straight month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks' demand for Treasury securities has not dimmed, contrary to expectations, since the Federal Reserve let expire a waiver to a capital adequacy regulation granted early in the pandemic, even as firms seek to raise more capital via debt issuance instead. 
That should prevent spikes in U.S. Treasury yields and keep them in a narrow range this year.
The waiver to the supplementary leverage ratio expired on March 31. That means big banks, as of April 1, have resumed holding more loss-absorbing capital against U.S. Treasuries and central bank deposits.
The Fed also said it would undertake a formal review of the SLR given concerns it is no longer functioning as intended with the central bank's COVID-19 monetary policy measures.
""When we were all talking about the SLR a couple of months ago, we were worried that the exemptions will expire... and banks would sell Treasuries, but the SLR (exemption) went away, and we didn't really see significant selling pressure,"" said Dan Krieter, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital in Chicago. 
Along with other investors, some bank buying has lifted Treasury prices since the beginning of the month, pushing U.S. 10-year yields about 20 basis points lower. They were last at 1.572%. 
Instead of selling Treasuries to meet the capital ratios, analysts said banks are issuing debt. By issuing debt, a bank raises capital against its assets, lifting capital ratios. 
Bank issuers are jumping in to take advantage of the low cost of capital with an eye to the future amid potentially higher rates and borrowing costs, said Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank in London.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have or are planning to issue a total of $40 billion in debt, according to media reports.
JPMorgan's $13 billion bond sale on April 15 was briefly an industry record until it was topped the next day by Bank of America's $15 billion offering.
""The Fed has also hinted heavily at a permanent tweak to SLR calculations that likely prevented any large selling of Treasuries,"" BMO's Krieter said. 
The latest Fed data on primary dealer holdings of Treasuries, one component of bank ownership of U.S. government debt, showed a slight increase of their Treasury inventory as of April 14, to $125.6 billion, from a week earlier. 
Primary dealer holdings did decline from end-February to mid-March as banks braced for the expiration of the SLR exemption, data showed.
U.S. banks currently hold between 8%-10% of publicly available Treasury securities, according to Fed data. That is a major chunk that could move yields if there are reallocations away from Treasuries. 
In April 2020, the Fed excluded Treasuries and central bank deposits from the leverage ratio until March 31, a move aimed at easing Treasury market stress and encouraging banks to lend.
""From my understanding, there weren't many banks that have been using the SLR exemption on their Treasury holdings anyway,"" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at broker-dealer Incapital.
DEBT ISSUANCE VS SELLING TREASURIES
Issuing debt is far more advantageous to banks compared with selling Treasuries, analysts said, even though they could lose money doing so.
""Funding a portfolio of bank reserves and Treasuries with unsecured bank debt is likely a negative arbitrage proposition,"" said BMO's Krieter. ""Interest on reserves don't earn much and they earn less than what you're paying for the debt that funds it.""
But Krieter noted that selling Treasuries has been a much more expensive exercise than issuing debt.
""To maintain a certain SLR, you might sell Treasuries and then presumably buy them back at a higher market price once the permanent exemption comes,"" Krieter said. 

""In this example, you're paying the full bid/ask spread on a Treasury portfolio worth tens of billions of dollars.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. recreational vehicle industry continued its pandemic-driven boom in the first quarter of 2021, underscoring the lingering impact of the health and economic crisis on American consumer buying and leisure-time habits.
Wholesale shipments of RVs in North America, which surged as people sought ways to safely travel during the COVID-19 crisis, hit a record 148,507 units in the first quarter, nearly 10% above the previous record set in the first quarter of 2018, according to a survey of manufacturers by the RV Industry Association which was seen by Reuters. The data is being released later Monday morning.
The survey also found the industry shipped 54,291 RVs in March, which was more than in any previous month in the industry's history.
Other types of outdoor-oriented industries have also boomed during the pandemic. 
Sales of swimming pools, boats, and all-terrain vehicles all surged after initial lockdowns were lifted last year. Some manufacturers are reporting shortages of parts and other supply chain constraints amid the upswing in manufacturing. Labor shortages also are bedeviling the industry, which is struggling to fill jobs in production hubs like northern Indiana.
The RV association figures dovetail with U.S. Census Bureau data released earlier on Monday showing orders for long-lasting manufactured products - everything from airplanes and automobiles to refrigerators and computers - rose 0.5% in March from the previous month to $256.3 billion, one of the highest monthly totals on record. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - so-called core durable goods orders - rose 0.9%, slightly less than expected.
New orders for all categories of motor vehicles and parts rose by 5.5% in March to $60.5 billion. Motor vehicle shipments were up 5.8% from February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has promised to help restore the U.S. economy to ""maximum employment,"" and is pointing to the months just before the coronavirus pandemic as the touchstone for what that might mean.
Yet early evidence from the reopening of the economy suggests the push to reach that goal may be elusive, or at best a more drawn-out process, as the labor market shifts away from the types of jobs lost in 2020, is potentially further transformed by massive infrastructure spending, and sees some workers quit job-seeking altogether.
Economists say they don't see troubling job bottlenecks in the near term. Some employers have complained about not being to find enough workers, though that problem is expected to ease as schools and childcare facilities reopen, allowing workers to return to their jobs, and the hard-hit hospitality and retail sectors start bulking up their workforces. 
But they may also not be far off if the pandemic leads to an economy more reliant on technology and less on people in the service sector, and the Biden administration's spending plans boost demand for construction, family care and other areas where the unemployed have a different set of skills and, perhaps, preferences.
""There is no broad-based constraint when you have 8.5 million fewer jobs"" than existed at the pandemic's onset, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Daco expects the economy to add jobs at a fast clip this year, but he said hiring could slow as the occupational mix changes and more older people use the pandemic as a reason to retire. 
""Yes, it will be an impediment to a full recovery and, yes, it will take longer,"" Daco said of the need for workers to shift skills and industries, and of possible limits to how far labor force participation will rise.
THE QUEST FOR LAST YEAR
The Fed is not expected to change its policy guidance after its two-day meeting this week, though it is likely to give a rosier view of the employment situation in the wake of the 916,000 jobs added in March and expectations of further growth through the summer.
The policy statement and Fed Chief Jerome Powell's news conference after the meeting are expected to shine some light on whether the employment landscape has changed the U.S. central bank's plans to leave its key overnight interest rate near zero for an extended time and to continue buying $120 billion in bonds each month.
Huge shortfalls remain, though: Payroll jobs peaked at 152.5 million in February of last year, compared with 144.1 million last month. The share of adults working or looking for work, known as the labor force participation rate, hit a 7-year high of 63.4% in January 2020, reversing what seemed an embedded decline. It fell when the pandemic struck and was at 61.5% last month, representing nearly 4 million additional people not looking for work.
For a graphic on Labor market index:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/LABORINDEX/nmopaoxozpa/chart.png
The best-case scenario is for the economy to snap back to those earlier conditions, though Fed policymakers say they will be patient and only dial back support if inflation surges in unanticipated ways. When the last U.S. recession ended in 2009, it took several years before the most positive trends took hold, and Fed officials will be reluctant to accept that won't happen again.
Yet even as rising COVID-19 vaccination rates promise a more fully open economy, a job market realignment appears underway. Hiring is shifting towards businesses that make and move goods, as well as to those in construction, pharmaceuticals and other fields that have done well during the pandemic and may be buoyed further by ongoing work from home, online shopping, and other trends.
Job postings in those sectors are up 50% or more compared to February 2020, while those for the hospitality and tourism trades remain 17% lower, according to hiring site Indeed.
Analysis of new job postings by analytics firm Chmura projects employment in retail, food service and accommodation will remain well below pre-pandemic levels at least through the end of this year.

A 'DIFFERENT' ECONOMY
If sidelined workers and new job seekers don't smoothly shift to the occupations demanded in the post-pandemic economy, it could limit what ""maximum employment"" turns out to be.
The constraint could reveal itself through a labor force participation rate not climbing back to prior levels. A recent New York Fed survey pointed that way, with a declining number of people expecting to work beyond the age of 67. A surprising return of older workers boosted labor force growth during the last economic expansion, but the reverse is possible now.
It could also show up in faster wage increases for some industries, particularly if the Biden administration's infrastructure spending stretches the supply of skilled workers. Construction employment in March, for example, was only about 2% below its pre-pandemic level.
""There are still people on the sidelines that could come back. But are they in the right locations and with the right skills?"" said Chmura Chief Executive Officer Christine Chmura. ""Probably not. That will drive wages up."" 
Higher wages and a speedier return to full employment are part of the rationale for the White House-backed $2.3 trillion infrastructure package under consideration in Congress, and a key phase could be approaching. 
Enhanced federal unemployment benefits end in September, which will likely push some people back into the job market; rising vaccinations should allow more of the economy to reopen this summer; and Congress will decide how much of President Joe Biden's program to authorize.
Billed as a ""transformational"" plan, the administration's infrastructure proposal acknowledges worker training will need to keep step, with tens of billions of dollars set aside for community college programs, apprenticeships, and efforts to shift displaced workers into new careers.
The Fed will be watching to see how it fits together.

""The economy that we're going back to is going to be different from the one that we had,"" Powell said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program earlier this month, adding that the changes ""will make it challenging"" for people who became unemployed during the pandemic to go back to work.

The Ifo institute’s gauge of expectations for the next six months fell to 99.5 in April from 100.3. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a gain. At the same time, an assessment of current conditions improved.
While Germany has significantly sped up its vaccination campaign, the infection rate is high and businesses are facing severe curbs on activity. Nighttime curfews have been in place since Saturday across vast parts of the country, and many shops were forced shut after the government tightened restrictions.
“Both the third wave of infections and bottlenecks in intermediate products are impeding Germany’s economic recovery,” Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
Surveys of purchasing managers on Friday suggested that the wider euro area is turning the the page on the pandemic, after on-and-off lockdowns dragged it into a double-dip recession.
Services grew in April for the first time in eight months, a milestone for a sector that has been hamstrung by some of the worst restrictions since the outbreak. The region’s manufacturing upturn, the strongest in more than two decades of data collection, continued to be led by Germany.
The recovery is expected to gain momentum in the second half of the year, as lockdowns ease and the European Union’s 800 billion-euro ($966 billion) recovery fund is being rolled out.

(Reuters) - New U.S. bank credit benchmarks are expected to gain traction in the coming months as the deadline to phase out exposure to the discredited Libor approaches, even as regulators continue to push an alternative called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).
Investors are facing a year-end deadline to stop basing new loans and trades on Libor, an acronym for the London Interbank Offered Rate. Some Libor rates will stop being published at the after Dec. 31, while others are scheduled to end in mid-2023.
Libor is being phased out as a reference rate due to concerns about the amount of derivatives using the rate, which in many cases is based on assumptions about their borrowing costs and not actual trades, and after it was manipulated before and during the financial crisis.
The shift will require more than $200 trillion in trades and loans to move to new benchmarks. The move will also likely result in several new indexes gaining prominence, reducing the historical reliance on just one key rate.
Most derivatives contracts based on Libor are expected to migrate to SOFR, the benchmark endorsed by regulators to replace Libor. This index is based on around $1 trillion in daily loans in the U.S. overnight repurchase agreement market.
But many banks and investors want a rate that includes a bank credit component for loans and will instead turn to alternatives.
Richard Sandor, chairman and CEO of the American Financial Exchange, which offers the Ameribor index, said that the shift away from Libor is an opportunity that “occurs once in 100 years,” adding that he has “never been more bullish.”
Ameribor and Bloomberg’s Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) are gaining interest as benchmarks for loans, though the move is in its early stages. ICE Benchmark Administration, part of the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), also plans to offer the U.S. Dollar ICE Bank Yield Index as a Libor replacement.
Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) said this month that it will use Ameribor as a replacement for Libor in most of its non-syndicated commercial loans.
Banks want loans to include a measure of their borrowing rates in case these costs increase.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also said last week that it has issued a $1 billion, six-month floating rate note referencing Bloomberg’s index. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have both indicated that BSBY meets their requirements as a money market reference rate, opening the door to money fund investments in notes based on the index.
“BSBY could become an increasingly common benchmark rate. It has several desirable features relative to SOFR,” said Daniel Krieter and Daniel Belton, analysts at BMO Capital Markets.
Market participants were frustrated after the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), a group of market participants that selected SOFR to replace Libor, said in March that it will not be able to recommend a forward looking SOFR rate by mid-year, its former target date.
The CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) has since said that it will offer SOFR term rates based on its SOFR futures trading.
The New York Federal Reserve began publishing SOFR in April 2018, but the shift away from Libor has been slow.
(GRAPHIC: USD Libor Exposures - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaazmlva/Libor.PNG) 
Around $223 trillion worth of contracts now reference U.S. dollar Libor, compared with $199 trillion at the end of 2016, the ARRC said last month.
Most derivatives are expected to shift to SOFR, though a portion of the market used to hedge loans is expected to reference the credit alternatives.
Trading in the CME Group’s SOFR futures rose to a record 112,000 average daily contract volume in the first quarter, though this remains well below the 2.72 million in average daily contract volumes for Eurodollar futures based on Libor.
The CME has said that it will shift any remaining eurodollar contracts based on Libor to SOFR futures when the Libor rate stops being published in mid-2023.
For many, the solution going forward may also be a hybrid that includes SOFR as a base and adds a credit component when desired.

“I’m pretty much convinced SOFR will be the dominant rate going forward and you will have participants who will choose to add a systemic spread onto that to take you to something like a synthetic Libor,” said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research, Americas, at ING.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's services prices showed signs of a pick-up in March as advertising and transportation fees rose, data showed on Monday, suggesting the economy was recovering moderately from last year's severe hit as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.
But the third state of emergency, rolled out on Sunday to combat a resurgence of new COVID-19 infections, clouds the outlook, with requests for retailers to close likely to hurt consumption.
""There might have been some pent-up demand in March that drove up prices, though there's huge uncertainty on the outlook given the new state of emergency,"" Shigeru Shimizu, head of the Bank of Japan's price statistics division, told a briefing.
The services producer price index, which tracks the price companies charge each other for services, rose 0.7% in March from a year earlier, BOJ data showed on Monday.
It was the first increase in six months and followed a flat reading in February.
While part of the rise was due to the base effect of last year's plunge, television and internet advertisement fees were up on demand from cellphone carriers and other services.
Cargo transportation prices also rebounded on tighter supply as airlines slashed the number of flights, the data showed.
Services prices have remained weak even as goods prices rose due to the severe blow the pandemic dealt to services consumption, adding to downward pressure from persistently slow wage growth in Japan.

Japan's core consumer prices fell for the eighth straight month in March, separate data showed on Friday, underscoring the challenge the BOJ faces in hitting its 2% inflation target.

485,"<span>Apr 25, 2021 06:00PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy continued to boom in April from the record growth in the first quarter, with strong exports and rising business confidence supporting the recovery.
That’s the outlook of an aggregate index combining eight early indicators tracked by Bloomberg, which remained unchanged from March in strong expansionary territory. Some of the strength this month may be exaggerated by the comparison with April 2020, when the country was still struggling to recover and reopen after a lockdown to contain the world’s first coronavirus cases.
Confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, picked up for a second month in a survey of more than 500 companies by Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc., with the rise in expectations pointing to even stronger performance in the current quarter compared to the first three months of the year.
“Export-oriented SMEs continued to outperform domestically-focused SMEs, with faster production and higher output price gains,” according to the Standard Chartered’s economists Lan Shen and Ding Shuang. “The services sector is catching up at a faster pace, driven by the transport and logistics, IT, and commercial services industries, while the catering and accommodation sectors remain sluggish.”
The improvement in services was due to the “removal of restrictive measures and vaccine rollout,” they wrote in a report. “While export demand stayed resilient, domestic demand also started to pick up.”
Three Reasons to Believe in the Boom on Bloomberg Trade Tracker
The strength of overseas demand can be seen in South Korea’s exports in the first 20 days of the month, which jumped more than 45% compared to the same period a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2011.
Global demand has driven up commodity costs, boosting factory-gate inflation in China to its highest since 2017, according to Bloomberg Economics’ price tracker. Copper prices approached the nine-year highs reached in February, while steel futures in China reached new peaks even as rebar stockpiles shrank slightly.
China’s stock market moved higher in April, with the benchmark index of 300 mainland companies bouncing back to levels above 5,100.
Home sales continued to grow in the month, although the pace was less robust than in March. Regulators have been trying to control housing risks after monetary easing spurred a rebound in the residential market, with buyers using property to hedge against inflation. Car sales growth in the same period slowed slightly.

The bank said in a note to clients that it now expects British gross domestic product to grow by a ""striking"" 7.8% this year, ""above our expectations for the U.S.""
A Reuters poll of analysts published on April 13 showed an average forecast for growth of 5.0% in the UK, the world's fifth-biggest economy in 2021. The International Monetary Fund has projected a 5.3% expansion.
But since those forecasts were made there have been signs of an acceleration in the pace of recovery with the country now having given a first coronavirus vaccine to more than half of its total population.
""The UK economy is rebounding sharply from the Covid crisis,"" Goldman Sachs said.
""The April flash PMI was much stronger than expected in the UK, with the services PMI moving strongly further into expansionary territory,"" it said.
The bank also noted a much-stronger-than-expected 5.4% monthly jump in retail sales in March.
The note did not provide a comparison forecast for U.S. economic growth this year. In February, Goldman said it expected U.S. GDP would grow by 6.8% in 2021 as President Joe Biden pushed ahead with a huge fiscal stimulus programme.
Britain's economy shrank by nearly 10% last year as it was hit by longer coronavirus lockdowns than many of its peers. By comparison, the U.S. economy shrank by an estimated 3.5%, according to the IMF. 

On Saturday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was quoted as saying he expected ""very rapid growth at least over the next couple of quarters"" as the country lifts its coronavirus restrictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity powered ahead in early April, though manufacturers increasingly struggled to source raw materials and other inputs as a reopening economy leads to a boom in domestic demand, which could slow momentum in the months ahead.
The flow of strong economic data continued with another report on Friday showing new home sales racing to a more than 14-1/2-year high in March. The economy is being boosted by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations against the virus.
Retail sales jumped to a record high in March and hiring accelerated, cementing expectations for robust growth in the first quarter and setting up the economy for what could be its best performance in nearly four decades.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 60.6 in the first half of this month. That was the highest reading since the series started in May 2007 and followed 59.1 in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 60.5 in early April. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
""The U.S. economy is enjoying a strong start to the second quarter, firing on all cylinders as loosening virus restrictions, an impressive vaccine roll-out, a brighter outlook and stimulus measures all helped boost demand,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
More than half of American adults have had at least one vaccine dose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A third of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. That, together with the fiscal stimulus, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement.
But the strong demand is pushing against supply constraints. The pandemic has disrupted labor at factories and their suppliers, causing shortages that are boosting prices of materials and other inputs. 
The IHS Markit survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to the highest level since July 2008. It attributed the higher input prices to ""severe supplier shortages and marked rises in transportation fees.""
The continued rise in input costs is one of many factors expected to drive inflation above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed confidence that the supply chains will adapt and become more efficient, and prevent prices from remaining higher for a sustained period. 
According to IHS Market supply shortages were causing backlogs of uncompleted work ""of a magnitude not surpassed for over seven years."" The raw material squeeze is most evident in the automobile industry, where a global semiconductor shortage has forced production cuts at motor vehicle assembly plants. 
Supply challenges have also spilled over to the housing market, where builders are struggling with record lumber prices, threatening to worsen an already acute shortage of previously owned homes available for sale. 
A report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed new single-family home sales surged 20.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.021 million units last month, the highest since August 2006.
The sales pace blew past economists' expectations for 886,000 units. The market for new homes is benefiting from the dearth of previously owned home.
""Demand is causing new homes to be bought virtually as soon as they hit the market,"" said from Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The data helped to lift stocks on Wall Street. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
TIGHT INVENTORY
The pandemic is driving demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations as millions of Americans continued to work from home and attend classes remotely. Homebuilders, however, are also grappling with shortages of land and workers. 
New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits. Sales soared 66.8% year-on-year in March.
Sales surged in the South, Midwest and Northeast, but fell in the West. They were concentrated in the $200,000-$399,999 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 3% of transactions last month.
The median new house price rose 0.8% from a year earlier to $330,800 in March. The National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday that sales of previously owned homes declined for a second straight month in March, with prices hitting an all-time high as supply remained near record lows. 
There were 307,000 new homes on the market last month, unchanged from February. At March's sales pace it would take 3.6 months to clear the supply, down from 4.4 months in February. 
""Inventories remain tight and while that should be a positive for home building activity, a lack of availability will likely remain a headwind for sales in the near term,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

About 74% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The chances of resolving cases through out-of-court settlements remain uncertain, with many banks waiting for a Polish Supreme Court sitting on May 11 before they decide whether to sign up to a settlement plan proposed by financial regulator KNF.
Thousands of Polish borrowers took out franc loans more than a decade ago to take advantage of low Swiss interest rates but then faced ballooning repayments when the zloty weakened sharply against the Swiss currency.
""The KNF's proposal minimises the bank's losses and completely eliminates the currency risk on the client's side,"" said chief financial officer Rafal Kozlowski. 
""A settlement is always better for the bank than a court dispute, we avoid legal costs, it relieves the client of debt and gives (the bank) a tax shield.""
PKO BP is so far the only bank to have committed itself to the KNF scheme. Kozlowski said that according to a survey carried out by the bank two thirds of customers would be ready to accept settlements under the KNF plan.
With many other banks waiting for the Supreme Court ruling before making a decision on the settlement plan, there had been speculation in Polish media that PKO BP shareholders would opt to put off the decision regarding the fund.
However, a motion at Friday's Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to adjourn proceedings until May 21 did not get the two thirds majority needed to pass.
Shareholders also accepted the management board's proposal not to vote on a 4.5 billion zloty share repurchase programme.

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro zone's recovery from its pandemic-induced economic downturn was much stronger than expected in April as the service industry adapted to lockdowns and made a surprise return to growth, a survey showed.
With the continent facing a fresh wave of coronavirus infections governments have reimposed strict curbs to contain the spread, forcing some businesses to close and encouraging citizens to stay home. 
That meant the economy was expected to recover at a much weaker rate this quarter than had been expected only a month previously, according to a Reuters poll last week. [ECILT/EU]
But IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to a nine month high of 53.7 from March's 53.2, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 52.8. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The euro zone economy looks like it's on the brink of a startling recovery. Only months ago it seemed to be rapidly turning into the weak link among advanced markets, being slow out the gates with vaccinations, seeing lockdowns extended and having weaker fiscal support,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""True, first-quarter GDP growth figures are set to still show declines, but the April PMI adds to a lot of encouraging underlying numbers.""
On Thursday, the European Central Bank kept its copious stimulus flowing to support the economy as President Christine Lagarde said there were clear signs of improvement.
""Progress with vaccination campaigns and an envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpin expectations of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021,"" she told a press conference.
A PMI for the dominant service industry rose to 50.3 from last month's 49.6, beating the median forecast in the Reuters poll for a decline to 49.1.
Meanwhile, factories in the currency union had their most active month since the survey began in mid-1997.
An index measuring output nudged up to survey high.
Germany's PMI gave an upbeat outlook for Europe's largest economy with factories continuing to churn out goods at a near-record pace although activity in the services sector remained sluggish due to coronavirus curbs.
French business activity expanded more strongly than forecast, according to its survey, as the euro zone's second-biggest economy showed signs of resilience.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, a deluge of new orders swept through businesses as the country lifted some of its COVID-19 restrictions, pointing to a rapid rebound.
COSTS RISING
Supply-side disruptions left factories facing soaring costs for raw materials. The euro zone input prices index climbed to a near-record high and manufacturers were only able to pass some of that increase on to customers.
""The composite input prices PMI reached its highest level in around a decade, with supply shortages driving up input costs in the manufacturing sector. These should hopefully prove temporary,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics. 
Still, any signs of pricing pressures may be welcomed by the ECB which has struggled to get inflation anywhere near its target. 
With some businesses staying open - or preparing to reopen - services firms increased headcount at the fastest pace since before Europe faced the full brunt of the pandemic.
Hopes slow vaccination programmes in the bloc accelerate and allow a return to some form of normality sent optimism about the coming year higher.

The composite future output index climbed to 68.8 from 67.9, the highest since IHS Markit started collating the data in July 2012. 
Euro zone consumer confidence rose 2.7 points in April from March, European Commission figures on Thursday showed.

LONDON (Reuters) -A deluge of new orders swept through British businesses in April as the country lifted some of its COVID-19 restrictions, according to a survey on Friday that pointed to a rapid rebound for the pandemic-hit UK economy.
The preliminary ""flash"" reading of the UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60.0 in April from 56.4 in March, its highest reading since November 2013. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a smaller rise to 58.2.
The survey added to signs that the world's fifth-biggest economy, which shrank by nearly 10% in 2020, is shaping up for a rapid recovery helped by the fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations.
Official data published earlier on Friday showed retail sales jumped by much more than expected in March even with many shops still closed last month.
Clothing retailers able to sell online benefitted especially as consumers got ready to venture out after being locked down for much of the past year.
Retailers also reported a rise in purchases of mobility equipment as older people left their homes after their vaccinations and there was a jump in sales at garden centres, reflecting the boom in gardening over the past year.
Non-essential retailers in England reopened on April 12 along with pubs and restaurants operating outdoors, and from May 17 more restrictions are due to be lifted to allow indoor hospitality, performances and sporting events.
Both services and manufacturing companies increased staffing this month in preparation, the PMI survey showed.
""We now seem to be seeing the first evidence of the release of the pent-up demand that was built up over the many months of lockdown as restraints begin to be lifted,"" said Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank.
Sterling was little changed by the report.
The evidence of momentum in Britain came after data unexpectedly showed the euro zone economy also picked up pace April, despite slower progress in vaccinating the bloc's population.
Another survey published on Friday showed British consumer confidence this month rose to its highest since the start of the pandemic.
INFLATION UNCERTAINTY
The PMI for Britain's services sector rose to 60.1 in April from 56.3 in March, the highest reading since August 2014 and driven by consumer-facing businesses.
The PMI for the manufacturing sector, which accounts for around 10% of British economic output, rose to its highest since 1994 at 60.7, up from 58.9 in March. 
As in previous months, the reading was flattered by the way the survey interprets supply chain delays caused by the pandemic and to a lesser extent Brexit.

Both manufacturers and services companies reported rapid increases in cost pressures - something the Bank of England will be keeping an eye on.
""These prices will inevitably feed through to higher inflation as we head into the summer, though there's much uncertainty as to how long the inflationary impact will last,"" IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales jumped last month before a partial lifting of coronavirus restrictions, suggesting an economic rebound is under way, but official data also showed record peacetime government borrowing.
Sales volumes leapt by 5.4% in March from February with clothing retailers able to sell online benefiting especially as consumers got ready to venture out after being locked down for much of the past year.
Retailers also reported a rise in purchases of mobility equipment as older people left their homes after their vaccinations and there was a jump in sales at garden centres, reflecting the boom in gardening over the past year.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a much smaller month-on-month increase of 1.5%.
""March's strong rise in retail sales showed that the economy made a fair bit of progress even before non-essential retailers re-opened in April,"" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics. 
Sales were up 1.6% from February last year, before the pandemic hit, the Office for National Statistics said.
Separate data underscored the huge cost of the government's emergency programmes to prop up the economy last year.
Britain's government borrowed 303.1 billion pounds ($420.1 billion) in the 2020/21 financial year, which ended last month, a surge of 246 billion pounds on the previous year and the biggest share of the economy in peacetime.
Borrowing stood at 14.5% of economic output, the highest such ratio since 1946, after World War Two, when it was 15.2%.
Public debt stood at 2.14 trillion pounds, almost 98% of gross domestic product.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak last year ramped up spending on jobs and income protection, welfare and the health service and cut taxes as swathes of the economy were closed.
Britain's budget forecaster predicted in early March that overall borrowing would hit 355 billion pounds in 2020/21, but it has said since then it would probably come in a bit lower.
Friday's figures do not include 27.2 billion pounds of COVID-19 loan programme write-offs that the forecasters estimate will need to be made.
They have said borrowing in the current 2021/22 year will fall to 234 billion pounds, more than four times the deficit in 2019/20.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that forecast was now looking too high, given the prospect of a stronger economic recovery this year.
Britain's debt office said it planned to issue 252.6 billion pounds of government bonds in 2021/22, a 43.3 billion-pound cut to its March estimate.
SPENDING AND RECOVERY
Economic output slumped by almost 10% last year, its biggest collapse in more than three centuries, but it is expected to grow by more than 5% in 2021 and 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The Bank of England is waiting to see the extent to which households spend their lockdown savings as it assesses how long it needs to keep its huge stimulus plan in place.
British consumer sentiment hit its highest since the start of the pandemic this month, a survey showed, but the increase was smaller than economists had expected.

The ONS said retail sales were up 7.2% compared with March 2020 when the pandemic was spreading in most Western economies.
The ONS said the share of shopping done online slipped from a record high in February to 34.7% in March.

Purchasing managers’ indexes from the euro area’s two largest economies showed businesses were confident at the start of the second quarter that they’ll soon be able to put the pandemic crisis behind them, even as lockdowns persist amid continuously high infections.
“The short-term outlook is continuing to strengthen for French businesses,” said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr. “Previously growth had remained elusive due to an ongoing decline in the service sector.”
France’s services PMI rose to an 8-month high in April, while a tightening of coronavirus restrictions in Germany curbed a rebound in the sector that had started in March.
German factories, meanwhile, saw their order stock increase at the fastest pace in a decade. Shortages of raw materials and freight capacity pushed up input costs to the highest since 2011 and output prices to strongest in more than two years.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the manufacturing sector edged down only slightly to 66.4 from its record high of 66.6 reached in March. This beat a Reuters poll forecast for a reading of 65.8.
The PMI for activity in the services sector fell to 50.1 from 51.5. This was a bit weaker than expected but still above the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.
As a result, the preliminary composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, eased to 56.0 from its 37-month high of 57.3 in the previous month.
Companies hired new staff at a pace not seen since October 2018 and their backlogs of work increased to the highest level in more than 10 years, the survey showed.
In a sign of supply chain problems, input prices hit a 10-year high but firms managed to pass on their increased costs through higher output prices, suggesting that inflationary pressures could be building up.
""The imbalance of demand and supply across manufacturing supply chains continues to drive up businesses' costs, which are now rising at the fastest rate for more than a decade,"" IHS Markit analyst Phil Smith said.
He added, however, that while factory gate prices were more and more in line with strong demand for goods, services firms remained cautious with their pricing, meaning that the spillover effects to overall consumer prices could be limited.
The government is expected to raise its 2021 GDP growth forecast next Tuesday after Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hinted earlier this month that Berlin was mulling an upward-revision to its 3% estimate.

Germany is struggling to contain an aggressive third wave of coronavirus infections as efforts are complicated by the more contagious B117 variant of the coronavirus and a relatively slow introduction of vaccines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japanese mega-bank Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group has cut six members of its U.S. team, four in sell-side markets research, sales and trading, and two investment-banking advisors, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The job reductions were made in the last week, the source said, as the bank expands its fixed-income trading and debt capital markets businesses, for which has been hiring since mid-2020. 
With assets worth roughly $3.1 trillion, MUFG is hoping to use its sizeable balance sheet to venture further into primary and secondary fixed-income markets, the source said. Low borrowing costs globally and a stock market rally have produced a boom in capital markets activity this year.
The reshuffle at MUFG also reflects a long-running decline in sell-side analysis. Buy-side advisory firm Substantive Research in November published results https://substantiveresearch.com/matter/value-of-analyst-meetings-has-fallen-by-47-since-january-2020 of a survey showing that asset managers have nearly halved the prices they're willing to pay for sell-side research since January 2020, as meetings with analysts, which are typically in person, have become virtual.
Among those laid off was John Herrmann, who had previously been the director of interest rate strategy in MUFG's New York office, the source said. 
In response to a request for comment, Herrmann said ""I had a very good run for 8-1/2 years at MUFG. I was hoping to serve our clients for several more years, but a new horizon awaits. I hope to be back soon doing what I do best: forecasting the economy, the FOMC and the yield curve."" 
Among the additions, the bank announced https://www.mufgamericas.com/who-we-are/news/mufg-launch-capital-markets-strategy-group in October it had hired Tom Joyce from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to head up a new capital markets strategy group. Constrained resources at the bank meant that hiring Joyce, along with two capital markets strategists also from Deutsche Bank - Hailey Orr and Stephanie Kendal - came at the expense of existing MUFG employees, according to the source. 
On April 21, MUFG also announced https://www.mufgamericas.com/who-we-are/news/mufg-further-strengthens-its-us-macro-trading-platform-fixed-income-industry-veteran-hire that it had hired George Goncalves from rival  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) as head of U.S. macro strategy, to bolster its fixed income trading platform.

498,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 09:00PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s manufacturing activity expanded for a third month in April while a contraction in the service sector continued amid a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.
The au Jibun Bank Japan’s purchasing managers index for manufacturing sector activity rose 0.6 point to 53.3, while its measure of service sector activity was unchanged at 48.3. Numbers above 50 indicate an expansion and those below 50 signal a contraction.
Factory activity has been supported by a recovery in exports to the U.S. and China, Japan’s most important trade partners. Service activity took a hit from ongoing restrictions on businesses as Japan struggles to contain the latest wave of virus infections, forcing the government to recommend reinstating a state of emergency in key economic hubs such as Tokyo and Osaka.
“The boost in private sector activity was led by the manufacturing sector, as the larger services sector saw business activity deteriorate,” said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. “There is concern the impact of the pandemic will be prolonged further.”
If tighter restrictions are imposed, the emergency will likely limit the economic rebound for the current quarter that is expected following a contraction in the first quarter. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has maintained the government’s stance that the Tokyo Olympics will start in July, as planned, despite the emergency.

The companies signed up for $9.3 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.9 billion a year earlier. However, borrowings in March rose 26% from the previous month.
""The equipment finance industry appears poised to take advantage of an economic tailwind that is manifesting itself in an improving labor market, a continued low interest-rate environment, a strong corporate earnings season, and high business confidence that is creating demand for investment in commercial equipment,"" said ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta.  
""ELFA member organizations also report improving portfolio quality, which is reflective of their customers' ability to meet their payment obligations as the pandemic's grip on many businesses loosens."" 
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 77% in March, from 75.8% in February.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 13-month low last week, suggesting layoffs were subsiding and strengthening expectations for another month of blockbuster job growth in April as a re-opening economy unleashes pent-up demand.
While the labor market recovery is gaining speed, red flags are emerging in the housing market, the economy's star performer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales of previously-owned homes tumbled to a seven-month low in March as prices jumped to a record high amid an acute shortage of houses, other data showed on Thursday. Realtors warned that expensive homes could become a permanent feature of the market, worsening inequality.
Even as the economy is booming and the labor market scars are healing thanks to massive public aid from the government and increased COVID-19 vaccinations, there are still 17.4 million people collecting unemployment checks. 
""We are seeing claims drop across most states, which shows the jobs recovery has become more geographically broad-based,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""However, a growing number of Americans are out of work for longer, and it's those who are tougher to bring back into the labor force.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020, the Labor Department said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 617,000 applications for the latest week. 
It was the second straight week that claims were below the 700,000 level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses like restaurants and bars were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. There were large declines in filings in Texas and New York, as well as decreases in several other states.
Claims have remained elevated because of fraud, especially in California and Ohio. The enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved. 
The latest Labor Department data on first payments show only a fraction of claims were successful over the past months.
The weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through Sept. 6. Claims jumped to a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.
Including the PUA program, 699,798 people filed claims last week, squeaking below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

BROAD IMPROVEMENT
The United States has expanded COVID-19 vaccination eligibility to most American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, as well as 26% of the population overall, it said.
That, together with the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement. The resulting surge in demand has left businesses scrambling for workers. Retail sales raced to a record high in March and factories are humming.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. First-time filings have dropped from 765,000 in mid-March, boosting hopes for strong employment gains in April. 
The economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment, however, remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
""Job growth in the spring of 2021 is receiving a boost as better weather allows for more outdoor activity,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Job growth will remain very strong throughout 2021 and into 2022 thanks to vaccination efforts and stimulus payments that are supporting consumer spending.""
But the housing market is backpedaling. Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report on Thursday. The plunge reflected a supply squeeze, which boosted the median house price a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100. 
Sales are skewed towards large and more expensive homes. The NAR reported intense bidding wars, which it said could lead to discrimination against some buyers.
""Without an increase in supply, the society wealth division will widen with homeowners enjoying sizable equity gains while renters will struggle to become homeowners,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.
Still, housing remains supported by the recovering labor market. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 34,000 to 3.674 million in the week ended April 10. 
The so-called continuing claims have declined from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis. Part of the drop is likely because of people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which is limited to 26 weeks in most states.
For a graphic on Pandemic jobless relief rolls remain high:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoxyxopd/Pasted%20image%201619095828488.png

About 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended April 3. Another 492,999 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. There were 17.405 million people receiving benefits under all programs in early April.

502,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell to a seven-month low in March, pulled down by an acute shortage of properties, which is boosting prices and making owning a house more expensive for some first-time buyers.
Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales fell in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales at a rate of 6.19 million units in March. The second straight monthly decline in sales was flagged by a sharp decline in signed contracts and applications for home purchasing loans in February.
Existing home sales, which are counted at the closing of a contract, lag signings by a month or two. That means part of the drop in sales last month was due to harsh weather in February. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 12.3% on a year-on-year basis, remaining well above their pre-pandemic level. 
The housing market is experiencing a dearth of properties available for sale in the wake of strong demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations as the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of Americans to work from home and schooling to be conducted remotely. 
Though homebuilders have stepped up new home construction, they are grappling with record-high lumber prices as well as shortages of land and workers. 
Increased COVID-19 vaccinations, which are leading to broader economic re-engagement, could allow more homeowners to put houses on the market. The pandemic, now in its second year, likely caused some Americans to delay downsizing, starving the market of much-needed inventory. 
The median existing house price surged a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100 in March. But economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than speculation, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
There were 1.07 million previously owned homes on the market in March, up 3.9% compared to February. Supply plunged 28.2% from one year ago. At March's sales pace, it would take 2.1 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.3 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 

First-time buyers accounted for 32% of sales in March, up from 31% in February and down from 34% in March 2020.

Investing.com -- The improvement in the U.S. labor market continued last week as the service sector in particular built on recent gains thanks to the relaxation of lockdown measures across the country.
The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits fell to 547,000 last week, their lowest since the start of the pandemic, from an upwardly-revised 586,000 the week before, the Labor Department said in a weekly release.
The number of continuing claims under regular state programs fell to 3.764 million, from 3.708 million a week earlier. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims.
Analysts had expected initial claims to rise modestly to 617,000.
The broader measure of people claiming benefits under all unemployment-related insurance programs, which has been consistently volatile this year, rose by just under 500,000 to 17.405 million in the week through April 3.
""Unemployment Insurance claims dropped across most states, a positive indication that the decline is broad-based rather than the result of changes in just a few states,"" said Glassdoor senior economist Danial Zhao via Twitter. ""Claims are still over double pre-crisis levels, but at least are making progress.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers' hopes for an economic rebound rose to their strongest in 48 years this month as the country began to recover from the slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday.
The CBI said its quarterly survey of manufacturers also pointed to a revival of investment and hiring plans and continued concerns about higher costs.
""Phased reopening has lifted the mood among firms, notably driving orders, employment, and investment plans,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
""However, rising costs are an increasing concern for many businesses, and seem to be putting upward pressure on prices as firms try to protect their margins.""
The CBI said its quarterly business optimism gauge, based on a survey of 288 manufacturers between March 24 and April 14, jumped to +38, the highest since April 1973, from January's reading of -22.
Plans to invest in plant and machinery were the strongest since July 1997, with anecdotal evidence from firms that they had brought forward plans to take advantage of a temporary tax break announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak in March's budget.
""Manufacturers are much more optimistic about the future, now that Brexit is largely in their rear-view mirror and world trade is rebounding,"" economist Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
Export order growth was the highest since April 2019.
However, the CBI's separate monthly survey of manufacturers was somewhat less upbeat, with the orders balance falling to -8 from -5, below forecasts in a Reuters poll for a rise to +2.
The quarterly survey also showed the biggest increase in costs for manufacturers since April 2011.
""Anecdotes from manufacturers point to COVID-related supply disruption such as global container shortages leading to higher costs, with Brexit factors such as higher administration costs playing a compounding role,"" the CBI said.
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year, its biggest annual slump in more than 300 years, and the International Monetary Fund expects it to grow by just over 5% this year and next.

Factories were not directly affected by tougher lockdown rules introduced at the start of the year to control the spread of COVID-19, but many of their customers were.
Restrictions have started to ease following the roll-out of vaccines, with non-essential shops reopening on April 12 and pubs and restaurants resuming outdoor service.

LONDON (Reuters) - English and Welsh shoppers rushed back to clothes and furniture stores last week when they reopened after three months of COVID lockdown restrictions, but the novelty of dining and drinking outside rapidly faded.
The Office for National Statistics said credit and debit purchases of clothes and furniture jumped to 89% of pre-pandemic levels in the week to April 15, up by 26 percentage points on a week earlier.
The figures are based on high-value CHAPS payment data from credit and debit card processors collected by the Bank of England.
This data shows overall card spending rose to 91% of its level in February 2020 last week, up from 83% the week before when the Easter holiday weekend had reduced spending.
The number of shoppers in the week to April 17 rose to 75% of its level two years earlier, up by 31 percentage points on the previous week, and the volume of job adverts held at pre-pandemic levels.
Non-essential retailers in England and Wales reopened on April 12 for the first time since early January, and English pubs and restaurants were allowed to begin serving customers who booked outdoor seating.
The first day of opening brought a rush of diners and drinkers, but the appeal of eating and drinking outdoors in dry but cold weather had faded by the weekend.
Reservations on April 17 stood at 60% of their average level two years ago, down from 79% on April 12, according to data from booking website OpenTable produced for the ONS.

London saw especially weak bookings, with reservations just 44% of pre-pandemic levels.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland, resigned to having much to lose from a global overhaul of how multinational companies are taxed, has embarked on a damage limitation exercise that it hopes will let it and other low-tax economies retain some of their decades-old advantages.
After years of talks, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is confident of finding a consensus this year among 140 countries on rewriting international tax rules for the first time in a generation.
For Ireland, opposing the changes would risk a messier outcome of larger rivals going their own way.
Instead, it is trying to keep a proposed global minimum corporate tax as low as possible and allow companies to cut their tax bills in other ways, such as offsets for research and development - aims it shares with Hungary, another low-tax state and European Union outlier.
Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate has helped it beat economies 10 times its size to investments from, among others, the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), who all call it their home in the region.
Global momentum is building towards including a minimum tax that the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden wants set as high as 21%.
That would undermine an economic success story that directly accounts for around one in eight Irish jobs.
""The rate is the front line (for Ireland),"" said PWC Ireland Managing Partner Feargal O'Rourke, who has advised the Irish government and U.S. companies with operations there on corporate tax.
""There's also the question of a minimum rate on what? The method of calculation and how it interacts with, for example, research and development and intellectual property, that's all still in play."" 
Addressing an online tax conference organised by his government that 1,500 global participants signed up to on Wednesday, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said any deal had to allow small countries to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for material advantages enjoyed by larger states.
He also said an agreement must ""accommodate Ireland's 12.5% rate"" and facilitate innovation and investment, a nod to the niche Ireland has carved out as a tax-efficient location to hold intellectual property rights.
ALLIANCE OF SMALL ECONOMIES?
While its regime has been under fire for years - and was the subject of the EU's largest anti-competition order, a 13 billion euro ($15.65 billion) fine that Dublin and Apple overturned in court - Ireland does not have the bloc's lowest corporate tax rate.
Hungary's 9% rate has helped it become a magnet for foreign carmakers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz. BMW is planning a new assembly line there, while South Korea's SK Innovation has pledged $1.2 billion to build a battery plant.
Sharing Ireland's reservations over a global minimum tax, it too insists exemptions should be carved out for profits generated from real business activity such as research and development.
""During the fight against harmful tax evasion, it is important that this effort should not transform into a fight against competitive tax systems,"" Benedek Nobilis, a head of department at the Hungarian Finance Ministry wrote in an article for financial news website portfolio.hu last week.
Together with countries in the Baltics, Nordics as well as like-minded Singapore, where the corporate tax rate is 17%, Ireland and Hungary have found themselves in an ""alliance of small open economies"" at the OECD, said Gerard Brady, chief economist at Ibec, Ireland's main business lobby group.
Ibec represents Ireland on a business advisory panel to the OECD, where it has also been pushing for companies to be allowed reduce their effective tax rate below any global minimum. The technical basis for that will be what matters, Brady said.

""If they can do an agreement that includes tax incentives for research, recognition of real substantial activities... then a rate that is slightly above 12.5% would still leave Ireland with a competitive offering,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Tokyo will not host its motor show this year because of the global pandemic, organizers said on Thursday, underscoring Japan's struggle to contain both a resurgent outbreak and the widening economic fall-out.
The cancellation comes as the government is expected to issue a third state of emergency for Tokyo and a number of other prefectures that could last for about two weeks, according to media reports. 
The halting of the auto show, a marquee event of the country's most important industry, is also likely to raise more questions about the government's insistence that the delayed Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer.
The chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Akio Toyoda, said the group felt it was difficult to provide a safe environment amid surging coronavirus cases. The show is normally held around late October to early November.
Such cancellations are bad news for an economy that, like many around the world, has been badly hit by the pandemic. Some analysts said another state of emergency could push Japan back into recession if retailers are asked to close during the Golden Week holidays, which start next week and run through early May. 
""The risk of a double-dip recession has clearly heightened,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities. ""The impact of imposing curbs on Tokyo and Osaka alone would be quite big.""
Japan has so far avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic that has plagued many Western countries, with total cases so far at about 540,000 and a death toll of 9,707. But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm, coming just three months before the planned start of the Tokyo Olympics and amid a sluggish vaccination roll-out.
Tokyo 2020 organizers said a policeman who worked with the Olympic torch relay in western Kagawa prefecture had tested positive for the virus.
STRONGER CURBS
With thousands of new cases resulting from highly infectious strains of the virus, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday the government will decide this week whether to declare the state of emergency for major parts of the country.
The governors of Tokyo's neighbouring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures will request the same emergency measures as the capital, the Nikkei newspaper reported. Four western prefectures are also seeking emergency measures, media have reported, bringing businesses in the large swathes of the country under tighter operating hours.
The government is considering imposing the curbs from April 25 to May 11, Jiji news agency reported. It is also expected to weigh stronger curbs than those issued last time in January, such as requests for department stores and other big retailers to close.
""We need to take stronger and more targeted steps than before including requests (for shops) to close,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency on Thursday.
Tokyo reported 861 new cases on Thursday, the most since Jan. 29 during the third wave of the pandemic and previous state of emergency. Osaka prefecture reported 1,167, down slightly from a record.
Japan's economy has emerged from last year's severe slump thanks to robust exports. 
But analysts expect GDP to have shrunk in the first quarter due to the hit to consumption from the second emergency curbs that rolled out in January and say a second consecutive contraction in Q2 that would constitute a recession is possible. 

""The timing is not good,"" as it would hit service spending during the spring leisure season, said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, of the latest curbs.
Tsunoda cut his forecast for second-quarter GDP to a 0.5% quarter-on-quarter rise, half the previously projected pace.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Record-breaking Wall Street bank bond offerings in recent days are being driven by a combination of extraordinary market conditions and regulatory decisions that can be traced to the government's pandemic relief efforts, said analysts. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have or are planning to issue a total of $40 billion in debt, according to media reports. JPMorgan's $13 billion April 15 bond sale was briefly an industry record until it was topped the next day by Bank of America's $15 billion offering.
While the banks did not provide details on why they are raising the debt, analysts said a confluence of monetary and regulatory factors are driving the unprecedented cash grab, underscoring the increasingly tricky balancing act for Wall Street lenders as the economy emerges from the pandemic slump. 
That economic rebound driven by the vaccination roll-out and trillions of dollars of stimulus, combined with ultra-low interest rates, has made for excellent borrowing conditions on the heels of stellar first-quarter earnings.
After the U.S. Federal Reserve said in March that it would lift capital distribution curbs on banks that pass its June stress tests, many also want to have enough cash on hand to keep shareholders happy with increased stock buy backs.
""We are going to buy back a substantial amount ... as soon as we can,"" Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told analysts during the bank's earnings call prior to the bond sale.
On Monday, Goldman announced its own plans to buy back some preferred stock. 
GROWING DEPOSITS 
But it's not all good news. While the fire-hose of government stimulus gushing through the economy flattered bank earnings, it has also reduced loan growth and caused deposits to surge. In turn, banks have had to park those deposits with the Federal Reserve and in safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries. 
""These deposits are growing like crazy, but loans are not and common equity is not, and that creates a serious problem for the banks,"" said Dick Bove, an analyst with Odeon Capital Group.
""I've never seen this happen before.""
For some banks, those problems are regulatory. As of April 1, banks had to resume holding extra capital against Treasuries and Fed deposits after the central bank ended temporary pandemic relief that had allowed lenders to exclude those assets from a key capital calculation.
That ""supplementary leverage ratio"" (SLR) is an extra safeguard introduced following the decade-ago financial crisis that requires big banks to hold cash against assets regardless of their risk. With surging deposits, some banks may be looking to raise debt to ensure they operate comfortably within the ratio. 
""It's quite likely that the debt issuance may have been partly driven by the expiration of the SLR relief,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist with TD Securities.
Executives with both Goldman and Bank of America told analysts on first-quarter earnings calls they still had room to operate before reaching the leverage ratio threshold.
Morgan Stanley's debt offering was not driven by regulatory constraints, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Fed declined to comment.
JPMorgan, for its part, issued the bonds in part to address regulatory constraints, according to one person familiar with the matter. On its earnings call, the bank's executives flagged that deposit growth had increased its leverage, prompting Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak to criticize the rules. 

""Raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks, and cannot be good for the system in the long run.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate doubled to 2.2% in March, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday, as the central bank signaled economic slack would likely be absorbed earlier than it had previously forecast.
Previously, the Bank of Canada had said it would be 2023 before inflation returned sustainably to its 2% target. On Tuesday, the central bank said it would happen in the second half of next year. In the meantime, inflation would temporarily breach its target, the bank said. 
Part of the March price bounce is due to a statistical effect caused by a sharp deceleration last year during the coronavirus pandemic, Statscan said.
The bank also held its key overnight interest rate at a record low 0.25% as expected.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the annual rate to rise to 2.3% in March, up from 1.1% in February. Energy prices gained 19.1% on a year-on-year basis, while inflation excluding gasoline and food rose 0.9% versus a year ago.
""The headline spike, as expected, is largely an energy story, but there are some signs that underlying pressures are starting to show up,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at the Royal Bank of Canada. 
""The Bank of Canada's core measures also moved higher on the month, with two of them very slightly above the Bank of Canada's midpoint 2% inflation target,"" Janzen said.
CPI common, which the central bank calls the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was 1.5%, slightly higher than the 1.4% forecast by analysts. 
CPI median rose to 2.1% from 2.0% in February, and CPI trim was 2.2% in March, up from a revised 2.0% in the previous month.
But Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said the annual rate is not being driven solely by a statistical effect.
""This isn't just base effect-driven, it's pretty remarkable resilience in terms of underlying inflation pressures,"" he said.
The bank now expects Canada's economy will grow 6.5% in 2021, up from its January forecast of 4.0%, with real GDP growth of 3.7% in 2022, down from a previous forecast of 4.8%.

After the Bank of Canada announcement, the Canadian dollar strengthened 0.9% to 1.2499 to the greenback, or 80.01 U.S. cents, its biggest gain since last June.

Investing.com – The Canadian dollar USD/CAD strengthened against the greenback after some initial hiccups in Wednesday’s trade, boosted by the country’s central bank forecasting a better economy.
Bank of Canada kept the key interest rate unchanged at 0.25%.
The Bank said it expects economy to grow 6.5% in 2021, up from its January forecast of 4%, with real GDP growth of 3.7% in 2022, down from a previous forecast of 4.8%. It now sees U.S. economic growth this year at 7%, up from 5%.
The Bank said the economy still needs “extraordinary monetary policy support” and that it is committed to holding the policy interest rate lower “until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2% inflation target is sustainably achieved.""
Nonetheless, improving economic indicators are behind the bank’s decision to trim its federal government bond purchases that were aimed at reviving the economy.
Effective April 26, weekly net purchases of government of Canada bonds will be adjusted to a target of $3 billion, the central bank said.
Like what many in several markets have feared their central banks will do, it suggested rates could rise sooner than the previous forecast of sometime in 2023.
Canada's annual inflation rate doubled to 2.2% in March, in part due to a statistical difference caused by the sharp deceleration last year during the pandemic and because of rising energy prices, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top of the 1% to 3% inflation-control range, the central bank said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell for a second month in a row to 4.9% in the December-to-February period, most of which the country spent under a tight COVID-19 lockdown, official figures showed on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had largely forecast that the jobless rate - which has been held down by the government's huge jobs subsidies programme - would edge up to 5.1% from 5.0% in the three months to January. 
The ONS linked the fall to a large volume of men leaving the jobs market altogether. The so-called inactivity rate rose by 0.2 percentage points in the three months to February, echoing a rise during the first lockdown of last year.
There was another reminder of the precarious state of the labour market in figures from Britain's tax office which showed the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 56,000 between February and March, the first decline in four months.
That pushed up the total number of jobs lost since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic to 813,000 - more than half of which were held by people aged under 25, with hospitality-heavy London the hardest-hit region, the ONS said.
""If we don't act quickly, in particular by focusing our support on the long-term unemployed, then we are risking another lost generation,"" Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said.
Some 363,000 people are classed as long-term unemployed after having been out of work for a year or more but with a similar number in the six-to-12-month bracket, that figure could soon rise sharply.
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% in 2020, a bigger slump than almost all its European peers, after it locked down later and for longer than many of them. 
But helped by the fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, it is in the process of lifting its third lockdown while other countries in Europe have recently tightened their restrictions.
The ONS said there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality which reopened for outdoor business last week.
FURLOUGH TAPER 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak in March extended his furlough scheme - which pays the wages of around one in five employees - until the end of September although employers will have to start contributing towards some of its costs from July. 
Without the scheme, the jobless rate would be far higher - a year ago, Britain's budget forecasters said it could hit 10%. 
The Bank of England will be watching how many jobs are lost when it expires as it considers how long it needs to keep its huge economic stimulus programme in place.
Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said long-term unemployment, particularly among young people, might mean progress towards pre-pandemic levels in the labour market lags behind the wider economic recovery.
""Further action will be needed to support the labour market when the furlough scheme ends, including supporting businesses to recruit and retain staff through a temporary cut in employer national insurance contributions,"" he said.

Britain's headline measure of pay growth again rose strongly in the three months to February, up 4.5% in annual terms. 
But the ONS said the reading was skewed higher by a drop in the number of lower-paid and part-time jobs. After accounting for this, pay growth was much weaker at 2.5%, it estimated.

The central bank is also seen projecting inflation to hover around 1% in fiscal 2023, the paper said without citing sources.

The BOJ currently expects core consumer prices to rise 0.5% in the year that began in April.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts rose 21.6% in March compared with the previous month, easily beating expectations and hitting a new record, data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation showed on Monday.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts rose to 335,200 units in March, well ahead of analyst expectations for 250,000 units, and a new high for all months on record. 
Much of the gain was on multiple urban starts, which jumped 33.8% to 222,358 units. Single-detached urban starts rose 3.6% to 78,615 units.
""The big acceleration came as weather was unseasonably warm in many parts of the country,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Economics, said in a note.
Mendes added that new home construction will likely be a major contributor to overall GDP growth again in 2021, even as building activity cools off from the ""torrid pace"" of recent months.
Canada's average home selling price soared an eye-watering 31.6% year-over-year in March, hitting a new high as sales also climbed to a new all-time record, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) said earlier this month.
A supply imbalance has been blamed for skyrocketing home prices through the pandemic, though new listings surged in March, which, coupled with strong starts, suggests a more balanced market could be coming.
""Red-hot demand for real estate propelled a record month for housing starts in March. While the market will need a long stretch of supply growth to have a meaningful effect on prices, the March numbers are a solid start,"" said Shelly Kaushik, an economist with BMO Capital Markets in a note.

Canada's ruling Liberals are set to unveil their first full budget in two years on Monday, with billions in pandemic supports as COVID-19 infections skyrocket, a national daycare plan and new taxes on luxury goods.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog is scrutinizing mortgage servicers' compliance with pandemic relief programs amid concerns struggling homeowners are not getting the help they need to avoid foreclosures, or are being discriminated against, said a dozen people with knowledge of the regulatory effort.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) crackdown by its policy, supervision and enforcement divisions could result in stiff penalties for those mortgage servicers found to have hurt borrowers, the regulatory officials, lawyers and industry executives said.
In recent weeks, the agency has sent data requests to mortgage servicers, usually a company or a bank that processes mortgage repayments. It is seeking data on how they are handling mortgage holiday or ""forbearance"" programs and whether the temporary debt relief is likely to get borrowers back on their feet, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter, some of whom asked to remain anonymous because aspects of the discussions are private. 
The agency has also opened probes into a handful of mortgage servicers over their handling of forbearance requests, three other people with knowledge of the matter said. 
""We are very concerned and we're watching closely,"" said one of the people. ""Our supervision team is robustly asking for more data than ever from servicers."" 
The effort underscores the tougher stance the new Democratic leadership of the consumer watchdog is taking towards the financial industry as it executes President Joe Biden's priorities to help Americans recover from the pandemic, boost fair housing and address systemic racial injustice. 
""The CFPB is focused on protecting consumers financially harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" a CFPB spokeswoman told Reuters. 
""Part of that work is using our supervisory authority to ensure mortgage servicers are treating borrowers fairly and meeting their responsibilities under federal law.""
'VERY CONCERNED'
To help Americans weather pandemic lockdowns, Congress last year gave many struggling homeowners the right to pause mortgage repayments and imposed a moratorium on foreclosures. Both safeguards have since been extended several times and are due to expire later this year. 
As of April 4, an estimated 2.3 million homeowners were in forbearance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
Last year, as servicers battled a flood of forbearance requests, the CFPB cut firms slack, but it is now taking a much tougher stance as it aims to prevent a foreclosure crisis, the sources said. 
""It already has started drilling down in its examinations and investigations of firms' activities, and the pace will only increase,"" said Quyen Truong, partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.
According to the six sources, the agency is examining a range of issues: how many and which borrowers are in forbearance; whether loan modifications will succeed in getting borrowers repaying; if servicers have been obstructing or delaying forbearance requests or granting only partial relief; and if some servicers have been discriminating against borrowers based on race or ethnicity, whether deliberately or inadvertently.
Home equity loan delinquencies rose 1.65 percentage points to 5.82% in the fourth quarter of 2020, the first rise since April 2020, the latest American Bankers Association data shows.
""We remain very concerned about a potential wave of borrowers seeking assistance after the emergency protections expire later this year, and we will use our regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory authorities to prevent avoidable foreclosures,"" said the CFPB spokeswoman. 
Pete Mills of the Mortgage Bankers Association pointed out that ""record numbers"" of Americans had so far exited forbearance without losing their homes and said he hoped the CFPB uses the data gathered from servicers ""to guide, rather than penalize, the industry"" on how to best help homeowners in forbearance. 
STAVING OFF A FORECLOSURE CRISIS 
The CFPB was created after the 2009 financial crisis to police the type of predatory lending that drove the sub-prime mortgage and subsequent foreclosure crisis, penalizing dozens of mortgage firms in its early years.
Former President Donald Trump's administration weakened the agency's enforcement and some protections, say consumer groups, but the pendulum has quickly swung back as the new leadership has moved https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-financial-regulators-analys/analysis-with-quick-fixes-bidens-agencies-reverse-trumps-wall-street-friendly-rules-idUSKBN2BZ16N to bolster fair lending protections.
This month the agency warned servicers to take ""all necessary steps"" to prevent a wave of foreclosures and rattled the mortgage industry by proposing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cfpb-mortgages/u-s-consumer-watchdog-proposes-lifeline-of-sorts-for-struggling-mortgage-borrowers-idUSKBN2BS1KG to bar foreclosures until next year. 
According to a January report, the CFPB found during 2020 examinations that some servicers gave customers ""incomplete or inaccurate information"" on their forbearance rights, delayed processing requests, or erroneously charge late payment fees.
The CFPB complaint website has hundreds of testimonies from borrowers detailing problems with, or issues resulting from, their forbearance plans.

One borrower, writing on the website last month after allegedly receiving misinformation on their plan, accused their provider of ""very bad faith and trickery.""

517,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 01:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- After fueling its V-shaped recovery by boosting spending on housing and infrastructure, China appears in no rush to drop its investment-led growth model despite international calls for it to “rebalance” its economy.
First quarter data released Friday underlined just how reliant China remains on its current approach: investment spending rose 6% compared with a 4.2% increase in retail sales, based on two-year average growth rates to strip out base effects from last year’s coronavirus lockdowns.
The International Monetary Fund and others have long argued that China’s unusually heavy dependence on investment in infrastructure and property has led to an unbalanced economy. While it’s helped to fuel decades of rapid growth, critics say it’s also led to a reliance on debt -- which could spark a financial crisis -- and overcapacity in the economy, as has happened in the past in industries like steel and coal.
Raising the share of household consumption would help to “rebalance” the economy, the argument goes. At about 43% of gross domestic product, China has one of the highest investment ratios of any major economy, while consumption is about 38%.
Justin Yifu Lin, a former chief economist at the World Bank who was an adviser to President Xi Jinping last year, said in an interview that calls for consumption-led growth “are not supported by empirical evidence or economic theory.” He argues that high investment in new infrastructure and equipment enables workers to be more productive and raises their income, in turn increasing consumption.
“If I’m an ordinary person what I care about will be the growth rate of consumption. We’d like to have higher consumption, but not necessarily a higher consumption ratio,” he said. Any increase in China’s consumer spending share in the next five years “will be gradual,” he said.
Growth Sources
That message is echoed by the central bank. In a working paper last week, People’s Bank of China researchers led by Chen Hao wrote that “consumption has never been a source of growth” and that “we attach importance to investment.” They singled out the U.S. as a warning, arguing that excessive consumption and low savings fueled a large trade deficit and contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The pandemic increased China’s gap between investment and consumption as Beijing aimed financial aid at companies to resume production, rather than handing cash to households. The U.S. Treasury said in a report last week that China’s lack of government support for households had fueled its rising trade surplus in 2020, calling on Beijing to “take decisive steps” to allocate more resources to consumers.
Lin says declining household consumption and an increased trade surplus are short-term effects of the pandemic and Beijing doesn’t need aggressive policies to counter them.
“Once the world returns to a normal situation I think the structure will spontaneously adjust back to the more balanced pattern,” he said.
In the longer term, because China is the leading producer of consumer goods but relies on other countries for raw materials it uses for investment, increasing the consumption share would not have a direct effect on the country’s trade surplus, Lin said. China’s current account surplus, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, fell below 2% of GDP before the coronavirus pandemic, even as it maintained a high investment rate.
The share of consumer spending in China’s GDP will increase at a slower pace in the next few years and economic growth still needs the support of investment, said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the China Association of Policy Science’s economic policy committee, a think tank affiliated with the ruling Communist Party’s Central Committee. There’s still a lack of infrastructure to support urbanization and an aging population, he added.
There are other indications that Beijing’s consumption push will be muted. The government’s latest five-year plan released last month predicts that the share of household income in GDP, the main determinant of consumer spending power, will remain roughly constant through to 2025. Beijing plans to invest the equivalent of trillions of dollars in digital infrastructure and green energy over the next five years.
‘Demand-Side Reforms’
Late last year, the Communist Party called for “demand-side reform,” a pledge that many interpreted as emphasizing policies aimed at creating a more equal distribution of household income. Since those with lower incomes tend to save less, re-distributive policies could increase consumption without raising the overall household income share.
Yet the five-year plan shifted language to “demand side management,” which is a “less ambitious formulation,” according to Andrew Batson, a China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics. Bejing has announced plans to increase consumption this year, but “none of these policy goals are associated with quantitative targets, or seem sizable enough to move the needle on aggregate consumer spending,” Batson wrote in a note. “The government does not actually have a plan to boost consumption.”
Some Chinese economists worry that investment spending is too low, rather than too high. Former central bank adviser Yu Yongding last week argued for a faster rate of increase in government infrastructure spending to boost growth, dismissing fears that added debt will increase financial risks.
“An inadequate economic growth rate will increase, rather than reduce, vulnerabilities of the financial environment,” he wrote in the state-run China Daily.

The shipments in March were the highest by value since $18.882 million in September last year. 
China imported $1.308 million of North Korean goods in March compared with $1.75 million in February. 

Early last year, North Korea banned almost all cross-border travel, and some countries including Britain, France and Germany withdrew their local representatives.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports posted their strongest growth in more than three years in March, led by a surge in China-bound shipments, in a sign the economic recovery from last year's deep coronavirus slump remains intact.
However, the trade data is unlikely to completely ease worries about the fragile recovery of the world's third-largest economy, which took an enormous hit from a collapse in global trade due to the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020.
Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday exports surged 16.1% in March from a year earlier, marking the steepest rise since November 2017. That was better than an 11.6% jump expected by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 4.5% contraction in February.
""The rebound in exports slowed significantly across Q1 and external demand is unlikely to provide much of a tailwind to growth this year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The impressive annual figure was down to base effects from the weakness in exports in March 2020.""
The exports surge was also marked by especially strong shipments to Japan's largest trading partner China, while the pace of recovery in firms' exports to the United States remained relatively slow, said analysts.
""Most exports to China aren't very high-tech, and there's the possibility there will be restrictions amid rising U.S.-China tensions,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, soared 37.2% in the year to March, led by nonferrous metals and plastic materials, and also boosted by stronger exports of semiconductor machinery.
However, Japan's economy was likely to face headwinds from a slower recovery in U.S.-bound shipments, which tend to add more value than those exported to China and elsewhere in Asia, for at least another couple of months, he added.
Exports to the United States, the world's top economy, rose 4.9% to post their first year-on-year gain in five months, as strong demand for cars and construction machinery such as bulldozers offset lower shipments of aircrafts.
Shipments to Asia as a whole gained 22.4%, while those to the European Union advanced 12.8% in March.
Imports rose 5.7% in March compared with the same month a year earlier, versus the median estimate for a 4.7% increase, bringing a trade surplus of 663.7 billion yen ($6.11 billion) versus the median estimate for a 490.0 billion yen surplus.

The trade data follows the Reuters Tankan poll on Friday that found confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose to a more than two-year high in April as strong demand in the electronics market boosted prospects for exporters.

Asking prices jumped by 2.1% in the five weeks to April 10, only the second time in five years that prices have risen by more than 2% from one month to the next, Rightmove said.
The rise took the average price of property coming to market to an all-time high of 327,797 pounds ($451,737) and homes were selling in record-fast time, it said.
On March 3 Sunak said he would extend a temporary tax break for buyers and he also announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers who cannot afford large deposits.
The tax break was rushed out in 2020 to counter the economic hit from coronavirus. It helped to fuel a mini-boom in the housing market which was already seeing strong demand from people seeking more space after their first lockdown.
Other measures of British house prices have also shown a rise since Sunak's announcement.
Rightmove said its measure of available properties was at a record low.
""However some of the froth is likely to come off this spring surge later in the year as the challenging economic conditions come to the fore, some of the government support to individuals and businesses unwinds, and the stamp duty holidays finally end in England and Wales,"" it said.

Planned payments stand at 97.4 billion euros, an increase of 5.5 billion euros ($6.59 billion) compared to previous estimate, the Finance Ministry said on Sunday.
Meanwhile, tax revenue is likely to come in 2.6 billion euros less than had been expected at 72.5 billion euros, boosting the forecast budget deficit by 8.1 billion euros to 30.7 billion euros.
Altogether, the general government debt ratio will rise 1.7 percentage points to 89.6% of gross domestic product, the government said.
""We're adjusting the budget to secure further resources for healthcare and economic aid,"" Finance Minister Gernot Bluemel said, adding the move follows budget revisions in neighbouring Germany and Switzerland. 
The action comes after Austria's Wifo institute, which provides forecasts for the government, said in March that in a ""lockdown scenario"" the country's GDP in the current year would grow only 1.5%, lower than an estimated 2.3% growth if lockdowns were lifted soon.
As it stands, Austria is planning broad easing in mid-May, but the government said that these budget changes were needed as the crisis persists. 
""I always said, if more money is needed, there will be more money,"" Bluemel said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. homebuilding surged to nearly a 15-year high in March, but soaring lumber prices amid supply constraints could limit builders' capacity to boost production and ease a shortage of homes that is threatening to slow housing market momentum. 
The sharp rebound reported by the Commerce Department on Friday added to robust retail sales in March in suggesting that the economy was roaring after a brief weather-related setback in February. Increasing COVID-19 vaccinations, warmer weather and massive fiscal stimulus are driving the economy, with growth this year expected to be the strongest in nearly four decades.
But caution is starting to creep in among consumers as the course of the pandemic remains uncertain and inflation is showing signs of heating up. Other data on Friday showed consumer sentiment rose moderately in early April.
""We're in a unique situation with the economy beginning to rebound from the worst of the pandemic,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Uncertainties remain, with many businesses yet to reopen, unemployment still high, and COVID-19 levels lower but persistent.""
Housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month, the highest level since June 2006. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.613 million units in March.
Starts soared 37.0% on a year-on-year basis in March. Homebuilding slumped in February as large parts of the country reeled from unseasonably cold weather, including winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely-populated South region.
Groundbreaking activity increased in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but fell in the West. Permits for future home building rose 2.7% to a rate of 1.766 million units last month, recouping only a fraction of February's 8.8% plunge. They jumped 30.2% compared to March 2020.
""While housing demand is expected to remain strong, we expect it to diminish somewhat as the year progresses,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. ""Homebuilders continue to face supply constraints, including increasing prices of lumber and other materials.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher, with the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting fresh record highs. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
RECORD LUMBER PRICES 
The housing market is being fueled by demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations, with millions of Americans continuing to work from home and remote schooling remaining in place as the pandemic enters its second year. Housing supply has been insufficient, with the inventory of previously-owned homes at record lows. This is underpinning homebuilding.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Thursday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders increased in April amid strong buyer traffic. Builders appealed for solutions ""to increase the supply of building materials as the economy runs hot in 2021.""
Inflation concerns were on consumers' minds early this month. A separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed its preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to 86.5 from a final reading of 84.9 in March. 
Economists had forecast the index would rise to 89.6. 
The survey's one-year inflation expectation jumped to 3.7%, the highest level in nearly a decade, from 3.1% in March. Its five-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.7%.
Reports this month showed big increases in both consumer and producer prices in March as strong domestic demand pushed against supply constraints. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and many economists view higher inflation as transitory, with supply chains expected to adapt and become more efficient.
Supply disruptions because of coronavirus-related restrictions are driving up commodity prices. Softwood lumber, which is used for frames and trusses of houses, surged by a record 83.4% on a year-on-year basis in March, according to the latest producer price data published last week. Prices of other building materials such as plywood have also risen sharply.
Port congestion on the West Coast as well as winter weather in Canada that has shut mills and restricted truck shipping were also contributing to the shortages that were driving prices of building materials higher, according to an Institute for Supply Management survey published early this month.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, surged 15.3% to a rate of 1.238 million units in March. Still, starts remained below last December's peak, likely constrained by the more expensive building materials. 
Single-family building permits rose 4.6% to a rate of 1.199 million units.
""The failure of single-family starts to fully recover to last winter's peak level despite tight inventories in most metropolitan areas supports the idea builders are holding back,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment soared 30.8% to a pace of 501,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects fell 1.2% to a pace of 567,000 units.
Housing completions accelerated 16.6% to a rate of 1.580 million units last month, the highest since March 2007. Single-family home completions shot up 5.3% to a rate of 1.099 million, the highest since November 2007.

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction rose 0.8% to a rate of 1.306 million units, the highest since September 2006.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers are discussing on Friday how to improve and possibly unify insolvency laws across the 19-nation bloc, to better prepare for a wave of bankruptcies expected when companies are weaned off government emergency pandemic support.
The expected surge in EU corporate bankruptcies will have a knock-on effect on the number of bad loans banks have to handle as the post-pandemic economic recovery starts to take hold and governments begin withdrawing state schemes that are now keeping many non-viable companies on life support.
But insolvency laws differ from country to country, making it more difficult for the euro zone to deal with the problem. The issue threatens to hamper economic growth as assets of insolvent companies are frozen during lengthy legal processes rather being quickly re-deployed in the economy.
""National insolvency regimes across the EU differ in their design and in their practical implementation,"" the European Commission said in a paper for the ministers' discussions.
""(They) embody choices made regarding the appropriate balance between creditor and debtor interests ... the priority enjoyed by employees, public utilities and tax authorities in the process,"" the paper said.
It said euro zone countries should, for instance, agree on a definition of insolvency and when a company should be obliged to undergo formal insolvency proceedings. 
It would also help if there was a common view on actions to replenish the insolvency estate in case of fraud, on asset tracing, the ranking of claims, including the position of secured creditors in insolvency and on court capacity, it said.
""The Commission will consider either proposing a legislative instrument for minimum harmonisation of certain targeted elements of corporate insolvency laws, or coming forward with a non-legislative initiative to increase convergence,"" it said.
Unifying these laws would involve justice ministries, adding an additional layer of difficulty, a senior euro zone official said. ""It may be realistic that we will have to look for non- legislative steps to promote convergence,"" the official said.

Such non-legislative steps would involve making sure that judicial systems in every country have proper resources and that backlogs of cases in courts are tolerable. Setting EU benchmarks to reach could help, the official said.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said EU imports from Britain dropped 47.0% year-on-year in January-February to 16.6 billion euros ($19.9 billion) while exports to the United Kingdom declined only 20.2% to 39.8 billion euros.
As a result, the EU's trade surplus with Britain rose to 23.2 billion euros in the first two months after Britain's Brexit transition period expired from 18.6 billion euros in the same period of 2020, when London still enjoyed unfettered access to the EU's single market.
Eurostat said the euro zone's unadjusted trade surplus with the rest of the world fell to 17.7 billion euros in February from 23.4 billion in February 2020. However, because of a strong January, the two-month cumulative result was still better than last year showing a surplus of 28.7 billion euros against 25.0 billion euros in Jan-Feb 2020.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade surplus with the rest of the world was 18.4 billion in February after 28.7 billion in January as exports fell 2.5% on the month while imports rose 3.4%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter to record growth of 18.3% from last year's deep coronavirus slump, propelled by stronger demand at home and abroad and continued government support for smaller firms.
But the brisk expansion, heavily skewed by the plunge in activity a year earlier, is expected to moderate later this year as the government turns its attention to reining in financial risks in overheating parts of the economy.
While the jump in gross domestic product (GDP) undershot the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, the official data showed it was the fastest growth since quarterly records began in 1992 and up from 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year.
""The upshot is that with the economy already above its pre-virus trend and policy support being withdrawn, China's post-COVID rebound is levelling off,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior china economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect quarter-on-quarter growth to remain modest during the rest of this year as the recent boom in construction and exports unwinds, pulling activity back towards trend.""
Aided by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan rapidly became a crippling pandemic that has killed about 3 million worldwide.
China's rebound has been led by exports as factories raced to fill overseas orders and more recently a steady pickup in consumption as shoppers returned to restaurants, malls and car dealerships.
Retail sales increased 34.2% year-on-year in March, beating a 28.0% gain expected by analysts and stronger than the 33.8% jump seen in the first two months of the year.
Other data, however, showed a moderation in expansion with quarter-on-quarter growth slowing to 0.6% in January-March from a revised 3.2% in the previous quarter, missing expectations for a 1.5% increase.
Factory output grew 14.1% year-on-year in March, slowing from a 35.1% surge in the January-February period and lagging a forecast 17.2% rise.
SLOWDOWN EXPECTED
National Bureau of Statistics spokeswoman Liu Aihua told a news conference on Friday while the economy started 2021 on a firm footing, the services sector and smaller firms still faced challenges, while consumer inflation was likely to remain moderate.
Data last week showed consumer prices rising at only a modest pace in March, even as factory gate inflation hit a near three-year high.
""Looking forward, the trend of normalisation may continue for the rest of the year, and domestic consumption is expected to be the major growth driver,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai.
""In terms of policy response, the central bank and fiscal authorities are returning to a more neutral stance, although some selective measures might be continued in order to support the small and medium-sized enterprises.""
Li Wei, economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) in Shanghai, expected second-quarter growth to slow to 7%.
FOCUS ON RISKS
The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow 8.6% in 2021, according to a Reuters poll, which would easily beat the government's 2021 annual growth target of above 6%.
China's GDP grew just 2.3% rise last year, its weakest expansion in 44 years but still making it the only major economy to avoid contraction as other industrial powers struggled with the pandemic hit.
With the economy back on a more solid footing, China's central bank is turning its focus to cooling credit growth to help contain financial risks.
However, it is treading cautiously to avoid derailing the recovery with policymakers vowing not to make any sudden policy shifts.
Authorities are especially concerned about financial risks involving the country's overheated property market and have asked banks to trim their loan books this year to guard against asset bubbles.

Separate data on Friday showed new home prices in China rising at the fastest pace in seven months in March, with gains spreading to more cities as red-hot demand defied government efforts to cool the market.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Property purchases in China funded through bank loans fraudulently obtained by speculators are fuelling already red-hot real estate markets in its biggest cities and beginning to alarm regulators.
Four tier-1 Chinese cities, including Shenzhen and Shanghai, have reported since March that a probe by financial regulators found that 877.8 million yuan ($134.21 million) of bank loans were improperly used for property purchases.
Analysts say that was just the tip of the iceberg and the number could be significantly higher nationwide.
""The amount (of misused loans) could be hundreds of billions of yuan in China's tier-1 and 2 cities,"" said Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International in Hong Kong, an estimate based on assumptions including 2020 transactions and loan volumes. 
The illegal diversion of bank funds presents a policy dilemma for Beijing, which wants to keep credit lines open to support businesses while ensuring loans are not misused. 
Home prices in large cities have soared since last year, fuelled by relentless speculation that Beijing has so far failed to suppress, and in many cases funded by business loans granted by banks.
Regulators are worried genuine credit demand may get crowded out by the illegal property loans. They have asked local governments for a report on such loans by May 31.
""In some red-hot cities with strong expectations of home price gains and high levels of speculation, there are cases in which people fraudulently obtain business loans from banks for home purchases, and some even involved organised criminal activity,"" Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the central bank, told a media briefing on Monday.
""If this can't be contained immediately, it will not only affect the effect of property regulatory policies, it will also squeeze out credit resources for the real economy, especially for smaller firms."" 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) and Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
WHISTLEBLOWER
Big Chinese cities have imposed onerous conditions on buying residential property, including requiring buyers to have residential permits for up to five years and to fork up at least 30% of the purchase price in cash. 
People, though, have come up with ways to try and circumvent them.
In an instance last year, an unidentified woman detailed her plan in an ad posted in some WeChat groups, seeking a joint investor among their over 3,000 members for a Shenzhen property purchase.
The so-called ""stakeholder"" would fund part of the 30% down-payment on a 7 million yuan apartment in the city, and they would jointly borrow the remaining 4.9 million yuan.
She would then use the home as collateral to apply for business loans via a shell company, and repay the 4.9 million yuan with the new bank loans, which carry lower interest rates compared to mortgage loans. 
The two would later resell the home at a higher price and repay all outstanding debt. She would get a 5% cut from the sale. 
The scheme was outlined in 102 screenshots of WeChat chat histories by an anonymous whistleblower on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) last week. 
""I've been exposing their tactics for a while, and it's my third Weibo account as the previous ones were shut or suspended by the platform, but I knew it wasn't going to be easy,"" the whistleblower told Reuters.
Shenzhen authorities said last week they will investigate the WeChat groups described in the whistleblower's posts.

Investing.com – China’s economy soared in the first quarter on a yearly basis. Consumer spending also strengthened, suggesting a more balanced recovery on a quarterly basis from the investment and export-fueled rebound from 2020’s COVID-19-induced lockdowns.
Economic data released earlier in the day said that the GDP for the first quarter grew a record 18.3% year-on-year and 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in March. Both were lower than the 19% and the 1.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Yearly growth soared from the 6.5% growth recorded in the first quarter of 2020, although the figures were skewed by the comparison with those from 2020, when China imposed a strict lockdown as the COVID-19 pandemic spread.
The country’s economic recovery has progressed at a remarkable speed, with the losses from a recorded contraction in the first quarter of 2020 all but recovered by the end of September 2020. Strong industrial output and robust exports as COVID-19 fueled demand for Chinese-made medical goods and electronic devices also gave the recovery a leg up.
“We are seeing a bit more balanced recovery in the Chinese economy,” UBS AG chief China economist Wang Tao told Bloomberg.
As monetary and fiscal policy starts to normalize, property and infrastructure investment are set to slow in the next few quarters, “that early pickup in the construction industry is going to give way to more household consumption,” she added.
Meanwhile, the quarterly growth, a better reading of the economy’s momentum, was slower than the 2.6% growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Wang credited the slower growth to a fresh COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of 2021, the subsequent travel restrictions over the Lunar New Year holiday in February and a lack of additional fiscal stimulus.
However, policymakers are wary of the increasing pace of economic recovery indicated by stellar yearly growth in GDP, which is also leading to rising inflation and soaring debt levels. The government has signaled a scale back in fiscal and monetary stimulus and is also tightening regulatory oversight in lending and real estate among other sectors.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stood at 5.3%, slightly down from the previous reading of 5.5%."

The recovery in the world's third-largest economy has been led by improving output and exports, but slow vaccine rollouts and a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases are clouding the outlook for consumption.
Next week's key data includes core consumer inflation, which is expected to fall for the eight consecutive month as price pressures remained low due to weak consumer demand.
Exports likely rose 11.6% in March from a year earlier, which would mark the sharpest rise since January 2018, the poll of 16 economists showed.
Imports were forecast to have grown 4.7% in March from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 490.0 billion yen ($4.5 billion).
Japan's economy suffered greatly from a shakeout in global trade due to the pandemic in the first quarter of last year, when it entered a recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years.
""Exports are again expected to turn positive compared to a year earlier, as they started to decline greatly in March last year due to the impact of the coronavirus,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
""While the rising trend that is driven by strong demand for capital and information-related goods continues, it is slowing down slightly.""
The finance ministry announces trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (2350 GMT Sunday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have fallen 0.1% in March compared to the same month a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.
The pace of decline, however, was expected to remain moderate as rising energy prices increasingly offset the downward pressure from lacklustre consumer spending due to the pandemic.

The figures released by the statistics bureau Friday are skewed by comparisons from a year ago when the economy was in lockdown. A better reading of the economy’s momentum comes from quarter-on-quarter growth, which slowed to 0.6% from 2.6% in the previous three months.
China’s economy steadily picked up pace after an historic contraction in the first quarter of last year, recovering all its lost ground by the end of September. The rebound has been led by strong industrial output and robust exports as the pandemic fueled demand for Chinese-made medical goods and electronic devices.
Bumper GDP growth, rising inflation and soaring debt levels have put policy makers on guard. Beijing has signaled it wants to scale back fiscal and monetary stimulus now that the recovery is gathering pace, and is tightening regulatory oversight in areas such as lending and real estate. The central bank has asked banks to curtail loan growth in coming months, though officials have stressed a gradual tapering of policy.
Globally, the rollout of vaccines is helping to bolster the world economy and underpinning China’s growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose by the most in 10 months in March as Americans received additional pandemic relief checks from the government and increased COVID-19 vaccinations allowed broader economic re-engagement, cementing expectations for robust growth in the first quarter.
The brightening economic prospects were underscored by other data on Thursday showing first-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to the lowest level since March 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the spread of the first COVID-19 wave.
Though output at factories rebounded modestly last month amid a global semi-conductor chip shortage that is hurting automobile plants, manufacturing remains underpinned by the strong domestic demand. The upbeat data, which followed on the heels of recent reports showing inflation heating up, will likely not shift the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance.
""Demand is booming right now. Fed officials up to now have said they expect this boost in demand to be fleeting, and will not consider changes in policy until the labor market is at full employment and price levels increase at a sustained pace,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.

The broad-based rebound was led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships accelerating 15.1%. Sales at clothing stores soared 18.3%. 
Consumers also boosted spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 13.4% jump in receipts. Still, sales at restaurants and bars are 1.8% lower compared to March 2020.

Receipts at electronics and appliance stores increased 10.5% and sales at furniture stores rose 5.9%. There were also hefty gains in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at building material stores vaulted 12.1%. Online retail sales increased 6.0%.
Many qualified households have received additional $1,400 checks, which were part of the massive stimulus package approved in early March. The package also extended a government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement through Sept. 6. 
At the same time, temperatures have warmed up and the public health situation has been rapidly improving, allowing more restaurants to offer dining services.
The data, together with upbeat earnings reports from several companies, propelled the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to record highs. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 6.9% last month after a revised 3.4% decrease in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have declined 3.5% in February.
Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their first-quarter GDP growth estimate by 100 basis points to a 9.7% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. 
The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday, described economic activity as having ""accelerated to a moderate pace from late February to early April."" 
Growth is expected to top 7.0% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984. It would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
A second report from the Fed on Thursday showed output at factories increased 2.7% in March after dropping 3.7% in February. Though the rebound did not recoup all of February's decline, that was offset by surveys showing strong manufacturing activity in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region this month.
Manufacturers in the two regions were also upbeat about prospects over the next six months, especially new orders.
""We think that activity in the manufacturing sector will keep picking up over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Indeed, households have amassed about $1.9 trillion in excess savings. That, together with a recovering labor market, are expected to underpin consumer spending this year.

In a fifth report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 193,000 to a seasonally adjusted 576,000 for the week ended April 10, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. Economists had forecast 700,000 applications for the latest week.
Despite the huge drop, claims remain well above their pre-pandemic level. Part of the elevation in claims is because of fraud. The enhancement of the unemployment benefit programs, including the weekly subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to file for aid and others not to seek work.
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.

""Although one cannot read too much into any one week's reading on jobless claims, the degree of the drop in initial filings, hints at a strong labor market in early April as Covid-related restrictions in various states were eased,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 

The economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sharp drop in Treasury yields in the face of strong U.S. economic data is surprising market participants who expected the reflation-driven bond selloff of the first quarter to continue.
U.S. Treasury yields notched their biggest drop since Nov. 12 on Thursday, even as March retail sales data came in much better than expected and jobless claims fell.
Normally, strong data would bolster the case for economic recovery and inflation, diminishing the attractiveness of bonds and pushing yields higher.
All told, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury has fallen nearly 20 basis points in April, reversing some of the dramatic rise in February and March and boosting a rally in growth and technology shares that has helped send markets to fresh records. The 10-year yield fell to a one-month low of 1.528% on Thursday. 
""Certainly the move in Treasuries today was counter to expectations,"" said Justin Hoogendoorn, managing director at Piper Sandler. ""With the surge in retail sales of 9.8% in March, a selloff seemed inevitable.""
Investors gave a broad range of reasons for the move, including an unwind of bearish bets against Treasuries, safe-haven buying in the face of heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine and increased appetite for U.S. debt among foreign buyers. 
John Briggs, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, believes some investors may have already factored in a powerful economic rebound, accounting for the climb in yields earlier in the year. 
“The market has generally priced in that the U.S. is accelerating more quickly than originally expected,” he said. “We’ve now gotten to a point where there’s some stability from the sell-off and you’re going to see some appetite coming back into the market.” 
Speculators trimmed their net bearish bets on U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures in the week to April 6. Their net position on the U.S. 10-year notes flipped from a net short to a net long, the data showed.
""That is somewhat telling of how it's not necessarily economic data that is driving this ... It's more positioning and expected change in terms of buyer base,"" said Chuck Tomes, associate portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
Nomura macro and quant strategist Masanari Takada recently noted a ""course correction"" away from bear trades in the Treasury market.
""According to the estimates output by our team’s model, it seems likely that fundamentals-oriented global macro hedge funds have already closed out the entirety of their aggregate net short position in USTs, and may have swung to the net long side,"" Takada said in a note on Tuesday.
Rising tensions between the United States, Russia and China could also be bringing some buyers back into the Treasury market as a safe haven given the outsized rally in equities over the past six months, said Scott Kimball, co-head of U.S. fixed income at BMO.
“Geopolitical risks are mounting, the income gap between net savers and those living paycheck to paycheck are continuing to grow, and the fiscal stimulus has been too late or at least behind the curve,” he said. 
Some investors have also pointed to greater demand from foreign investors, including Japanese buyers. April 1 marked the start of a new fiscal year in Japan, ending a period of portfolio readjustment in which investors sold off Treasuries.
The previous move higher in rates at the beginning of the year is also likely attracting buyers enticed by higher returns, said Robert Sears, chief investment officer at Capital Generation Partners.

""In this yield-starved world, rates don’t have to go up that much for the trade to become appealing,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign outflows in Treasuries hit their highest in more than two years in February, according to data from the U.S. Treasury released on Thursday, as investors sold government debt on expectations that yields would go higher as the economy emerged from the pandemic. 
On a transaction basis, foreign investors sold $65.46 billion in Treasuries in the month, the largest outflow since December 2018, compared with outflows of $49.13 billion the previous month. Investors have sold Treasuries in nine of the last 12 months.
Foreign holdings of Treasuries overall declined to $7.098 trillion in February, from $7.119 trillion the previous month. In January, foreign ownership of Treasuries gained the most in six months.
""A lot of investors may have been nervous about the move in rates and decided to sell on expectations that rates are moving higher,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
At the end of February, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were at 1.456%, up from 1.077% at the beginning of the month.
An improving U.S. economy due in part to increased vaccinations pushed yields higher in February and prompted market expectations that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates earlier than what officials had suggested, which was not until at least 2024.
The Fed stuck to its guns and said no rate hike is forthcoming over the next few years. 
Japan led the slide in foreign holdings in February, with $1.258 trillion, from $1.276 trillion in January, which, analysts said, may have been related to the country's March fiscal year-end.
Japanese investors tend to sell U.S. assets and repatriate those proceeds back to their home country for balance sheet purposes, with the approaching fiscal-year end.
Japan remains the largest non-U.S. holder of U.S. government debt.
China, on the other hand, raised its holdings of U.S. government debt, with $1.1 trillion, from $1.09 trillion in January.
""There's a lot of cross-currents. The sell-off has a lot of strong sellers, but also attracted buyers, buying the dip,"" said TD's Goldberg. 
Data also showed foreign investors bought $13.99 billion in U.S. equities in February, from $11.868 billion in January. Foreigners have purchased U.S. stocks for 10 straight months.
U.S. corporate bonds had a net inflow of $14.49 billion, from $18.87 billion in January.

Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, as well as banking flows, amounted to a net inflow of $72.6 billion in February, from a revised $105.8 billion in January.

534,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the challenges faced by minority-owned businesses, which experienced higher rates of closures and revenue losses and had more trouble accessing credit than white business owners, according to a report by the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve. 
Businesses owned by people of color were more likely to scale back their operations during the pandemic, according to the study released on Thursday. Black-owned businesses, in particular, struggled to access financing and were more prone to using personal savings or to borrow money from family and friends to stay afloat. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted communities of color and small businesses of color, in many cases to a greater extent than their white counterparts,"" the researchers wrote in the report.
Businesses owned by Blacks and Hispanics were half as likely to be approved for non-emergency loans as white-owned businesses, even when they were all similarly rated as being low credit risk. Just 24% of Black business owners and 25% of Hispanic business owners with low credit risk received all of the financing they sought, compared to 48% of white business owners.
In fact, Black and Hispanic business owners with low credit risk were approved for credit at the same rate as white business owners deemed to be a medium or high credit risk, the study found. 
Black business owners were more likely than any other group to take a hit to their personal finances. Some 38% borrowed money from a friend or relative, 25% worked a second job during the crisis and 74% used their personal funds. 

The report is based on a survey conducted last September and October of nearly 10,000 businesses with fewer than 500 employees and another 4,500 non-employer firms.

Business inventories rose 0.5% after increasing 0.4% in January, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. February's gain was in line with economists' expectations. 
Inventories fell 2.4% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Retail inventories were unchanged in February as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a ‐0.3% decline in January.
Motor vehicle inventories decreased fell 2.6% as previously reported. Motor vehicle stocks are dwindling as a global semi-conductor shortage hampers auto production.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 1.2% as estimated last month. That followed a 0.2% gain in January. Inventory investment has contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters.
Growth estimates for the first quarter are as high as a 9.7% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% rate in the fourth quarter.

The new target is contained in the Treasury's annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF) which Mario Draghi's cabinet approved at a meeting on Thursday.
The new target for the fiscal gap incorporates the impact of a 40-billion-euro stimulus package which the cabinet signed off on at Thursday's meeting, the source said. Italy has not posted a double-digit deficit since the early 1990s.

The DEF contains multi-year targets for the GDP, the budget deficit, and public debt, which are expected to be officially announced shortly.

Investing.com -- U.S. shoppers wasted no time in spending their stimulus checks in March, embarking on their biggest spending spree in nearly a year. 
Retail sales rose 9.8% according to data released on Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, well ahead of the 5.9% rise expected and the biggest monthly increase since May last year.  The less volatile series of  core retail sales also rose sharply, by 8.4%. The numbers for February were also revised up for both series.
The strength in retail sales was broadly distributed across almost all sectors: Sporting goods sales were up 24% after falling 6.9% in February. while apparel sales were up 18%, motor vehicles and parts were up 18%, and building materials sales were up 12%. Only food and beverage, with a 0.7% gain, lagged the overall trend noticeably.
""The level of overall sales should remain robust in the coming months with households on track to spend a part of savings accumulated during the pandemic,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief economist and strategist at Market Securities, in a blog post. ""The large amount of excess savings accumulated since March 2020 (more than $1.750 trillion at the end of February 2021) could partly flood the economy from 2Q21.
Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, noted meanwhile that ""almost every retail group is now above pre-crisis levels. Even clothing where spending dropped more than 80% from February to April 2020.""
He pointed out that the only outlier was the restaurant and bar sector, where spending is still 4.8% below pre-pandemic levels.
News from the labor market front was also encouraging, as initial jobless claims fell much further than expected last week to only 576,000, their lowest level since the pandemic began. Analysts had expected a figure of 700,000 ahead of time.
Last week's initial claims number was revised up by 25,000 to 759,000. 
The jobless claims numbers have been uneven in recent weeks. However, the longer-term declining trend was clearly underlined as another 1.2 million people dropped off the Department of Labor's broadest measure of those claiming benefits under all unemployment-related programs. The overall number fell to 16.93 million in the week through March 27, from 18.17 million the previous week.  The narrower number of continuing claims under federal and state programs 
Elsewhere, readings from both the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business study and the New York Empire State Manufacturing index both exceeded expectations too, although Nordea analyst Martin Enlund warned that both appeared to be merely catching up with the Institute of Supply Management's findings in its last monthly survey."

LONDON (Reuters) -English diners rushed back to restaurants this week and online job adverts have returned to pre-pandemic levels as Britain's economy starts to reopen following the coronavirus pandemic, according to new figures on Thursday.
The slew of economic indicators published by the Office for National Statistics and the Bank of England also showed that British banks are preparing to increase mortgage lending to households by the most since before the 2008 financial crisis.
Non-essential shops reopened in England for the first time since January on Monday, and restaurants and pubs were allowed to serve customers outside.
While much of Europe is battling with a fresh wave of COVID cases, Britain - which suffered the continent's highest death toll from the disease - is opening up as earlier lockdown measures and a rapid vaccine roll-out have reduced cases.
British restaurant reservations for Monday jumped to 79% of their level on the same Monday in 2019, a year before the pandemic, the ONS said, based on figures from bookings website OpenTable.
Online job adverts recovered to pre-pandemic levels on April 8, as retailers, pubs and restaurants took on new staff, according to figures produced by recruitment firm Adzuna for the ONS.
""We're not back to normal yet but these are really promising signs,"" Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter said.
The International Monetary Fund expects Britain's economy to grow 5.3% this year as it recovers from a record 10% slump in 2020. But it is still likely to take until 2022 before output is back at pre-pandemic levels - a slower recovery than the United States or Japan.
Around 5.7 million employees - 17% of the total workforce - remained on furlough at the end of March, the ONS said, and economists think it is unlikely that all will have work when government support ends at the end of September.
Thursday's figures also showed a fall in a closely watched measure of consumer spending based on Bank of England 'CHAPS' data on credit and debit card payment processing.
This spending measure dropped to 83% of its pre-crisis level in the week to April 8 from 88% the week before, likely due to public holidays over Easter, the ONS said.
Separate figures published by the BoE on Thursday showed banks gearing up for more lending.

Lenders polled in March said they planned to increase the supply of mortgage lending by the most since the survey began in 2007, while unsecured lending such as overdrafts were seen expanding by the most since 2013.
While banks' intentions do not always match up with later lending, it points to further fuel for a boom in British house prices which started in the pandemic, aided by an extension of property purchase tax breaks in March's budget.

Between Oct. 1 and April 2 the value of external trade slumped to $15.78 billion from $20.36 billion in the same period a year earlier, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported.
""Myanmar witnessed a slump in exports and imports triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Both sea trade and border trade dropped amid the coronavirus impacts and political changes,"" said the newspaper, which has long been considered a mouthpiece of the military.
The military overthrew an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi two and a half months ago after the election commission rejected its complaints of fraud in a November vote swept by her party.
The return of military rule has triggered daily protests and strikes that have crippled the economy. More than 700 people have been killed in attempts by the security forces to suppress the demonstrations, an activist monitoring group says.
The newspaper, citing Commerce Ministry data, said exports were estimated at $7.8 billion in the October-April period, down more than $1.7 billion from the same period the previous year.
Imports were valued at $7.9 billion during the period, down $2.85 billion.
Myanmar mostly exports agricultural products, animal products, minerals, forest products, and finished industrial goods. Its main imports are capital goods, raw industrial materials and consumer goods.
The government is trying to reduce the trade deficit by screening luxury import items and boosting exports, the newspaper said.
Myanmar’s trade deficit was $1.3 billion in the 2019-2020 financial year, the newspaper said, citing the central statistics office.
It had targeted exports of $16 billion and imports of $18 billion for 2020-2021 under a National Planning Law, it said.

The Commerce Ministry and statistics office were not immediately available to comment.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the country's largest lender, said growth in its home loan book this year should boost the company's mortgage profit in the order of 3%, Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said on Thursday.
Speaking at a twice-yearly parliamentary session with the country's top banks, Comyn said CBA expects to grow its $378 billion home loan book by about 5% this year with demand for mortgages buoyed by near-zero low interest rates.
A strong economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, fuelled by easy monetary policy, paired with a ""miraculous"" turnaround in the labour market, will likely push record house prices even higher, Comyn added.
Job creation in March outstripped expectations with unemployment falling to 5.6% from a recent peak of 7.5% in July, government data showed on Thursday.
""We're anticipating credit growth of about 5% over the course of the year,"" Comyn said. ""Our forecast for housing (price growth)... I suspect it's probably closer to 10% at this particular point in time.""
Asked whether a 5% increase in CBA's home loan book would lead to an equivalent rise in mortgage profit, Comyn said factors such as bad debt and price-based competition meant profit would be slightly lower. Pressed on whether that meant a 3% increase, Comyn said, ""It could be in that order.""
""We've also seen the highest level of refinancing, in the market, that I think we've ever seen,"" he said, adding that business lending growth, however, would be much lower. 
While official interest rates dropped to a record low of 0.1% last year, major banks protected profit margins by not passing on the cuts to the majority of customers with variable mortgages, and instead lowered rates on fixed-rate loans.
That dynamic continues to lead many customers to refinance mortgages to secure cheaper debt.
CBA - the biggest of Australia's Big Four banks by assets followed by  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - reported A$3.89 billion ($3 billion) in cash profit for the six months to Dec. 31, a 10% fall from the previous year.
Together, the four command the majority of the country's A$1.8 trillion housing loan market.

Westpac's CEO Peter King, who appeared in the afternoon, matched CBA's expectations for housing and credit growth, but declined to given any forecasts on the impact of that growth on profits.

Australia’s unemployment rate fell further in March as strengthening sentiment combined with record low interest rates to accelerate the economy’s recovery and further boost hiring.
The jobless rate dropped to 5.6% from 5.8% in February versus economists’ median estimate of 5.7%, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. Employment soared by 70,700 in March, double the expected 35,000 gain. The participation rate climbed to 66.3%, also exceeding economists forecast of 66.1%.
“Employment and hours worked in March 2021 were both higher than March 2020, up by 0.6% and 1.2%,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. “The proportion of women employed was the highest it’s ever been.”
The Australian dollar jumped on the data before trading at 77.36 U.S. cents at 11:34 a.m. in Sydney.
The economy is booming Down Under with sentiment surging as cashed-up households are encouraged to spend and firms consider investing. That’s prompted increased hiring and Australians to resume job-hunting, swelling the labor force and further strengthening the economic outlook.
The Reserve Bank of Australia in February doubled its quantitative easing program to A$200 billion ($155 billion) and reiterated that it doesn’t expect to increase interest rates until 2024 at the earliest. Governor Philip Lowe, in a speech last month, said the economy could probably manage unemployment in the low 4s, or potentially even the 3s, before stoking inflation.

With businesses such as restaurants, cinemas and hotels still closed in many countries, many households in developed countries have accumulated far greater savings than normal.
Whether households start spending these savings or sit on them in anticipation of financial challenges ahead is one of the biggest puzzles facing economists and policymakers as they try to figure out how fast economies will recover from the pandemic.
The OFCE think-tank approached the issue by comparing a scenario for major economies where households spend in 2022 a fifth of the extra savings they built up during 2020 and 2021 with a scenario in which they do not.
Under the first scenario, global economic growth was seen at 4.5% next year and under the second it came out at 4.0%, the OFCE said in an update of its global forecasts.
The U.S. economy was seen achieving growth next year of 5.9% under the first scenario and of 3.7% without the boost from savings being spent down.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, could see 5.5% growth next year under the first scenario and 4.1% under the second, while French growth would reach 6.0% and 4.3% respectively.

Britain could see growth of 5.0% with a savings drawdown or 3.2% without while Italy was seen at 5.5% and 3.9% respectively.

Britain's Office for National Statistics said the productivity impact of last year's economic collapse - the biggest in more than 300 years - differed from the 2008-09 financial crisis due to the types of jobs affected.
""Although there was substantial volatility during the year, this contrasts with a slow and steady decline in productivity during the 2008-09 economic downturn,"" the ONS said. 
Many workers in relatively low-paid retail and hospitality roles lost their jobs or were furloughed last year, while employees able to work from home were typically in higher-paid sectors which boost the productivity numbers.
During the 2008-09 recession, there was a greater loss of high-paid financial services jobs, exacerbating a longer-term slide in productivity growth which began before the crisis and persisted for years afterwards.
The ONS said productivity within the retail sector itself increased sharply during the second half of last year as businesses partly reopened and a shift to online shopping intensified. 
Online retail employs fewer staff compared with traditional stores, and those shops which did stay open - such as supermarkets - tended to be larger than average, both factors which boost measured productivity.
However, output per hour in the public sector was 13.0% lower in the final quarter of 2020 than a year before. The ONS said this reflected a sharp increase in COVID-related spending - such as on costly personal protective equipment and COVID testing programmes - while measured output fell slightly.

Output per hour for the whole economy in the final quarter of 2020 was 0.7% lower than a year earlier, a slightly smaller decline than an earlier flash estimate of a 1.1% decline.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell the most in about a year in February, government data showed, dashing hopes for a pick-up in capital expenditure needed for a private sector-led recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump.
Policymakers are counting on companies to spend their huge cash piles on investment in plant and equipment and wage hikes to help pull the world's third-largest economy out of deflation and stagnation.
Many companies however are reluctant to invest amid worries over a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections, although a gradual recovery is expected later this year as vaccinations become more accessible. 
The Cabinet Office data on Wednesday showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 8.5% in February from the previous month.
It was a second straight month of contraction and marked the fastest decline since April 2020. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted 2.8% growth, following a 4.5% drop in January.
""The sharp fall in machinery orders in February poses downside risks to our view that business investment continued to rise last quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, the recovery in private investment should still gather pace again in the second half of the year as vaccines allow the economy to regain full health.""
By sector, manufacturers' orders declined 5.5% in February from the prior month, dragged down by computers, nuclear power motors and engines.
Orders from non-manufacturers also decreased 10.9%, led by electric meters, railway cars and farm equipment.
Many economist have forecast a contraction in economic growth in the first quarter as COVID restrictions hampered service-sector activity, such as hotels and restaurants, keeping companies from boosting investment.
The Cabinet Office cut its assessment on machinery orders to say a pick-up is stalling. Previously, orders were described as picking up.
Underscoring solid overseas demand, external orders, which are not counted as core machinery orders, jumped 76.2% month-on-month in February, helped by a big ticket item that gave a one-off boost, a Cabinet Office official said.
The value of external orders hit a record 1.8 trillion yen ($16.53 billion) under comparable data available since April 2005, he added.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, declined 7.1% in February, versus a 2.3% gain predicted by economists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Market participants this week staked out their positions on how to fix systemic risks in the $4.9 trillion U.S. money market fund industry, in what is shaping up to be the first big fight for U.S. President Joe Biden's financial regulators. 
After taxpayers bailed them out for the second time in 12 years during the pandemic-induced turmoil in March 2020, money market funds - a key source of short-term corporate and municipal funding - are facing a regulatory reckoning which could potentially change the industry beyond all recognition.
Monday was the deadline for submitting feedback to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on ideas the Treasury Department floated in December on ways to boost money market fund resilience amid market stress. [L1N2KA2BD] 
The industry on Monday disputed that money market funds were to blame for last year's turmoil in short-term funding markets, citing its own analysis, while conceding some changes were warranted. Advocacy groups, meanwhile, called for major reforms. 
""Without fundamental repairs, disorder will happen again,"" wrote http://4atmuz3ab8k0glu2m35oem99-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Systemic-Risk-Council-Comment-Letter-File-No.-S7-01-21.pdf the Systemic Risk Council, a think tank comprising former regulators, warning the implicit government guarantee the sector now enjoyed would drive ""even bigger problems down the road."" 
The Investment Company Institute (ICI), which represents the asset management industry, cautioned against hasty changes and said policymakers ""should prioritize the examination of the activities and behavior of all market participants.""
An SEC spokeswoman did not immediately provide comment on the review.
Because money market funds invest in high-quality short-term debt instruments and offer daily redemptions, investors generally expect immediate liquidity with little price volatility, and are easily spooked when those expectations are not met during market stress, according to the Treasury. 
As the pandemic shut down the economy in March 2020, investors pulled more than $130 billion from institutional investor ""prime"" and tax-exempt money market funds, contributing to stress in the short-term funding markets, it said. 
To calm fleeing investors and stem a broader crisis, the Treasury and Federal Reserve launched emergency liquidity facilities to backstop the market. 
The panic was reminiscent of 2008, when a run on money market funds threatened to freeze up global markets and prompted the government to backstop the sector. 
That bailout led the SEC in 2010 and 2014 to introduce rules aimed at reducing the risk of investor runs. But last March showed those changes were inadequate, said regulatory experts.
Among the additional reforms floated by the Treasury were new liquidity and capital requirements, allowing fund boards more flexibility to charge for or suspend redemptions, and adjusting the fund's value in line with dealing activity to transfer costs to redeeming investors, known as ""swing pricing."" 
The ICI did endorse two measures: scrapping fixed thresholds for imposing redemption fees and suspensions, which it said intensified investor flight, and raising the proportion of a fund's weekly assets which must be liquid, currently 30%.
The group said the Treasury's other ideas, many of which were dismissed during the SEC's previous review, would not help improve financial system resilience.
Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group, however, warned policymakers not to again bow to industry resistance and to instead implement a combination of the Treasury's proposals. 

The group's legal director Stephen Hall said finishing the job of regulating the industry was ""long overdue"" and that he expected the SEC to issue proposed new rules soon.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's stubbornly high inflation is expected to heat up again in March, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, creating pressure for the government as it looks to rein in rising prices that stymie economic growth and increase poverty.
The poll of 16 local and foreign analysts indicated that the South American country's Consumer Price Index (CPI) would advance 4% in the month, quicker than the 3.6% rise a month earlier, driven mainly by food and education costs.
Argentina is expected to see 46% inflation this year, a recent central bank poll showed, well above government targets, though slightly lower than an earlier poll. Soaring prices were a key element in poverty hitting 42% last year.
Analysts are divided about whether a government drive to tamp down inflation will work. It is a key focus in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a new deal to roll over some $45 billion in loans Argentina cannot pay back.
Hernán Hirsch of FyE Consult said inflation was ""consolidating"" even with currency controls holding the exchange rate in check. 
Isaías Marini, an economist at Econviews consultancy, however, predicted the rise in prices would cool.
""In the coming months we project a slowdown in inflation, mainly due to the central bank's new strategy of reducing the rate of exchange rate depreciation, but also due to controls and the freezing of rates,"" he said.
Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) pointed out in a note that prices were rising around the region, driven by food and energy costs, and this would likely get worse before it got better.
""Rising inflation is no longer a risk but a tangible reality for a number of emerging markets, particularly in LatAm,"" he said.
Argentina's INDEC statistics agency is set to release official March CPI data on Thursday.

ROME/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Post-Brexit trade rules mean prosecco supplier Serena Wines 1881 must store bottles destined for Britain on costlier, fumigated pallets in their own corner of its warehouse in the northeast Italian town of Conegliano.
The new shipment requirement is one example of the extra cost and complexity that firms across continental Europe face serving British customers since Jan. 1, adding to disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic to drive UK-EU trade volumes lower.
""These first months have been hectic, hellish for everyone,"" said export manager Nicola Piovesana. ""Delivery times are now longer, now it takes 2 weeks to get to the (UK) client, while before it took one week at the most.""
The Dec. 24 deal reached between Britain and the EU after years of wrangling over post-Brexit trade terms at least meant goods trade - roughly half the total $900 billion of annual EU-UK commerce - was spared from tariffs and quotas.
But January trade volumes crashed as difficulties with the new rules combined with a hit from pandemic restrictions and substantial stockpiling by firms on both sides of the English channel in late-2020 in anticipation of trouble.
UK data released on Tuesday showed only a partial recovery in February, with British goods exports to the EU 12.5% below year-ago levels and imports 11.5% down. Data from Italy, France and Germany - Britain's biggest EU trading partner - have all shown falls in the volume of UK trade in February.
With Britain its second largest export market after Germany, Serena Wines has bent over backwards to secure business with UK hotels, restaurants and caterers by revamping internal customs processes and dedicating one staff member to Britain alone.
But the pallet issue is typical of the type of knock-on impacts that companies are now having to deal with: in this case, trade with any non-EU country means international rules on anti-pest treatment of wood packaging apply. 
Piovesana says the fumigated pallets cost about 9.50 euros (8.23 sterling) each, almost 20% more than the regular ones. UK guidance is for firms to consider switching from wooden to plastic pallets.
""EASIER TO SHIP TO ASIA""
High Quality Foods, a Rome-based food supplier to high-end outlets from artisanal bakers to West End eateries, struggles most with documentation on speciality meat products like beef from Black Angus cattle crossed with an Italian breed.
""There seems to be a trap in every corner,"" lamented managing director Simone Cozzi, adding the company's hygiene officer - a trained veterinarian – now needed to spend extra time with them when filling in the necessary paperwork. 
Cozzi said delays at customs points had also added to transport costs because drivers want more money to compensate for wasted time, while air shipments can be held in a UK airport for 24-plus hours compared to only 30-45 minutes in Hong Kong.
""At the moment it is actually easier to ship things to Asia,"" he said.
Italian farmers association Coldiretti cites such hurdles as endangering 3.4 billion euros of Italian agri-food exports, pointing to a 38% drop in exports of foodstuffs to the UK in January and almost 14% in February. 
Some firms have found work-arounds - albeit at a cost.
Swedish wood products supplier Vida Wood, riding the wave of lockdown-induced booms in DIY home improvement activity, had an existing UK subsidiary which now takes care of all the customs hassle and bills the British end-customer from there.
""So there is more administration for us,"" said CEO Karl-Johan Löwenadler, acknowledging that solution would not be available to smaller companies with no UK presence like its 11-person operation in Billericay, 25 miles (40 km) east of London.
MORE CHECKS TO COME
While stories of major disruption are common among goods exporters across different sectors in Europe, the unanswered question remains what the long-term impact on trade will be.
A UK government spokesperson said the February data showed ""welcome growth"" in the value of trade with the EU from January, suggesting most traders and hauliers were now adapting.
""It's premature to make any firm judgments on the long-term impacts of our new trading relationship with the EU, especially with the pandemic still ongoing,"" the spokesperson added. (Graphic: Imports into the UK, https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU/dgkplyxgnvb/chart.png) (Graphic: UK exports, https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU/gjnpwdwywvw/chart.png) 
The Bank of England expects UK-EU trade in goods and services to fall by more than 10% in the long term due to post-Brexit restrictions, and for British output to be around 3% lower than if the government had agreed to the EU rules needed for a frictionless trade deal.
Moreover, exporters to Britain face added complications in the coming months, with extra paperwork for UK food imports such as meat, fish and cheese needed from October and a further raft of checks to take effect from January 2022.
A group of lawmakers and heads of business will hold a first ""evidence session"" on Brexit's trade impact on Thursday with a view to making recommendations on possible improvements.
Yet even before Brexit, the EU's share of Britain's trade had already been declining for years, with figures quoted in a UK parliament report last year showing UK exports to the EU made up 43% of all its exports in 2019, down from 54% in 2006.
Some major European exporters are resigned to the idea that, while the early disruption will eventually settle down, the logic of a Brexit deal that spurned closer ties will inevitably lead to a further drift southwards of UK-EU trade volumes.
It could already be happening: A December 2020 survey of members of Germany's BGA trade association showed one out of five companies were reorganizing supply chains to swap out British suppliers in favour of those in the EU single market.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose sharply in March while imports growth surged to the highest in four years in yet another boost to the nation's economic recovery, signalling improving global demand amid progress in worldwide COVID-19 vaccination. 
The data suggests the world's second largest economy will continue to gather momentum as it emerges from the COVID-19-led slump in early 2020, though a lagging consumer rebound, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in many countries and Sino-U.S. tensions have raised risks for the outlook. 
Exports in dollar terms soared 30.6% in March from a year earlier, but at a slower pace from a record 154.9% growth in February. The analysts polled by Reuters have forecast a 35.5% jump in shipments. 
""Strong foreign demand is likely to be sustained throughout the second quarter as the global economy further recovers,"" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust.
""But with the acceleration in global vaccination efforts, industrial sectors in other countries are gradually restarting. It remains to be seen that if China's stellar export growth will begin to slide.""
Despite sporadic COVID-19 cases in China's border cities, authorities have been able to largely contain the virus in a boost to the lagging consumer recovery. 
Beijing managed to largely bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control much earlier than many countries thanks to stringent anti-virus curbs and lockdowns at the initial phase of the outbreak last year.
Asian stocks markets were broadly positive after the data, with strong imports giving investors confidence that domestic demand is improving as part of the recovery from the pandemic.
The data showed total Chinese imports jumped 38.1% year-on-year last month, the fastest pace since February 2017 on high commodity prices, beating a 23.3% forecast and compared with 17.3% growth in February.
Meat imports of 1.02 million tonnes in March marked the highest monthly volume since at least January 2020, while imports for soybeans iron ore, copper and crude oil also rose.
China posted a trade surplus of $13.8 billion last month, versus analysts expectations for the surplus to rise to $52.05 billion from $37.88 billion in February.
TRADE CHALLENGES
Official and private manufacturing surveys in China pointed to robust growth, with export orders returning to growth amid improving foreign demand.
However, many analysts believe exports could lose some momentum in the short term and the advantages of orders transferred from other countries due to coronavirus-related disruptions will begin to abate.
Li Kuiwen, customs spokesman, said that overall trade growth in the second quarter could show the pace slowing due to a higher base comparison in the year-ago period when a jump in pent-up demand boosted the headline figures.
The resurgent COVID-19 infections abroad and constraints in global trade have left some companies grappling with prolonged delivery timeframes and surging prices of raw materials.
Makers of cars and electronic devices from televisions to smartphones are sounding alarm bells about a global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays as consumer demand bounces back from the coronavirus crisis.
Meng Xianglong, founder of Heji Trade & Credit Research Centre based in the port city of Ningbo, believes the recent surging commodity prices have already deterred some exporters from taking on orders, especially those small firms, in signs of the weaknesses to come for the next couple of months. 
""Factories are now facing a squeeze in profits. Even though today's data are robust, they're suffering from pains in reality.""
China's gross domestic product expanded 2.3% last year, the only major economy to post growth in 2020, underpinned by solid demand for goods such as medical and work-from-home equipment.
Still, the massive initial hit from the COVID-19 crisis meant China's growth in 2020 was still its weakest in 44 years.
This year, China has set a modest growth target of at least 6%, as authorities plotted a careful course out of a year disrupted by COVID-19 and amid heightened tensions with the United States.
President Joe Biden said last month that U.S. was not seeking confrontation with China over differences on trade. 

China's trade surplus with the United States slipped to $21.37 billion in March from a $23.01 billion in February.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew by 0.4% in February from January as companies prepared for the lifting of a third coronavirus lockdown, according to official data which also showed a partial recovery in post-Brexit trade with the European Union.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 0.6%. However, the data also showed that the fall in gross domestic product in January was not as severe as previously estimated, down by 2.2% compared with the initial reading of a 2.9% drop.
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year, its biggest slump in more than three centuries and a more severe fall than in most European economies, as the country was battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Tuesday's data showed GDP remained 7.8% below its level a year earlier, shortly before the pandemic swept Europe, and was 3.1% lower than its level in October, before the two latest lockdowns hammered Britain's huge services sector.
Still, a fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has raised the prospect of a bounce-back this year and in 2022.
Non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality venues reopened on Monday and Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to relax most coronavirus restrictions before the end of June.
""While the UK is still on course for a modest contraction in GDP in the first quarter, investors are increasingly looking towards the forthcoming rebound in economic growth rather than dwelling on the negative quarterly figure,"" Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said. 
Growth in February was helped by a first rise in factory output since November, led by car manufacturing after two months of contraction when the industry struggled with a global shortage of microchips.
Wholesalers and retailers saw a pick-up in sales which helped the services sector to grow by 0.2%.
There were signs that trade between Britain and the European Union partially recovered in February after a hit in January, the first month of a new post-Brexit trade relationship.
British goods exports to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and precious metals, were 41.4% below year-ago levels in January but partially recovered to be 12.5% below year-ago levels in February. Imports, which dropped 19.2% on year-ago levels in January, were 11.5% below year-ago levels in February.
Trade volumes between Britain and the European Union rose in late 2020 as businesses stockpiled goods in anticipation of border delays in 2021. 

""Despite the evidence of partial recovery from the substantial January falls in some commodities, it is still too soon to determine to what extent the monthly changes in trade for January and February can be directly attributed to the end of the transition period,"" the ONS said.

Investing.com – Chinese exports rose at a slower pace than expected in March despite strengthening global demand, while imports grew at a faster pace, according to data released earlier in the day.
Exports grew 49% year-on-year, higher than the 35.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but remaining below February’s 60.6% growth.
Although growth slowed from February’s record gains, export momentum remained strong as COVID-19 vaccines continued to be rolled out globally and a recovery in global growth, albeit uneven, helped boost demand.
“Export outperformance remains a theme in China’s recovery,” Natwest Markets economist Peiqian Liu told Bloomberg, adding that it was due to “a combination of global recovering demand as well as China’s role in filling up the global supply chain gaps.”
Meanwhille, Imports grew 38.1% year-on-year, higher than both the 23.3% growth in Inveting.com forecasts and February’s 22.2% growth.
The surge in imports was due to higher volumes and prices of commodities, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. senior China strategist Xing Zhaopeng told Bloomberg.
“Looking forward, while rising commodity prices may increase import costs in the near term, the recovery in external demand could offset part of the impact,” he said.
The trade balance stood at USD116.35 billion, against the forecast USD52.05 billion and the USD103.25 billion recorded in February.
Although the Chinese Ministry of Commerce did not provide a forecast for the country’s foreign trade outlook, it has pledged to push for stable development in foreign trade in 2021. The World Trade Organization, meanwhile, forecast that global trade would increase by 8% in 2021, the biggest gain since 2010, after falling 5.3% in 2020.
The comparison with figures from early 2020, when China entered a COVID-19-induced strict lockdown that shut down much of its economy, also distorted the figures. The distortion led Premier Li Keqiang to urge investors and companies over the weekend to look beyond the ‘base effect’ and use other data and methods to assess the economic situation."
555,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- China’s trade surged in the first quarter, with overseas demand driving a jump in exports and imports also rising.
Exports rose 38.7% in yuan terms in the first quarter to 4.61 trillion yuan ($704 billion), the General Administration of Customs said Tuesday. Imports were up 19.3% to 3.86 trillion yuan, leaving a surplus of 759.3 billion yuan. The government will release trade data for March and dollar-denominated figures later Tuesday.
China is benefiting from stronger global demand as the rollout of vaccines helps to boost world growth. The figures are also skewed by comparisons from a year ago, when the economy was largely shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for the $96 billion in new Treasury notes sold Monday was average, but substantial enough to prevent a jump higher in yields ahead of Tuesday's inflation data. 
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday sold $58 billion in three-year notes to solid demand, while the results of the $38 billion 10-year note auction were slightly weaker. Both were watched closely by investors looking to see if the auctions would restart the dramatic rise in yields of the first quarter. [US/]
The flood of new Treasury supply - estimated to be around $4 trillion this year to pay for pandemic stimulus endeavors - has contributed to the move higher in yields this year. Historically weak auctions, in particular February's seven-year offering, were responsible for sparking dramatic selloffs in Treasury debt that pushed yields to pre-pandemic highs. 
The stabilization in yields that began in April will therefore continue going into the publication of consumer price index data on Tuesday morning. 
""The three-year was good, the 10-year was okay,"" said Andy Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. 
""I don't think it's going to have much of an effect on rates just on this alone. I still think the jury is out as to what the next big move is,"" said Brenner, who does believe the rise in yields will resume, and expects the 10-year yield to reach 2% before the end of the second quarter. 
The benchmark 10-year yield rose more than 80 basis points in the first quarter. Since the start of the second quarter on April 1, the 10-year yield has dropped 6.8 basis points and was last trading around 1.678%.
U.S. consumer price data for March, due Tuesday, might also drive yields higher. Yields on longer-dated securities rise with inflation expectations, as higher consumer prices can erode their value over time. U.S. producer prices notched their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years last month, Labor Department data showed Friday, likely marking the start of higher inflation as the economy reopens.
In order for yields to move significantly higher, ""I think you would have to have a CPI number tomorrow out of line, outside of expectations, similar to what the PPI was on Friday,"" said Brenner.

The Treasury will also be auctioning $24 billion of 30-year bonds on Tuesday and a total of $151 billion in bills throughout the week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government posted a March budget deficit of $660 billion, a record high for the month, as direct payments to Americans under President Joe Biden's stimulus package were distributed, the Treasury Department said on Monday.
The deficit for the first six months of the 2021 fiscal year ballooned to a record $1.706 trillion, compared to a $743 billion deficit for the comparable year-earlier period.
The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a big impact on the first six months of fiscal 2020, as increased outlays tied to rising unemployment due to pandemic-related lockdowns and major new aid spending did not start until the very end of March 2020 and ramped up in the following month, a Treasury official told reporters. 
The March 2021 deficit was the third highest U.S. monthly deficit on record, surpassed by gaps of $864 billion in June 2020 and $738 billion in April 2020.
The March deficit, which compared to a year-earlier fiscal gap of $119 billion, included receipts of $268 billion and outlays of $927 billion - both record highs for that month.
The 13% increase in March receipts was buoyed by an increase in taxes withheld from individuals, representing strong earnings among higher-paid Americans who were able to work remotely, the Treasury official said, as well as from improved overall employment levels compared to a major drop in employment in the second half of March 2020.
The March outlays were further increased by $339 billion in direct payments of $1,400 that were sent to many individuals under Biden's American Rescue Plan Act that was enacted last month, the Treasury official said.

More funding from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package will roll out in coming months, the official added, likely keeping outlays elevated.
For the first six months of fiscal 2021, outlays were a record $3.410 trillion, while receipts were $1.704 trillion, the Treasury said. Total direct payments in the six-month period came to $487 billion, including those from a year-end stimulus package passed under former President Donald Trump, the Treasury official said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union cannot help EU-hopeful Montenegro repay its debts to China, but can help it complete a highway plan that started with a huge loan from Beijing, the European Commission said on Monday.
The small Balkan republic will struggle this year to start servicing a 1 billion euro loan from China that it took in 2014 to build the first phase of the highway linking the port of Bar on Montenegro’s Adriatic coast to landlocked neighbour Serbia. 
Montenegro's Deputy Prime Minister Dritan Abazović said in March the EU should therefore help the country refinance the loan, taken out by the previous Montenegro government, to protect the EU candidate from becoming dependent on China.
Asked about the call for help, a Commission spokeswoman said that every country was free to make its own investment decisions but that the ""EU did not repay loans from third parties.""
Montenegro will have to find its own way to handle the Chinese loan, spent on a 44 km stretch of the 165 km motorway, the spokeswoman said, but the EU was willing to help with money for the rest of the road through its 9 billion euro Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans.
""We are providing a mix of grants, guarantees and preferential loans from international financing institutions such as European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,"" she said, noting the financing was at ""very favourable conditions"".
Montenegro, with a population of 622,000, had a debt of 4.33 billion euros or 103 percent of GDP last year and its repayment ability has been weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic which is undermining its main source of income -- tourism.
The motorway is at the heart of an intense debate about Chinese influence in Europe, both within EU member states and countries aspiring to join the bloc such as Montenegro and its Western Balkan neighbours Serbia, Macedonia and Albania.
As Beijing extends its economic reach under the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, poor countries across Asia and Africa have seized on attractive Chinese loans and the promise of transformative infrastructure projects.
The Commission said Chinese influence was a concern.

""The EU has concerns over the socioeconomic and financial effects some of China’s investments can have. There is the risk of macro-economic imbalances and debt-dependency,"" the spokeswoman said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese wholesale prices marked their first annual increase in more than a year in March, a sign that rising commodities costs are pinching corporate margins and adding inflationary pressure to the world's third-largest economy.
Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price firms charge each other for their goods and services, rose 1.0% in March from a year earlier, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Monday, marking the first rise in 13 months.
Markets are turning their attention to the return of inflation as advanced economies recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, forcing some central banks to offer reassurances that a brief uptick in prices won't trigger a withdrawal of stimulus.
Analysts, however, expect the fallout on consumer inflation to remain more modest in Japan than in the United States, as soft wage growth and slow vaccines rollouts are seen weighing on Japan's household spending.
The March jump in wholesale prices, which was at the fastest pace since January 2020, exceeded a median market forecast for a 0.5% increase and followed a 0.6% fall in February.
""While there's still a lot of uncertainty on the outlook, global economic activity is picking up and keeping commodities prices high,"" said Kouta Fujiwara, an economist at NLI Research Institute.
""Given the base effect of last year's sharp fall, Japan's wholesale inflation may spike to around 3% from April,"" he said.
Most of the gain in March wholesale prices was driven by a 29% spike in prices of non-ferrous metals goods and 9.8% rise in those for oil products and coal, showing how a rebound in global demand for commodities pushed up costs for Japanese firms.
Compared with a month ago, wholesale prices jumped 0.8% in March to mark the biggest gain since October 2019.
""The increase is driven mostly by recoveries in U.S. and Chinese economies, which are pushing up global commodities prices, rather than a rebound in domestic demand,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, the head of a BOJ division overseeing price moves.
""It's too early to say price levels have fully returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" he told a briefing.
The data will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price forecasts at its next interest rate review on April 26-27.
Japan's economy has emerged from the initial hit of the pandemic thanks to robust exports. But analysts expect any recovery to remain modest with a renewed spike in infections clouding the outlook for domestic demand.

Years of heavy money printing by the BOJ has failed to push inflation up closer to its 2% target, with core consumer prices falling 0.4% in February from a year earlier.
While rising input costs could help push up consumer inflation, they could also hurt retailers already feeling the pinch from slumping sales blamed on the pandemic.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury auctions offering $271 billion of new debt and a key inflation report this week could end a recent lull in the bond market, reigniting a rise in yields that worried investors in the first quarter. 
Treasury yields have dipped since April 1 during a two-week pause in issuance, reversing some of the dramatic rise in February and March. That eased concerns that higher borrowing costs will hurt stocks, particularly in growth sectors like technology, which have an outsized weighting in the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
Investors said weak demand at upcoming auctions, which kick off on Monday, could send bond prices lower and yields higher, albeit at a slower pace than in the first quarter.
""No matter how you slice it, supply auctions will be in focus,"" said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. Of particular interest will be the auction of both three- and 10-year notes on Monday, worth $96 billion in total. 
The benchmark 10-year yield rose more than 80 basis points in the first quarter on expectations of blistering economic growth, higher inflation and the estimated $4 trillion in new debt to be issued this year. 
A poor seven-year note auction in February sparked a run higher in yields, and drove the 10-year real rate - the 10-year Treasury yield stripped of inflation expectations - to the highest since June 2020. Even after markets cooled slightly in March, demand at that month's seven-year auction was modest. 
Monday’s double auction ""will have some ramifications, but I don't think we move substantially the way we saw in quarter one,"" said Lederer. 
The Treasury will also be auctioning $24 billion of 30-year bonds on Tuesday and a total of $151 billion in bills throughout the week. 
U.S. consumer price data for March, due Tuesday, might also drive yields higher. Longer-dated yields rise with inflation expectations, as higher consumer prices can erode their value over time. 
.S. producer prices notched their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years last month, Labor Department data showed Friday, likely marking the start of higher inflation as the economy reopens amid an improved public health environment and massive government aid.
""The next potential catalyst I see for the rates market is the CPI print,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist for fixed income at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). “It shouldn’t be a surprise, but you might still get some sticker shock and a bit of indigestion.” 
While the most recent Fed projections see inflation reaching 2.4% this year, well above target, the central bank believes it will fall back to 2% next year. The consumer price index, which does not map perfectly onto the Fed's metric, is expected to have risen 2.5% year-over-year in March, according to a Reuters survey. 
Some investors and strategists said there may be greater demand for Treasuries now than during March, which could cap any rise in rates. April 1 marked the start of a new fiscal year in Japan, ending a period of portfolio readjustment in which investors sold off Treasuries, said Meghan Swiber, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). ""Japanese real money accounts were notably absent in March, likely because the combination of volatile rates and a stronger dollar kept a lot of buyers on the sidelines ahead of their fiscal year-end on March 31,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. 

""Now, with those buyers back in and currency markets a bit more stable, the balance has tipped slightly in favor of demand.""

(Reuters) - Ecuadorean banker Guillermo Lasso unexpectedly won the nation's presidency on promises to revive an economy battered by coronavirus as his rival's vows of a return to socialist largesse failed to win over a skeptical electorate. 
Lasso took 52% of the vote in the runoff following a campaign that pitted free market economics against the social welfare plans of economist Andres Arauz, a win likely helped by a ballot spoiling campaign that left one in six ballots void. 
The 65-year-old president-elect will now have to find ways to kick-start a stalled economy while using the same pro-market play book as President Lenin Moreno, who shored up government finances but struggled to create jobs and did not seek re-election.
""A third of Ecuadoreans live in poverty, and just three in 10 have access to employment,"" Lasso said at a campaign rally last week. ""These are two objectives that should bring 100% of Ecuadorean political leaders to dialogue.""
Lasso's third campaign for the presidency centered on bringing in foreign investment to create jobs and on expanding investments in the agricultural sector.
It differed sharply from Arauz's promises of handing out $1,000 to a million poor families and returning the country to the social welfare programs of former President Rafael Correa, Arauz's mentor. 
Lasso may have benefited from a protest campaign by indigenous leader Yaku Perez, who called on supporters to vote null in protest of what he called voter fraud in the first round in February. 
Lasso's election win is a rare bright spot for emerging markets, which are struggling under concerns such as Argentina's tense talks with the International Monetary Fund and broader headwinds from rising U.S. interest rates that threaten to spark a selloff.
Ecuadorean bond prices had spiraled last year after Arauz said he would overhaul a $6.5 billion 2020 financing deal. 
Lasso is seen as having greater capacity to negotiate with the IMF, but he has also said he would push back on IMF plans to raise taxes - which could complicate his efforts to keep the government's books balanced. 

And any economic rebound will rest on a restructuring of the country's stalled COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which has been plagued by nepotism allegations and a revolving door of health ministers who have resigned or been sacked.

China's trade surplus is expected to be $52.05 billion in March, following a surplus of $103.25 billion in the first two months of the year, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 27 economists. The data will be released on Tuesday.
Exports are expected to have risen 35.5% in March from a year earlier, according to the poll. The number was down from 60.6% jump in January-February, as the year-ago level suffered a deeper contraction as the the coronavirus outbreak in China passed through its peak.
The rebound of overseas demand for Chinese goods continued with the recovery of global economy amid greater vaccination efforts. Surveys showed U.S. factory activity picked up in March amid strong growth in new orders, and the growth in Euro zone monthly factory activity was the fastest on record.
Official and private manufacturing surveys in China pointed to riobust growth, with export orders returning to growth amid improving foreign demand.
Imports likely rose 23.3% in March versus a year ago, the poll showed, slightly higher than the 22.2% gain in the first two months of the year.
""Import growth might have stayed solid in March on the back of more working days (this year relative to last year), healthy underlying domestic demand, and also higher oil prices,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' economists said in a note. 
However, many analysts believed exports could lose some momentum in the short term and the advantages of orders transferred from other countries due to coronavirus-related disruptions will begin to abate. 
""The current strength of export growth is unsustainable and will unwind over the coming quarters as vaccinations allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist with Capital Economics.
Other China watchers also noted the resurgent COVID-19 infections abroad and constraints in global trade have left some companies grappling with prolonged delivery timeframes and surging prices of raw materials. 

Makers of cars and electronic devices from televisions to smartphones are sounding alarm bells about a global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays as consumer demand bounces back from the coronavirus crisis.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank lending rose 6.3% in March from a year earlier, data showed on Monday, as restaurants and hotels sought more loans to weather the hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Deposits held by banks were also up 9.9% in March as households continued to save rather than spend on uncertainty over the pandemic's fallout, the Bank of Japan data showed.
Outstanding loans held by the country's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, hit a fresh record at 579.995 trillion yen ($5.29 trillion), according to the data. In February, total loans increased 6.2%.
The introduction of a new scheme that offers incentives to banks that channel more funds to pandemic-hit firms has yet to have a major impact on bank lending, a BOJ official said.
""We'll likely seen the impact appear ahead, and hope the scheme will help smooth financial intermediation,"" the official told a briefing.
At its policy meeting in March, the BOJ adopted a new interest paying scheme for financial institutions that tap its cash coffers to boost loans.

564,"<span>Apr 11, 2021 07:30PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Confidence among big businesses in Britain about their profits in the year ahead has hit a record high, helped by the country's coronavirus vaccinations and hopes for less Brexit disruption, a survey of chief finance officers showed.
After the biggest hit to Britain's economy in more than three centuries last year, accountancy firm Deloitte said its poll found CFOs were planning to increase hiring and investment.
Most workers were expected to return to their offices between July and September after working from home for much of the past year.
Almost 10% of CFOs had experienced significant or severe disruption due to Brexit but only 3% expected that level of disruption to persist in a year's time, Deloitte said on Monday.
""Brexit has been a significant dampener on business activity in the last four years but with the UK's final departure from the EU, such effects are fading,"" Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist, said, noting most CFOs still thought Britain's departure from the European Union would hurt their businesses. 
""Combined with a successful vaccine rollout and a greatly improved global backdrop, we are seeing a turbo-charged surge in business optimism.""
Britain's economy shrank by nearly 10% in 2020 as the country was hit by Europe's highest COVID-19 death toll. But it is expected to start recovering soon as the government lifts its social-distancing rules.
The only category of macroeconomic risk where concerns had risen sharply related to inflation and asset price bubbles, Deloitte said.
A separate survey suggested Brexit and COVID-related problems were continuing for exporters.
The British Chambers of Commerce said 41% of firms reported lower sales in the first three months of 2021, up from an already-high 38% in the previous quarter, led by firms in sectors hardest hit by lockdowns - hospitality, catering, retail and wholesaling.
A third survey showed small firms in Britain were their most confident in more than six years, but one in seven was likely to make some or all employees redundant this quarter.
FSB Chairman Mike Cherry urged the government to offer more incentives for hiring.
""Bringing down the non-wage costs of employment, starting with employer national insurance contributions which essentially serve as a jobs tax, would certainly help,"" Cherry said. 
The Deloitte survey was conducted between March 17 and March 30 and polled 100 CFOs from companies with a combined market value of 547 billion pounds ($751 billion) among UK-listed firms.
The BCC data was based on a poll of 6,103 firms between Feb. 15 and March 11.
The FSB surveyed 1,648 small firms between March 8 and March 22.

Left-wing economist Andres Arauz won the first round of the election in February, garnering almost 33% of the vote, on promises of generous cash handouts and a resumption of the socialist policies of his mentor, former President Rafael Correa.
Arauz's rival, banker and third-time presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso, is promising to create jobs through foreign investment and financial support for the agricultural sector. Lasso won just shy of 20% of the first-round ballots. 
Indigenous activist Yaku Perez, who narrowly lost out to Lasso for a slot in the runoff, is calling on supporters to spoil their ballots to protest what he called electoral fraud during the first round.
The vote will hinge on the roughly 15% of the electorate who remain undecided, said Francis Romero, director of pollster Click Report, describing the figure as unusually high. 
""(The undecided) see that neither option has the capacity to get the country out of the economic and health crises that it's in,"" said Romero.
The oil-exporting nation's economy was already weak due to low crude prices when the coronavirus outbreak started. The pandemic has pushed a third of the population into poverty and left half a million people unemployed.
President Lenin Moreno, who is not seeking re-election, imposed painful austerity measures as part of a $6.5 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund, but was unable to kick-start the economy.
The elections council expects to report the results on Sunday night. The new president will take office on May 24.
Arauz, 36, has offered to give $1,000 to a million families as soon as he takes office, as well as provide benefits to young people such as free internet access.
His plans are being closely watched by foreign investors who hold Ecuadorean bonds, some of whom have expressed concerns about heavy spending plans in the face of the government's delicate finances.
Lasso has tried to soften his conservative image by promising to fight discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and boost protection of animal rights.

Both candidates are calling on supporters to ""take care of the votes"" and denounce irregularities on voting day and during the vote tallying process.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's red-hot housing market has bolstered the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the market imbalances are escalating and driving up already-high household debt, the Bank of Canada said on Friday.
Housing prices in Canada have surged over the last year, with the Bank of Canada becoming increasingly concerned in recent months that gains are being driven by excessive exuberance, investor activity and a fear-of-missing-out. 
""Strength in the housing market is contributing to Canada's economic recovery from the pandemic. But it may also be intensifying housing market imbalances and household indebtedness,"" the Bank of Canada analytical note said.
""The evidence presented here generally suggests these vulnerabilities have increased in recent months.""
The report, released Friday morning, shows that since the onset of the pandemic, outstanding household debt has risen by close to 3.5%, reflecting a surge in mortgage debt. 
New mortgages to highly-indebted households are also rising sharply, the report shows.
Home price growth, meanwhile, has accelerated and is nearing the last peak in April 2017. The Bank also said some measures show rising exuberance in Toronto's housing market.
Canada's financial regulator said on Thursday it plans to tighten its mortgage stress test amid concerns about surging home prices, and to gird against risks when interest rates rise from record-low levels. 
The average selling price of a Canadian home jumped 25% in February, hitting a record C$678,091 ($540,096), according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
Governor Tiff Macklem said late last month that the central bank was seeing signs of household indebtedness worsening as housing prices soared.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in March, resulting in the largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years and likely marking the start of higher inflation as the economy reopens amid an improved public health environment and massive government aid. 
The report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed solid gains in underlying producer prices last month. That aligned with business surveys showing rising cost pressures as strengthening domestic demand pushes against supply constraints. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday reiterated that he believed the expected rise in inflation will be transitory and that supply chains will adapt and become more efficient. Most economists agree, citing considerable slack in the labor market.
""Beyond temporary effects, inflation is unlikely to keep accelerating given ample slack in the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 
The producer price index for final demand jumped 1.0% last month as costs increased across the board. The PPI rose 0.5% in February. In the 12 months through March, the PPI surged 4.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since September 2011 and followed a 2.8% advance in February. 
The year-on-year PPI was boosted as last spring's weak readings dropped out of the calculation. Prices tumbled early in the pandemic amid mandatory closures of non-essential businesses across many states to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would increase 0.5% in March and jump 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. The PPI report was delayed after the Bureau of Labor Statistics website crashed. The BLS, the Labor Department's statistics agency, said it was looking into the problem with the website.
Goods prices soared 1.7%, accounting for almost 60% of the increase in the PPI last month. That was the biggest increase since December 2009 and followed a 1.4% rise in February. Prices for services shot up 0.7% after gaining 0.1% in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
SOLID GAINS
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020, while the Fed has slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
Powell said on Thursday that while he expected a surge in demand and bottlenecks in the supply chain as the economy reopens, ""it seems unlikely that will change the underlying inflation psychology that has taken deep roots over the course of many years.""
Employment remains about 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Though vacancies have rebounded above their pre-pandemic level, competition for jobs remains stiff, limiting workers' ability to bargain for higher wages.
But some economists do not share Powell's inflation assessment, arguing that businesses have the capacity to pass on the higher production costs to consumers. Business surveys have indicated that customer inventories are at record lows and order books are full.
""The implication is that manufacturers potentially have the sort of pricing power we haven't seen in years,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""With greater scope to pass these price rises on to customers, the obvious implication is that risks are increasingly moving in the direction of higher CPI readings.""
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday if the expected jump in inflation did not reverse going into 2022, the U.S. central bank ""will have to take that into account.""
According to a Reuters survey, the consumer price index likely rose 0.5% in March, which would boost the year-on-year increase to 2.5% from 1.7% in February. The report is scheduled to be released on Tuesday.
Wholesale energy prices increased 5.9%, accounting for 60% of the broad-based rise in goods prices in March. Energy prices rose 6.0% in February. Food prices climbed 0.5% last month.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices increased 0.6%. The so-called core PPI gained 0.2% in February. In the 12 months through March, the core PPI accelerated 3.1%, the biggest rise since September 2018, after increasing 2.2% in February.
In March, wholesale core goods prices shot up 0.9% after gaining 0.3% in February. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target, a flexible average. 
The core PCE price index is at 1.5%. Some of the PPI components, which feed into the core PCE price index, rose moderately last month. 

Airline tickets increased 1.1% after jumping 3.7% in February. Healthcare costs rose 0.2% after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. Portfolio management fees rebounded 1.6% after dropping 1.1% in February.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada added far more jobs than expected in March, bringing employment to within 1.5% of pre-pandemic levels, official statistics showed on Friday, though economists warned fresh lockdowns imposed this month would undo some gains.
Statistics Canada said the country added 303,100 jobs in March, triple analyst expectations of 100,000, as a number of industries continued to recover from December and January shutdowns. 
The unemployment rate fell to 7.5%, beating an expected 8.0% and reaching its lowest level since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Canada added 175,400 new full-time positions in March and 127,800 part-time.
""This is another strong jobs report,"" said Ryan Brecht, a senior economist at Action Economics. ""However, the outlook for April activity has been dented by the return of regional lockdowns.""
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, closed most businesses this month amid a sharp surge of COVID-19 infections driven by faster-spreading variants.
Neighboring Quebec has also added fresh restrictions and tightened curfews in its hardest-hit regions. 
Economists warned that the return of closures would hit employment in the coming months, but noted that the strength and speed of the rebound from the most recent shutdowns was heartening.
""If there is a message, it is that employment can bounce back quickly once containment measures do ease,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC Economics.
""We're also not at the finish line yet in terms of the pandemic, so we could see a rapid recovery in employment later this year. That's assuming that vaccine distribution ramps up as expected and vaccines remain effective,"" he added.
Canada has lagged other major countries in vaccinations, but the pace of inoculations has sped up in recent weeks. 
The labor market strength in March supported bets that the Bank of Canada could adjust its quantitative easing (QE) program as early as this month.
""The scales tip slightly in favor of tapering QE but it really depends on what kind of fiscal outlay there is prior to their decision,"" said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst at Monex Europe and Monex Canada.

Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland will unveil Canada's 2021 budget, which is expected to contain billions of dollars in stimulus, on April 19.

That suggests inventory investment could contribute to GDP growth in the first quarter. Inventories increased 2.0% in February from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.8% after accelerating 4.4% in January. 
At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.27 months to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in January.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic, helping to underpin manufacturing. But a big chunk of the inventory build is coming from imports, which could keep the trade deficit elevated, which could offset some of the boost to GDP growth from inventories.

Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts fell 0.6% in February. There were increases in stocks of professional and computer equipment, as well as petroleum.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The number of Japan's ""izakaya"" dining bars that went bankrupt hit a record high in the year that ended in March, a sign some service-sector firms are being left behind even as the economy emerges from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic.
A rebound in global growth and domestic consumption has helped the world's third-largest economy recover from the doldrums, with business confidence improving to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter.
But industries that had been hardest-hit, such as restaurants, are likely to remain under pressure as Japan plans to place Tokyo under a new, month-long ""quasi-emergency"" state to combat surging COVID-19 cases.
A total of 175 ""izakaya"" bars - a mainstay of Japanese working culture and late-night drinking - went under in fiscal 2020, up 17% from a year ago and the highest level since compable data became available two decades ago, think tank Tokyo Shoko Research said on Friday.
""People stayed away from the bars to avoid crowds. Small restaurants are also suffering from the cost of investing in equipment to prevent the spread of the virus such as partitions,"" Tokyo Shoko Research said.
Operators of wedding halls also took a hit as people refrained from hosting big banquets, with nine of them going under in fiscal 2020, increasing for the second straight year, Tokyo Shoko Research said.
A separate government survey showed that while service sector sentiment improved in March, an index gauging the outlook worsened on concern over a resurgence in infections.

Investing.com – China continued on a steady path towards economic recovery from COVID-19, as factory gate prices rose at their fastest annual pace since July 2018 in March and growth in the second-largest economy globally continued to increase its pace.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that the producer price index (PPI) grew 4.4% year-on-year in March, exceeding the 3.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 1.7% growth.
""Markets may become increasingly concerned about pressures from rising inflation on Beijing's policy stance, but we expect Beijing will stick to its 'no sharp policy shift' commitment,”, with annual PPI inflation to rise to around 6.0% mid-year and ""moderate thereafter,"" Nomura chief China economist Ting Lu told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China shifted to a steadier stance as the country’s economic recovery solidified. The central bank rolled out measures including interest rate and reserve ratio cuts in early 2020 to counter COIVD-19's economic impact,

The data is the latest indicator pointing towards solid economic growth during the first quarter of 2021. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indexes released during the previous week indicated that China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in three months in March.
Falling food prices, especially for pork, continued to drag on consumer inflation in February, a note from an NBS official released alongside the data said.

Core machinery orders - a highly volatile data series seen as an indicator of capital spending six to nine months ahead - are forecast to rise 2.8% in February from the previous month after a 4.5% fall in January, the poll of 18 economists showed.
The core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, likely grew 2.3% in February from a year earlier.
""Manufacturers' capital spending is on the uptick, helped by exports' recovery,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research. ""But non-manufacturers remained cautious about spending on worries about the spread of the coronavirus infection.""
Policymakers are hoping corporate expenditure can help revive the world's third-biggest economy, even though analysts expect it shrank again in the first quarter due to emergency steps to curb the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Bank of Japan's latest quarterly survey showed that big firms expect to boost capital expenditure by 3.0% in the year that began in April, more than market forecasts for a 1.4% gain.
The government will announce core orders data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Wednesday (2350 GMT on Tuesday).
Next week's data also include the BOJ's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services.
The index likely rose 0.5% in March from a year earlier, up for the first time since February 2020, led by price gains in oil-related products, the poll found.

The BOJ will release the CGPI at 8:50 a.m. on Monday.

China's producer price index (PPI) rose 4.4% in annual terms, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement, far above a 3.5% rise forecast in a Reuters poll and up sharply from a 1.7% increase in February. 
The inflation data is the latest indicator to point to robust economic growth in the January-March quarter. Data last week showed China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in three months in March as factories ramped up production to keep up with improving global demand.
""Markets may become increasingly concerned about pressures from rising inflation on Beijing's policy stance, but we expect Beijing will stick to its 'no sharp policy shift' commitment,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.
He expected annual PPI inflation to rise to around 6.0% mid-year and ""moderate thereafter.""
China's central bank has rolled out a raft of measures, including cuts in interest rates and reserve ratios since early-2020 to support the virus-hit economy, but it shifted to a steadier stance as the recovery solidified.
China's consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% from a year earlier in March, the statistics bureau said in a separate statement, beating a median forecast for a 0.3% rise in a Reuters poll and returning to inflation after two months of price falls. CPI fell 0.2% year-on-year in February.
Falling food prices, especially for pork, continued to drag on consumer inflation last month, according to a note from an NBS official released alongside the data.

China has set a modest growth target of above 6% for this year, but analysts widely expect growth of more than 8% after 2.3% growth in 2020. That was the weakest full-year reading in over 40 years as China grappled with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beijing has warned that uncertainties related to the pandemic, which has claimed more than 3 million lives worldwide, continue to overshadow the economic outlook.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.5% month-on-month for a 1.5% year-on-year rise.
Changes in prices at factory gates are usually transmitted to final consumers and therefore herald trends in inflation that the European Central Bank targets with its monetary policy.
Euro zone consumer inflation jumped in March to 1.3%, taking another step higher in what is likely to be a temporary but sharp climb that may put consumer price growth above the European Central Bank's target of near 2% later this year.
The ECB has predicted the surge, warning that inflation may even exceed its target by the close of the year, but has promised to look past what it expects to be a temporary spike in its policy decisions. 
The main change in producer prices in February came from a jump in energy costs, which were up 2.3% year-on-year after months of year-on-year declines. But even excluding energy, producer prices rose 1.2% in February after a 0.7% in January. 
Prices of intermediate goods rose 2.4% year-on-year in February after a 1.0% rise in January while prices of non-durable consumer goods continued to decline.

Wall Street is known for its tough work culture, but remote working during the health crisis has been particularly gruelling for most employees, taking an enormous toll on their health and mental wellbeing.
Global stock markets have seen a strong rebound from lows hit during the start of the pandemic, with low interest rates also leading to a surge in dealmaking activity.
""Given our ongoing remote work environment – coupled with the recent pace of market activity as well as client requests and transactions – your contributions and commitment have become more important than ever,"" the memo said.
In a similar move, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said last month the bank would make efforts to give employees Saturdays off and shift staff from other divisions to the busiest teams in the investment bank.
The move came after media reports revealed that some junior bankers were working nearly 100 hours a week and sleeping five hours a night to keep up with excessive workloads.

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), another major U.S. bank, last month encouraged employees to limit calls outside work hours and to take their vacations, while announcing a firm-wide holiday on May 28.

LONDON (Reuters) - A global minimum corporate tax rate could deal a major blow to the multinationals which some governments allege shift billions of dollars in profits every year to low-tax havens, as well as triggering a fundamental reassessment of corporate earnings.
The chances of such reform rose this week as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen threw the weight of the U.S. government behind a push to upend international tax rules.
Yet stock markets held near record highs, boosted by the near-zero U.S. interest rates as well as a bet that a proposed 21% minimum tax rate, regardless of where companies make their sales, would not be implemented for years.
But some such as Grace Peters, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, think future earnings estimates ""could be underpricing the full potential impact of tax increases"".
""The issue is definitely right up as a major risk for companies,"" Peters said after the proposals were aired.
High-profile names including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have been accused by governments in Europe of using legal loopholes in fragmented global taxation regimes to pay less tax.
A minimum corporate tax level would stamp out the ability of companies to move income from ""intangible"" sources, such as patents, software and royalties, to countries with lower rates. 
This could double the existing tax paid on profits for some companies and cause a major headache for countries such as Ireland which have attracted many with a 12.5% rate, which research last year showed is half the global average.
The companies have not commented on the latest proposals.
A paper by Thomas Torslov at the University of Copenhagen and University of California academics Gabriel Zucman and Ludvig Wier calculated that profit shifting amounted to almost 40% of multinational profits and that 35% of these profits came from non-haven EU nations, while 25% were from the United States.
Although technology and healthcare firms are seen as major beneficiaries of tax arbitrage, stock market investors appear not to be fazed by the threat to companies' earnings.
Their focus is possibly on an expected rebound in corporate earnings, with U.S. companies set to report a 25% jump in profits this year, and a near 14% rise in 2022 after the damage inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
INVESTMENT HURDLE?
Irish finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, voiced ""reservations"" about the proposal, while the World Bank has warned against setting a minimum tax rate that is too high, saying it would hinder poor countries in attracting investment. 
Ireland is positioning itself for lower corporate tax receipts and has budgeted for them to fall by 500 million euros a year from 2022 and by 2025 to lose two billion euros a year.
The proposed reforms would probably also lower public revenues in poorer European Union states Hungary and Bulgaria with statutory tax rates of 9% and 10% respectively, UniCredit economist Andreas Rees said. 
And it would shift taxable revenues back to high-tax countries such as France, Germany and Italy where rates range from 28% to 32%, Rees added.
Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets said markets appeared sceptical a 21% rate would be adopted and ""it would take a long time to negotiate"".
U.S. THREAT
U.S. multinationals face another blow; the prospect of a domestic corporate tax rate rise to 28%, from the 21% levy set by former-President Donald Trump in 2017. That plan too faces stiff opposition within Congress
Companies have come in for withering criticism for paying little or no U.S. federal tax, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) chief executive Jeff Bezos said this week he supported hiking tax rates to overhaul infrastructure.
UBS analysts predict that a 28% tax rate would deliver a 7.4% hit for S&P 500 companies' earnings per share. They expect the hike to go into effect in 2022, though at a slightly lower 25% rate, which would result in a 3.6% earnings hit.
President Joe Biden signalled on Wednesday he was willing to negotiate how much U.S. companies would pay.
Pimco managing director and the head of public policy Libby Cantrill dismissed fears of a major equity setback.

""While tax increases are likely on the horizon, they are also likely to be watered down in the final version, take longer to pass, be less of a headwind to economic growth, and, as a result, give even more runway for equities and risk assets to rally,"" Cantrill told clients in a blog last month.

580,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"PARIS (Reuters) -A new U.S. proposal to unblock international negotiations on how to tax big multinationals is an ""interesting"" starting point, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday.
He said his U.S. counterpart Janet Yellen had suggested this week that a broader range of companies should be covered by new rules for taxing multinationals which are being negotiated at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
""If we can be assured that the American proposal covers all of the digital giants without exception, it appears to us to be an interesting point of departure,"" Le Maire told journalists.
Frustrated like many governments that big digital giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) can legally book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, France in 2019 imposed a digital service tax that it has promised to drop once there is an OECD deal in place.
However, France remains subject to a threat of U.S. tariff retaliation which the previous administration of Donald Trump put in place, judging that the French tax unfairly discriminates against U.S. companies.

Le Maire also said that he was open to considering a higher global minimum corporate tax rate than what had been under consideration so far in the OECD talks.
A rate of 12.5% had been under discussion so far in the negotiations until Washington proposed a rate of 21% this week.

The precariousness of employment for young people rose across the region, according to an investigation by Canadian charity Cuso International based on data from a U.N. commission and a poll by the International Labour Organization. 
""It's extremely difficult for young people to access the labor market due to issues around specialization, lower wages, and poverty,"" the advocacy group's Colombia director Alejandro Matos told Reuters.
More than half of those who stopped working since the start of the pandemic were let go by their employers, the report said, while others saw their businesses close and those employed in the informal sector could not work due to lockdowns. 
""Feelings of sadness, fear and anxiety, as well as discouragement following the crisis prevail among young people, where a greater proportion than in other age groups say their well-being and mental health has also deteriorated,"" the report said.
While job losses among the young caused interruptions in education and training programs, the collapse of businesses and falling wages increased precariousness, underemployment and informal work, the study said.
The majority of job losses came in the first half of 2020, with the numbers of young people in work or education falling by 7.8%, it said. 
Unemployment particularly afflicted those aged 15 to 24, growing by 3.4%, almost twice the rate for those over 25. 

""Young people without access to education, training, or professional experience do not accumulate human capital and find themselves increasingly distant from the realm of decent work,"" the study said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the increase likely understated the rapidly improving labor market conditions as more parts of the economy reopen and fiscal stimulus kicks in.
The second straight weekly increase in claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was at odds with reports this month showing the economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months, and job openings increased to a two-year high in February. Households have also been upbeat in their assessment of the labor market.
""Our belief is that continued moves to reopen the economy will result in a solid further advance in payrolls in the April jobs report and that the claims data are likely not capturing the pace of improvement in the labor market,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 744,000 for the week ended April 3 compared to 728,000 in the prior week. Data for the prior week was revised to show 9,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 680,000 applications for the latest week. Some speculated that spring break-related school closings, the Easter holiday and churn in some industries were behind the surprise rise. 
Others believed the unprecedented surge in claims in March 2020, when mandatory closures of non-essential businesses were enforced across many states to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections, was making it difficult to adjust the data for seasonal fluctuations.
""We suspect that the seasonal adjustment process is the main culprit behind the confounding volatility in claims data in recent weeks as the economy passed the one-year anniversary of the lockdowns from last spring,"" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Even so, unadjusted claims rose 18,172 to 740,787 last week. 
Some economists also believed the expansion of benefits, including a government-funded $300 weekly subsidy and program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance programs, was contributing to keeping claims high. 
The weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through Sept. 6. Fraud, multiple filings and backlogs have dogged the system. Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April of 2020, but remain more than double their pre-pandemic level. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000. 
Including the PUA program, 892,539 people filed claims last week, remaining below one million for a third straight week.
The increase in applications was led by California and New York. There were big drops in Alabama and Georgia, as well as Ohio, which has been beset by fraudulent applications.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record high. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
COMPANIES HIRING
The labor market stumbled in December but has regained its footing thanks to the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package and an acceleration in the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations, which are allowing more services businesses to resume operations.
In the minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 16-17 policy meeting released on Wednesday, U.S. central bank officials acknowledged the improvement in labor market conditions and ""expected strong job gains to continue over coming months and into the medium term.""
Several Fed officials suggested the latest relief package ""could hasten the recovery, which could help limit longer-term damage in labor markets caused by the pandemic."" 
Anecdotal evidence suggests companies are recalling workers laid off during the pandemic and hiring new employees. An Institute for Supply Management survey on Monday showed services businesses reporting they ""have recalled everyone put on waivers and made new hires"" and had ""additional employees added to service the needs of new customers at new locations.""
Still, the labor market recovery has a long way to go. Employment is 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 16,000 to 3.734 million in the week ended March 27. That was down from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis.
The 12th straight weekly decline in the so-called continuing claims in likely due to people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states. About 5.634 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended March 20, up 117,108 from the prior week.

Another 786,962 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid, down 230,780 from the week before. There were 18.2 million receiving benefits under all programs during the week ended March 20.
""This points to unemployment insurance remaining a substantial source of household income at this time,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief Executive Victor Dodig urged policymakers to focus on measures to boost the supply of homes amid calls for them to intervene to cool a surging housing market. 
""Part of the short-term aberration you're seeing here is low interest rates, lots of liquidity, but not enough supply,"" Dodig said in an interview late on Wednesday.
If regulators introduce measures to cool demand instead, ""that's up to them and we’ll react accordingly,"" he said. ""But the bigger issue is the supply of housing.""
Canada's housing market has been on fire since last summer, with the most recent data from the Canadian Real Estate Association showing sales jumped 39.2% and prices surged 17.3% in February from a year earlier.
Canada's financial regulator said it will relaunch on Thursday a consultation on the minimum qualifying rate for borrowers of uninsured mortgages. It had suspended the consultation, originally announced in February 2020, less than a month later.
As immigration flows continue to grow following the pandemic, many will wish to own, Dodig said. 
""How do we make sure we have supply of housing in place and a plan to make sure that supply grows?"" 
Canada will release the first federal budget in two years on April 19. Economists have called for measures including a capital gains tax on principal residences and a national non-resident tax to help cool the housing market.
Dodig also warned that a recovery in spending could lead to inflation that would make debt more expensive to carry for government, businesses and consumers, and called for ""smart policy"" that enables Canada to ""grow our way out of a situation where there's too much debt.""
Canadian household debt https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210312/dq210312b-eng.htm was 175% of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 170.8% in the prior quarter, Statistics Canada data showed, while the country's trade surplus with the world narrowed in February to C$1.04 billion from C$1.21 billion in January.

""Policymakers need to be thinking, how do you attract capital into the country, because our foreign direct investment has been going down... how to create a positive current account and positive capital account,"" he said.

Investing.com -- The recovery of the U.S. labor market from the Covid-19 pandemic remains uneven, official data showed on Thursday, as layoffs appeared to tick up again.
The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 744,000, defying expectations for a drop to 680,000. The previous week’s number was also revised up a touch.
The numbers come only a week after the monthly labor market report for March showed the U.S. economy creating jobs at its fastest rate in months.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, did fall modestly to 3.734 million, from an upwardly-revised figure of 3.750 million the previous week. Meanwhile, the overall number of people claiming benefits under unemployment-related programs fell by 51,000 to 18.165 million. 
Weekly numbers from the Labor Department have been subject to a high degree of volatility, as various states appear to have had problems processing and evaluating their data. 
""It's a surprise that jobless claims aren't improving more quickly,"" Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, said via Twitter. ""The increase over the last 2 weeks is moderately concerning—claims should be falling.""
The minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, released on Wednesday, had again listed the high level of unemployment as the chief reason why it won't wind down the aggressive monetary stimulus that has now been in place for over a year. While the labor market report showed the economy had created 917,000 jobs in March, overall net job destruction since the start of the pandemic is still around 10 million.

Initially, six truckloads of troops were deployed to quell protesters in the town of Taze, the Myanmar Now and Irrawaddy news outlets said. When the protesters fought back with handmade guns, knives and firebombs, five more truckloads of troops were brought in.
Fighting continued into Thursday morning and at least 11 protesters were killed and about 20 wounded, the media said. There was no word of any casualties among the soldiers.
That would take the toll of civilians killed by security forces to over 600 since the junta seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). It had a toll of 598 dead as of Wednesday evening.
Taze is near the town of Kale, where at least 12 people were killed in a similar clash between troops and protesters on Wednesday, according to news media and witnesses. Security forces fired live rounds, grenades, and machine-guns on protesters who were demanding the restoration of Suu Kyi's government, AAPP said.
""Taze, Kale have many hunters in the jungle,"" said Hein Min Hteik, a resident of the region and a youth activist. ""They have handmade firearms. And now they came out with their weapons in order to protect the locals, while the people were under attack by the junta."" 
A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.
""People will try to defend their own lives and their rights,"" said a former government minister who is part of the CRPH, a group of lawmakers representing the ousted civilian government. 
""People will not wait for CRPH to act,"" the minister said in a video call with Reuters.

AAPP has said 2,847 people were currently being held in detention.
In addition, arrest warrants have been issued for hundreds of people, with the junta this week going after scores of influencers, entertainers, artists and musicians.
'LOCKED OUT OF EMBASSY'
Paing Takhon, 24, well-known in Myanmar and Thailand, was one of the latest celebrities to be detained. He had condemned the military takeover and pledged support for Suu Kyi. 
His sister, Thi Thi Lwin, told Reuters that the military detained her brother at 4.30 am at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying for several days while unwell, suffering from malaria and a heart condition.
The security forces came with eight military trucks and about 50 soldiers and it was unclear where he had been taken, she said.
The country’s most famous comedian, Zarganar, was arrested on Tuesday, media reported.
Overseas, tussles for control of Myanmar's diplomatic missions emerged again on Wednesday.
Myanmar's ambassador to London Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was locked out of the embassy, with sources saying his deputy had shut him out and taken charge on behalf of the military.
Kyaw Zwar Minn has broken ranks with the ruling junta in recent weeks, calling for the release of detained civilian leader Suu Kyi.
""It's a kind of coup, in the middle of London... you can see that they occupy my building,"" he told Reuters.
There have also been similar counter claims in embassies in other global centres and at the United Nations. 
Meanwhile, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta's leader, said in a statement on Wednesday that the civil disobedience movement, or CDM, had halted the working of hospitals, schools, roads, offices and factories.
""CDM is an activity to destroy the country,"" he said.
Fitch Solutions said in a report that Western sanctions targeting the military were unlikely to succeed in restoring democracy, but said the army was losing control.
It predicted a violent revolution pitting the military against an armed opposition comprised of members of the anti-coup movement and ethnic militias. 
""The escalating violence on civilians and ethnic militias show that the Tatmadaw (military) is increasingly losing control of the country,"" it said. 

The vast majority of people back Suu Kyi's ousted government, it added.

LONDON (Reuters) - British households' spending on credit and debit cards rose strongly to 88% of its pre-pandemic average in the week to April 1, its highest since the week before Christmas, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday.
The figures are not seasonally adjusted, and the ONS said some of the increase was driven by end-of-month spending on households bills and food shopping. 
But they add to signs that the economy is beginning to pick up as coronavirus restrictions being to ease following the roll-out of vaccines to more than half of Britain's adult population.
Payment processor Barclaycard said on Wednesday that spending at golf courses jumped five-fold last week after they reopened to the public, and also reported more contactless payments which it linked to people buying picnic supplies.
Construction activity last month recorded its biggest jump since 2014, as businesses restarted mothballed projects in anticipation of shops, pubs and restaurants reopening next week, and recruiters reported the biggest increase in hiring of permanent staff in six years.
This week the International Monetary Fund revived up its growth forecast for Britain this year to 5.3%, but it does not see Britain's economy recovering its pre-crisis size until next year, much slower than the U.S. and Japanese economies.
The Bank of England expects rapid initial growth but has warned that there could be a long overhang of unemployment and underemployment after government support is withdrawn.
The ONS said firms reported that 19% of businesses' staff were on furlough in mid March. This is equivalent to 6 million people and well above levels of 11% in early December, before COVID restrictions were tightened to slow the spread of a more infectious variant of the disease.

Some 75.1% of businesses replying to the ONS survey said that they were currently trading as of April 4, up 1.3 percentage points from the previous two-week period, while 22.2% of firms said they were closed temporarily.

Paing Takhon, 24, a model and actor well-known in Myanmar and Thailand, was one of the latest celebrities to be detained. He had condemned the military's takeover and pledged support for Suu Kyi. 
His sister, Thi Thi Lwin, told Reuters that the military detained her brother at 4.30 am at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying for several days while unwell, suffering from malaria and a heart condition.
The security forces came with eight military trucks and about 50 soldiers and it was unclear where he had been taken, she said.
The country’s most famous comedian, Zarganar, was arrested on Tuesday, media reported.
'LOCKED OUT OF EMBASSY'
Overseas, diplomatic tussles emerged again on Wednesday.
Myanmar's ambassador to London Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was locked out of the embassy, with sources saying his deputy had shut him out and taken charge on behalf of the military.
Kyaw Zwar Minn has broken ranks with the ruling junta in recent weeks, calling for the release of detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
""It's a kind of coup, in the middle of London... you can see that they occupy my building,"" he told Reuters.
There have also been similar counter claims in embassies in other global centres and at the United Nations. 
Meanwhile, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta's leader, said in a statement on Wednesday that the civil disobedience movement, or CDM, had halted the working of hospitals, schools, roads, offices and factories.
""CDM is an activity to destroy the country,"" he said.
Fitch Solutions said in a report that Western sanctions targeting the military were unlikely to succeed in restoring democracy, but said the army was losing control.
It predicted a violent revolution pitting the military against an armed opposition comprised of members of the anti-coup movement and ethnic militias. 
""The escalating violence on civilians and ethnic militias show that the Tatmadaw (military) is increasingly losing control of the country,"" it said. 
The vast majority of people back Suu Kyi's ousted government, it added.
Suu Kyi and leading figures in her National League for Democracy party, which won an election in November that was annulled by the coup, are currently in detention facing various charges. 

The United Nations' special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, hopes to visit the country in the next few days, a U.N. spokesman said in New York.

France is one of Britain's most important trading partners within the European Union and many economists forecast that Britain's exit from the world's largest free trade area will prove to be a long-term drag on its growth. 
Britain's statistics office said in March that the COVID-19 pandemic made it hard to quantify the Brexit impact from the new customs arrangements. 
Britain last month delayed the introduction of a range of post-Brexit import checks on goods from the EU by around six months, saying businesses needed more time to prepare because of the impact of the pandemic.
French imports from Britain jumped 27% to 1.48 billion euros in February, returning to a level just shy of the monthly average during the second half of 2020.

Overall, France's trade deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 5.25 billion euros from 4.19 billion euros in January, led by a fall in the exports of aircraft, pharmaceuticals and manufactured goods.

The seasonally adjusted index rose to 72.9 from 60.0 in February, surpassing analysts' expectations for 60.5. It was the highest level for the index since March 2011 and the second highest since the PMI was launched in 2000.
The Ivey PMI measures the month-to-month variation in economic activity as indicated by a panel of purchasing managers in the public and private sectors from across Canada. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in activity. 
The employment index rose to an adjusted 62.7 from 54.0 in February, while the measure of supplier deliveries edged up to 39.6 from 38.6. Still, it was well below the 50 threshold, indicating that companies are having difficulty meeting increased demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in February as the nation's economic activity rebounded more quickly than that of its global rivals and could remain elevated this year, with massive fiscal stimulus expected to spur the fastest growth in nearly four decades.
The economy is roaring as increased COVID-19 vaccinations and the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package boost domestic demand, a chunk of which is being satiated with imports. President Joe Biden last week proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, expected to pull in even more imports and fire up economic growth. 
""The deficit could remain wide this year and next because of the fiscal stimulus and potential infrastructure package that could pass in the second half of this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""As the economy continues to strengthen, this will keep the deficit wide."" 
The trade deficit jumped 4.8% to a record $71.1 billion in February, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $70.5 billion deficit. The goods trade gap was also the highest on record.
Exports dropped 2.6% to $187.3 billion. Exports of goods tumbled 3.5% to $131.1 billion, likely hurt by unseasonably cold weather across large parts of the country. The decline was led by shipments of capital goods, which decreased $2.5 billion.
Consumer goods exports fell as did those of motor vehicles, parts and engines. There were also fewer food exports. The pandemic remained a drag on services exports, especially travel.
Imports slipped 0.7% to $258.3 billion. Goods imports fell 0.9% to $219.1 billion. The drop likely reflected supply-chain constraints, rather than weak domestic demand. Indeed, imports of capital goods hit a record high, boosted by civilian aircraft, medical equipment and electric equipment among others.
Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since October 2018, thanks to $1 billion worth of crude oil imports. That resulted in the United States recording its first petroleum deficit since December 2019.
But imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines decreased as did those of consumer goods. The reduction in trade flows in February was partly due to harsh weather, logistic and transportation problems at ports.
""Congestion at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together account for a third of U.S. container imports, caused container ships to anchor offshore while waiting for available port space,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""Even when ships are docked and unloaded, port executives report higher than normal container dwell time, or the time it takes importers to pick up their cargo from port.""
Following the recent six-day blockage of the Suez Canal, economists expect trade flows remained depressed in March.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher.
DRAG ON GROWTH 
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit shot up to a record $99.1 billion in February from $96.1 billion in January. The so-called real trade deficit is running well above the average for the October-December period. 
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimate trade could subtract a full percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter, which would be the third straight quarterly drag. 
But that is unlikely to make a dent on first-quarter GDP growth estimates, currently as high as a 10% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Economists expect growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting the global economy to expand 6% this year, driven primarily by the U.S. economy, which the fund estimated would grow by 6.4%.
From the labor market to manufacturing and the hard-hit services industries, activity accelerated sharply in March. 
But the housing market, one of the pandemic star performers is showing signs of fatigue. 
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home fell 4.6% last week, dropping for a second straight week.

According to the MBA, the 30-year mortgage fixed rate has risen to 3.36%, a 10-month high. That, combined with higher house prices due to an acute shortage of properties, is making home-ownership more expensive for some first-time buyers.
""With inventory at record lows and affordability increasingly stretched thanks to rapid house price gains, we expect home purchase demand will trend down this year,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business activity bounced back to growth last month, underpinned by a record expansion in manufacturing, according to a survey on Wednesday that also showed the service industry was coping better than expected with new lockdowns.
Europe is battling a third wave of coronavirus infections and governments - also struggling with vaccine programmes beset by delays - have re-imposed curbs on citizens and forced swathes of the dominant services industry to remain closed. 
But IHS Markit's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.6 in March from February's 45.7, much higher than a flash estimate of 48.8 and only just shy of the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""Encouragingly, today's data confirmed the services sector is on the path to recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
""Despite the health situation remaining fragile and some restrictions being extended, optimism about the vaccine campaigns sends some hopes for the services sector outlook.""
A composite PMI, combining manufacturing and services and seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 53.2 from 48.8, above the 52.5 preliminary estimate.
Growth in Germany's private sector accelerated to its highest level in more than three years while a slowdown in France's service sector eased despite tougher COVID-19 restrictions.
British businesses, outside the currency bloc and the European Union, saw a strong rebound in orders as they prepared for the relaxation of curbs next week, and ramped up their hiring for the first time since the pandemic struck. [GB/PMIS]
SUPPLY SNAGS
Despite the slow vaccine rollouts in the euro zone and a surge in reported coronavirus infections, optimism about the year ahead improved. The bloc's composite future output index rose to 67.9 from 67.0, its highest since February 2018.
That came after factory activity growth galloped at its fastest pace in the near 24-year history of its PMI in March, a sister survey showed last week, though supply chain disruptions and renewed lockdowns in the region could rein it in soon. [EUR/PMIM]
Supply issues led to a big jump in input costs for services firms and they increased their prices for the first time in just over a year. The output prices index rose to 50.5 from 48.1.

Still, a pick-up in euro zone inflation is unlikely to be sustained and a slow recovery from a pandemic-induced recession will keep price growth under the European Central Bank's target for years, a March Reuters poll found. [ECILT/EU]
""The surveys also show that price pressures are building, but this seems to be caused by short-term supply shortages in the industrial sector,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics. ""We suspect this will be temporary.""

The IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index - measuring Britain's huge services sector and its manufacturers - jumped to 56.4 from 49.6 in February, going into positive territory above 50.0 for the first time in three months.
However, the final reading was a little lower than a preliminary estimate of 56.6.
Britain's economy contracted by almost 10% last year but is expected to grow by around 5% or 6% in 2021 as the country makes quick progress with its vaccination programme.
Two thirds of services firms, which have typically been hit hardest by the lockdowns, expected business to increase over the year ahead, the most positive reading since the end of 2006.
Some services companies said they received a boost from increased residential property transactions during March.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced an extension of a tax cut for property purchases on March 3.
A measure of employment turned positive for the first time since February last year, and pointed to the biggest increase in hiring since mid-2019 as businesses planned for reopening when COVID restrictions ease in April and May.
The Bank of England is watching closely for how much further Britain's unemployment rate rises from its most recent level of 5% as it keeps its stimulus programmes at emergency crisis settings.
Business with the European Union remained disrupted after Britain left the bloc's single market on Jan. 1, with orders from Asia and the United States unable to offset the fall in EU exports for service providers.
International travel restrictions also hurt services exporters.

However, the pace of decline in orders from abroad was the least severe in 13 months, IHS Markit said.

594,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Growth in Germany's private sector accelerated in March to its highest level in more than three years as the services sector fared surprisingly well despite extended coronavirus curbs and a third wave of infections, a survey showed on Wednesday.
IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 51.5 last month from 45.7 in February.
The figure came in better than a flash value of 50.8 and marked the first month since September above the 50.0 mark that signals growth.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said the improvement was mainly due to an easing of restrictions for some shops and services while authorities extended other curbs into April.
The better-than-expected performance of services helped to push IHS Markit's composite PMI to 57.3 in March from 51.1 in February.
PMI data released last week showed that German factory activity grew at the fastest pace on record in March thanks to a surge in demand from the United States and China.
The growth outlook for Europe's largest economy remains clouded, however, by a more contagious virus variant and rapidly rising COVID-19 cases that could force authorities to tighten restrictions again in the coming weeks.

Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told Reuters on Tuesday that the German economy will likely miss the central bank's growth projection of 3% this year as pandemic-related restrictions weigh on business activity.

The pandemic, which has so far claimed more than 77,000 lives in Germany, has devastated Europe's largest economy, even though it has proven more resilient than many expected, partly because of continuing strong export demand from China.
Public spending rose 12.1% to 1.7 trillion euros in 2020 as the government pulled out all the stops to offset the impact of months of lockdown, while tax take fell 3.5% to 1.5 trillion euros, the statistics office said on Wednesday.
The spending spree is set to continue, with German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last month promising to do whatever was needed to enable Germany to spend its way out of a coronavirus-induced economic slump.
Germany is struggling to control a third wave of the pandemic and is set to keep many businesses, like bars and cinemas, closed until at least later this month.
However, the number of people on shortened working hours declined last month, driven by the industrial sector, which is benefiting from robust exports, the Ifo institute said on Wednesday.
Companies can shorten workers' hours under a government scheme designed to avoid mass layoffs during the downturn by offering companies subsidies to keep workers on the payroll.
In March, 2.7 million employees were on shortened hours, down from 2.9 million, Ifo estimated.
The number of people on the scheme peaked at about 6 million a year ago but had been rising steadily since Germany entered its second lockdown late last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households' inflation expectations rose in March from three months ago and their confidence on the economic outlook improved to an eight-year high, a central bank survey showed, a sign the initial pain from the coronavirus pandemic was heeling.
The outcome offers some relief to policymakers struggling to balance the need to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 infections while sustaining a moderate economic recovery.
The ratio of households which expect prices to rise a year from now stood at 62.4% in March, up from 60% in December, the Bank of Japan's survey showed on Wednesday.
A diffusion index measuring households' confidence on the economy a year from now stood at minus 8.5 in March, recovering sharply from minus 23.1 in December and marking the highest level since June 2013, the survey showed.
The poll follows a separate BOJ survey that showed business confidence improving to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter as the economy benefited by robust global demand.
While the economy may have emerged from the pandemic's initial hit, a resurgence in infections and weak wage growth cloud the outlook for consumption.
More households saw income shrink and expect to slash expenditure a year from now, the survey showed, underscoring the patchy nature of Japan's recovery.

The survey will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price forecasts at its next rate review on April 26-27.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings rose to a two-year high in February while hiring picked up as strengthening domestic demand amid increased COVID-19 vaccinations and additional pandemic aid from the government boost companies' needs for more workers.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday was the latest indication that the labor market had turned the corner after shedding jobs in December as the nation buckled under a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections and depleted government relief.
""Labor demand should continue to heat up as companies brace for a post-pandemic burst in pent-up demand,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 268,000 to 7.4 million as of the last day of February. That was the highest level since January 2019 and pushed job openings 5.1% above their pre-pandemic level. 
The second straight monthly rise in vacancies lifted the jobs openings rate to a record 4.9% from 4.7% in January.
There were an additional 233,000 job openings in the health care and social assistance industry. Vacancies in the accommodation and food services sector, one of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic, increased by 104,000 jobs. Arts, entertainment and recreation job openings rose 56,000.
But vacancies decreased in state and local government education as well as educational services and information.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 6.995 million in February. The report followed on the heels of news on Friday that the economy added 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months.
The labor market is being boosted by an acceleration in the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations and the White House's recently passed $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, which is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and fresh funding for businesses.
Demand for labor could increase further as more services businesses reopen. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday fully vaccinated people could safely travel at ""low risk.""
An Institute for Supply Management survey on Monday showed services businesses reporting they ""have recalled everyone put on waivers and made new hires"" and had ""additional employees added to service the needs of new customers at new locations.""
STIFF COMPETITION
In February, hiring rose 273,000, the largest gain in nine months, to 5.7 million. That boosted the hiring rate to 4.0% from 3.8% in January. Hiring was led by the accommodation and food services industries, which increased by 220,000 jobs. But hiring decreased in state and local government education.
Hiring still has a long way to go, with employment 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
""The labor market continues to improve but remains a long way from what the Federal Reserve would describe as the conditions to restore maximum employment,"" said John Ryding, chief economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The U.S. central bank has signaled it would maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a while to allow complete healing.
With unemployment well above pre-pandemic levels, competition for jobs remains tough. There were 1.4 unemployed people for every open job in February, well above 0.82 on the eve of the first wave of the pandemic lockdowns 12 months ago. 
""This means employers will have an easier time hiring, but job seekers still don't have the bargaining power they did prior to the pandemic,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. 
Layoffs increased to 1.8 million from 1.7 million in January amid job cuts in the finance and insurance industry. The layoffs rate was unchanged at 1.2%. 
Risks remain to the brightening labor market outlook.
""New strains of the virus and unwillingness to abide by health recommendations could extend the impact of the pandemic on the economy,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""In addition, the severity of the downturn, which closed many business, means that many industries will not bounce back immediately."" 
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs rose to 3.4 million from 3.3 million in January. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3%. 

The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But the pandemic has forced millions of women to drop out of the labor force mostly because of problems related to child care, with many schools still only offering online learning.

MADRID (Reuters) - Tourist arrivals to Spain plummeted 93.6% year-on-year in February as visitors stayed away from bars and beaches in what is usually the world's second most visited country.
International tourism to Spain plunged 80% to 19 million visitors last year - the lowest since 1969 - as coronavirus curbs took their toll. 
That trend continued in the first two months of 2021, data from the National Statistics Institute showed on Tuesday, in further bad news for a country that used to get over a tenth of its gross domestic product from tourism.
Spain received 284,311 foreign tourists in February, 34.6% less than in January. International tourism revenues dropped 93.3% year on year in February, putting many business in jeopardy.
While most tourists came from France, one in four travellers in February, the number of French fell 87.4% from February 2020, the last month before the pandemic hit.
Many French people, weary of their own lockdown, have been flocking over the border to enjoy open bars and restaurants in areas such as Madrid.
Germans, who have started going back to Mallorca, took second spot. 

Estimates from the Funcas think tank show the tourism sector's contribution to Spain's economy slumped to between 4% and 5% last year from around 12% in 2019, jeopardising many businesses.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.3, the highest since December, from 51.5 in February, well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Firms reported the sharpest increases in activity and overall sales in three months. New export business continued to contract but at a slower pace.
A sub-index for employment rose back into positive territory as businesses hired more workers than they laid off, the survey showed.
The findings were largely in line with an official survey released last week.
Chinese authorities successfully curbed domestic transmissions of COVID-19 virus over the winter, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back.
""The Covid-19 flare-ups that occurred in the fall and the winter have basically died down, and the services sector has quickly recovered with supply and demand expanding,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
But rising input costs and output prices shown by surveys of both the services and manufacturing sectors are not conducive to a sustained post-epidemic recovery, he said.
Costs for services firms continued to grow, according to the survey, although at a slower pace than the month before. Companies raised their prices charged for the eighth month in a row and by the largest amount so far this year.
Chinese services firms were highly optimistic about the year ahead, with business expectations rising to the highest level since 2011.
The services sector, more vulnerable to social distancing restrictions, had been slower to recover initially from the pandemic than the industrial sector.
Domestic COVID-19 cases have largely been controlled in China although a city on the border with Myanmar last week ordered home quarantines and mass testing after new cases emerged.
Analysts expect a strong rebound in China's full-year growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages rose for the first time in a year in February, the government said on Tuesday, largely due to prices weakening as the coronavirus pandemic continued to weigh on the economy.
The health crisis and steps taken to keep it in check are having a big impact on the world's third-largest economy, which is expected to have contracted in the first quarter due to weakening consumer spending.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key measure of households' purchasing power, rose 0.2% in February compared with the same month a year earlier, the labour ministry said on Tuesday.
It was the first rise in inflation-adjusted real wages in 12 months, after a revised 0.6% decline in January.
But nominal total cash earnings dropped 0.2% in February from a year earlier, down for the 11th straight month, following a revised 1.3% decline in January.
""Since the fall in prices was larger than the drop in wages, it (February inflation-adjusted wages) turned positive,"" a health ministry official said.
The official said a relatively small number of winter bonus payments in February compared with the prior month reduced pressure on overall nominal total cash earnings, which saw their smallest decline in 11 months.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - rose for the second straight month, gaining 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.2% rise the previous month, according to the data.
Overtime pay, a key indicator of strength in corporate activity, declined 9.3% in February compared to the same month a year earlier, falling at a quicker pace than in January.
Special payments, which include winter bonuses, lost 1.0% in February after a 20.4% decline in January, which was downwardly revised from minus 12.7%.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who were employed for more than one month at a company that employed more than five people, or 2) those who were employed on a daily basis or had less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted, at a company that employs more than five people.

Cash sent back to family members this past January was slightly higher, at $3.298 billion.
Remittances have been on a record run since last year and reached their all-time monthly high in March 2020, as a growing number of Mexican migrants living in the United States dug deep to send extra money to relatives back home to alleviate the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Solid workers' remittance flows have been adding support to the current account and to private consumption, particularly for low-income families, who have a high propensity to consume and are the overwhelming recipients,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos in a research note on Monday.
Most of Mexico's remittances are sent by the millions of Mexicans living in the United States and are a pillar of support for Latin America's second-largest economy, which suffered its steepest contraction in 2020 since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Remittances sent to Mexico totaled $40.61 billion last year. For January and February 2021, Mexico received a total of $6.47 billion in remittances, up from $5.35 billion the first two months of last year.
Remittance flows are expected to remain strong on the back of the $1.9 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus package and robust economic growth in the United States.

""Generous wage/income support fiscal transfers in the U.S., a very competitive MXN/USD level, and a deep contraction of activity and employment in Mexico have acted as both push and pull drivers of dollar remittances from the U.S. to Mexico,"" Ramos said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity surged to a record high in March amid robust growth in new orders, in the latest indication of a roaring economy that is being boosted by increased vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus.
The upbeat survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday followed news on Friday that the economy added 916,000 jobs last month, the most since August. Economic growth this year is expected to be the best in nearly four decades.
""Vigorous services activity in March sets the stage for robust expansion in the second quarter,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""All the right pieces for a faster services recovery – expanded vaccine eligibility, reopenings, and historic fiscal expansion – are falling into place."" 
The ISM's non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a reading of 63.7 last month also due to warmer weather. That was the highest in the survey's history and followed 55.3 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 59.0 in March. 
The ISM said comments from services industries indicated that ""the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions has released pent-up demand for many."" It, however, noted that ""production-capacity constraints, material shortages, weather and challenges in logistics and human resources continue to cause supply chain disruption.""
A raft of reports from manufacturing to consumer confidence and employment have suggested that the vastly improved public health situation and the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package are providing a powerful tailwind to the economy.
The ISM reported last week that its measure of national manufacturing activity soared to its highest level in more than 37 years in March. The services industry, hardest hit by the pandemic, could accelerate further as the economy re-opens. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday fully vaccinated people could safely travel at ""low risk.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Dow hitting record highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

BROAD GROWTH
All 18 services industries reported growth last month. Businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation segment lauded the reopening of movie theaters in California and New York, which they said was ""creating a surge in demand.""
Retailers said they remained ""cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year as businesses continue to open up and projects come online."" 
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry rebounded to an all-time high from a nine-month low in February. No industry reported a drop in new orders in March. 
The ISM said comments from businesses included ""we have resumed several large projects that were on hold due to the pandemic"" and ""higher sales at retail outlets.""
But businesses are grappling with logistics challenges, port and shipping delays as well as shortages of materials, with some saying ""it is still difficult to find trucks for loads and to secure shipping containers.""
Those supply constraints are raising costs for businesses. 
The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries jumped to the highest reading since July 2008. The surge in these price measures have added to concerns of higher inflation this year. But some economists caution they are not reliable predictors of future inflation.
""These price measures generally follow recent changes in headline inflation that are often caused by changes in energy prices,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""The business surveys could be a signal of higher inflation to come, but the relationship between the survey price data and future inflation changes generally has been weak."" 
Inflation is seen driven by the generous fiscal stimulus and extremely accommodative monetary policy. 
The ISM survey's measure of services industry employment shot up last month to the highest reading since May 2019. That confirmed the sharp acceleration in private services industry employment in March.
Services businesses said they ""have recalled everyone put on waivers and made new hires"" and had ""additional employees added to service the needs of new customers at new locations.""
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed new orders for U.S.-made goods dropped 0.8% in February, likely weighed down by unseasonably cold weather. Factory orders surged 2.7% in January.
Graphic: Factory orders https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgxkxavq/factoryorders.png
The weakness in factory orders is likely temporary, though a recent brief blockage of the Suez Canal and global semiconductor shortage could hurt some segments of the manufacturing industry.
That is not expected to have an impact on lofty growth projections for this year. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.

""For the next few months, manufacturing and business investment may struggle a little,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior director at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

A state of emergency declared in the Tokyo area to curb the spread of COVID-19 hurt service sector spending such as restaurants and bars, while demand for home appliances and food and beverage was likely to stand firm, analysts said. 
Household spending is forecast to have fallen 5.3% in February from a year earlier after a 6.1% decline in January, the poll of 16 economists showed.
But compared with the previous month, household spending likely grew 2.8% in February, rebounding from a 7.3% drop in January, the poll found. 
The government will release household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on April 6 (2330 GMT, April 5).
A decline in new coronavirus cases in February helped to improve consumer sentiment from January but a more recent rebound in infections clouds the outlook, analysts said.
""Spending on consumer goods were rather on the uptick in February led by firm demand for stay-at-home and remote working related items,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. 
""On the other hand, spending on services likely remained lackluster. Consumer spending was expected to have picked up in February but the pace of recovery was slow.""

Japan's economy has rebounded from a pandemic-induced deep slump last year. Many economists expect the economy contracted again in the January-March quarter because of emergency coronavirus curbs but then expect an export-led gradual recovery.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 45.6 in March from 44.2 in February, but remained well below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
There were widespread reports that business closures, due to coronavirus controls, caused contractions in factory output during March, according to the survey.
""The Mexican manufacturing sector was again hampered by COVID-19 restrictions, with business closures causing further reductions in sales and output. Subsequently, firms continued to lower input purchasing and employment. However, rates of contraction did at least slow,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
The overall fall was the slowest over the past 12 months, but sharper than any seen prior to that. And after reaching a one-year high in February, the overall level of business confidence fell in March to 55.8, from 58.2 in February.
""While the COVID-19 vaccination program lifted business confidence to a one-year high in February, growing concerns about a further wave of infections and the possibility that controls could tighten restricted sentiment in March. Uncertainty could further delay the recovery, dampening business investments and preventing job creation"", said De Lima.
Mexico's economy is seen growing at a quick pace in 2021 and reaching pre-pandemic levels by the beginning of 2022, after suffering its steepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s last year, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.
The PMI index tracks developments on a range of business indicators including prices, new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

607,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell in February, likely weighed down by unseasonably cold weather, though manufacturing remains strong as the economic recovery regains steam amid an improving public health situation and massive fiscal stimulus.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders dropped 0.8% after surging 2.7% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders slipping 0.5% in February. Orders increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis. 
Severe weather blanketed large parts of the country, including winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, in the second half of February, disrupting consumer spending, production at factories, home building and sales.
But that's all the rear view mirror. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said last week its index of national factory activity jumped in March to its highest level since December 1983. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has been buoyed by a shift in demand towards goods from services during the pandemic.
Job growth accelerated sharply in March, the government reported on Friday.
Economic growth is expected take off this year, powered by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the reopening of nonessential businesses as more Americans are vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
Factory goods orders in February were held down by declines in demand for machinery, computers and electronic products, as well as primary metals. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose. 
Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.8% in February after gaining 0.2% in January, suggesting a rebound in demand in the coming months.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, fell 0.9% in February instead of dropping 0.8% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, decreased 1.1%. They were previously reported to have declined 1.0% in February.

Business spending on equipment increased robustly for a second straight quarter in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy's 4.3% annualized growth rate during that period.

608,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's annual inflation climbed above 16% in March for the first time since mid-2019, data showed on Monday, piling pressure on new central bank governor Sahap Kavcioglu to maintain tight policy after his surprise appointment.
Consumer prices were up 16.19% year-on-year, higher than 16.11% in a Reuters poll and 15.61% in February. Inflation remains well above a 5% official target and has been in double digits for most of the past four years.
Month-on-month CPI inflation was 1.08%, the Turkish Statistical Institute said, compared to a Reuters poll forecast of 1.04%.
The former central bank governor, Naci Agbal, had raised the policy rate to 19% from 10.25%. But he was ousted on March 20 - after only four months on the job and two days after a last rate hike - prompting a 12% drop in the lira to near record lows. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has abruptly ousted four bank chiefs in less than two years, hurting Turkey's monetary credibility and contributing to the currency's long-term decline, which in turn has driven up overall inflation via imports.
Kavcioglu has in the past criticised tight policy, including making the unorthodox claim shared by Erdogan that high rates cause inflation. Yet he has told investors and bankers in recent weeks rates must remain high due to high inflation.
The producer price index rose 4.13% month-on-month in March for an annual rise of 31.2%, the data showed.
The monthly CPI price rise was underpinned by demand in the health, education and hospitality groups, including restaurants, after coronavirus measures were eased. 
Annual rises were driven by higher energy and import prices which raised transportation-related prices by nearly 25%. 

According to a February forecast, the central bank expected a maximum of 17% inflation in March and a bit more in April. Analysts predict it will rise through April, when Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects it to peak at 18%.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell slightly to 53.3 in March from 53.9 in February, remaining above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. 
The overall index has fallen from a recent peak of 57.1 in January, indicating the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has lost some momentum.
""The pandemic and associated restrictions continued to trim new business growth, according to respondents, contributing to a more downbeat outlook for business activity over the next 12 months,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""This largely reflected doubts about clients' willingness to spend as well as the short-term boost to the economy from the vaccine rollout, with some firms expecting market activity to remain subdued until the second half of the year.""
The output subindex slipped to 56.2 from 56.9, dropping further from the 15-month high hit in January and below the series average of 61.5.
The employment subindex, while remaining in contractionary territory, was just below the 50 mark and at its second-highest since February last year.
More than 87% of the firms surveyed gave a neutral forecast for future output, indicating caution among some companies about the speed of the recovery from the pandemic, while 11% expected activity to rise.

""While businesses were hopeful that output would expand over the coming 12 months, the degree of optimism continued to dwindle during March. Notably, the Future Output Index fell to the lowest since last June, but was above the 50.0 no-change threshold,"" the PMI report said.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 52.6 in March from 50.6 in February, hitting a 20-month high and indicating a solid upturn in business conditions but still below the series average of 54.1.
""The PMI has also now been above the 50.0 no-change mark in each of the latest four months, signalling increased momentum in the economy's recovery. Likewise, business confidence improved to an eight-month high, with vaccine optimism driving confidence in future activity,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
The output subindex climbed to 56.3 in March from 51.8 in February, also reaching its highest level since July 2019 but still below the series average of 57.3.
Some subindexes weighed on the overall PMI, however, with input prices ticking up and delivery times on raw materials and key components increasing amid pressure on global supply chains.
""There is growing concern surrounding supply-side factors, however, with global delivery delays having built up during the first quarter of the year,"" Owen said.
""Firms struggling to contain costs may find this acting as a resistance to future output growth as COVID-19 restrictions continue to unwind and new orders start to improve.""
Employment contracted for the second consecutive month and shrank at a slightly faster pace than in February.
Expectations for future output continued a gradual rise into March and the subindex has been rising further into growth territory for four straight months.

""Despite a greater intake of new orders, anecdotal evidence suggested that firms sought to ease cost pressures through staff reductions. That said, the rate of job shedding was much softer than those seen throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic so far,"" the PMI report said.

A trade agreement between London and Brussels which came into force on Jan. 1 has meant some companies have had to deal with new bureaucracy and rules.
The Survation survey for London First/EY, conducted in February, found 75% had experienced some disruption, even though 71% said they had felt prepared for the changes.
Almost half, 49%, said they expected that to continue in the long-term while nearly a third said they had stopped trading with the EU and countries not covered by rollover agreements.
The findings echo other surveys which indicate businesses have had difficulties with their supply chains, along with other border and regulatory matters, since the new trading arrangements came into operation.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the disruption is mainly due to ""teething"" problems which would ease as firms got to grips with the new system. 
""It’s clear that the disruptions to UK trade with the EU go beyond teething problems with the new regime,"" said John Dickie, Acting Chief Executive of London First.
""If the government is to champion Global Britain successfully, it must redouble its efforts to fix our trading relationship with the EU.""
The survey of 1,040 businesses found 29% of firms reported their cost base had increased, with half of these businesses saying those costs would have to be passed on to customers.

However, 26% reported they had a better understanding of how to access new markets, and 24% saw the new trading arrangements as a chance to diversify their activities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the most jobs in seven months in March as more Americans got vaccinated and the government doled out additional pandemic relief money, marking the start of what could be the strongest economic performance this year in nearly four decades.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed job gains in February were larger than initially estimated. The best first two months of employment growth of any administration in history suggested the labor market has finally turned the corner.
All industries added jobs and many people rejoined the labor force. A measure of the economy's ability to create employment also improved. But the road to full recovery remains long. The jobs deficit is still huge and more than four million Americans have been unemployed for over six months. 
President Joe Biden welcomed the job growth spurt.
""The first two months of our administration has seen more new jobs created than the first two months of any administration in history,"" Biden told reporters. ""It's a reflection of two things going on here, a new economic strategy focused on building from the bottom to the middle up, and one that puts government on the side of working people.""Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000. Still, employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. At the current pace, many believe the more than 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic could be recouped by the end of next year.
The economy added 1.6 million jobs in the first quarter.
The strong gains could play into fears of the economy over heating, even as ample slack remains. The Federal Reserve has signaled it would maintain its ultra easy monetary policy stance for a while to allow complete healing.
""The economy is booming,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""If vaccines result in low enough COVID numbers to allow significant further service-sector reopening, the Fed will have to start discussing a taper, and update its guidance, before the end of this year.""
(GRAPHIC - Substantial further progress for the Fed? Substantial further progress for the Fed?: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FEDPROGRESS/nmovazmdypa/chart.png)Job growth last month was led by the leisure and hospitality sector, where employers hired 280,000 workers. Restaurants and bars accounted for nearly two-thirds of the industry's employment gains. Construction employment rebounded by 110,000 after being depressed by harsh weather in February.
Manufacturers hired 53,000 employees. Public and private 
education payrolls also rose as more schools resumed in-person learning and other school-related activities. Retailers also added jobs, while mining employment increased by the most since 1981.

As of Friday morning, the United States had administered 157.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country and distributed 204.7 million doses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Friday, the CDC said fully vaccinated people could safely travel at ""low risk,"" which could help accelerate the services industry recovery. 
The Biden administration's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package approved in March is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and fresh funding for businesses.
Economists expect job growth will average about 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   
First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as an annualized rate of 10.0%. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years. 
The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. Wall Street is closed for Good Friday.
POWERFUL TAILWIND
First-quarter growth prospects got a boost from workers putting in longer hours in March as temperatures rose. The average workweek rose to 34.9 hours from 34.6 hours. That, together with robust hiring lifted aggregate hours 1.5%. 
Though average hourly earnings slipped 0.1% as the lower-wage leisure and hospitality industry dominated payroll growth, a proxy for take home pay increased 1.4%.
""The powerful tailwind of the reopening of economic activity appears to be gathering force,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without the misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 6.4% in March.
Even so, a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to a one-year low of 10.7% after holding at 11.1% for two straight months.
About 347,000 people, mostly women, re-entered the labor force in March. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 61.5% from 61.4% in February. 
The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, increased to 57.8% from 57.6% in the prior month. But about 4.218 million people have been out of work for more than 27 weeks, accounting for 43.4% of the 9.7 million people classified as unemployed last month. That was up from 41.5% in February.

""Overall, the aggressive policy support and speed of this cycle should limit labor market scarring,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, though the labor market recovery is gaining traction as economic activity picks up, driven by increased vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus.
That was confirmed by other data on Thursday showing a measure of manufacturing activity soared to its strongest level in more than 37 years in March, with employment at factories the highest since February 2018. Layoffs announced by U.S. companies in March were also the fewest in more than 2-1/2 years.
Initial claims have been distorted by backlogs, multiple filings and fraud, making it difficult to get a clear signal on the labor market's health from the weekly data.
""Higher jobless claims in the most recent week don't detract from the strong downward trend, which will continue given the reopening of local and state economies, and the acceleration of vaccinations,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 61,000 to a seasonally adjusted 719,000 for the week ended March 27, the Labor Department said. 
Data for the prior week was revised to show 26,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, pushing total filings down to 658,000 and below their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a 200,000 to 250,000 range. 
The government revised the claims data from 2016, which showed applications hitting a record 6.149 million in April 2020, instead of 6.867 million in March 2020. 
A staggering 79 million claims were filed under the regular state (UI) programs since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of non-essential businesses such as restaurants, bars and gyms were being enforced across many states to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
About 28 more million applications were submitted under the government-funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PAU) program, which covers the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the UI programs.
""Together, that equates to 70% of payrolls, or 67% of household employment, pre-pandemic and reflects duplicate filings and fraud,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""But also the tremendous churn in the labor market since COVID, with some workers losing jobs more than once as restrictions and activity fluctuated this past year."" 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 680,000 applications in the latest week. Virginia accounted for the bulk of the rise. There were also notable increases in California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey and New York.
Including the PUA program, 951,458 people filed claims last week, remaining below one million for a second straight week.
U.S. stocks were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MANUFACTURING SHINES 
Both the economy and the labor market appear to have turned the corner after hitting a ditch in December, thanks to the acceleration in inoculations, which is allowing more businesses to reopen. The White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February. That was the highest level since December 1983. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists had forecast the index rising to 61.3 in March. The survey's manufacturing employment gauge shot up to its the highest reading since February 2018.
According to the ISM, ""significantly more companies are hiring or attempting to hire than those reducing labor forces.""
Indeed, a third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned layoffs by U.S.-based companies dropped 11% to 30,603 in March, the fewest since July 2018. Through the first quarter planned layoffs plunged 35%, compared the October-December period. At 144,686, job cuts last quarter were the fewest since the fourth quarter of 2019.
The labor market's improving fortunes were underscored by a survey from The Conference Board this week showing its measure of household employment rebounding in March after three straight monthly decreases. That aligns with expectations that the government's closely watched employment report on Friday will show a surge in job growth in March.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 647,000 jobs last month after rising by 379,000 in February. That would leave employment about 8.8 million below its peak in February 2020, highlighting that a full labor market recovery is years away.
At least 18.2 million people were collecting unemployment checks in mid-March, a sign that long-term joblessness was becoming entrenched. 

""But even at that rapid (hiring) clip, it would take the economy until January 2024 to get back to pre-pandemic trends,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation.
""This cold, hard math underscores the hurdles facing the millions of workers still on state or federal jobless aid as they seek to return to productive work.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity soared to its highest level in more than 37 years in March, driven by strong growth in new orders, the clearest sign yet that a much anticipated economic boom was probably underway. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February. That was the highest level since December 1983. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 61.3 in March. The year-long COVID-19 pandemic has boosted demand for goods.
Economic growth is expected take off this year, juiced up by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the reopening of nonessential businesses as more Americans are vaccinated against the coronavirus.
The relief package passed last month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6. Households have also accumulated about $19 trillion in excess savings, which are expected to fuel pent-up demand.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled a plan to spend roughly $2 trillion on infrastructure like roads and bridges over 10 years. 
First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.
But the massive fiscal stimulus could leave the economy pushing against domestic capacity constraints and fan inflation.
Suppliers are already struggling to deliver materials to manufacturers, pushing up production costs. That has been most evident in the automobile industry, where a global semiconductor chip shortage has forced cuts in production. 
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers last month hovered near its highest since July 2008. 
Its forward-looking new orders sub-index jumped to 68.0 in March. That was the highest reading since January 2004 and was up from 64.8 in February. Factories also received more export orders, while order backlogs swelled.
There is room for further expansion, with inventories at manufacturers and their clients still lean. With demand robust, factories hired more workers in March. The survey's manufacturing employment gauge shot up to 59.6, the highest reading since February 2018, from 54.4 in February. 

That supports expectations for a sharp acceleration in employment growth in March. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 647,000 jobs last month after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish March's employment report on Friday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil fell in February for the first time in 10 months, figures showed on Thursday, an unexpected decline that adds weight to a growing view that Latin America's largest economy shrank in the first quarter.
February's 0.7% fall in industrial output was significantly weaker than the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists for a 0.4% rise. The following chart shows that several months of slowing growth have finally turned into outright decline.
Graphic: Brazil industrial output https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkpleonzvb/INDUS.png
Statistics agency IBGE said the year-on-year rise was 0.4%, also well below the Reuters poll forecast of 1.5% growth.
Brazil is being battered by a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 67,000 deaths in the month triggering renewed lockdowns, the immediate outlook for industry and wider economy is darkening.
""With the surveys for this month deteriorating and car plants shutting amid the latest COVID-19 outbreak, the data for March and April are likely to be worse still,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics.
""Overall, the risks to our 3% GDP growth forecast for this year increasingly look skewed to the downside,"" he said.
The central bank last week raised its 2021 industrial output growth forecast to 6.4% from 5.1%. But the latest survey by the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank showed that industrial confidence fell in March to its lowest since August.
IBGE said the main drivers of February's decline were a 7.2% slump in auto and auto parts production in the month, and a 4.7% decline in mining output.
Three of the four major categories saw output fall in February, led by a 4.6% decline in durable goods production, while of the 26 industry segments surveyed, 14 registered lower output, IBGE said.
Brazil's industrial sector in February was 2.8% bigger than February last year, just before the global COVID-19 pandemic erupted, IBGE said, but still 13.6% smaller than its peak from May 2011.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 58.5 in March from 54.8 in February, posting the highest reading in the 10-year history of the survey. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""Canadian manufacturers ended the first quarter of 2021 on an upbeat note,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""The growth was driven by stronger demand as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease across the provinces.""
The new orders index rose to 58.0, its highest since November 2013, from 54.4 in February, while the measure of output was at 57.7, up from 52.0.
Last month, the Bank of Canada said it now expected the economy to grow in the first quarter, an upgrade from its January forecast of a contraction, saying it was proving more resilient to a second wave of COVID-19 infections than expected. 
On a more cautious note, material shortages and border restrictions linked to the pandemic contributed to the greatest lengthening in lead times since April last year, IHS Markit said.
The suppliers' delivery times index fell to 28.7 from 34.0 in February, while the measure of input prices rose to the highest since August 2018.

Still, manufacturers were upbeat about their prospects for growth in the year ahead, with the future output index climbing to 67.6, its highest level since May 2019.

Investing.com --- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose unexpectedly last week, signaling that the improvement in labor market trends remains uneven despite the reopening of large swathes of the economy.
The Labor Department said 714,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, up from 658,000 the previous week. The latter figure, which was already the lowest since the pandemic started destroying jobs a year ago, was revised down by 26,000. 
Analysts had expected a marginal decline in initial claims to 680,000.  
The number of those making continuing claims, which is compiled with a one-week lag to the initial claims data, fell to 3.794 million.
Millions more remain on other, pandemic-related insurance programs. The overall number of people claiming under all unemployment-related programs - collated parallel to the continuing claims series -  resumed its longer-term decline in the week through March 13. It fell by over 1.5 million to 18.21 million.
The numbers suggest that layoffs are still running at a historically high level, despite evidence of a sharp improvement in hiring trends through mid-March. Private-payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday that the economy added 517,000 jobs in March, nearly three times the February number, as various states relaxed pandemic-driven restrictions that have mainly hit labor-intensive service industries.
The government's more authoritative labor market survey is due to be released on Friday. Analysts expect total nonfarm payrolls to have risen by 647,000. The ADP and government numbers have shown a much lower correlation during the pandemic than before it."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Factories across Europe and Asia ramped up production in March as a solid recovery in demand helped manufacturers move past the setbacks of the pandemic, although escalating costs and supply- chain disruptions were creating challenges and driving prices.
A series of upbeat factory surveys released on Thursday reinforced market optimism that vaccine rollouts, as well as strong growth in global powerhouses like the United States and China, would help economies emerge from their sharp downturns of 2020.
Euro zone monthly factory activity growth galloped at its fastest pace in the near 24-year history of a leading business survey last month, but supply chain disruptions and renewed lockdowns in the region may rein it in soon. [EUR/PMIM]
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 62.5 in March from February's 57.9, above the initial 62.4 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
""The euro zone manufacturing sector proved once again to remain resilient through the re-imposed wave of lockdowns,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
In Germany, Europe's largest economy, activity grew at the fastest pace on record. In France, the bloc's second-biggest economy, it hit levels not seen since the internet boom at the turn of the century.
But much of Europe is suffering a third wave of coronavirus infections, and with a slow vaccine rollout in the region, governments have re-imposed tough controls on citizens, likely hitting the bloc's dominant services industry hard.
Meanwhile, supply-chain issues, exacerbated when the recent blockage of the Suez Canal caused disruption in global shipping and ports that could take months to resolve, has driven a surge in input prices and the biggest increase in suppliers' delivery times since the survey began.
""Margins are coming under pressure because of all the supply-chain issues. The Suez issue didn't help and we now have inventories at very low levels,"" said David Owen at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
In Britain, outside the currency union, factories rode a wave of orders and prepared for a gradual re-opening of the economy from its COVID-19 shutdowns by hiring staff at the fastest rate since 2014. [GB/PMIM] 
ASIA EXPANDS
Japan and South Korea saw factory activity expand in March thanks to solid demand at home and abroad, PMIs showed, offering relief to policymakers facing pressure to speed up a patchy recovery.
""South Korean manufacturers continued to signal strong optimism as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations began and demand for new products accelerated,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
China's factory activity in March expanded at the slowest pace in almost a year, though underlying economic conditions remained positive.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI, which focuses on smaller firms, dropped to 50.6 in March from February's 50.9, missing market expectations.
The private-sector survey came after the official manufacturing PMI on Wednesday, which showed Chinese factories cranking up production after a brief lull during the Lunar New Year holiday.
Activity in big, export-reliant economies stayed brisk.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.7 in March from the previous month's 51.4 reading, marking the fastest expansion since October 2018.
South Korea's PMI stood at 55.3 in March, with activity expanding for a sixth straight month.
Manufacturing activity also accelerated in Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia, the March PMI surveys showed. Malaysian activity continued to decline but at a slower pace.
Although supply-chain disruption related to previous COVID-19 outbreaks eased, China's Caixin survey showed factories reporting a sharp increase in input costs.

""Input prices continue to outpace output prices, suggesting there may be some risk to profit margins,"" said Erin Xin, China economist at HSBC.
""Should there be significant compression in profit margins, this could dampen firms' capex spending in the coming quarters.""

With Europe suffering a third wave of coronavirus infections, governments have re-imposed tough controls on their citizens, hurting the bloc's dominant service industry and leaving it to manufacturers to drive the economic recovery.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 62.5 in March from February's 57.9, ahead of the initial 62.4 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, climbed to 63.3 from 57.6, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and easily a survey high.
""Euro zone manufacturing is booming,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Although centred on Germany, which saw a particularly strong record expansion during the month, the improving trend is broad based across the region as factories benefit from rising domestic demand and resurgent export growth.""
But supply chain issues, likely exacerbated by the recent blockage of the Suez Canal which has caused disruption to global shipping and at ports that could take months to resolve, has driven a surge in prices and the biggest increase in suppliers' delivery times since the survey began.
Both the readings for input and output prices were near record highs. The input price index jumped to 79.7 from 73.9, a level not seen in a decade.
""While the forces driving prices higher appear to be temporary, linked to the initial rebound from COVID-19 lockdowns, any further upward pressure on firms' costs and selling prices is unwelcome,"" Williamson said.

Still, as factories struggled to meet flourishing demand they increased headcount sharply and built up a solid backlog of work.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, reached 66.6, matching the record flash reading achieved thanks to a surge in demand from the United States and China.
Factories in Europe's biggest economy have been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by lockdowns that have impacted the services sector.
""It was a record-breaking month on many fronts including new export orders, which have benefited from synchronised upturns in sales to the US and China and seen an unprecedented number of German manufacturers reporting growth,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.

He added: ""However, the Suez Canal blockage could not have come at a worse time, with more than three-quarters of German manufacturers already reporting increasing lead times on inputs in March, with the potential for those numbers to increase further given the backlog of containers it created and the anticipated congestion at ports in the coming days and weeks.""

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity in March expanded at the slowest pace in almost a year thanks to weaker overall domestic demand, a private survey said. However, underlying economic conditions remained positive even as manufacturers’ input and output inflationary pressures intensify.
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was at 50.6 in March, against the 51.3 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.9 reading.
The figure remained above the 50-mark indicating growth but contrasted with the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs released a day earlier, which read 51.9 and 56.3 respectively.
The survey said that the supply chain disruption due to previous COVID-19 outbreaks had eased for the small, private and export-oriented firms included, but input costs increased at their fastest rate in 40 months.
However, with producer price inflation in February already at its highest level in more than two years, some investors are paying attention.
""We should pay attention to inflation in future as the gauges for input and output prices have been rising for several months... the growing inflationary pressure limits the room for future policies and is not a good thing for sustaining an economic recovery in the post-epidemic period,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
Exporters also continue to face a squeeze in profits as raw material prices surge thanks to a rallying Chinese yuan and rising labor costs. The survey also said that Chinese manufacturers reduced their staffing levels for a fourth consecutive month in March, albeit marginally.
Adding a positive note was the overall progress in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout globally, which increased overseas demand and the return to growth of new export orders. Firms also remained optimistic about the business outlook in 2021 due to hopes of an end to COVID-19, the rebound in overseas demand and plans to expand capacity.
Meanwhile, the Caixin services PMI focusing on the services sector is due on the following week."

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 50.6 last month - the lowest level since April 2020 - from February's 50.9, missing analyst expectations for an uptick to 51.3. 
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The findings contrast with those in an official survey which showed manufacturing activity grew at a stronger pace as large firms ramped up production after a brief lull during the Lunar New Year holidays.
Although supply chain disruption related to previous COVID-19 outbreaks eased, the private survey showed factories reported a sharp increase in input costs, which surged at their fastest clip in 40 months. 
The Caixin survey focuses on small, private and export-oriented firms while the official survey typically polls large and state-owned manufacturers. 
Producer price inflation in February already picked up to its highest level in more than two years.

""The growing inflationary pressure limits the room for future policies and is not a good thing for sustaining an economic recovery in the post-epidemic period.""
Exporters previously told Reuters that they were a facing a squeeze in profits due to surging raw material prices, a rallying Chinese currency and rising labour costs. 
But not everything was gloomy, as Thursday's survey showed the return to growth of new export orders as foreign demand improves amid greater global COVID-19 vaccination efforts - in line with findings in the official survey. 
Chinese manufacturers trimmed their staffing levels for the fourth straight month in March, but the rate of reduction was only marginal. 
Firms also remained strongly optimistic about the business outlook over the next year due to hopes of an end to the pandemic, a rebound in overseas demand and plans to expand capacity, the survey showed.
China managed to largely bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control much earlier than many countries as authorities imposed stringent anti-virus curbs and lockdowns at the initial phase of the outbreak.
That has helped its economy mount a rapid turnaround after a slump at the start of 2020, led by resurgent exports growth as factories raced to fill overseas orders. 
Beijing has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, well below analyst expectations for an expansion of more than 8% as authorities emphasised the importance of solidifying the recovery rather than chasing higher GDP numbers.

China was the only major economy to post growth last year with an expansion of 2.3%, but that still marked the weakest annual pace in more than 40 years due to the COVID-19 fallout.

The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.7 in March from the previous month's 51.4 reading.
The rise in the headline figure, which was stronger than a preliminary 52.0 reading, marked the fastest expansion in manufacturers' activity since October 2018.
Output levels rose for the second straight month, with firms reporting that overseas and domestic demand continued to recover as the impact of the health crisis began to dissipate.
But new overseas orders expanded at a slower pace than in February, with firms reporting that external demand strength was centred on Asian economies such as China and South Korea.
""Japanese manufacturers were confident that output would continue to rise over the coming 12 months,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Firms cited hopes that a successful vaccination rollout which began in March would help to bring a quicker end to the pandemic and allow for a broad-based recovery in demand.""
The survey also showed that producers are facing a jump in input prices, which expanded at their fastest pace since late 2018, mainly due to higher raw material costs.

Manufacturers partly passed on those increased input costs to their customers, the survey said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' sentiment improved to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter as companies planned to increase capital expenditure this year, suggesting the export-reliant economy was benefiting from a solid recovery in global demand.
Confidence among big non-manufacturers also recovered from three months ago, underscoring the fading strains from the coronavirus pandemic, a central bank survey showed on Thursday.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rose to plus 5 in March from minus 10 in December, the Bank of Japan's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey showed, marking the third straight quarter of improvement and hitting the highest level since September 2019.
It compared with market forecasts of a flat reading.
The data offers some relief for policymakers striving to revitalise the pandemic-hit economy as a fourth wave of infections raises uncertainty about the outlook.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment improved to minus 1 in the March survey from minus 5 in December, the survey showed.
Big firms expect to increase capital expenditure by 3.0% in the year that began in April, compared with a median forecast for a 1.4% increase, the survey showed.
Like many countries, Japan deployed massive monetary and fiscal stimulus over the past year to lift the economy back from a record postwar slump.
Many analysts expect the economy to have contracted in the first quarter but see it gradually emerging from the doldrums as solid exports offset some of the weakness in consumption. 

The BOJ tankan indexes are derived by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired the most workers in six months in March as more Americans got vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the economy towards a broader reopening, which is expected to unleash a strong wave of pent-up demand in the coming months.
Though the private payrolls gain shown in the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday was slightly below economists' expectations, the jump in hiring aligned with a recent improvement in labor market conditions. The broad-based increase was led by the leisure and hospitality industry. 
The labor market and economy are also being supported by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.
""Companies were hiring again in March and the economy was roaring,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Private payrolls surged by 517,000 jobs this month after rising 176,000 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 550,000 jobs in March.
The leisure and hospitality sector added 169,000 jobs after only 51,000 in February. Construction payrolls rebounded by 32,000 jobs, while hiring at factories rose by 49,000 positions. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.
It has a very poor track record of predicting the private payrolls count in the government's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report because of methodology differences. Recent reports have pointed to rapidly improving labor market conditions. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has dropped to the lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. A report on Tuesday showed a measure of household employment rebounding by the most in a year in March after three straight monthly decreases.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG JOB GAINS EXPECTED
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely surged by 647,000 jobs in March after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish March's employment report on Friday.
""We still expect nonfarm payrolls to show an above-consensus 700,000 gain, with a lot of that gain reflecting the rebound in leisure and hospitality employment,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
Economists are hopeful that the labor market has turned the corner after shedding 306,000 jobs in December. The relief package passed this month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6.
That is expected to drive consumer spending beginning in March. In addition, Americans have amassed about $1.9 trillion in excess savings, which economists expect will fuel consumer spending when the economy fully re-opens this year and well into 2021, and spur demand for workers.
Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Raphael Bostic said on Tuesday, ""a million jobs a month could become the standard through the summer.""
Employment is 9.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. While the labor market is regaining its footing, the housing market appears to be stumbling as surging prices amid tight supply and rising mortgage rates reduce affordability. 
A separate report on Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors showed its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in February, tumbled 10.6%, with contracts falling in all four regions.
Economists had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would decline 2.6% in February. Compared to a year ago, pending home sales slipped 0.5% in February. Contracts had increased for eight straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
The supply of existing homes is at a record low. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.17%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Mortgage rates have increased since February.
The decline in contracts suggested sales of previously owned homes could fall further in March after dropping sharply in February. A third report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy a home fell last week after four straight weekly increases.
""The housing market continues to face both tailwinds and headwinds. Pent-up demand and a strong economic rebound should support sales as we head into the heart of the spring home selling season,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""However, tight inventories and home prices at multi-year highs will make homebuying difficult for some households.""

Data on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index soared 11.2% in January from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after rising 10.4% in December.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Unemployment in Brazil rose in January for the first time in four months, figures showed on Wednesday, kicking off the year back above 14% as job growth failed to keep pace with the number of people returning to the labor market to look for work.
The 14.2% jobless rate in the three months to January was slightly higher than the 14.1% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, inching back up towards the record 14.6% in the three months to September. It was up from 13.9% in the final quarter of 2020.
Figures from statistics agency IBGE showed that the number of Brazilians officially unemployed in the three months to January rose slightly to 14.3 million from 14.1 million in the three months to October, and up 20% from a year ago.
Some 86 million Brazilians had work, up 2% or 1.7 million people from the August-October period, although still down 8.6% or 8.1 million people from the same period a year earlier.
The workforce stood at 100.3 million people, up 2% or 1.9 million from the three months through October, and the number of people out of the workforce entirely fell by 1.1% to 76.4 million, IBGE said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's coronavirus-hammered economy grew more quickly than previously thought in the final three months of last year but still shrank by the most in more than three centuries in 2020 as a whole, official data showed on Wednesday.
Gross domestic product increased by 1.3% between October and December last year from the previous three-month period, the Office for National Statistics said.
That was stronger than an earlier estimate of 1.0% growth as the ONS received more data in recent weeks.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the growth rate to remain at 1.0%.
In 2020, gross domestic product fell by 9.8% from 2019, only slightly less sharp than an initial estimate of a 9.9% slump.
Britain's economy suffered the biggest drop of all countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development except for Argentina and Spain last year, OECD data has shown.
Britain's economy remained 7.3% smaller than before the pandemic, in inflation-adjusted terms, the second biggest drop among eight major economies listed by the ONS. 
But in nominal terms - which is affected less by differences in the way countries compile the data - Britain stood middle of the pack.
Data also showed households were sitting on a big pile savings that the Bank of England thinks will fuel a jump in spending as the government lifts restrictions on the economy between now and late June.
The savings ratio rose to 16.1% from 14.3% in the third quarter and for 2020 as a whole it hit a record high of 16.3%, compared with 6.8% in 2019.
Separate data showed Britain's current account deficit widened to 26.3 billion pounds in the fourth quarter, almost double the shortfall in the third quarter, as firms rushed to import goods before the Jan. 1 start to the country's less open trade relationship with the European Union.

But the deficit - a long-standing concern for investors because it leaves Britain reliant on foreign inflows of cash - came in below forecasts of 33 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output fell in February as an earthquake and semiconductor shortage led to declines in the production of cars and electrical machinery, adding to worries for an economy struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to contract in the current quarter due to coronavirus-related curbs that were imposed from early January for Tokyo and other prefectures.
Official data released on Wednesday showed factory output shrank 2.1% from the previous month in February, dragged down by falls in production of cars, electrical machinery and information and communication equipment.
Disrupting production was a magnitude 7.3-earthquake off the coast of eastern Japan on Feb. 13, which damaged homes and businesses throughout the northern region.
""The semiconductor shortage and natural disasters pushed down output by quite a lot,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""It will be hard for production to rebound,"" said Sera. ""If there is a recovery in production, the pace will likely be very gradual.""
The output fall was worse than a 1.2% decline expected by economists and followed the previous month's sharp 4.3% gain.
Factories worldwide are struggling with a global semiconductor shortage, which has hurt the production of cars, smartphones and home appliances. 
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to drop another 1.9% in March, followed by a 9.3% rebound in April.
A trade ministry official said a March 19 fire at a Renesas Electronics chip-making plant was not reflected in the forecasts. 
Renesas, which commands nearly a third of the global market share for microcontroller chips used in cars, said on Tuesday it would take at least 100 days to get back to normal production at the plant.
Factory output had rebounded in January largely thanks to a sharp increase in the production of electronic parts and general-purpose machinery, as demand for tech-making equipment remains strong.
Some analysts, however, worry that Japan's economic recovery will be dragged down by weak spending at home and a slower-than-anticipated demand recovery abroad as economies slowly reopen, even in countries that have rolled out COVID-19 vaccines.
There is not much the government could do in terms of policy support if manufacturers' production remains hobbled by parts shortages, said Sumitomo Mitsui's Sera.
""If there would be temporary layoffs due to factory closures, the government could provide subsidies for that as part of economic policies,"" she said.

""But I don't think policies will help with boosting production,"" she added.

Investing.com – Chinese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in three months in March, with increased production after the Lunar New Year holidays and increasing overseas demand boosting the country on its road to a solid economic recovery.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day said that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March was 51.9, higher than both the 51 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.6 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 56.3, also surpassing its February reading of 51.4. Both indexes remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
“The latest official PMI surveys suggest that after being hit by COVID-19 disruptions earlier in the year, growth bounced back strongly this month,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note ahead of the data’s release.
Factory activity is usually dormant during the Lunar New Year holidays, which were in February this year. However, with workers discouraged from the customary travel to their hometowns during the holiday due to an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, factories resumed business earlier than expected. The domestic number of cases has now decreased, and everyday activity is returning to normal levels.
Although increasing overseas demand helped export orders returned to growth, Capital Economics’ Evans-Pritchard believes that the exports momentum could slow over the shorter term and in turn impact the manufacturing sector.
“The current strength of exports is likely to unwind over the coming quarters as vaccinations allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns,” the note added.
With COVID-19 cases resurging in areas such as Europe, the constraints in global trade have led some companies with inadequate imports of few raw materials, leading to prolonged delivery timeframes, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement accompanying the data.
Makers of cars and electronic devices, including TVs and smartphones, are sounding warnings about the global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays, as consumer demand bounces back.
The NBS data also showed that the service sector, whose recovery has been slower than that of the manufacturing sector, picked up significantly in March, as consumers slowly start to open their wallets.
Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs for the private sector are due later in the week."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in three months in March as factories cranked up production after a brief lull during the Lunar New Year holidays, with improving global demand adding further momentum to a solid economic recovery.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.9 from 50.6 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 13th straight month.
Analysts had expected it to rise to 51.0.
""The latest official PMI surveys suggest that after being hit by virus disruptions earlier in the year, growth bounced back strongly this month,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients after the data release. 
Chinese factory activity normally goes dormant during the Lunar New Year break, but this year millions of workers stayed put due to COVID-19 fears, which led to an earlier-than-usual resumption of business at factories. 
Authorities successfully curbed the domestic transmission of COVID-19 virus during the winter, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back as life once again returns to normal.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed both the sub-indexes for production and new orders stood at the highest level since December.
Adding to the positive impulse, export orders returned to growth amid improving foreign demand, the survey showed.
EXPORTS TO SLOW? 
Capital Economics' Evans-Pritchard believes the exports momentum could slow over the shorter term, and in turn weigh on the manufacturing sector.
""The current strength of exports is likely to unwind over the coming quarters as vaccinations allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns.""
China managed to largely bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control much earlier than many countries as authorities imposed stringent anti-virus curbs and lockdowns at the initial phase of the outbreak.
That has helped its economy mount a rapid turnaround after a slump at the start of 2020, led by resurgent exports growth as factories raced to fill overseas orders. Factory-gate prices have accelerated at their fastest pace in more than two years, while industrial output has also surged.
The resurgent COVID-19 infections abroad and constraints in global trade have seen some surveyed firms grappling with inadequate imports of few raw materials, leading to prolonged delivery timeframes, said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with the NBS in a statement accompanying the data.
Makers of cars and electronic devices including from TVs to smartphones are sounding alarm bells about a global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays as consumer demand bounces back from the coronavirus crisis.
Beijing has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, well below analyst expectations for an expansion of more than 8%. 
China's was the only major economy to post growth last year with an expansion of 2.3%, but that still marked the weakest annual pace in more than 40 years due to the COVID-19 fallout.

Growth in China's services sector picked up significantly in March, a separate survey showed, as consumers opened up their wallets after months of hesitation.
A sub-index for activity in the construction sector stood at 62.3 as weather turns warm, compared with 54.7 in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer confidence raced in March to its highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting views that economic growth will accelerate in the coming months, driven by more fiscal stimulus and an improving public health situation.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers were fairly upbeat about the labor market, with a measure of household employment rebounding after declining in February. Restrictions on non-essential businesses are being rolled back as more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19.
That, along with the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, has led economists to predict the economy will this year experience it best performance in nearly four decades. The survey showed more consumers intended to buy homes, cars and household appliances over the next six months.
""Consumers finally are fully on board with the pending expansion,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""What remains to be seen is how quickly services industries such as travel and leisure will open up, allowing venues for consumers to release their pent-up demand.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped 19.3 points to a reading of 109.7 this month, the highest level since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. The increase was the largest since April 2003. Confidence remains well below its lofty reading of 132.6 in February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 96.9.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, soared to a reading of 110.0 from 89.6 last month. The expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 109.6 from a reading of 90.9 in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were largely lower.
INFLATION WORRIES
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rebounded to a reading of 7.8 this month from -0.8 in February. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
That fits in with expectations for a sharp acceleration in job growth this month. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 639,000 jobs in March after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish its closely-watched employment report for March on Friday.
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income over the next six months rose to 15.5% from 14.8% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop increased to 13.3% from 12.9% in February. More consumers expected to purchase homes, motor vehicles and major household appliances compared to February.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months increased to 6.7% from 6.5% in February.
""Consumers' renewed optimism boosted their purchasing intentions for homes, autos and several big-ticket items,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. ""However, concerns of inflation in the short-term rose, most likely due to rising prices at the pump, and may temper spending intentions in the months ahead.""
The rise in house-buying intentions suggests demand for homes could remain strong and continue to drive up prices as supply remains tight. The housing market is being powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. It remains strong despite a rise in mortgage rates this year.

A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index soared 11.1% in January from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after increasing 10.2% in December.
""A wave of eager buyers is being forced to act swiftly and face heightened competition for the few homes available,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""The combined dynamic is pushing prices upward at their strongest pace in years, and it doesn't appear that there is an end in sight.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Producer prices in Brazil rose in February at their fastest rate since comparable records began seven years ago, figures showed on Tuesday, intensifying ""stagflation"" pressures in an economy struggling with rising interest rates, a weak currency and a rampant COVID-19 pandemic.
The monthly and annual rates of factory gate inflation in Latin America's largest economy jumped to 5.2% and 28.6%, respectively, both the highest since statistics agency Ibex's data series began in January 2014.
Prices rose in each of the four main categories surveyed and 23 of the 24 activities surveyed, led by a 27.9% surge in mining costs on the month, which accounted for around a third of the overall rise.
Oil refining and alcohol production costs rose 12.1% on the month, accounting for over a percentage point of the broader monthly increase, BILGE said.
On an annual basis, the biggest rise in February was a 87.6% spike in mining industry inflation, IBGE said. But food price inflation contributed to nearly 8 percentage points or more than a quarter of the overall annual rise.

The central bank this month raised interest rates by 75 basis points to 2.75% - the first increase in six years and the biggest in over a decade - because consumer price inflation expectations are rising above the bank's central year-end target of 3.75%.

Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected the indicator to remain unchanged.
The improvement came even though the government tightened restrictions on Paris and much of northern France during the month in the face of steadily rising COVID-19 case numbers.
Households were their least pessimistic about prospects for the general economic situation since March 2020, when the pandemic was beginning to spread. Concerns about unemployment were at their lowest since April last year.
Despite their improving confidence, households indicated they were more inclined to save extra cash than spend it. The measure of savings intentions was at its highest since the survey began in 1972.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales fell for the third straight month in February as households kept a lid on expenditure amid the coronavirus emergency, underscoring the fragile nature of the economy's recovery from last year's slump.
Analysts expect Japan's economy sharply contracted in the first quarter, as lacklustre consumer spending and weakening exports create challenges for policymakers who have already rolled out massive stimulus.
Retail sales lost 1.5% in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, a smaller fall than the median market forecast for a 2.8% drop.
But it marked the third straight month of declines following January's 2.4% fall and a 0.2% drop in December.
""That the coronavirus isn't subsiding is a major reason to worry about a delay of an economic recovery,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Clothes aren't selling because people aren't going out,"" he said. ""People are not really returning to commercial facilities, the trend is for them to go shopping at supermarkets in their neighbourhoods.""
The broader decline in retail sales was driven by falls in spending on items such as clothing, toiletries and general merchandise, the data showed.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales rose 3.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Separate data showed the nationwide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was steady at 2.9%, lower than the median forecast of 3.0%.
There were 1.09 jobs per applicant in February, down from the previous month's 1.10, labour ministry data showed. 
The world's third-largest economy is set to contract by an annualised 6.0% in the current quarter, which would be the first decline in three quarters partly due to sagging consumer spending, according to the latest Reuters poll data.

Some analysts are worried that a longer contraction in household spending and weakening exports raise the prospect of a slower economic recovery than initially thought.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to edge up to 51.2 for March from 50.6 in February, according to the median forecast of 30 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
""The key driver (in March PMI) is likely to be continued resilience in external demand, as shown by Korea's daily exports in the first 20 days of March, which accelerated to 6.5% on a 2Y CAGR basis vs. 5.2% for full month of February,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a report last week. 
""This would boost export orders and production."" 
Analysts at Industrial Bank in Shanghai attributed the acceleration to more working days in March and an earlier than usual resumption of business at Chinese factories this year. 
Millions of workers who normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday had stayed put this year due to COVID-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period.
China has successfully curbed the domestic transmission of the COVID-19 virus in northern China, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back as life returns to normal.

Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference on Monday the deficit had widened to the equivalent of 10.97% of gross domestic product in 2020 from 2.9% in 2019, and said the government would reduce the deficit this year. 
The budget gap was narrower than the government's latest official target, which stood at 11.3% of GDP.
Excluding the roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.78 billion) hit from the recent reclassification of Spain's SAREB 'bad bank' as a public entity, the deficit was 10.09% of GDP.
""The deficit increase doesn't imply the government has renounced the principle and benefit of budget stability,"" she said. ""The priority will still be the pandemic, but that will not prevent us from reducing the deficit in 2021."" 
Public spending increased by around 53 billion euros in 2020, Montero said, with some 85% of the total aimed at mitigating the effects of the pandemic. 
""Never before has the state made an effort on this scale,"" Montero said.
The government's ERTE furlough scheme helped cushion the blow to the labour market and kept a lot of companies from going bust - preventing a scenario that would have been even more devastating for government revenues, she said.
Tax revenues fell around 8% in 2020.
Spain's national government shouldered the vast majority of the pandemic costs, while regional governments reduced their deficits by an average of nearly 70%, with nine authorities ending the year in surplus.

Data from China, set to be published on Wednesday, will probably show a rebound in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, supporting the broader backdrop of improving global growth. Meantime, the developing world’s better corporate outlook may lure investors to buy the dip.
Last week, MSCI Inc.’s developing-nation stock index slumped amid declines in Turkey, Argentina and China. A selloff in the Turkish lira sent emerging-market currencies to their fifth loss in six weeks, and dollar bonds also edged lower. The recent weakness is encouraging stock-picking in some developing nations that are poised to rebound.

“The pickup in U.S. yields, the slightly stronger U.S. dollar and Europe’s hapless vaccination rollout have hurt EM, but valuations are again looking interesting in China technology,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer in Dubai. “And for those prepared to look beyond Covid disruption, commodity exporters and tourist destinations offer great opportunities.”
One of the lingering questions for emerging-market investors is whether the meltdown in Turkey worsens or spills over into other countries. So far, the contagion has been limited. There’s also the ongoing drama in the Suez Canal, which could weigh on oil markets for days to come.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer spending fell by the most in 10 months in February as a cold snap gripped many parts of the country and the boost from a second round of stimulus checks to middle- and lower-income households faded.
But the drop in consumer spending, the biggest since mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses like restaurants last April to slow the spread of COVID-19, is seen as temporary. The economy is poised to log its best performance in 37 years, thanks to the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and increased vaccinations against the coronavirus.
""The February pullback in income and spending is only a temporary blip,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect the combination of rising vaccination rates and a new round of stimulus checks from the largest COVID-19 stimulus package yet will provide a powerful lift to consumer spending in March."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 1.0% last month amid a broad decline in purchases of goods, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That followed a 3.4% rebound in January.
Personal income tumbled 7.1% after surging 10.1% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would decrease 0.7% in February and income would decline 7.3%.
Unusually harsh weather in the second half of February, including in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, depressed homebuilding, production at factories, orders and shipments of manufactured goods. 
Temperatures are rising and the relief package approved this month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6. The labor market recovery is also gaining traction, with first-time applications for unemployed benefits hitting a one-year low last week.
The brightening health and economic outlook boosted consumers' spirits, which bodes well for spending. In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index increased this month by the most in nearly eight years. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of other currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
BROAD DECLINE
Last month, spending on goods dropped 3.0%, led by declines in purchases of pharmaceutical products and recreational items. Spending on services edged up 0.1% as consumers spent more on utilities and health care at hospitals, offsetting a decrease in outlays at restaurants.
With demand soft, inflation retreated. But prices are expected to accelerate owing to the broader re-opening of the economy and the dropping of last year's weak readings from the calculation, as well as very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the anticipated rise in inflation over the course of the year will be ""neither particularly large nor persistent.""
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component gained 0.1% after rising 0.2% in January. In the 12 months through February, the so-called core PCE price index climbed 1.4% after increasing 1.5% in January. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, a flexible average.
""Although inflation will move somewhat higher, it will remain well-contained over the next few years,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""There is still a lot of slack in the economy."" 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending decreased 1.2% last month after jumping 3.0% in January. Despite the drop in so-called real consumer spending, consumption in the first two months of the first quarter is running well above the fourth quarter average.
A 2.5% increase in the goods trade deficit to $86.7 billion in February, the second highest on record, reported by the Commerce Department in another report on Friday, did nothing to dampen enthusiasm about economic growth this quarter. 
The report also showed wholesale inventories gaining 0.5% last month and stocks at retailers unchanged.
With latest data in hand, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their first-quarter gross domestic product estimate to a 10.0% annualized rate from a 8.7% pace. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.

Income last month was depressed by a 27.4% plunge in government transfers. Wages were also flat. The saving rate fell to a still-high 13.6% from 19.8% in January, with economists expecting some of the cash from the latest stimulus checks will be saved. Households are sitting on about $1.9 trillion in excess savings.
""We anticipate that hoard will surpass $2 trillion once the latest round of direct checks hits household income in March and April,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""This will provide households with ample means to drive spending, not only as the economy re-opens this year, but into next year as well.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position improved in February, figures showed on Friday, as the current account deficit as a share of the economy shrank to its smallest in 13 years and billions of dollars of corporate and financial investment poured into the country.
The current account deficit of 0.48% of gross domestic product in the 12 months to February was down from 0.64% the previous month and the smallest since February 2008, central bank figures showed.
Graphic: Brazil current account - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvodekrpd/CURRACC.png
Foreign direct investment (FDI) totaled $9 billion, the highest monthly inflow since August 2019, while investors plowed $3.6 bln into Brazilian stocks and bonds, the ninth consecutive month of net portfolio inflows.
Graphic: Brazil FDI flows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbgwaqpq/FDI.png
The current account deficit in the month was $2.3 bln, in line with the median forecast of a $2.4 bln shortfall in a Reuters poll of economists. That was down from a $4.7 bln deficit a year ago.
The figures for February come a day after the central bank revised its 2021 current account forecast to a $2 bln surplus from a $19 bln deficit. That would be Brazil's first annual surplus since recording a slender $408 million surplus in 2007.
The $9 bln FDI inflow in February was more than the $6.1 bln forecast in a Reuters poll, and sharply up from $2.6 bln the same month last year, the central bank said.
Based on partial data so far for March, the central bank expects FDI totaling $7 bln this month and a current account deficit of $1.3 bln. On Thursday the central bank maintained its expectations for $60 billion FDI inflows this year.
Net portfolio investments into Brazil totaled $3.6 bln in February, the ninth consecutive month of inflows, the central bank said. Of that, $822 mln went into stocks and $2.8 bln into debt securities.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales partly recovered in February, helped by locked-down consumers getting outdoor furniture in preparation for small garden parties and couples buying Valentine's Day dinners at home rather than in restaurants.
Sales volumes increased by a monthly 2.1% - in line with a Reuters poll of economists - after a plunge of more than 8% in January when England went back into a lockdown and the rest of the United Kingdom was also under tough restrictions.
Retail sales were down 3.7% compared with February 2020, before the pandemic struck most Western economies, with many non-essential retailers still closed. Clothing retailers saw sales plunge by more than half on their pre-pandemic level.
But many retailers have found ways to soften the blow of the latest lockdown by improving or opening online shopping operations.
The Office for National Statistics said the share of shopping done online reached a record high 36.1%. 
""It’s worth saying that overall sales are down 'only' around 4% on pre-virus levels, a marked improvement on what we saw last spring,"" ING economist James Smith said.
""Experience of lockdowns also tells us that it will probably only take a matter of weeks for sales to return - or exceed - pre-virus levels once the shops re-open."" 
The ONS said February's recovery from January, when sales slumped by 8.2% from December, was helped by increased shopping at budget-end department stores that were allowed to stay open because they sold food.
""Household goods also fared well, with feedback suggesting spending on home improvement and outdoor products boosted sales as consumers prepared for an easing of lockdown restrictions,"" ONS statistician Jonathan Athow said.
Home improvement retailers such as B&Q and Wickes have performed strongly during the crisis. On Monday, B&Q owner  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) reported a 44% jump in full-year profit and a strong start to its new financial year.
The Bank of England says the degree to which households spend the savings they have accumulated while they were stuck at home will determine the speed of Britain's recovery from its worst economic shock in more than three centuries.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to allow groups of up to six people to meet in gardens from March 29. Non-essential retailers are expected to re-open on April 12.
On Thursday, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed retailers suffered another difficult month in March but expectations for sales for the month ahead turned positive for the first time since December 2019. 

James Sproule, a Handelsbanken economist, said online sales would probably stay high after the lockdown at about 30% of all sales, ""meaning that the progress towards online buying, previously expected to take place over the next decade, has been achieved in just 12 months.""

651,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank estimated the maximum the economy can expand without fueling inflation, known as the potential growth rate, is under 6% in the next five years.
In a working paper released Thursday, the statistics department of the People’s Bank of China said potential growth was projected at 5%-5.7% in the period covering the government’s latest five-year plan through 2025. That represents an overall “medium to high” growth rate, it said.
Potential output measures the maximum sustainable expansion of gross domestic product without causing inflation. The objective of monetary policy should be to match actual output with potential, and the support of monetary policy to the real economy should be in line with the expansion of potential GDP, according to the paper.
China’s official growth target for 2021 is “above 6%,” though economists predict much higher expansion of more than 8%, partly because of last year’s low base during the pandemic.
The PBOC’s paper points out that traditional large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus policy won’t be able to lift real GDP growth above potential. Such stimulus would only lead to inflation and a rapid increase in the debt ratio, causing systemic risks to the economy, it said.
The central bank is seeking to dial back the stimulus it pumped into the economy last year, concerned by the build up in debt and the risk of asset bubbles.
At its quarterly meeting this week, the PBOC’s monetary policy committee reiterated its stance of keeping policy flexible and appropriate. However, a statement released Thursday after the meeting omitted previous phrasing used by the PBOC of “no sharp turn” in policy, suggesting policy makers are giving themselves more room to act if needed.
Chen Xi, a fixed income analyst at Pacific Securities, wrote in a note that the shift in language could mean the PBOC is taking a more flexible approach to policy fine-tuning based on current economic conditions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Japan's capital city Tokyo continued to fall in March though slowed their annual pace of decline for a third consecutive month, indicating that rising fuel cost and a rebound in domestic demand will help Japan avert deflation.
The data may offer relief for the Bank of Japan as it seeks to fire up inflation to its 2% target, though the rising cost of living could weigh on consumption as wage growth stays weak.
The core consumer price index for Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide inflation, fell 0.1% in March from the same month a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, less than a median market forecast decline of 0.2%.
That followed a 0.3% fall in February and compared with the steepest recent decline of 0.9% in December, with the data signalling a rebound in oil and commodities costs underpinning prices.
Gasoline prices, for instance, rose 2.1% on year in March after falling 5.2% in February.
Prices of household appliances rose 7.0% in March, up from a 4.0% gain in February, suggesting a pick-up in consumption. Hotel accommodation fees stopped falling in March after sliding 5.1% in February, the data showed.
Japan's economy is widely expected to suffer a contraction in the current quarter as renewed curbs introduced in January to prevent the spread of COVID-19 weighed on consumption.

While the curbs have ended, analysts expect any rebound in the economy to be modest and heavily reliant on overseas demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.
But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic's scarring.
President Joe Biden in his first press conference highlighted the brightening economic outlook and drop in claims to their lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic barreled across the United States just over a year ago.
""There are still too many Americans out of work, too many families are hurting and I still have a lot of work to do,"" Biden said. ""But I can say to you the American people, help is here and hope is on the way."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March. Data for the prior week was revised to show 11,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 730,000 applications for the latest week. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 898,534 people filed claims last week, dropping below one million for the first time since the pandemic started. 
The decline was led by Ohio, which has been dogged by fraud, and Illinois. Claims shot up in the second week of March, likely as backlogs after severe winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region were processed. 
The deep freeze in the second half of February, which also gripped other parts of the country, depressed retail sales, homebuilding, production at factories, orders and shipments of manufactured goods last month. 
Warmer weather, passage of the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations are expected to boost activity beginning March. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck an optimistic note on the economy in testimony before lawmakers this week.
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
CORPORATE PROFITS FALL
But the massive fiscal stimulus, which extended government-funded unemployment aid, including a $300 weekly supplement, through Sept. 6, could keep claims elevated as some people reapply for benefits. Claims surged to a record 6.867 million in March 2020. They remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.
Employment is 9.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Economists say it could take at least two years for the economy to recover all of the 22.4 million jobs lost in March and April last year. 
Full labor market recovery could take even longer, with the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, near a 47-year low. More than 4 million workers have dropped out of the labor force since February 2020.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 264,000 to 3.870 million in the week ended March 13. More people are finding work, while others are exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
About 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended March 6. Another 1.1 million were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed gross domestic product increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from the 4.1% pace reported last month. 
Goods-producing industries grew at a 6.1% rate, supported by gains in construction and the manufacturing of computer and electronic products as well as fabricated metal products.
Services industries expanded at a 4.9% pace, partly driven by finance and insurance, health care and social assistance, and professional, scientific and technical services. They were partially offset by decreases in accommodation and food services, utilities and educational services.
Government contracted at a 1.1% rate. Seventeen out of 22 industries contributed to fourth-quarter GDP growth. The economy grew at a record 33.4% rate in the third quarter. 
Profits fell $31.4 billion last quarter after increasing $499.6 billion in the July-September period. They plunged $130.2 billion in 2020 after rising $7.6 billion in 2019.

The worst is likely over, with the economy forecast to grow by as much as a 7.5% rate in the first quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.
""We believe there is ample room for corporate profits to rise as company revenues pick up markedly and margins remain well supported,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Improving health conditions, expanding vaccine distribution, and generous fiscal stimulus will form a powerful growth cocktail.""

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market’s healing process appeared to pick up speed last week, as the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell to its lowest level in almost a year.
The Department of Labor said that initial jobless claims fell to 684,000 from 781,000 the previous week. Last week’s figure was revised up slightly from an initial estimate of 770,000.
The number of continuing claims also fell by some 260,000 to 3.87 million, its lowest since March last year.
The data on continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims.
That is also true of the broader dataset that covers all people claiming unemployment-related benefit claims. That dataset showed a less positive development, with the overall number of claimants rising by 734,000 to 18.95 million.  
""The gentle downward trend in place since late January is intact,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in emailed comments.  However, he warned the pace of gross layoffs remains alarmingly high, above the 655,000 peak seend after the 2008 crash.
""The rate of gross job losses, presumably concentrated in the consumer services sector, remains depressingly rapid.  We’re guessing that each week sees some firms either downsizing further or throwing in the towel, unable to hang on until the economy reopens,"" Shepherdson said, adding that ""this gradual attrition should not last much longer: we expect claims to fall sharply as the economy reopens fully across the second quarter.""
The numbers were released at the same time as the government issued its final reading for economic growth in the fourth quarter. Gross domestic product growth was revised up slightly to an annualized rate of 4.3% from 4.1%, but the more important development was arguably a sharp slowdown in prices for core personal expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Core PCE prices rose only 1.3% on the year in the fourth quarter, below expectations for 1.4%. However, the third-quarter's data were revised up to a gain of 3.4%. "
655,"<span>Mar 25, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - German consumer morale improved for the second month in a row heading into April, boosted by an easing of lockdown measures at the beginning of March, a survey showed on Thursday, though a recent decision to extend restrictions is clouding the outlook.
The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose to -6.2 points from a revised -12.7 in March.
That was the best result since November, when a partial lockdown to contain a second wave of infections began, and clearly beat a Reuters forecast of -11.9.
Income expectation jumped to 22.3 points compared to 6.5 points in the previous month. This was in line with a survey by the Ifo institute and the Randstad employment services firm, which showed that a majority of personnel directors at German companies expected wages to rise in 2021.
The survey took place from March 3 to March 15, which was before Germany extended its lockdown until April 18 and a temporary suspension of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 shots following reports of possible serious side-effects.
The second lockdown, which was tightened in mid-December, is forcing most shops and services to close. Restaurants, bars and entertainment venues have been shut since early November.
""Another hard lockdown will seriously damage the consumer climate and the current improvement will remain a flash in the pan,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
A sustained recovery in consumer sentiment will continue to be a long time coming, which means difficult times for retailers and manufacturers, Buerkl said.
The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.
The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods and shipments unexpectedly fell in February after nine straight monthly increases, but a rebound is likely as factory activity picked up early this month amid warmer temperatures. 
The weak report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday joined a stream of other data in showing severe disruptions to economic activity wrought by last month's deep freeze, including in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region. 
Economists are maintaining their lofty first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates. Warmer weather, the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations are expected to boost activity in March.
""While the February figures have disappointed, there is nothing to be too concerned by,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Consumer spending is expected to rebound strongly in March and April on the latest stimulus payments, manufacturing will roar back given the strong order books and low inventory levels.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.8% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 0.6% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would rise 0.5%. 
Core capital goods orders surged 8.5% on a year-on-year basis in February. The year-long coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for goods, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
A survey from data firm IHS Markit on Wednesday showed its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 59 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 58.6 in February. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing. The survey's new orders measure jumped to the highest since June 2014.
But manufacturing is struggling with supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.
U.S. stocks were trading largely higher. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices also rose.
BROAD WEAKNESS
In February, core capital goods orders were weighed down by machinery and primary and fabricated metal products, as well computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.2%. 
Shipments of core capital goods dropped 1.0% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. They increased 1.9% in January. 
Last month's decline suggests a slowdown in business investment on equipment this quarter after double-digit growth in each of the last two quarters. 
The economy is forecast to grow by as much as a 7.5% annualized rate in the first quarter after expanding at a 4.1% pace in the final three months of 2020. 
""The simple reality is that the economy is in good shape and almost everything is moving in the right direction,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The stimulus is hitting consumer bank accounts, vaccinations are ramping up and, at least until recently, virus cases and especially deaths were trending downward.""
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, decreased 1.1% in February after jumping 3.5% in January. They were pulled down by a 1.6% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 7.5% surge in January.
But orders for civilian aircraft soared 103.3%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 82 aircraft orders last month compared to only four in January. That included 39 orders for the 737 MAX jets. The U.S. government late last year lifted a 20-month grounding of the aircraft that was put in place after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts tumbled 8.7% in February after falling 0.9% in January. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products also has been impacted. 

""The biggest headwinds for manufacturing as we emerge from this pandemic are mostly about manufacturers getting the stuff they need,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The downside of that is price pressures and the potential for profit squeeze.""
Indeed, the IHS survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers raced to a 10-year high early this month, amid what the data firm said was the ""most severe supply chain disruption on record."" It said firms ""commonly reported slower output growth"" due to raw materials shortages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity picked up in early March amid strong growth in new orders, but supply chain disruptions because of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to exert cost pressures for manufacturers, which could keep inflation fears in focus. 
Data firm IHS Markit said on Wednesday its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 59 in the first half of this month from a final reading 58.6 in February, when activity took a step back after a cold snap hit large parts of the country.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 59.3 in early March. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. The year-long pandemic has boosted demand for goods.
Factories and their suppliers are, however, struggling to find workers, leading to shortages that are driving up prices for production materials. A global semiconductor chip shortage has forced some automobile manufacturers to cut production. 
The IHS Markit survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers raced to a 10-year high early this month, amid what the data firm said was the ""most severe supply chain disruption on record."" It said firms ""commonly reported slower output growth"" due to raw materials shortages.
The relentless rise in input costs is one of several factors expected to drive inflation above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target this year. 
A broader reopening of the economy as more Americans get vaccinated against the coronavirus is expected to lead to price hikes, especially in the services sector. There are concerns that the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package and the U.S. central bank's extremely accommodative monetary policy stance could cause the economy to overheat.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly pushed back against fears of higher inflation becoming sustained. Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that the anticipated rise over the course of the year, will be ""neither particularly large nor persistent.""
The IHS survey's new orders measure jumped early this month to the highest since June 2014. 
Though the pace of hiring at factories slowed, that was because of a dearth of workers. The survey showed ""many firms highlighted struggles finding suitable candidates to fill vacancies.""
Growth in the services industry is also gaining traction. The IHS Markit's flash services sector PMI climbed to 60 this month, the highest since July 2014, from a final reading of 59.8 in February. That likely reflected broader economic re-engagement amid an acceleration in the pace of inoculations.
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has borne the brunt of the pandemic.

Overall business activity, however, slipped early this month as input shortages and supplier delays limited manufacturing production capacity. The survey's flash composite PMI output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dipped 59.1 from a final a reading of 59.5 in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Surging new orders before an easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions has prompted a stronger rebound for British companies than expected this month, although price pressures are rising sharply, too, a business survey showed on Wednesday.
The flash IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seven-month high of 56.6 in March from 49.6 in February. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a reading of 51.1.
Britain's economy shrank by 10% last year - its sharpest decline in more than 300 years - and earlier this month government budget forecasters predicted it would take until the middle of next year before it regains its pre-pandemic size.
But confidence among British businesses had been bolstered by Britain's swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, one factor behind the first increase in employment since the start of the pandemic, the survey showed.
Services in Britain enjoyed a rapid recovery, in contrast to those in the euro zone. They saw another month of contraction as many countries re-entered lockdown to stem a third wave of COVID-19. They're also struggling with their vaccination programmes.
""The rise in the (UK) composite PMI in March is probably a taste of things to come over the next few months as retail and hospitality firms are allowed to open again,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy. 
""This gives us more confidence in our view that the economy will have regained its pre-pandemic level by early next year.""
The survey is likely to bolster confidence among Bank of England officials that the economy is on track for a swift recovery. IHS Markit said its survey pointed to robust growth in the second quarter.
The PMI does not cover British retailers, but separate figures from market research company GfK on Friday showed consumer sentiment was the strongest in over a year, again largely based on recovery hopes. Another survey on Wednesday, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also found the highest level of consumer confidence for a year. 
But companies still face difficulties - not least in the form of rising costs.
The PMI's gauge of company input prices rose to a more than four-year high in March, with manufacturers citing increased costs from a global shipping shortage and customs delays.
Official data for February released on Wednesday also showed accelerating costs pressures for British factories, although consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell during the month.

The factory PMI rose to its highest since November 2017 at 57.9 in March but was flattered by the way the survey interprets supply chain disruption. The services PMI rose to a seven-month high of 56.8 from 49.5 last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity unexpectedly grew this month, a preliminary survey showed, but with much of Europe suffering a third wave of coronavirus infections and renewed lockdown measures, that may not last through April. 
Factories ramped up output at the fastest monthly pace in over 23 years, countering a continuing slowdown in the currency bloc's dominant services industry, which is far more vulnerable to lockdowns and the region's slow vaccine rollout.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, bounced above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, to 52.5 in March compared to February's 48.8, its highest since late 2018. 
Even the most optimistic respondent in a Reuters poll had forecast it would rise to 51.0, while the median predicted only a modest increase to 49.1.
""March's rise in the euro zone composite PMI pushed it back above the 50 mark for the first time in six months, but the recent tightening of restrictions in a number of countries suggests that the improvement will not be sustained,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
Indicating Europe's largest economy was so far shrugging off pandemic lockdowns, German factory activity rose to a record high and the services sector expanded after five successive months of contractions.
In France, the 19-country euro zone's second-largest economy, activity held up better than expected, with manufacturing surging ahead at the fastest pace in more than three years.
A rush of new orders in anticipation of an easing of lockdown restrictions, and Britain's swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, also prompted a much stronger rebound for British companies, who are outside the euro zone and the European Union.
DIVERGENCE
A flash PMI covering the euro zone services industry rose to 48.8 from February's 45.7, still in contractionary territory but its highest reading since August, and well above the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 46.0.
A big jump in input costs led services firms to increase their prices for the first time in just over a year. The output prices index climbed to 50.8 from 48.1.
Any sign of increasing price pressures may be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which has struggled to get inflation anywhere near its target, but a Reuters poll earlier this month suggested the pick-up would be shortlived. 
Meanwhile, booming demand for manufactured goods helped the flash factory PMI soar to 62.4 from 57.9, comfortably the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997 and well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted 57.7. 
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to a survey high of 63.0 from 57.6.
The manufacturing upturn was led by a record surge of factory production in Germany, accompanied by the fastest production growth since January 2018 in both France and the region as a whole, IHS Markit noted.
That jump in output came as euro zone factories tried to meet soaring demand, also at a survey high, with the new orders index at 64.2 versus February's 57.8.
""The manufacturing sector seems to be in boom territory at the moment,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""New orders increased in March, with export orders growing especially quickly, indicating that the euro zone profits from the rest of the world being much more open in this phase of the pandemic.""

Meanwhile, hopes the vaccine programme would accelerate and allow a return to some sort of normal life, optimism remained elevated. The composite future output index only dipped from February's three-year high of 67.0 to 66.8.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the manufacturing sector shot up to 66.6, the highest reading since the survey started in April 1996. That compared with 60.7 in February and beat a Reuters poll forecast for a reading of 60.8.
The surveys were conducted before Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and leaders of Germany's 16 states decided this week to reimpose strict measures shutting down most businesses until April 18 to try to break a third wave of COVID-19.
The data also pointed to a revival in the services sector, which had suffered under COVID-19 lockdown measures imposed in November and which were eased early this month.
The flash PMI for the services sector rose to a seven-month high of 50.8, up from 45.7 in February.
As a result, the preliminary composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to a 37-month high of 56.8 from 51.1 the previous month.
""The flash PMI pointed to a notable upturn in German business activity in March, with the data therefore hinting at the prospect of a better-than-expected economic performance in the first quarter,"" said Phil Smith, associate director at survey compiler IHS Markit. 
""The result owed to a combination of survey record growth in manufacturing output and a better performance from services, where some firms benefited from the slight easing of lockdown restrictions.""
But the picture was not all rosy, he added, pointing to supply chain pressures in manufacturing which were pushing up input costs at the fastest rate in nearly 25 years. 
""Businesses remain highly optimistic about the outlook over the coming year, with many pinning their hopes on progress in the vaccine rollout,"" said Smith. 

""However, with the 'emergency brake' restrictions coming into effect in April to stem a third wave of infections, the immediate outlook looks less promising.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly fell last month, reflecting the biggest annual drop in clothing prices since 2009 and cheaper second-hand cars, toys and computer games, though most economists see sharper price rises ahead.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation dropped to 0.4% in February from 0.7% in January, the Office for National Statistics said, in contrast to economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll of a rise to 0.8%.
""The impact of the pandemic has disrupted standard seasonal patterns,"" ONS Deputy National Statistician Jonathan Athow said. ""A fall in clothing prices helped to ease inflation in February, traditionally a month where we would see these prices rise.""
Sterling weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar after the figures came out.
The Bank of England and others expect inflation to rise sharply back towards the BoE's 2% target in the first half of this year, reflecting higher oil prices, increases in regulated household energy bills and other one-off effects.
""From April we'll also see the headline rate of inflation leap on energy prices, partly because we'll no longer be comparing petrol prices to pre-pandemic levels, but also because the household energy price cap will rise to 9%,"" ING economist James Smith said.
Few economists expect the rise in inflation - which may include a small overshoot of its 2% target - to prompt the British central bank to begin raising interest rates.
Unemployment is forecast to rise later this year when government job support measures end, putting downward pressure on wages and prices for the next year or two. 
Clothing and footwear prices fell between January and February for the first time since 2007 and are 5.7% lower than a year before, the biggest annual decline since November 2009, reflecting a widespread drop in demand due to the pandemic.
Price falls were mostly for women's clothes and shoes. Normally prices steadily rise with the launch of new spring and summer ranges after the January sales.
But high-street clothing retailers were shut across Britain in February due to lockdown restrictions that have closed all non-essential stores.
Children's toys such as dolls and scooters, as well as computer games - where prices fluctuate significantly - were also cheaper, the ONS said.
Prices for second-hand cars, which rose last year as people avoided public transport during the pandemic, fell by 1.8%.

But petrol prices rose by 2.9% and factories' raw materials costs - which tend to feed through into consumer prices later - were 2.6% higher than the year before in February.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must seek ways to encourage corporate investment to promote digitalisation and a carbon-free society, one of its board members said at a January meeting, suggesting that the idea could emerge as a future policy option.
Meeting for a rate review weeks after the government rolled out fresh curbs to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, BOJ policymakers warned of various risks that cloud their projections of a moderate economic recovery.
Among them was the chance the pandemic could prod firms to put off investment for innovation, minutes of the Jan. 20-21 meeting showed on Wednesday.
""It's important to encourage corporate activities for future growth such as research and development investment, business portfolio reforms, and efforts on digitalisation and decarbonisation,"" one of the members was quoted as saying.
""It's crucial for the BOJ to devise monetary policy means to boost firms' and households' growth expectations by showing its determination to never allow a return to deflation,"" the member said.
Another member, however, said it was ""not easy"" to use monetary policy to address the structural challenges faced by Japan's economy, the minutes showed.
The debate by the nine-member board suggests the BOJ could come up with additional easing steps to assist Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's growth strategy to revitalise the economy.
In December, Suga's administration laid out a growth strategy that put green investment and digitalisation among the top priorities to bolster the economy.
The BOJ board also kicked off discussions in January about a review of its policy tools, aimed at making them sustainable enough to weather a prolonged battle with economic stagnation.
One member said allowing long-term yields to fluctuate more will not hurt the economy much because many corporate borrowing are linked to short-term rates, the minutes showed.
There was no mention in the minutes of the need to keep long-term rates stably low, a comment later made by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
At the January meeting, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady and upgraded its economic forecast for next fiscal year, but warned of escalating risks to the outlook.

At a subsequent meeting in March, the BOJ slightly loosened its grip on long-term yields but focused on the need to keep borrowing costs low to support the pandemic-ravaged economy.

But the service sector remained much more gloomy, with businesses suffering from the coronavirus pandemic's fallout even after the government lifted a state of emergency in the Tokyo region.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.0 in March from a final 51.4 in February.
That meant manufacturing activity came in above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the second straight month.
The PMI survey showed that activity was helped by growing output and new orders. Future output, which shows firms' growth expectations for the year ahead, also remained strongly positive.
""Positive sentiment stemmed from the expectation that the lifting of state of emergency measures and broader restrictions as vaccinations roll out would trigger a recovery in demand in both domestic and external markets,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
But the survey highlighted pressure on firms from higher input prices, which had already risen sharply in the previous month.
Manufacturers reported input prices were at their highest since November 2018, leading to the widest gap between input and output prices since December 2014.
Despite the expanding output and orders, manufacturers were hesitant to take on workers, reporting the third straight month of job shedding.
The PMI survey also showed the service sector remained pessimistic as fallout of the health crisis persisted, the survey showed.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI index was in line with the previous month's reading, rising to 46.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis from February's final of 46.3.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, stood at 48.3 in March, largely unchanged from the previous month's final of 48.2.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a nine-month low in February amid bitterly cold weather, and expensive lumber and rising mortgage rates could cool the housing market this year. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday followed on the heels of data this month showing a plunge in homebuilding and permits for future construction in February. There has been demand for bigger houses to accommodate home offices and remote schooling as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers. 
But a record jump in lumber prices and labor and land shortages is increasing costs for builders, hampering their ability to ramp up construction. The dearth of homes is boosting house prices, which together with a sustained rise in mortgage rates since February, is making homeownership more expensive for first-time buyers. 
""The residential housing market will continue to support economic growth, but risks are to the downside,"" said Abbey Omodunbi, an economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The run-up in prices and rising mortgage rates will erode affordability and likely weaken demand in 2021."" 
New home sales plunged 18.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 775,000 units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales would tumble 6.5% to a rate of 875,000 units in February. Though new homes account for a small share of total sales, they are a leading indicator for the housing market as they are counted at the signing of a contract. 
Sales decreased in all four regions. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from single-family building permits, which dropped 10% in February.
Last month's unseasonably cold weather, including severe winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, depressed retail sales, production at factories and homebuilding. Warmer temperatures, an acceleration in the pace of coronavirus vaccinations and the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package are expected to spur a sharp rebound in economic activity in March. 
New home sales increased 8.2% on a year-on-year basis in February, benefiting from an acute shortage of previously owned homes. The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that the inventory of existing homes remained stuck at record lows in February. (Graphic: New home sales, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvodzdbpd/nhs.png) 
New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales in the below-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 4% of transactions last month.
Stocks on Wall Street slipped. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
EXPENSIVE LUMBER
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.09%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Mortgage rates have risen in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields, which have spiked in anticipation of stronger economic growth this year and higher inflation from the massive fiscal stimulus. 
The cost of softwood lumber surged a record 79.7% on a year-on-year basis in February. According to the National Association of Home Builders, that was adding about $24,000 to the price of a new home. The median new home house price jumped 5.3% from a year ago to $349,400 in February. 
""Rising mortgage rates will likely soften homebuyer demand modestly, while homebuilder constraints, including the ongoing high prices of lumber and other materials, will likely dampen the supply of new homes,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. ""However, underlying demand remains strong. The extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale may encourage more homebuyers to turn to new home purchases."" 
There were 312,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 304,000 in January. At February's sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 3.8 months in January. About 73% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built. 
Separately on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, surged 34.8% to a 12-year high of $647.2 billion in 2020 as the pandemic severely disrupted exports. (Graphic: Current account, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwoboepw/currentaccount.png) 
The deficit could remain big this year as the stimulus-driven economic recovery draws in imports. The current account gap represented 3.1% of gross domestic product last year, also the largest share since 2008 and up from 2.2% in 2019. The wider deficit is likely not an issue for the United States because of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.
""Early 2021 data shows the trade recovery continuing in the first quarter, but it will take time to return to pre-COVID conditions since the pandemic isn't over yet and stretched supply chains are inhibiting progress,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""Looking ahead, we expect the current account deficit to widen slightly and average 3.5% of GDP in 2021 as positive recovery dynamics and generous fiscal stimulus maintain a strong pull on imports while exports recover more slowly.""

Economic growth this year is expected to top 7%. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil registered its third largest monthly fall on record, a survey indicated on Tuesday, hammered by a deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and near collapse of the public health system in several cities.
The Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) consumer confidence index fell 9.8 points to a 10-month low of 68.2 points in March, The current situation index fell 5.5 points and the expectations index tumbled 12.3 points, FGV said.
There have been only two steeper monthly declines since the data series began in 2005: October 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, and April last year as the first wave of the global pandemic virtually shut down the entire economy.
Graphic: Brazil consumer confidence - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgxzmlpq/conscon.png
""The COVID-19 immunization campaign remains slow, while the number of hospitalizations and deaths per day is advancing rapidly, leading states and municipalities to adopt measures to restrict the movement of people,"" said survey manager Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
""Consumers look at the deteriorating economic situation and see serious risks to their employment and income, and are also affected psychologically by the fear of contracting the disease and the need to socially isolate,"" Bittencourt added.
Barring the all-time lows of April and May last year, consumer confidence in March was the lowest since 2015, when Brazil was a year into a steep two-year economic downturn. 

The fall in confidence was spread across most income brackets, but especially the lowest earners, FGV said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate unexpectedly fell in the three months to January, a change that partly reflected people giving up their job hunt as lockdown measures tightened at the start of the year, official figures showed on Tuesday.
The main jobless rate dropped to 5.0% in the three months to January from 5.1% in the final quarter of 2020, in contrast to forecasts in a Reuters poll for a small rise to 5.2%. None of the economists polled had expected a fall.
""The latest labour market data are somewhat mixed but show considerable resilience overall,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at consultants EY ITEM Club.
Part of the drop in the headline unemployment rate was due to high jobless numbers for October alone dropping out of the three-monthly figures.
The drop also reflected an increase in the proportion of the potential workforce classed as 'inactive', such as students, parents looking after their children full time and people who have temporarily given up looking for work.
This 'inactivity rate' rose by 0.3 percentage points over the past three months to 21.0%, its highest since early 2019, while the share of people in employment fell by 0.3 percentage points over the same period, equivalent to a drop of 147,000.
Since January non-essential shops and most businesses open to the public have been closed in England to slow a surge in more infectious variants of COVID, with similar measures in other parts of the United Kingdom.
Last month the government extended furlough support - which currently pays the wages of one in five employees - until the end of September. Without furlough, Britain's jobless rate would be far higher.
A rapid roll-out of vaccinations has sharply reduced new infections and allowed English pupils to return to school this month. Shops are due to reopen next month, but restrictions on hospitality will remain until at least late June. 
Separate official data based on tax records - which some analysts view as more reliable than the main labour force survey - showed the number of employees on company payrolls in February had fallen by 693,000 over the past year.
Almost two thirds of this decline affected workers aged under 25, a majority of the job losses were in hospitality and a third of the total took place in London, the ONS said.
But there has been an upturn more recently with an increase of 68,000 between January and February in the number of workers.
This data also pointed towards a fall of 550,000 in the number of non-UK nationals employed by British companies in the final quarter of 2020 compared with a year earlier.
Previous ONS data from the main labour force survey had pointed towards a fall of around 800,000 or more, although the ONS had said it needed to be interpreted cautiously.

""LFS estimates alone may be significantly overstating the fall in the number of non-UK nationals,"" the ONS said. [

The companies signed up for $7.4 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $6.8 billion a year earlier. But borrowings in February fell 9% from the previous month.
""As vaccine distribution picks up across the country, labor markets improve and interest rates remain low, the U.S. economy will only improve as we move into Q2,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 76.8% in February, from 76.2% in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales dropped to a six-month low in February amid cold weather in many parts of the country and record low supply, and a rebound could be muted by rising mortgage rates as well as higher house prices.
Still, the report from the National Association of Realtors on Monday showed robust demand, with houses only staying on the market for a record-low 20 days last month after being listed. 
The slump in sales did not dampen expectations for robust economic growth in the first quarter as brokers' commissions only account for a fraction of gross domestic product. Growth is seen boosted by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and increased vaccinations against COVID-19, which are allowing more parts of the economy to reopen.
""Severe winter weather depressed sales in February,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But pending home sales already had been trending lower before the bad weather; existing home sales also are cooling off following a robust run due to some other factors apart from the weather.""
Existing home sales dropped 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.22 million units last month, the lowest level since last August. Sales declined in the Northeast, South and the Midwest, but rose in the West. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would drop 3.0% to a rate of 6.50 million units in February. Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 9.1% on a year-on-year basis, keeping them perched well above their pre-pandemic level. Activity continued to be concentrated in the upper price range of the market.
Bitterly cold weather, including severe winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, disrupted economic activity last month, depressing retail sales, production at factories and homebuilding.
Warmer temperatures, an acceleration in the pace of coronavirus vaccinations and the massive fiscal stimulus are expected to spur a sharp rebound in activity in March. 
The housing market, however, is seen lagging after being one of the main drivers of the economic recovery from the pandemic as Americans sought bigger and more expensive houses for home offices and remote schooling during the pandemic.

AFFORDABILITY ERODING 
Home resales have been running ahead of contracts. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.09%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Though mortgage rates remain historically low, the sustained increase since February is contributing to making homeownership more expensive for first-time buyers.
Mortgage rates have risen in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields, which have spiked in anticipation of stronger economic growth this year and higher inflation from the fiscal stimulus.
Growth estimates for the first quarter top a 6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. It is forecast expanding 7.0% this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
The median existing house price jumped 15.8% from a year ago to $313,000 in February. 
Economists, however, do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than speculation, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
""Demand for homes has been strongest at the upper-end of the price range, where the supply of homes is unusually tight,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We expect price gains to moderate as fears about COVID subside, amid lower case counts and rising vaccinations, and as more homeowners choose to put their homes on the market.""
There were 1.03 million previously owned homes on the market in February, matching January's all-time low. Supply plunged a record 29.5% from one year ago.
Builders are being constrained by record-high lumber prices as well as shortages of land and labor. At February's sales pace, it would take two months to exhaust the current inventory, an all-time low and down from 3.1 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Seventy-four percent of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month. 
According to the NAR, realtors were reporting multiple bids for houses on the market. First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in February, down from 33% in January and 32% in February 2020. All-cash sales accounted for 22% of transactions.

""A further rise in mortgage interest rates to around 4.0% by the end of the year will help bring sales back toward their pre-COVID trend,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

Russia's commodity-dependent economy is on track to grow this year after shrinking 3.1% in 2020 -- its sharpest contraction in 11 years but still smaller than expected. 
The central bank expects the economy to return to pre-crisis levels before the end of the year, the governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, said on Friday after a surprise 25-basis-point rate increase, brought about by rising inflation and geopolitical risks.
The Federal Statistics Service, or Rosstat, said Russia's real wages, which are adjusted for inflation and reported one month later than other key indicators, rose 0.1% year-on-year in January. Analysts on average had forecast they would remain flat.
Economic growth and a recovery in living standards in Russia are a crucial issue for President Vladimir Putin and the United Russian ruling party. The latter is bracing for parliamentary elections in September amid massive protests that rocked Russian streets earlier this year. 
Russia's jobless rate slipped to 5.7% in February from 5.8% in January, in line with the forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.

Retail sales, a barometer of consumer demand that is Russia's main driver of economic growth, underperformed, slipping 1.3% year-on-year in February versus expectations for a 1.1% drop predicted by a Reuters poll.

That would be the third straight quarter of improvement. 
But big non-manufacturers' pessimism is expected to have remained subdued with the sentiment index likely to at minus 5, in line with the December survey, according to the poll.

But emergency curbs to contain the pandemic and rises in raw material costs slammed non-manufacturers' confidence, he added.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers forecast business conditions to improve three months ahead, the poll found, suggesting the coronavirus vaccination and lifting of the emergency steps will help economic activity.
Big firms will likely raise their capital spending plans by 1.4% for the business year beginning in April, showing some improvement in appetite for business investment.
The BOJ will announce the Tankan quarterly survey results at 8:50 a.m. on April 1.

The BOJ on Friday widened the band at which it allows long-term interest rates to move around its target, as part of a raft of measures to make its ultra-easy policy more sustainable amid a prolonged battle to fire up inflation.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer morale struck a one-year high this month as the public became increasingly confident that an economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is approaching and that they would benefit directly, a survey showed on Friday.
The monthly consumer confidence index from market research firm GfK rose to -16 from -23 in February. While still some way below the its long-run average of -9, the survey showed rising optimism in all of its components. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller increase to -20. 
The readings came a day after the Bank of England said Britain's economic recovery was gathering pace thanks to the speed of COVID-19 vaccinations. But its policymakers are split over the prospects for longer-term improvement, dampening speculation about a reversal of stimulus.
GfK said household expectations for the economic outlook and personal finances improved rapidly this month, with the latter hitting a three-year high.
""If this improved mood translates into spending, it might help reverse some of the economic damage the UK has suffered,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said. ""The eight-point fillip in our major purchase measure to -11 suggests this may well happen.""
Staton added that further improvement was likely in the coming months.
Britain suffered its worst economic slump in three centuries last year when it shrank by 10%. It has also been hit with Europe's biggest COVID-19 death toll of over 125,000 people.

But the country is racing ahead with vaccinations and many economists expect the economy would shrink by 2% in the first quarter of 2021, half the hit forecast by the BoE only last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the labor market is regaining its footing as an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations leads to more businesses reopening.
The improving health situation, combined with extremely accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, is boosting manufacturing, putting the economy on course for its fastest growth pace in 37 years this year. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region raced to its highest level in nearly 50 years in March, other data showed on Thursday.
""It is best to look through the weekly ups and downs of initial claims,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The labor market is set for a dramatic improvement through the rest of 2021."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 45,000 to a seasonally adjusted 770,000 for the week ended March 13, from 725,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 13,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 700,000 applications in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 16,000 to 746,250 last week, a four-month low. This measure has been decreasing since February.
""The recent declines are consistent with the idea that claims are trending lower as the labor market recovers, aided by progress on virus containment, and we think that this recovery will continue over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Unemployment claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020, but are still above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a 200,000 to 250,000 range.
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1 million people filed claims last week. Claims continue to be distorted by backlogs and fraudulent filings.
Ohio, which has been plagued by fraud, accounted for 15.2% of claims last week. Claims shot up in Texas, likely reflecting backlogs following last month's snowstorms.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were higher.

STRONG MANUFACTURING 
The United States had administered 113,037,627 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 147,590,615 doses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The faster pace of inoculations should allow for broader economic re-engagement, even as the rate of decline in new coronavirus infections has leveled off.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index surged to a reading of 51.8 this month, the highest since April 1973, from 23.1 in February. Measures of new orders and shipments at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware also soared.
A gauge of factory employment hit its highest level since June 2018 and manufacturers increased hours for workers. But worker shortage is becoming a problem, with nearly two-thirds of manufacturers reporting this was an issue. 
Nearly 45% said they had positions that had remained unfilled for more than three months, while 59% indicated skills mismatches between vacancies and available labor. 
Manufacturers also planned to boost spending on capital projects in the next six months. The survey, however, likely exaggerates the manufacturing sector's health. A global semiconductor shortage is undercutting production of motor vehicles, and bottlenecks in the supply chain remain a constraint for other manufacturing industries.
""The key theme for manufacturing this year is that growth is limited by capacity but not demand,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Still, strong manufacturing aligns with expectations that economic growth this year could be as high as 7%. That would be the strongest since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday projected robust growth and higher inflation this year. The U.S. central bank, however, repeated its pledge to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero for years to come.
President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan is sending fresh aid to businesses and households, which will underpin the labor market and overall economy.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of March's employment report. 
The economy added 379,000 jobs in February. Employment remains 9.5 million jobs below its peak before the pandemic barreled through the United States in March 2020.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 18,000 to 4.124 million during the week ended March 6. The drop was mostly because of people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.

About 4.815 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 27, down 640,732 from the prior week. The number of people on unemployment benefits under all programs during that period fell 1.9 million to 18.2 million.

Investing.com -- ‘Two steps forward, one step back’ remained the watchword for the U.S. labor market last week, as the number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 770,000.
That defied expectations of a drop to 700,000. The previous week’s number was also revised higher to 725,000 from an initial estimate of 712,000.
However, the overall number of those claiming under all unemployment-related insurance schemes resumed its downward trend, falling by some 1.9 million to 18.216 million. The broader numbers are reported with a one-week lag to the initial claims numbers.
The numbers, which continue to show layoffs at a rate far in excess of what was usual before the pandemic, give support to the Federal Reserve's assessment of a high level of slack in the labor market, which is the key assumption underlying the central bank's continued belief that it will not have to raise interest rates before 2024.
Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton, said via Twitter that the data ""suggests we should see another solid gain in employment in March,"" although she noted that the U.S. economy is ""still 9.5 million jobs in hole, mostly in service sector, including education.""
The figures contrasted sharply with the - less nationally relevant - Philadelphia Federal Reserve monthly business survey, which was published at the same time. The Philly Fed's Business Conditions index rose strongly to 61.6 in March from 39.6 in February, while the manufacturing index soared to its highest level since the mid 1970s. Orders, shipments and backlogs all rose, while the prices paid index hit the highest level since 1980.
The Philly Fed's survey underscored the strain on a manufacturing sector that is struggling to restock after running down inventory levels last year while recurrent outbreaks of Covid-19 repeatedly snarled global supply chains. A global shortage of semiconductors is currently affecting production of products as diverse as mobile phones and cars, while freight costs have soared as shipping companies have struggled to keep pace with the reallocation of consumer spending from services to goods.
 Financial markets were paying more attention to the signs of near-term overheating than the long-term labor market outlook on Thursday. The yield on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.74%, its highest since January 2020, while the 30-Year yield topped 2.50% for the first time since 2019 in the overnight session. The Treasury is due to auction 10-year inflation-linked securities later Thursday."

Unemployment dropped to 5.8% from a revised 6.3% in January, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. Employment jumped by 88,700 in February, compared with an expected 30,000 gain. The participation rate was unchanged at 66.1%, in line with expectations.
“The strong employment growth this month saw employment rise above 13 million people, and was 4,000 people higher than March 2020,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS.
The Australian dollar advanced following the data’s release and was trading at 78.23 U.S. cents at 11:44 a.m. in Sydney.
Australia is experiencing a V-shaped recovery as the containment of Covid-19 boosts confidence and encourages cashed-up households to spend. That’s prompted firms to accelerate hiring and people to resume job-hunting.
The Reserve Bank of Australia said last month it was extending its quantitative easing program by a further A$100 billion ($78 billion) and reiterated that it doesn’t expect to increase interest rates until 2024. It’s trying to keep a lid on a currency, which left unchecked could appreciate further and hurt exports and employment.
Among other details in today’s jobs report:
The central bank’s most recent forecasts show the jobless rate falling to around 6% by the end of this year and 5.5% at the end of 2022. Under an optimistic scenario for unemployment, the rate would drop to 4.75% by the end of next year.
The labor market’s strength might cool in the period ahead as the government’s vast wage-subsidy program JobKeeper, designed to keep workers attached to their employers, expires at the end of this month. The government is providing ongoing support to industries like tourism and airlines that are still struggling from closed borders.
The RBA late last year cut interest rates and its three-year yield target to 0.10% and initiated a quantitative easing program to lower borrowing costs across the economy. That came on the heels of the government announcing tax cuts, incentives for firms to invest and hire and infrastructure projects to boost activity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding dropped to a six-month low in February as severe cold gripped many parts of the country, in a temporary setback for a housing market that remains supported by extremely lean inventories amid strong demand for larger homes.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed a sharp decline in building permits last month. It followed on the heels of data this week showing that the deep freeze, which was most severe in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, depressed retail sales and output at factories.
Though the second straight monthly decline in homebuilding could lead economists to trim their lofty gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter, a rebound in starts is expected in the April-June period, keeping intact predictions that economic growth this year will be the strongest since 1984.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday projected robust growth and higher inflation this year. The U.S. central bank, however, repeated its pledge to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero for years to come.
""We can read nothing into the underlying strength of the economy from these weather-distorted reports,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""March data are likely to show strong bounce backs in consumer spending, industrial production and construction activity.""
Housing starts fell 10.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.421 million units last month, the lowest level since last August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would decrease to a rate of 1.560 million units in February.
Starts were down 9.3% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Groundbreaking activity plunged in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but surged in the West. Permits for future home building tumbled 10.8% to a rate of 1.682 million units last month. They, however, jumped 17.0% compared to February 2020, underscoring the housing market's strength.

RISING CHALLENGES 
The year-long COVID-19 pandemic has shifted demand towards bigger and more expensive houses as millions of Americans continue to work from home and remote schooling remains in place. 
But challenges for the housing market, one of the main drivers of the economic recovery, are mounting. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to an eight-month high of 3.05%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Mortgage rates have jumped in tandem with Treasury yields, which have spiked as investors anticipate that stronger growth will generate significant inflation. Growth is being driven by massive fiscal stimulus, including President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package, which was enacted last week.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed a moderate increase in applications for loans to purchase a home last week. Though mortgage rates remain low by historical standards, they are contributing to the rising costs of homeownership, especially for first-time buyers.
Supply disruptions because of coronavirus-related restrictions are driving up commodity prices, including softwood lumber, which surged a record 79.7% in February on a year-on-year basis. According to a survey from the Associated General Contractors of America, manufacturers have hiked drywall prices by 20% effective late March or the beginning of April. 
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dipped in March, despite strong buyer traffic, amid worries over rising material costs and delivery times, especially for softwood lumber. 
With the supply of previously owned homes at record low levels, builders are likely to continue breaking more ground, though houses could become more expensive.
""Builders face some near-term challenges,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We don't anticipate that this will weigh too heavily on starts, the forecast is for housing starts to steadily increase throughout the course of this year."" 
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, declined 8.5% to a rate of 1.040 million units in February, also a six-month low. Single-family building permits tumbled 10.0% to a rate of 1.143 million units.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment plunged 15.0% to a pace of 381,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects declined 12.5% to a pace of 539,000 units.
Housing completions jumped 2.9% to a rate of 1.362 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. 
The stock of housing under construction rose 0.3% to a rate of 1.283 million units, the highest level since October 2006.

""Builders will continue to have a key role to play in addressing the inventory shortage for a market chock full of eager home shoppers,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""The homebuilding sector has more room to run.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese exports fell in February for the first time in three months as U.S. and China-bound shipments weakened, a source of concern for the world's third-largest economy as it tries to prop up growth.
The trade data comes on the eve of the Bank of Japan's two-day policy review at which it may phase out a numerical target for its risky asset buying, underscoring the rising cost of prolonged easing under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's stimulus.
The prospects for a U.S. recovery may ease concerns about the outlook for Japan's economy, however, which is seen contracting in the current quarter due to new COVID curbs that have hit service-sector activity.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japanese exports fell 4.5% year-on-year in February, hurt by decline in U.S.-bound shipments of automobiles.
It was the first decline in three months, following a 6.4% gain in January. It was much bigger than a 0.8% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
By region, exports to China rose 3.4% in the year to February, led by chip-making equipment, nonferrous metals and plastic, slowing sharply from a 37.5% gain in the prior month.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key export market for Japanese goods, declined 14.0% year-on-year in February, dragged down by automobiles, airplane parts and motors, after a 4.8% drop in the prior month and posting a fourth straight month of declines.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half Japan's overall shipments, fell 0.8% in the year to February, while those to European Union declined 3.3%, the data showed.
Wednesday's trade data follows the Reuters Tankan poll that found Japanese manufacturers grew more upbeat about a gradual recovery though worries about COVID impact lingered.
Imports rose 11.8% in the year to February, roughly matching the median estimate, following a 9.5% drop in the prior month.
Imports marked the first annual gain in 22 months due to a pick-up in domestic demand, restocking of inventory and rises in crude oil and resources prices.
The trade balance came to a surplus of 217.4 billion yen ($2 billion), versus the median estimate for a 420.0 billion yen surplus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers strengthened in March, the Reuters Tankan poll showed, as firms grew more upbeat about a gradual economic recovery though worries about the immediate impact of the coronavirus remained.
The monthly poll indicated that the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan quarterly survey due April 1 will show an improvement in business sentiment among manufacturers, while that of non-manufacturers remains depressed.
It comes as investors are closely eyeing the outcome of a BOJ policy review on Friday in which it may phase out a numerical target for its asset buying, a move which would mark a turning point for Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's massive stimulus programme.
The Reuters Tankan showed the sentiment index for manufacturers improved to 6 from 3 in the previous month, led by chemicals and oil refinery/ceramics. Some 235 out of 482 large- and mid-sized non-financial firms surveyed between March 3 and March 12 responded, all on condition of anonymity.
Emergency measures rolled out in Japan to halt the country's third, and most lethal, wave of the virus has curbed consumer spending and hit the services sector particularly hard.
""Almost all accommodation and banquet reservations were cancelled due to the impact of the third wave (of the virus), bringing conditions for us back to a critical state,"" a manager at a services sector firm wrote in the survey.
The non-manufacturers' index edged up to minus 5 from minus 7 in the previous month but remained in negative territory. It was seen rising to 5 in June, turning positive, the poll showed.
The world's third-largest economy expanded at a slower-than-initially-reported pace in the fourth quarter of last year, the government said last week, with the virus crisis causing firms to scale down their capital spending.
Respondents said economic conditions were improving, in part due to solid Chinese demand. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers was expected to rise further to 15 in June, according to the poll.
But some noted the rebound was centred on specific areas of the economy, such as semiconductors and electrical device-making.
""The momentum has slowed slightly except in semiconductors even as the recovery trend continues,"" a manager at a rubber producer reported in the survey.
Another manager, at a transport equipment maker, wrote: ""Transportation costs have soared because of a container shortage, and it has become difficult to secure ships, even though customer orders have recovered.""

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in February amid bitterly cold weather across the country, but a rebound is likely as the government disburses another round of pandemic relief money to mostly lower- and middle-income households.
The harsh weather also took a bite out of production at factories last month as the deep freeze in Texas and other parts of the South put some petroleum refineries, petrochemical facilities and plastic resin plants out of commission. 
The setback is probably temporary, with the strongest economic growth since 1984 anticipated this year, thanks to massive fiscal stimulus and an acceleration in the pace of vaccines, which should allow for broader economic re-engagement, even as new COVID-19 cases are starting to creep up. 
Federal Reserve officials, who started a two-day meeting on Tuesday, are likely to focus on the underlying economic strength, expectations of higher inflation and a steadily recovering labor market.
""We knew the economy took a major hit in February due to the brutally cold weather and a lot of snow,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""No reason to panic over the February numbers, the economy is moving forward rapidly and it should pick up the pace as the latest stimulus payout hits home.""
Retail sales dropped by 3.0% last month, the Commerce Department said. But data for January was revised sharply up to show sales rebounding 7.6% instead of 5.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales falling only 0.5% in February.
Unseasonably cold weather gripped the country in February, with deadly snow storms lashing Texas. The decline in sales last month also reflected the fading boost from one-time $600 checks to households, which were part of nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus approved in late December, as well as delayed tax refunds.
The broad-based decrease was led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships dropping 4.2%. Sales at clothing stores fell 2.8%. Consumers also slashed spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 2.5% drop in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars decreased 17% compared to February 2020.
Receipts at electronics and appliance stores dropped 1.9% and sales at furniture stores tumbled 3.8%. There were also big declines in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Receipts at food and beverage stores were unchanged. Sales at building material stores decreased 3.0%. Online retail sales plunged 5.4%.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices fell.

TEMPORARY SETBACK
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales decreased 3.5% last month after surging by an upwardly revised 8.7% in January. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have shot up 6.0% in January.
President Joe Biden last week signed his $1.9 trillion rescue package into law, which will send additional $1,400 checks to households as well as extend a government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement through Sept. 6. Households have also accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.
""This year, we expect the combination of an improved health situation and generous fiscal stimulus to fuel a consumer boom for the history books,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Saturday raised their first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 6% annualized rate from a 5.5% pace, citing the latest stimulus from the Biden administration. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
Goldman Sachs forecast 7.0% growth this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
The rosy economic outlook was not dimmed by a separate report from the Fed on Tuesday showing output at factories tumbled 3.1% in February, also weighed down by a global semiconductor shortage because of the pandemic.
""While we expect these supply disruptions to be temporary, auto production could remain soft in the very near term,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""With substantial new fiscal stimulus to support demand for consumer goods in the coming months, supply disruptions could lead to rising prices.""
Indeed, supply constraints because of coronavirus-related restrictions are driving up commodity prices. A third report from the Labor Department showed import prices rose 1.3% last month after surging 1.4% in January. They jumped 3.0% on a year-on-year basis after rising 1.0% in January.

Though inflation is expected to accelerate as early as the first half of this year, many economists do not expect it to spiral out of control with millions of Americans unemployed. Supply chain bottlenecks are also expected to start easing as more people around the globe get vaccinated. 
The dollar has also strengthened so far this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.

""There is still a great deal of unused industrial capacity in the U.S. economy. This will help keep inflation under control throughout this year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Business inventories increased 0.3% in January after rising 0.8% in December, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. January's gain was in line with economists' expectations. 
Inventories fell 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in January.
Retail inventories decreased 0.5% in January, instead of 0.6% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.7% increase in December. 
Motor vehicle inventories dropped 1.5%, rather than 1.4% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, dipped 0.1%, instead of slipping 0.2% as estimated last month.
Domestic demand is picking up after slumping late in the fourth quarter, driven by declining COVID-19 infections, an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and additional pandemic relief money from the government. Households have also accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.
Economists estimate the economy could grow this year by as much as 7%, fueled by the massive fiscal stimulus and rollout of vaccines that are expected to get the pandemic under control. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Wholesale inventories increased 1.3% in January. Stocks at manufacturers gained 0.1%.

Business sales shot up 4.7% in January after rising 1.0% in December. At January's sales pace, it would take 1.26 months for businesses to clear shelves. That was the shortest time since April 2012 and was down from 1.32 months in December.

Manufacturing production dropped 3.1% last month, also weighed down by a global semiconductor shortage, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. That followed a 1.2% jump in January and ended nine straight monthly increases in factory output. Manufacturing production remains below its pre-pandemic level. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would dip 0.1% in February. 
Stormy weather battered the South last month, leaving large parts of Texas without power or water for days. The deep freeze shut oil production and refineries in the state, the biggest producer of natural gas and oil in the United States. 
That likely had a ripple effect on segments of manufacturing tied to the oil industry. Excluding the weather impact, manufacturing output fell 0.5%, the U.S. central bank said.
Production at auto plants continued to be hampered by a shortage of semiconductors, tumbling 8.3% last month. 
But manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains underpinned by lean inventories and strong demand for goods, though a shift to services like airline travel and hotel accommodation is likely in the months ahead as more Americans get COVID-19 vaccinations.
A survey this month showed manufacturing sentiment increased to a three-year high in February.
The weakness in manufacturing output combined with a 5.4% dive in mining to push down industrial production by 2.2% in February. That followed a 1.1% jump in January. Bitterly cold temperatures boosted utilities output 7.4%.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, dropped 2.3 percentage points to 72.3% in February. 
Overall capacity use for the industrial sector decreased 1.7 percentage points to 73.8% in February. It is 5.8 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday import prices rose 1.3% last month after surging 1.4% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, advancing 1.2% in February. 
In the 12 months through February, import prices accelerated 3.0%. That was the largest gain since March 2012 and followed a 1.0% rise in January.
Oil prices have recovered to pre-pandemic levels amid expectations of a pick-up global economic growth, but the COVID-19 pandemic is caused disruptions to the supply chain, boosting prices of commodities. 
Inflation is expected to gain steam this year, driven by massive fiscal stimulus and the reopening of the domestic economy as vaccinations slow the spread of the coronavirus. But excess capacity in the labor market will probably stop price pressures from spiraling out of control. 
Imported fuel prices surged 11.1% last month after advancing 9.0% in January. Imported food prices shot up 1.6%.

While the impressive set of numbers released on Monday were heavily skewed by the very low base from last year's massive slump, analysts said they nonetheless showed China's strong rebound remained intact.
Industrial output rose 35.1% in the first two months from a year earlier, up from a 7.3% on-year uptick seen in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, stronger than a median forecast for a 30.0% surge in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Retail sales increased 33.8%, also faster than a forecast 32% rise and marking a significant jump from 4.6% growth in December and a 20.5% contraction for January-February of 2020.
""We have a positive outlook for exports and manufacturing investment this year,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics and Oxford Economics. ""And we expect household consumption to become a key driver of growth from Q2 onwards as confidence improves and the government’s call to reduce travel is toned down.""
China's ability to contain the coronavirus pandemic before other major economies were able to do so has allowed it to rebound faster.
In 2020, it was the only major economy to report positive annual growth, with an expansion of 2.3%.
The recovery has been driven by robust trade, pent-up demand and government stimulus.
Export growth hit a record pace in February while factory gate prices posted their biggest expansion since November 2018.
China’s economic activity is normally distorted in the first two months because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February in 2021.
MODEST EXPECTATIONS
Despite the statistical noise in the latest data, other measures show a broad-based recovery with industrial output up 16.9% and retail sales growing 6.4% compared with the first two months of 2019.
However, Liu Aihua, an NBS spokeswoman, warned that while positive factors for China's economy are increasing, the foundation for the recovery is not yet solid.
""COVID-19 is still spreading around the world and global economic conditions are complex and severe; domestically the imbalances of the recovery are still quite obvious,"" Liu told a briefing in Beijing.
The country saw scattered COVID-19 outbreaks re-emerge earlier this year, but brought them under control by early February. 
Surveyed urban unemployment reversed a steady decline and rose to 5.5% in February from 5.2% in December, indicating increasing pressure on China's job market.
While millions of workers normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday, many stayed put this year due to COVID-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period, but it also had some impact on consumer spending. 
Seasonally adjusted month-on-month data showed retail sales growth actually fell in January-February, likely due to both travel restrictions but also elevated unemployment, analysts at Capital Economics said in a note.
Fixed asset investment increased 35% in the first two months from the same period a year earlier, slower than a forecast 40.0% jump. That compared with 2.9% on-year growth in 2020, and a 24.5% plunge in January-February last year.
Investment grew 3.5% compared with the first two months of 2019.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment, which makes up 60% of total investment, rose 36.4% in January-February, versus a 1.0% increase for the full year of 2020.
Beijing this month set a modest annual economic growth target, at above 6%, well below analysts' consensus forecast of more than 8% this year.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last week the focus for growth this year is on consolidating the economic recovery.
Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management, said the recovery seen in month-on-month indicators may have already peaked, a sign momentum is slowing.

However, he expects infrastructure to receive a boost from still accommodative fiscal policy while exports are likely to maintain growth as the world economy opens.

Investing.com – Economic activity in China soared during the first two months of 2021, but recovery remains uneven a year after the country imposed draconian lockdowns around this time in 2020.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day said that industrial production grew 35.1% year-on-year in February, above the 30% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previously recorded 7.3% growth.
Retail sales also soared 33.8% year-on-year in February, against the predicted 32% growth and the previously recorded 4.6% growth. The unemployment rate was at 5.5%, higher than the previously recorded 5.2%.
The spectacular growth rates of more than 30% for key indicators in the data are largely attributable to distortions when compared to 2020’s lockdowns. It also indicated a rebound happening at uneven rates, with strong industrial output and export demand against lagging consumer recovery.
“We must be aware that the COVID-19 pandemic is still rampaging globally and the world economy is facing severe challenges … domestically, the unbalanced recovery is still notable and the foundation for the economic recovery is not solid yet,” NBS spokeswoman Liu Aihua said in a statement.
China is the only major economy to have returned to economic growth after imposing 2020’s lockdowns as COVID-19 spread. Soaring global demand for medical goods and work-from-home devices has also given the recovery a boost.
The economy grew 2.3% in 2020 and is forecast to expand 8.4% in 2021, although the recently-ended National People’s Congress set a more modest growth goal of “above 6%.” There are also signals that the government will gradually scale back COVID-19 stimulus measures.
However, investment figures released Monday showed manufacturers are still cautious and that businesses, “especially private-owned enterprises, will begin to have a stronger willingness to invest only after the recovery of their profit growth is confirmed,” China Renaissance Securities economist Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
“Consumer demand also remains weak, with retail sales in February rising only 0.56% from the previous month, “indicating that the Lunar New Year may have had a weaker boost to national consumption than expected,” he added.
The government issued advisories not to travel during February’s Lunar New Year holidays to curb an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country earlier in the year. The additional manpower in what is usually the biggest travel season of the year in the country likely boosted industrial output as factories either remained open or resumed production earlier than usual. Inversely, spending on travel, restaurants, and leisure activities dropped during the holidays."

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses are more likely to expect a rebound in activity this year than their counterparts abroad, and expectations of a pick-up in growth are stronger than at any point since 2015, a survey showed on Monday.
The global poll of 12,000 manufacturers and services providers, conducted three times a year for consultants Accenture (NYSE:ACN) by data company IHS Markit, showed 68% of British firms expected activity to rise, while 11% saw a fall.
The net balance of +57% is the highest since June 2015 and up from +34% in October, and also tops readings for businesses in the United States, Japan and continental Europe.
""After a tough year it is encouraging to see business confidence bouncing back,"" Accenture consultant Rachel Barton said.
Britain's economy shrank by 10% last year - its biggest fall in over 300 years as many areas of business activity ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Government budget forecasters this month said it would take until mid-2022 for the economy to recover its pre-COVID size.
Britain suffered Europe's highest death toll from COVID, but is now rolling out vaccines faster than other European countries and the government hopes to fully lift social-distancing restrictions by late June.
The strongest improvement in optimism in the survey - conducted from Feb. 11 to Feb. 25 - was in the hotels and restaurant sector which has been hardest hit by the crisis.
Separately, manufacturing trade body Make UK said on Monday that it was revising up its 2021 growth forecast to 3.9% from 2.7%. Industrial output in Britain slumped by 8.6% last year - the biggest drop since records began in 1949.
""After the seismic shock to the sector last year, manufacturers are now beginning to move through the gears and accelerate into recovery as demand at home increases and major markets also begin to pick up,"" Make UK's chief executive, Stephen Phipson said.
However, it warned that January data which showed a 40% slump in exports to the EU added to evidence that post-Brexit trade restrictions were causing more severe damage than the 'teething problems' admitted by the government so far.

Make UK said that in its latest survey, members reported a further fall in export demand that contrasted with a rebound domestically and for exporters based in other countries.

690,"<span>Mar 14, 2021 06:09PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China is set to report roaring growth in economic activity in the first two months of the year, with figures largely distorted by comparisons from a year ago when the nation was the first in the world to go into lockdown.
Underneath those eye-popping numbers though will be the first look at whether the economy’s two-speed recovery from the pandemic persisted in the first two months of the year. Growth has so far been fueled by an export and industrial-led boom, with consumer spending slow to pick up.
China posted record contractions in the data a year ago when the economy was mostly shut down, first because of the usual Lunar New Year holiday break, and then a lockdown to contain the world’s first Covid-19 outbreak.
With the pandemic now under control domestically and the economy mostly reopened, comparisons with a year ago make it difficult to assess the true momentum of the recovery, especially for consumers.

Comparing the actual value of retail sales should provide some guide as to whether private consumption continued its pick up from late 2020, or is still struggling.​​
“As the recovery has been largely driven by the industrial recovery, I would focus on retail sales,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Hong Kong. “Headline growth below 32% would be considered weak.”
Economists like Bruce Pang of China Renaissance Securities Ltd. are looking at comparisons with 2019 data instead to get a better sense of the recovery. He said any year-on-year growth rate below 15% would be considered weak.
Whatever the actual numbers, the data will still show China as the only major economy that’s powering out of the pandemic, propelled by rising debt and an export boom. The government is now looking to gradually pull back on its fiscal stimulus and rebalance growth so that it’s driven more by consumption.
That was a key theme outlined by the government during the National People’s Congress, China’s biggest political meeting of the year, which concluded last week. The government set a modest growth target of “above 6%” for 2021 in comparison with the 8.4% expansion economists predict, allowing officials to focus on curbing risks, such as easing debt and asset bubbles.

Another factor complicating the data in the first two months of the year was the imposition of travel restrictions before the Lunar New Year break, which fell in February. To curb sporadic virus cases in some parts of the country, the government discouraged people from making their annual trips home for the holidays.
That likely helped to boost industrial output, with factories able to remain open or resume production earlier than usual to meet soaring export demand. But it also suppressed spending on tourism and travel, restaurants and leisure activities as millions of people refrained from booking train and air tickets and cut back on hosting banquets and buying presents.
Through March 8, people took almost 41% fewer trips this year than in 2020, according to data from the Ministry of Transport, and travel was down almost 71% compared to the same period in 2019. Consumption in lower-tier cities and the countryside likely took a hit, while higher-tier cities probably benefited as people stayed near their workplace during the holidays.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong, said growth rates below 20% for any of the data released Monday should be considered weak given last year’s very low base.
“On retail sales, I would look at catering, which has been heavily affected by social distance measures,” she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased strongly in February, leading to the largest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years, but considerable slack in the labor market could make it harder for businesses to pass on the higher costs to consumers.
That was supported by a survey on Friday showing an easing in consumers' near-term inflation expectations early this month, even as their confidence in the economy rose to a one-year high.
Receding new COVID-19 cases, an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government are seen allowing wider economic re-engagement in the spring. 
Inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months and exceed the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, by April. Part of the anticipated spike would be the result of price declines early in the pandemic washing out of the calculations. Many economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, do not expect the strength in inflation will persist beyond the so-called base effects.
""Beyond a rise in the metrics this year on base effects and a fuller reopening of the economy that will revive demand, price pressures are unlikely to keep accelerating, given an incomplete recovery in the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.5% last month, with the costs of energy products and food surging, the Labor Department said. That followed a 1.3% jump in January, which was the biggest advance since December 2009.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI accelerated 2.8%, the most since October 2018. The PPI increased 1.7% year-on-year in January. Last month's rise in the PPI was in line with economists' expectations. (Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvngzdrpl/inflation.png) 
Manufacturing and services industries have been flagging higher production costs as the year-long pandemic gums up the supply chain. Surveys this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries in February racing to levels last seen in 2008. 
These inflation jitters have boosted U.S. Treasury yields.
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020, with President Joe Biden on Thursday signing legislation for his $1.9 trillion package. At the same time, Fed is pumping in money through monthly bond purchases, raising fears in some quarters of the economy overheating. 
But the worst recession since the Great Depression, which started in February 2020, has left at least 20.1 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
""Supply-chain issues are temporarily putting upward pressure on producer prices along with higher energy prices,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""These pressures should begin to moderate. We expect growth in consumer prices to accelerate through the first half of this year, but this will be transitory.""
Consumers' one-year inflation expectations moderated to 3.1% in mid-March from 3.3% in February, the University of Michigan said in a separate report on Friday. Its preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to 83.0, the highest since last March, from a final reading of 76.8 in February.

FOOD PRICES SOAR
A 6.0% jump in the cost of energy goods accounted for more than two-thirds of the broad-based rise in the PPI last month. Energy prices rose 5.1% in January. Wholesale food prices jumped 1.3%. Goods prices rose 1.4%. 
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices climbed 0.2%. The so-called core PPI accelerated 1.2% in January. In the 12 months through February, the core PPI increased 2.2% after gaining 2.0% in January.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its inflation target. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. 
The core PCE price index is at 1.5%. The government reported this week that the core CPI barely rose in February after being unchanged for two straight months.
In February, wholesale core goods prices gained 0.3% after rising 0.8% in January, driven by the dollar's weakness against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
The cost of services edged up 0.1% last month after accelerating 1.3% in January, which was the biggest increase since December 2009. Healthcare costs dipped 0.1% after surging 1.2% in January. Portfolio fees dropped 1.1% after soaring 9.4% January. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.
With the PPI and CPI data in hand, economists are estimating that the core PCE price index rose by as much as 0.18% in February. That would lift the annual increase in the core PCE price index to as high as 1.6%. The data is due to be released on March 26. 
Healthcare and rents will determine the inflation path.

""If medical services strength combines with stronger rents later this year, as we expect, the two large components of services inflation would be supportive of the view that core PCE inflation is running more stably at or above 2%,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation accelerated to a three-month high in February on higher fuel prices, which could challenge the central bank's accommodative stance and record-low key policy rates adopted to boost the pandemic-hit economy. 
Annual retail inflation rose 5.03% in February, up from 4.06% in January, and below the 4.83% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, data released by the Ministry of Statistics showed on Friday.
Retail petrol prices in the national capital New Delhi have gone up by nearly 9% so far this year, while diesel prices are up over 10%, pushed up by higher federal and state taxes, putting pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut taxes. 
The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which kept the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4% last month, is expected to keep rates unchanged at its next meeting from April 5-7. 
After cutting the repo rate by 115 basis points to sustain the economy during the coronavirus crisis, the central bank has kept the policy rate unchanged since May, 2020.
Analysts said high commodity prices will continue to fan inflation in the coming months. 
""The rising global crude prices will continue to add inflationary risks going ahead and CPI (retail inflation) will remain elevated,"" said Rahul Gupta of Emkay Global Financial Services.
""Currently CPI is within RBI's target range but at the April meeting, the central bank will have to tackle increasing inflation and rising bond yields,"" Gupta said. 
India's economy is projected to contract 8% in the current financial year ending in March before growing at around 11% next financial year.
Retail food prices, which comprise nearly half of India's inflation basket, increased 3.87% in February on year compared to 1.96% in January.
Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was estimated in the range of 5.61%-5.9% for the month by four economists, compared to 5.5%-5.7% in January.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian retail sales fell in January for a third consecutive month, official figures showed on Friday, largely in line with expectations and led by declining supermarket, food and drink sales, as well as weakness in the clothing and footwear sector.
Researchers at government statistics agency IBGE said the fall was in large part due to the expiration on Dec. 31 of emergency government cash transfers to millions of poor families to help them through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The 0.2% monthly fall was slightly less than the 0.3% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and the 0.3% fall compared with the same month a year earlier was slightly more than the 0.25% fall forecast in the poll.
January's figures followed a 6.2% slump in retail sales in December, the second biggest fall on record. 
Four of the eight segments covered by IBGE showed falling sales in January. Supermarket, food and drink sales fell 1.6% on the month, while clothing and footwear sales were down 8.2%.
On a wider basis, including cars and building materials, retail sales in January fell 2.1% on the month, and were down 2.9% from January 2020, IBGE said. 

Since rebounding to record levels in October last year, the volume of retail sales in Latin America's largest economy has fallen 6.5%, IBGE said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by less than feared in January when the country went back into a coronavirus lockdown, but trade with the European Union was hammered as new post-Brexit rules kicked in.
Gross domestic product was 2.9% lower than in December, the Office for National Statistics said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a contraction of 4.9% and government bond prices fell as investors took the data as a sign that the Bank of England was less likely to pump more stimulus into the economy.
Britain suffered its worst economic slump in three centuries last year when it shrank by 10%. It has also been hit with Europe's biggest COVID-19 death toll of over 125,000 people.
But the country is racing ahead with vaccinations and, after Friday's figures, economists said they expected the economy would shrink by 2% in the first quarter of 2021, half the hit forecast by the BoE only last month.
Many businesses are learning to cope with lockdowns, including retailers who have ramped up their online shopping operations and services firms that have tried to help workers to do their jobs from home.
Samuel Tombs, with Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicted a 5% second-quarter growth rebound ""which would kibosh the chances of the Monetary Policy Committee reducing Bank Rate this year.""
The BoE looks set to keep its stimulus programmes on hold next Thursday. 
The ONS figures also showed exports and imports from Britain to the EU plunged by the most on record, although there was a delay in gathering some of the data and there were signs of a pick-up towards the end of January.
Exports of goods to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, slumped by 40.7%. Imports fell by 28.8%. 
Many companies brought forward imports to avoid border disruption from Jan. 1 onwards, and global trade flows have been hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
SERVICES HIT
The overall GDP figures were hit hard by the impact of social distancing rules on Britain's huge services sector.
""The economy took a notable hit in January, albeit smaller than some expected, with retail, restaurants, schools and hairdressers all affected by the latest lockdown,"" Jonathan Athow, an ONS statistician, said.
Manufacturing fell for the first time since April with car production down sharply. 
But ING economist James Smith pointed to the boost to GDP from Britain's COVID-19 health policy response: ""What really stands out is health expenditure, where the ramping up of the government's test and trace scheme and vaccine programmes added 0.9% to the GDP figures alone."" 
The economy remained 9% smaller than in February last year, before the pandemic hit.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to ease England's coronavirus restrictions gradually before lifting most of them by late June.
Growth in the next few months is also likely to get a boost from finance minister Rishi Sunak's announcement last week that he will pump a further 65 billion pounds ($90.6 billion) into the economy, including an extension of his jobs-protecting furlough scheme.

The ONS said services output shrank by 3.5% in January from December. The Reuters poll had pointed to a 5.4% contraction.

The ONS had previously warned that the hit to trade from the COVID-19 pandemic would make it difficult to identify a Brexit impact from new customs arrangements in January's data.
But it said there were signs that this hurt trade at the start of the year.
""External evidence suggests some of the slower trade for goods in early January 2021 could be attributable to disruption caused by the end of the transition period,"" the ONS said.
It said the weak figures likely reflected a lull after stockpiling in November and December ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period and it also pointed to a new national coronavirus lockdown in Britain that started in January.
""All of these are potential contributing factors to the fall in January trade in goods,"" the ONS said.

Britain's overall goods trade deficit, including non-EU countries, narrowed to 9.826 billion pounds ($13.70 billion) in January from 14.315 billion pounds in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a four-month low last week as an improving public health environment allows more segments of the economy to reopen, putting the labor market recovery back on track.
Still, a full recovery from the deep scars inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic will probably take years, with the weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showing a whopping 20.1 million Americans collecting unemployment checks in late February.
""We're likely on the verge of much lower unemployment claims, but we're not there yet,"" said Robert Frick, economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Assuming COVID-19 infections and deaths continue to decline, we expect lower, and perhaps dramatically lower, claims this spring.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 for the week ended March 6, the lowest level since early November. Data for the prior week was revised to show 9,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 725,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims dropped 47,170 to 709,458 last week, amid declines in Texas, New York and Mississippi, where claims had been boosted in the prior period by harsh weather. But there was a big jump in claims in California. 
Filings also rose in Ohio, which has been plagued by fraudulent applications. The state accounted for 18% of the claims filed last week, though it makes up only 3.7% of total employment.
""If these claims were genuine, more than 20% of Ohio workers lost their job in February,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""Removing this distortion alone would lower the total number of claims in recent weeks for the U.S. by about 100,000.""
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week.
New coronavirus infections have dropped for eight straight weeks, declining 12% last week, according to a Reuters analysis of state, county and CDC data. Vaccinations jumped to a record 2.2 million shots per day and virus-related deaths fell 18%.
That, together with nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief money advanced by the government in late December, fired up consumer spending and hiring in February after declining in December.
President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on Thursday, which he hailed as ""rebuilding the backbone of this country.""
The package will send fresh aid to small businesses as well as one-time $1,400 checks to mostly lower- and middle-income households. A government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement will be extended through Sept. 6.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow (DJI) indexes hitting all-time highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

VACANCIES RISE 
Steady labor market recovery was underscored by other data from the Labor Department on Thursday showing job openings increased 165,000 to 6.9 million in January. Layoffs declined 136,000 to 1.7 million. 
Still, there was only 0.68 job per unemployed person in January versus 1.23 jobs in February 2020. 
""The labor market remains far from a healthy place, but there are glimmers of hope in these numbers and others,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""If coronavirus cases continue to fall and the pandemic gets under control, the labor market can start to sustainably heal.""

Employment is 9.5 million jobs below its peak before the pandemic barreled through the United States in March 2020.
Jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020, but are still above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession and could remain elevated because of the expanded unemployment benefits. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a 200,000 to 250,000 range.
""There is some risk in our view though that expanded unemployment, with benefits of an additional $300 per week, could keep the level of claims for unemployment benefits more elevated this year, as some workers could earn more on unemployment than in their previous jobs,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Regular state unemployment benefits averaged about $346 per week in January. Together with the weekly $300 subsidy, they add up to $646 per week or over $15 per hour for a 40-hour week.
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, though some states have higher rates.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 193,000 to 4.144 million during the week ended Feb 27. The decrease largely reflected people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.

About 5.455 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 20, up 986,351 from the prior week. There number of people on unemployment benefits under all programs during that period increased by 2.087 million.

The WTO's services trade barometer rose to a record high of 104.7 in March after 95.6 in September and a low of 91.2 in March 2020, the Geneva-based trade body said.
""World services trade appears to be in a recovery phase... However, continued weakness in some sectors and an uneven distribution of COVID-19 vaccines cast some doubt on the durability of the recovery,"" the WTO said.
The WTO said that components of its ""barometer"" related to purchasing managers' indexes, container shipping, construction and financial services all rose above their medium-term trends. 
By contrast, IT services were weak, driven down by stricter U.S. lockdowns weighing on computer services, and air transport was very weak.
The WTO services trade barometer is a composite of published data and is designed to gauge momentum in global trade growth rather than to provide a specific short-term forecast. 

It dates back to 2000, with a reading of 100 marking the boundary between above and below trend growth.

Investing.com -- The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits fell last week to its lowest level since the pandemic erupted a year ago, signaling that the reopening of the U.S. economy is damping the pace of layoffs around the country.
The Labor Department said that 712,000 initial jobless claims were filed last week, down from 754,000 the week before and a bigger drop than expected. The consensus forecast ahead of time had been 725,000. 
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, also fell by more than expected to 4.144 million, a drop of almost 200,000 from the previous week.
The Labor Department's figures weren't all rosy, however. The broadest measure of people claiming unemployment-related benefits rose by nearly 2 million to top 20 million again, thanks to rises of 1 million each in claimants under two pandemic-related schemes, known as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation. Those programs cater to the self-employed (notably to gig workers) and the long-term unemployed.
Almost all of that increase was accounted for by the state of California, suggesting that the state may have undercounted its claimants in past weeks.
The data come against the backdrop of a U.S. economy that is slowly starting to eat away at the vast amount of slack in the labor market. The economy added nearly 400,000 jobs last month, with more than that number created in the services sector, where restaurants and non-essential stores were among the biggest hirers.  "

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Annual inflation in Brazil rose above 5% in February for the first time in more than four years, official figures showed on Thursday, above analysts' expectations and driven largely by as a strong rise in transport costs.
Coming less than a week before the central bank's next policy decision, the figures are likely to cement the consensus view that the first increase in Brazilian interest rates since 2015 is imminent.
The annual rate of consumer inflation in February was 5.20%, statistics agency IBGE said, above the 5.06% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the highest since January 2017, according to Refinitiv data.
The central bank's year-end target is 3.75%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side.
The monthly rate of inflation rose to 0.86%, IBGE said, the highest for any February since 2016 and higher than economists' forecast for a 0.72% increase. 
Eight of the nine categories surveyed by IBGE showed rising prices in February, with a 2.28% rise in transport costs accounting for almost half of the overall rise.

Within the transport segment, fuel prices rose more than 7% on the month, IBGE said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a budget deficit of $311 billion in February, a record high for the month and up $76 billion from the same month last year, as outlays to fight the coronavirus pandemic remained high, the Treasury said on Wednesday.
Receipts for February rose 32% from the year-earlier period to $248 billion, a phenomenon due largely to a $45 billion reduction in tax refunds issued during the month because the 2021 tax filing season started about two weeks later than in 2020.
Individual and withheld income tax receipts also rose by $9 billion, which a Treasury official said was due to tax withholding on increased unemployment benefits, along with increased hours worked at higher wage rates as lower-wage earnings languished. 
February outlays also grew 32% to $559 billion, with the biggest increases for unemployment benefit-related costs and health expenditures. Both receipts and outlays were record highs for February.

For the first five months of the 2021 fiscal year, the deficit rose 68% to a record $1.047 trillion for the period, beating the previous record deficit of $652 billion in October-February of fiscal 2010.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in February, with households paying more for gasoline, but underlying inflation remained tepid amid weak demand for services like airline travel and hotel accommodation.
The mixed report from the Labor Department on Wednesday did not change expectations that inflation will push higher and exceed the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, by April as declining COVID-19 infections and a faster pace of vaccinations allows the economy to reopen. 
Inflation is also seen accelerating as price decreases early in the coronavirus pandemic wash out of the calculations. Many economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell expect the strength in inflation will not stick beyond the so-called base effects and the reopening of services businesses.
""Base effects and one-time price increases stemming from the reopening of the economy and some pass-through of higher prices from supply chain bottlenecks should lift core inflation to 2.5% in the spring,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""However, the acceleration in inflation will be transitory and will not represent the start of an upward spiral."" 
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after rising 0.3% in January. A 6.4% advance in gasoline prices accounted for more than half of the gain in the CPI. 
In the 12 months through February, the CPI shot up 1.7%, the largest rise since February 2020, after climbing 1.4% in the 12 months through January. Last month's CPI readings were in line with economists' expectations.
Gasoline prices surged 7.4% gain in January. Food prices climbed 0.2% last month, with the cost of food consumed at home gaining 0.3%. The cost of food consumed away from home rose 0.1%.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI nudged up 0.1% after being unchanged for two straight months. The so-called core CPI was lifted by a surprise pick-up in rents as well as rising costs for recreation, medical care and motor vehicle insurance, which offset declines in prices for airline fares, hotel and motel rooms, used cars and trucks and apparel. 
The core CPI rose 1.3% on a year-on-year basis, retreating from January's 1.4% gain. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its inflation target. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. The core PCE price index is at 1.5%.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
LABOR MARKET SLACK 
There are fears from some quarters that a very expansionary fiscal policy, marked by nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief money in late December and President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package, expected to be approved by Congress this week, could stoke inflation. 
That, together with the Fed's monthly bond purchases could cause the economy, which plunged into recession in February 2020, to overheat. U.S. Treasury yields have spiked in anticipation of stronger economic growth this year and higher inflation. But there is plenty of slack in the labor market, with at least 18 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
Still, the stronger inflation prophecies could become self-fulfilling. Consumers are already anticipating to pay more in the near-term and many small business are planning price increases. Surveys this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries racing to levels last seen in 2008 in February.
Reports from the Atlanta Fed on Wednesday showed businesses' one-year inflation expectations jumped to 2.4% in March from 2.2% in February. Its sticky-price CPI, a weighted basket of items that change price relatively slowly, jumped 2.3% in February after rising 1.1% in January.
""Data suggests that we're not only witnessing the end of disinflation for some time, but rapid growth and firmer prices will punctuate the bounce-back from Covid lows,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief investment officer of global fixed income. 
""However, while we think growth will be surprisingly strong, we also think that over the intermediate-term the Fed is correct in thinking inflation will remain muted by the same factors that have held sway over the past two decades, the demographic trend of population aging and technological disinflation.""
In February, apparel prices fell 0.7% after three straight monthly increases. The cost of healthcare rose 0.3%, driven by increases in the costs of doctor visits, though consumers paid less for prescription medication and hospital visits.
The cost of airline fares tumbled 5.1% after decreasing 3.2% in January. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3% after nudging 0.1% in January. 
The increase occurred despite the rental housing market being hurt by a flight from city centers to suburbs and other lower density areas. Many landlords have entered into forbearance agreements with tenants.
""The stabilization in our shelter tracker and a waning drag from rent forgiveness suggest scope for some of the rental acceleration to be sustained in the spring months,"" economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. 

Services excluding energy rose 0.2% in February after being unchanged for two consecutive months. Consumer spending on services is about 3.3% below its pre-pandemic level.

The Commerce Department said business applications decreased 13.4% to a seasonally adjusted 423,095 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications.
There were a seasonally adjusted 48,749 applications from corporations, down 10.4% from January. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 51,071, a decrease of 12.9% from the prior month. Overall, business applications fell in all four regions last month and were across all industries.
The COVID-19 pandemic has decimated businesses in the services sector, especially restaurants and bars, leaving millions unemployed. Additional fiscal stimulus, declining new cases and a faster pace of vaccinations have allowed many businesses to reopen, boosting consumer spending and hiring.

Based on the February data, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the data, projected about 31,153 new business startups with payroll tax liabilities would form within four quarters of application, down 13.2% compared to the estimates for January.

706,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in February as costs of used vehicles, clothing and transportation services declined from a month earlier, suggesting broader inflationary pressures remain tame.
The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.1% from a month earlier and 1.3% from the prior year. The overall CPI rose 0.4% from the prior month and 1.7% from a year earlier, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists for the month-on-month change in the CPI was for a 0.4% gain. The core measure was projected to rise 0.2%.
Treasuries pared earlier losses, while inflation expectations remained higher and the yield curve added slightly to its steepening on the day. The dollar edged lower from earlier highs and U.S. stock futures rose, reversing earlier losses.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries have surged recently on inflation bets, but Federal Reserve officials have brushed off the concerns and expect any pickup to be transitory.
Investors and economists are split on the inflation outlook, with some predicting a wave of rising prices driven by stronger demand and pandemic stimulus, while others say the forces that have contained price pressures for years -- from technology to demographics -- are still in place.
Despite the softer-than-expected figures, inflation is poised to accelerate in the months ahead -- driven by pandemic stimulus, income growth and a vaccination campaign that’s helping businesses to reopen.
Starting with the March data, the so-called “base effect” will push up the headline rate, because sharp declines in prices at the start of the pandemic will influence the year-on-year calculations. That means even fairly small price increases during the month will likely cause the annual measure to jump above 2%.
Some pockets of the economy are already showing signs of bubbling inflationary pressures. In January, a measure of producer prices surged by the most in records dating back to 2009. The Institute for Supply Management’s factory measure of prices paid for materials rose to the highest since 2008 last month.
The Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus bill will add to the more than $1 trillion in excess savings that American households racked up during the pandemic. It’s unclear how much of that money they’ll spend in the coming months on things they couldn’t do during the health crisis, like restaurant dining or travel.
The CPI report showed prices of goods, excluding food and energy, declined 0.2% in February from a month earlier, the first decrease since May. Apparel and medical care commodities costs both dropped 0.7%, while prices of used vehicles fell 0.9% for a third month.
Services prices minus energy rose 0.2%, the first increase in three months, reflecting higher shelter costs and medical care services.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate prices climbed at their fastest pace since November 2018 in February, with the scramble to fill export orders raising expectations for strong Chinese growth in 2021.
National Bureau of Statistics data released earlier in the day showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month, against the 0.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January's 1% growth.
The CPI contracted 0.2% year-on-year, against the forecast 0.4% contraction and January's 0.3% contraction. The Producer Price Index grew 1.7% year-on-year in February, against the forecast 1.5% growth and January’s 0.3% growth.
The low base in 2020 was one factor in the better-than-expected data but comes as investor worries about surging inflation globally continue to mount.
Trade data released during the previous week said that exports climbed 60.6% year-on-year in February. Also, during the previous week, the National People’s Congress set a modest economic growth target of above 6% for 2021, against investor expectation for an expansion of more than 8%.
The second-largest economy globally continues to face challenges on the road to recovery, as the COVID-19 situation remains severe globally and continues to erode demand.
“We do not think the recent period of consumer price deflation is likely to persist. Shifting pork price base effects will nudge up food inflation, a tightening labor market will push up core inflation and energy inflation will rebound thanks to rising oil prices,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
“Given that officials have signaled a hawkish tilt in recent weeks, we think the People’s Bank of China will tighten policy this year,” the note added."

The firmer-than-expected price data is in part driven by a very low base a year earlier but also comes as the spectre of surging inflation globally rattles financial markets amid concerns the world economic recovery may overheat.
China's exports in February grew at a record 154.9% in dollar terms from a year earlier, when the country was in virtual shutdown during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beijing last week set an economic growth target of above 6% for 2021, which is modest when compared with analyst expectation for an expansion of more than 8%. China's gross domestic product rose 2.3% in 2020, its weakest growth in 44 years but stronger than its global peers.

Resurgent producer prices raises the prospect of China exporting inflation to the rest of the world as factories start hiking prices for goods sold abroad. Bond markets have already been roiled by expectations that faster global growth and massive fiscal stimulus will push up inflation.
The biggest PPI gains were in mining, which climbed 6.8% in February from a year ago. Raw material prices rose 2.9% after several months of declines.
“Metal prices were on the rise due to global fiscal stimulus money to be spent on infrastructure projects,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Wholesale Banking. “If crude oil price keeps increasing it would push up other prices, like transportation, and therefore production cost, then it could generate inflation.”
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs, were unchanged from a year earlier. Falling pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket, have been the main driver of weaker consumer inflation in recent months, with prices falling 14.9% in February from a year ago after declining 3.9% in January.
That trend could reverse with the re-emergence of African swine fever in Asia, which could threaten hog supplies once again. However, Lu Ting, chief China economist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc., points out that the statistics bureau made a downward revision to pork’s weighting in the CPI basket last month, a change that could keep prices elevated.
China’s government outlined new economic targets last week, setting a goal of about 3% for consumer inflation for this year, down from 3.5% in 2020. It’s aiming for economic growth of more than 6% as the recovery from the pandemic continues to strengthen.

Consumer prices rose by 3.76% in the year through February, beating the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for a reading of 3.72%. Inflation, which stood at 3.54% a month earlier, quickened to its highest level since reaching 4.09% in October.
The Bank of Mexico targets a rate of 3% with a one percentage point tolerance threshold above and below that figure.
The uptick in inflation may add weight to the view among some analysts who believe the Mexican central bank should pause its rate-cutting cycle when it meets for its next monetary policy decision.

The European Union's statistics office said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, more than the initial 0.6% estimate, for a 4.9% year-on-year drop, less the previous estimate of 5.0%.
The main downward pull came from household consumption which subtracted 1.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter from the final quarterly result and 4.1 points from the annual number.
Growing inventories added 0.6 points to the final quarterly figure, government spending another 0.1 points and investment 0.3 points, but trade gave a negative contribution of 0.1 points.
Pandemic lockdowns, which have closed economies to various degrees across the single currency bloc since October, also hit jobs, with employment growth slowing to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter from a 1.0% growth in the previous three months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded at a slower-than-initially-reported pace in October-December, with firms tightening spending on plant and equipment as the coronavirus pandemic clouded their business plans.
The slower growth was mainly due to a sharper contraction in private inventories and capital expenditure expanding less than previously thought in the fourth quarter, even as exports remained solid.
Separate data showed household spending was hit by a much bigger annual drop in January than in the prior month, a sign the COVID-19 pandemic was keeping consumers cautious about shopping.
The economy grew an annualised 11.7% in October-December, weaker than the preliminary reading of 12.7% annualised growth to mark the second straight quarter of growth, Cabinet Office data showed Tuesday.
The reading, which was weaker than economists' median forecast for a 12.8% gain, translates into a real quarter-on-quarter expansion of 2.8% from October-December, versus a preliminary 3.0% gain.
Capital spending grew 4.3% from the previous quarter, lower than a preliminary 4.5% rise, but outpacing the median forecast for a 4.1% increase.
Private inventories, including raw materials and manufactured products, subtracted 0.6 percentage point from revised gross domestic product growth (GDP), which was more than a negative preliminary contribution of 0.4 percentage point.
""Although vaccination started in Japan, it will take time to yield its impact, so the economy is forecast to go though some ups and downs,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""We expect the economy will pick up from the second quarter but it will be difficult to regain soon what it will lose in the first quarter.""
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of GDP, rose 2.2% from the previous three months, matching the preliminary reading.
Net exports - or exports minus imports - added 1.1 percentage point to revised GDP growth, while domestic demand lifted it by 1.8 percentage point, weaker than a preliminary contribution of 2.0 percentage point.
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING DROPS
The worse-than-expected GDP revision comes after exports and factory output picked up in January, signalling a stronger recovery in global demand following last year's deep coronavirus slump.
Household spending, however, fell 6.1% in January compared with the same month a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, worse than the 2.1% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
Separate data showed real wages dropped for the 11th straight month in January, although at a slower pace than in the prior month, as the pandemic continued to pressure corporate profits.
Some analysts are worried that a cold spell in corporate investment and household spending could last longer than expected, boding ill for demand and threatening to leave the world's third-largest economy without a domestic growth driver.

The Bank of Japan will conduct a review of its policy tools next week to make them more ""effective and sustainable"" as the pandemic forces it to keep its radical stimulus programme in place longer than originally expected.

Consumer spending was 13.8% lower than a year before, similar to January's plunge of around 16%, Barclaycard said.
Spending on essential items grew 5.3% and online grocery shopping surged. But spending on non-essentials plummeted 22.1% with many businesses still closed.
After suffering its biggest slump in three centuries last year, Britain's economy is expected to grow strongly once the COVID restrictions are lifted between now and late June.
Barclaycard said a survey which it had commissioned showed consumers' confidence in the wider economy rose by 4 percentage points to 28%, its highest point since the pandemic hit last year. 
Many people were thinking about where to spend the savings they had racked up while stuck at home. A fifth of those who had saved more than normal said they would take a big holiday and 13% planned treats for themselves.
The survey of 2,003 people was conducted between Feb. 19 and Feb. 22, before finance minister Rishi Sunak announced an extension of support for households and businesses in a new budget plan last week.
The Bank of England is watching to see how much of the big increase in household savings is spent as it tries to gauge the likely strength of the economy's bounce-back.
A separate survey published on Tuesday by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body also showed how households, for now at least, were focusing their spending on essential items.
Its measure of overall retail spending at major retail chains rose by 1.0% in February compared with the same month last year, faster than the average growth rate of 0.6% in the past three months.
Over the three months to February, total food sales increased 7.9% but sales of non-food items fell by 5.5%.
Paul Martin, UK head of retail at accountants KPMG which produces the survey with the BRC, said Sunak's budget last week offered only short-term help for retailers.

""Conditions will continue to be incredibly challenging as they face subdued demand, thinner margins and rising logistics costs, alongside the accelerated structural changes to the sector,"" Martin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories increased solidly in January even as sales surged and it is taking wholesalers the shortest time in six years to clear shelves, a sign of strengthening demand that aligns with expectations for faster economic growth this year. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday that wholesale inventories rose 1.3% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers gained 0.6% in December. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product also increased 1.3% in January.
Inventories rose 0.6% in January from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers jumped 4.9% after advancing 1.9% in December. At January's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.24 months to clear shelves. That was the shortest since November 2014 and was down from 1.29 months in December.
Domestic demand is picking up after hitting a pothole late in the fourth quarter, driven by declining COVID-19 infections and nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief from the government. Consumer spending rebounded sharply in January after slumping in November and December.
""Pent-up demand, particularly coming from middle- and high-income households who have been aggressively saving throughout the crisis, is set to drive consumption spending throughout the year as the health crisis begins to abate,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Spending is likely to accelerate further if Congress, as expected, approves President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. The bill, which was passed by the Senate on Saturday, will send onetime $1,400 checks to many low- and middle-income Americans as well as extend government-funded unemployment benefits for millions of people.
Households have accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.
Economists estimate the economy could grow this year by as much as 7%, fueled by the massive fiscal stimulus and rollout of vaccines that are expected to get the pandemic under control. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic, helping to underpin manufacturing. But a big chunk of the inventory build is coming from imports, which could keep the trade deficit elevated. 
The government reported last week that imports of goods raced to a record high in January. Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts rebounded 1.2% in January. There were also increases in stocks of professional and computer equipment, as well as petroleum. Machinery inventory, however, fell. 

Wholesale goods sales were boosted by the automotive, professional equipment, computer equipment, machinery and petroleum categories.

Consumers said they expect gas prices to rise by a median 9.6% over the next year, up from 6.2% in January. It was the fifth straight month of increase and a new high for the survey, which launched in 2013. Similarly, rent is expected to increase by a median of 9.0% over the next year, up from 6.4% in January.
Respondents also raised their expectations for how much food, medical care and college will cost over the next year.
A drop in coronavirus infections, the distribution of vaccines and expectations for additional fiscal support is raising hopes that the U.S. economy could be poised for a robust recovery this year. Investors expecting stronger inflation are moving into riskier assets, leading to a rise in long-term Treasury yields. 
Some investors worried about inflation have speculated the Fed would move to lower long-term borrowing costs by adjusting its bond-buying program. But Fed officials signaled last week that they view the rise in long-term yields as a sign of growing optimism about the economy and do not expect to adjust monetary support in the near future. Fed officials will meet again for a policy-setting meeting on March 16 and 17. 
The New York Fed's survey is based on a rotating panel of about 1,300 households. 

Median inflation expectations over the next year rose slightly to 3.1% in February, reaching the highest level since July 2014. Projections for inflation at the three-year horizon stayed flat at 3.0%, according to the monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations.

Investing.com – Chinese exports rose in February, continuing a surge recorded in the first two months of 2021. The upward trend reflects strong global demand for manufactured goods, but the figures are partly skewed by the low base in 2020 when the economy shut down due to COVID-19.
General Administration of Customs data released on Sunday said that exports climbed 60.6% year-on-year in February, above the 38.9% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 18.1% growth recorded in January.
Exports more than doubled from 2020 in February alone, despite the volatility usually seen in Chinese economic activity for the first two months of the year thanks to the Lunar New Year holiday. The comparison with 2020, when factories and businesses shut down to contain COVID-19, distorted the figures even further in 2021.
Strong demand for medical equipment and work-from-home devices, which has helped to underpin China’s V-shaped recovery from the pandemic since the second half of 2020, also continued to boost exports. Demand has also been helped by improving COVID-19 situations in major trading partners like the U.S. and Europe.
A shorter-than-usual break for migrant workers during the Lunar New Year holiday, and the subsequent early resumption of factory production, also boosted exports. An outbreak of COVID-19 earlier in the year discouraged many workers from the traditional journey back to their hometowns during the holiday.
“Excluding distortions from base effects, trade growth was still quite solid,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. analysts said in a note.
While export growth will likely slow after March as base effects ease, fresh stimulus measures in developed nations, especially in the U.S., “may bolster external demand for Chinese products and partly offset the downward pressure,” the note added.
Imports grew 22.2% year-on-year, against the forecast 15% growth and January's 6.5% growth. The data did suggest a divergence between heavy industries and hi-tech sectors, with the latter outperforming, according to Bloomberg.

719,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s exports surged in the first two months of the year, reflecting strong global demand for manufactured goods and with figures partly skewed by the low base in 2020 when the economy was in lockdown.
Exports jumped 60.6% in dollar terms in the January-February period from a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed Sunday, well above the 40% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In February alone, exports more than doubled from last year.
The first two months are normally volatile for China’s economic activity because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year. The figures are even more distorted this time around because of the comparison with 2020, when factories and businesses were shut to contain the coronavirus outbreak in the early part of the year. Exports plunged 17.4% in the first two months of last year.
Even with the favorable base effects, the data shows exports continued to benefit from soaring global demand for medical equipment and work-from-home devices, which has helped to underpin China’s V-shaped recovery from the pandemic since the second half of the year.
The customs agency said the strong trade data reflects improving demand in major trading partners like the U.S. and Europe, a domestic recovery that’s fueling import growth, and base effects from last year’s slump.
Travel Restrictions
Exports also benefited from a shorter-than-usual vacation for migrant workers during this year’s Lunar New Year break and the early resumption of factory production. Travel restrictions imposed early in the year prevented many workers from making their annual trip home during the holiday.
“Excluding distortions from base effects, trade growth was still quite solid,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. economists led by Ting Lu wrote in a note. While export growth will likely slow after March as base effects ease, fresh stimulus measures in developed nations, especially in the U.S., “may bolster external demand for Chinese products and partly offset the downward pressure,” they said.
Imports also grew strongly, climbing 22.2% in the first two months of the year from a year earlier, exceeding the 16% gain predicted by economists. A breakdown of the data suggests a divergence between heavy industries and hi-tech sectors, with the latter outperforming, according to Bloomberg Economics.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
In the longer term though, we see uncertainty for exports in the second half of the year as external demand for working-from-home and anti-epidemic goods may start to slow, alongside the pandemic staying in check. In addition, more export economies would return to the market, potentially leading to more intensive competition in global markets.

The value of exports declined to almost $205 billion in February, likely due to the Lunar New Year holiday. However, that was still 155% higher than shipments in the same month in 2020, when China was in lockdown to contain the first outbreak of Covid-19.
The data comes two days after the National People’s Congress, the biggest political meeting of the year, kicked off in Beijing, with the government setting out its economic agenda for coming years. Authorities are targeting growth of more than 6% this year, a relatively conservative goal compared with the 8.4% expansion that economists predict. The government also signaled more restrained monetary and fiscal policy after last year’s pandemic stimulus.
“We expect Beijing to carry out its policy normalization in coming months, although a sharp shift in policies appears unlikely,” Nomura’s economists said.

720,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's February exports grew at a record pace from a year earlier when COVID-19 battered the world's second-biggest economy, customs data showed on Sunday, while imports rose less sharply.
Exports in dollar terms skyrocketed 154.9% in February compared with a year earlier, while imports gained 17.3%, the most since October 2018. The data did not include figures for January alone. 
In the January-February period, exports jumped 60.6% from a year earlier, when lockdowns to contain the pandemic paralysed the country's economic activity. That exceeded the forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll for a 38.9% surge. 
Strong exports, which benefited from China's success in largely containing the public health crisis, have helped fuel the country's recovery from a pandemic-induced paralysis. 
The surge was driven by a rebound in foreign demand, customs said in a statement on its website, citing improvements in manufacturing industries in the European Union and the United States, and their increased imports of Chinese products thanks to fiscal stimulus measures.
""In addition, a majority of manufacturing employees (in China) chose to stay put over the Lunar New Year holidays,"" the statement said. ""Our survey showed a lot of firms in export-oriented provinces stayed open, and orders that usually only get delivered after the new year had been delivered normally.""
Chinese factory activity usually goes dormant during the Lunar New Year break, which fell in the middle of February this year, as workers return to their hometowns. This year, the government appealed to workers to avoid travelling to curb the risk of a spread of the coronavirus. 
In January-February, imports increased 22.2% from a year earlier, above the 15% forecast, partly due to stockpiling of semiconductors and energy products, according to customs. 
China posted a trade surplus of $103.25 billion for the first two months. Analysts had expected the trade surplus to narrow to $60.15 billion from $78.17 billion in December.
'NORMAL YEARS'
In yuan terms, exports rose 50.1% in the two months from a year earlier, while imports gained 14.5%.
""Due to the impact of the new coronavirus, overall trade (in yuan terms) in January-February last year fell 9.7%, and the low base was one of the reasons for the larger increase this year,"" customs said. ""But even when compared with normal years, such as the comparable periods in 2018 and 2019, growth in China's overall trade was around 20%.""
China's economy expanded 2.3% last year, helped by solid demand for Chinese-made goods such as medical and work-from-home equipment, although the growth was its weakest in 44 years.
This year, China has set a modest growth target of at least 6%, planning a careful course out of a year disrupted by COVID-19 and amid heightened tensions with the United States.
China's trade surplus with the United States stood at $51.26 billion in January-February. Chinese customs did not give a monthly breakdown. The surplus was $29.92 billion in December.

Katherine Tai, President Joe Biden's nominee to be U.S. trade representative, said last week she would work to fight a range of ""unfair"" Chinese trade and economic practices.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's exports to the United States, its largest trading partner, rose sharply in January, leading to a surprise trade surplus, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
Canada's trade surplus with the rest of the world was C$1.41 billion ($1.11 billion) in January, the largest since July 2014. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a deficit of C$1.40 billion.
""In a sea of really bad news this is an island paradise. Everything is up,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada. 
""This is very strongly driven by our top trading partner,"" Hall said, noting that demand from the United States will continue to be strong as its economy strengthens with increased vaccinations spurring a broader recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Canadian dollar clawed back some of its earlier decline after the data, trading 0.1% lower at 1.2678 to the greenback, or 78.88 U.S. cents.
Canada's exports jumped 8.1% in January, led by a large sale of used aircraft to the United States. Even without the atypical aircraft sale, aggregate exports would have been up, with strong exports of gold bars, crude oil and lumber. 
Excluding the swings of 2020, exports posted their largest increase since August 1995.
""The return to surplus in January ... is consistent with expectations that Canada's trade position will improve through 2021 amid returning global demand and firmer energy prices,"" said Ryan Brecht, a senior economist at Action Economics.
Canada's export of services rose slightly on an increase in transportation services, but they still remain 16.3% below the February 2020 level.

Imports edged up 0.9% in January, mostly on higher imports of energy products. Canada's December trade deficit was revised to C$1.98 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in February as falling new COVID-19 infections and additional pandemic relief money from the government boosted hiring at restaurants and other services businesses, firmly putting the labor market recovery back on track. 
Though job growth momentum is expected to build in the months ahead amid an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and more fiscal stimulus, it will probably take several years for the labor market to heal from the deep scars inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, which is now in its second year.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed at least 4.1 million Americans have been out of work for more than six months, accounting for 41.5% of the unemployed population in February. Another 3.5 million have permanently lost their jobs. 
Graphic: Unemployment duration - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xegpbwrqdvq/ueduration.png
""There remains easy fuel for strong payroll gains in coming months as the reopening gains momentum,"" said Robert Rosener, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""But there is much further to go before conditions are consistent with maximum employment.""
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 379,000 jobs last month after rising 166,000 in January. Payrolls fell in December for the first time in eight months. The economy has recouped 12.7 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in the pandemic recession. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast February payrolls increasing by 182,000 jobs. Restaurants and bars hired 286,000 workers last month, accounting for 75% of the payrolls gain. There were also increases in employment at hotels and motels and at amusements, gambling and recreation establishments. Altogether, leisure and hospitality employment jumped by 355,000 jobs.
Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, increased further. Healthcare and social assistance also added jobs, and retailers hired 41,000 workers. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 21,000 jobs. About half of the factory job gains were in transportation equipment, despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has forced some automakers to cut production.
But construction employment decreased by 61,000 jobs because of bitter cold across the country. Government payrolls dropped by 86,000 jobs, with losses concentrated at state and local governments. The diffusion index, or measure of private industries expanding, jumped to 57.0 from 48.4 in January.
The surge in hiring follows on the heels of a strong rebound in consumer spending in January, which prompted economists to sharply upgrade their growth estimates for the first quarter. 
A decrease in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations and nearly $900 billion in stimulus provided by the government at the end of December are driving the revival in economic activity and hiring. That has stoked inflation fears. 
The White House is not backing down on President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan. Economists have warned the massive package, combined with the Federal Reserve's near zero interest rates and bond purchases, could cause the economy to overheat.
U.S. Treasury yields have jumped as investors see higher inflation.
""We will always be rooting for more job growth for more Americans across the board,"" National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told CNBC. ""We think that if we pass this rescue plan right now we could be poised for really strengthening the economy and getting to full employment significantly faster than most forecasters estimate without this plan.""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday again brushed aside the inflation concerns, saying he expected the U.S. central bank ""will be patient"" until the economy is ""very far along the road to recovery."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

PLENTY OF SLACK
Even as the labor market recovery is regaining steam, ample slack remains. Though the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% last month from 6.3% in January, it continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this problem, the unemployment rate would have been 6.7%. It is about 9.5%, including people who have given up the search for work.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 11.1%. Unemployment remains high among Blacks and Hispanics, as well as Americans without a high school diploma and college degrees. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was steady at 61.4% in February. The participation rate has tumbled from 63.3% in February 2020, with women accounting for the biggest share of dropouts.
According to Census Bureau data, around 10 million mothers living with their own school-age children were not actively working in January, 1.4 million more than during the same month in 2020.
""The Fed wants a 'broad' recovery in the labor market across income and racial groups,"" said Joseph Song, a U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""So while there is meaningful improvement, the labor market is far from returning to normal.""

With the lower-wage leisure and hospitality industry accounting for 94% of payrolls growth last month, average hourly earnings gained 0.2%. Unseasonably cold weather shortened the average workweek to 34.6 hours from 34.9 hours.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that the trade gap rose 1.9% to $68.2 billion in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $67.5 billion deficit in January.
Goods imports advanced 1.6% to $221.1 billion, the highest on record. Consumer spending increased by the most in seven months in January, boosted by government checks to low-income households as part of nearly $900 billion in additional COVID-19 pandemic relief.
The surge in demand also reduced inventories at retailers in January, according to an advance estimate published by the government last week. Lean inventories and anticipated strong domestic demand as new coronavirus cases decline and the pace of vaccinations accelerates, suggest imports will continue to rise.

Exports of goods gained 1.6% to $135.7 billion. Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for two straight quarters.

Investing.com -- Hiring in the U.S. economy accelerated sharply in February, reviving hopes of a rapid recovery from the winter wave of layoffs due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 379,000 through the middle of the month, almost double the 182,000 consensus forecast. The number for January was also revised sharply by higher by over 100,000 to 166,000.
The data reflected the gradual reopening of parts of the U.S. economy as the pressure on the country's hospitals eased off during the month. Gross gains in services employment totaled 513,000, with the leisure and hospitality sector alone adding 355,000 jobs as bars and restaurants resumed business, albeit often still under capacity constraints.
The figures are likely to reinforce concerns that the Federal Reserve will start to withdraw monetary stimulus from the economy sooner than originally planned. In a speech on Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had again said that he wanted to see substantial progress in bringing down unemployment before thinking about tightening monetary policy.  Powell has repeatedly stressed that the U.S. is still operating with around 10 million fewer jobs, relative to its pre-pandemic state.
The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3% in January, while the broader U6 measure of joblessness, which captures a broader sample of underemployment, remained steady at 11.1%. The labor force participation rate stayed at 61.4%. 
The numbers emboldened those willing to be on higher interest rates: 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to 1.58% from 1.56% immediately before the release, while five-year yields, which are more sensitive to expectations of changes in Fed policy, rose 4 basis points to 0.84%. They've now risen some 15 basis points this week.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil rose in January for a ninth straight month, figures showed on Friday, but it was the slowest rate in that period, offering another indication that the wider economic recovery is losing steam.
January's 0.4% increase in industrial output was exactly in line with the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists, while the year-on-year rise of 2.0% was slightly below the poll forecast of 2.2% growth. 
Graphic: Brazil industrial production - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdedjdpo/IPMONTH.png
Statistics agency IBGE said the main drivers were a 3.1% increase in food production, and a 1.5% rise in mining output.
Not only was the overall increase the slowest in the past nine months, IBGE also said it was spread across a far narrower range of categories and segments.
""Industry kept up its positive performance, but decelerated in January,"" said IBGE survey manager Andre Macedo.
""It is also worth noting that the number of segments with a negative performance was a majority (14 of 26), something that has not been seen before in this sequence of nine months of growth,"" he said.
Capital goods and consumer goods production were the only two of four major categories to record an increase in output in January, while only 11 of the 26 industry segments surveyed showed growth, IBGE said.
Purchasing managers index data show that the pace of expansion in Brazil's manufacturing sector picked up again in February after three months of deceleration, driven by strong increases in new orders and production.
But confidence in the sector fell in February for a second consecutive month, a sign that the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 virus is taking its toll.
In the nine consecutive months of rising output, the sector grew by more than 42%, IBGE said, more than making up for the 27% contraction in March and April at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.
However, Brazilian industry is still 12.9% smaller than its peak in May, 2011, IBGE said.

The central bank forecasts a 5.1% rise in industrial output this year, following last year's 4.5% slump.

Domestic orders fell by 2.6% on the month while orders from abroad rose by 4.2%. Contracts from the euro zone increased by 3.9%. Orders from the rest of the world rose by 4.4 %.
German factories have been humming along during the pandemic on higher foreign demand, helping the economy avoid a contraction in the last quarter of 2020 and offsetting a drop in consumer spending amid a partial lockdown to contain COVID-19.
Higher demand from China, the United States and Europe drove growth in German factory activity to its highest level in more than three years in February, brightening the outlook for the economy, a survey showed on Monday.
However, lockdown measures introduced in November, and then tightened in mid-December, have held back private consumption.
Strong exports and solid construction activity helped the economy to grow by 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, but the stricter lockdown measures at home and abroad are clouding the economic outlook.
German business groups expressed dismay on Thursday after Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed a gradual easing of coronavirus curbs but added an ""emergency brake"" to reimpose restrictions if case numbers get out of control.

The tentative reopening plan dashed any hopes of a swift rebound in consumer spending this month to end a weak first quarter on a stronger note.

Household spending likely shed 2.1% in January from a year earlier, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 15 economists, after a 0.6% decline in December. On a monthly basis, spending likely fell 3.1% in January after a 0.9% gain in December, according to the poll.
""Stay-at-home demand such as for electric appliances and food and beverages remained firm but service spending such as travel and eating out appeared to have weakened,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Japan's export-reliant economy, the world's third largest, has bounced back from its worst postwar recession last year thanks to a rebound in overseas demand. 
But ongoing coronavirus curbs are hitting Japan's services sector as the country grapples with its third wave of infections. Japan's government plans to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Friday.
Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded an annualised 12.8% in October-December, according to analysts in the poll, slightly higher than a preliminary reading of 12.7%. 
The government is due to release revised GDP data and household spending data on March 9.
GDP was seen rising 3.0% in the October-December period from the previous quarter, unchanged from an initial estimate, the poll showed.
Capital spending likely grew 4.1% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the poll showed, compared with an initial reading of 4.5% growth.

Analysts said better-than-expected public spending likely supported overall GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020.

 Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC), the U.S. government-owned mortgage holder, reported on Thursday that the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has edged up 0.6 percentage points to 3.02%, its highest level since July.
""Since reaching a low point in January, mortgage rates have risen by more than 30 basis points, and the impact on purchase demand has been noticeable,"" said Sam Khater, chief economist with the government-owned mortgage holder. ""While purchase activity remains high, it has cooled off over the last few weeks and is currently on par with early March, prior to the pandemic.""
This aligns with data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, which reported on Wednesday that the average 30-year fixed contract rate increased to 3.23%, marking the second straight week above the 3% level which it sank below in mid-November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, likely boosted by brutal winter storms in the densely populated South in mid-February, though the labor market outlook is improving amid declining new COVID-19 cases.
That was confirmed by other data on Thursday showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based companies plummeted 57% in February. The labor market has lagged an acceleration in overall economic activity, driven by nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic aid provided by the U.S. government in late December.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also struck an optimistic note on the labor market on Thursday, telling a Wall Street Journal forum that there is ""good reason to expect job creation to pick up in the coming months."" Powell, however, said there is still a lot of ground to cover for the labor market to get back to a state of full employment. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 745,000 for the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 750,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims rose 31,519 to 748,078 last week, boosted by filings in Texas and New York, as well as in Ohio, which has been plagued by fraudulent applications.
Stormy weather in the South left large parts of Texas without power or water for days. The deep freeze shut oil production and refineries in Texas, the biggest producer of natural gas and oil in the United States. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week.
But the sun is slowly starting to peek through the clouds shrouding the labor market. In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S. companies announced 34,531 job cuts in February. That was the smallest number since December 2019 and was down from 79,552 January.
""The jobs picture is beginning to firm up again after a rough winter,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY
A drop in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations helped to lift consumer spending in January. Though the pace of decline in infections has stalled, economists believe the labor market will accelerate in the spring and through summer, noting that vaccinations were increasing daily.
A boost to hiring is also expected from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which is under consideration by Congress. 
Still, the road to recovery remains long and difficult.
Though weekly jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020 when the pandemic hit the United States a little more than a year ago, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. 
In a well-functioning labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 124,000 to 4.295 million during the week ended Feb 20. But that was mainly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
About 4.465 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 13. At least 18 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs in mid-February. 
""This underscores just how far the nation is from a genuine labor market recovery,"" said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. 
Government-funded unemployment benefits will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration's relief package, affecting nearly 12 million people.
Last week's claims data has no bearing on February's employment report as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed establishments and households. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government will likely report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 182,000 jobs in February after rising by only 49,000 in January.
Hopes for a pick-up in hiring last month were supported by a survey last week showing consumers' perceptions of the labor market improved in February after deteriorating in January and December. In addition, a measure of manufacturing employment increased to a two-year high in February.
But those expectations were tempered by reports on Wednesday showing private employers hired fewer-than-expected workers in February. Employment growth in the services industry retreated last month, with businesses reporting they were ""unable to fill vacant positions with qualified applicants.""
The year-long COVID-19 pandemic is keeping some workers at home, fearful of accepting or returning to jobs that could expose them to the virus. Millions of women have left the labor force to look after children as many schools remain closed.

The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday noted ""continued difficulties attracting and retaining qualified workers"" reported by many of the U.S. central bank's contacts last month, with labor shortages ""most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions."" The Fed's contacts cited the coronavirus, childcare, and unemployment benefits as factors behind the labor supply problem.

731,"<span>Mar 04, 2021 10:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in January, pointing to a sustained recovery in manufacturing even as the pace of business spending on equipment is slowing.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders shot up 2.6% after rising 1.6% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 2.1% in January. Orders increased 1.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has been driven by strong demand for goods, like electronics and furniture as 23.2% of the labor force works from home because of the virus. Demand could, however, shift back to services in the summer as more Americans get vaccinated, and slow manufacturing activity from current levels.
A global semiconductor chip shortage, which on Wednesday forced General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to extend production cuts at its plant in Fairfax, Kansas, could slow momentum. But the outlook for manufacturing remains solid, with the Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity rising to a three-year high in February.
Factory goods orders in January were boosted by strong demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as primary metals and fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery fell. 
Unfilled orders at factories edged up 0.1% in January after decreasing 0.2% in December. 
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.4% in January instead of 0.5% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 1.8%. They were previously reported to have surged 2.1% in January.

Business spending on equipment increased robustly for a second straight quarter in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy's 4.1% annualized growth rate during that period.

Investing.com -- The number of people applying for jobless benefits stayed at an elevated level for another week, despite the first relaxations of measures designed to stop the winter surge in Covid-19 cases.
The Labor Department said that 745,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, fractionally below expectations for 750,000 but up slightly from a revised total of 736,000 last week. The biggest increase in initial claims was in Texas, with just under 18,000. The state had suffered disproportionately from the collapse of its energy system due to an extreme cold snap late last month.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, fell by 124,000 to 4.295 million. However, that number doesn't capture the full extent of underemployment caused by the pandemic and the lockdown measures taken to contain it. 
The broadest measure of those claiming under federal and state programs, which include those set up specifically since the pandemic struck, showed a big improvement in the week through February 13, falling by over 1 million to 18.026 million. 
""Two good weeks in this volatile series don’t prove anything,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in emailed comments, ""but whatever happens next week, we expect the trend to fall sharply over the next few months, provided the new Covid variants don’t trigger a spring wave in cases and, more importantly, hospitalizations.""
""The jury is still out,"" he added.
There were clearer signs of progress with the monthly Challenger Job Cuts survey, which fell by more than half from January's level to 34,531. That's the lowest level since before the pandemic erupted a year ago.
Hopes for a relatively swift decline in unemployment have risen in recent weeks as a series of states, most notably Texas this week, have lifted public health measures restricting businesses, which have hit the labor-intensive service sector particularly hard. However, a suite of Federal Reserve officials have pointed to a still-vast reservoir of unemployed and discouraged workers, noting that the prospect of full employment is still way off. 
Employment in the U.S. is currently running some 10 million below where it was a year ago."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.3 from 49.2, moving above the 50 threshold for growth. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 51.0.
""The rebound was supported by the largest rise in commercial development activity since last September as the successful vaccine roll-out spurred contract awards on projects that had been delayed,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at financial data company IHS Markit.
""House-building is still the engine of recovery for the construction sector, although there was a loss of momentum since January as adverse weather and longer wait times for materials contributed to some temporary delays on site,"" he added.
Britain's housing market has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, spurred by demand for more spacious properties and a tax break which finance minister Rishi Sunak extended for up to six months for some home-buyers in Wednesday's budget statement.
The survey showed purchasing costs for construction companies rose at the fastest pace since August 2008, reflecting global shipping shortages and demand for raw materials.
Timber was in particularly short supply, IHS Markit said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in February amid job losses in manufacturing and construction, suggesting the labor market was struggling to regain speed despite the nation's improving public health picture.
Part of the labor market's problems appear to be rooted in a shortage of workers. Other data on Wednesday showed job growth in the services industry retreated last month, with businesses reporting they were ""unable to fill vacant positions with qualified applicants"" and ""need more resources to meet demand.""
That was also corroborated by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report, which noted ""continued difficulties attracting and retaining qualified workers"" by many of the U.S. central bank's contacts last month, with labor shortages ""most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions.""
The year-long COVID-19 pandemic is keeping some workers at home, fearful of accepting or returning to jobs that could expose them to the coronavirus. The data was published ahead of the government's closely watched employment report on Friday, and could temper expectations for an acceleration in job growth in February. The ADP's private payrolls report, however, has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the government's more comprehensive employment report.
""This is a disappointment given that the drop-off in coronavirus case numbers and the resulting lifting of containment measures should be giving the economy a bigger shot in the arm,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
Private payrolls rose by 117,000 jobs last month after increasing 195,000 in January, the ADP National Employment Report showed. The report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 177,000 jobs in February. 
Construction employment fell by 3,000 jobs and manufacturing payrolls decreased 14,000. Hiring in the services sector increased by 131,000 jobs, with the leisure and hospitality industry adding 26,000 positions. Harsh weather in some parts of the country was also likely a factor holding back gains.

Still, the labor market has been slow to regain traction even as some restrictions on services businesses have been rolled back amid a drop in new COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. Though the rate of decline in coronavirus cases has stalled, economists still believe the labor market will accelerate in the spring and through summer.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its measure of services sector employment fell to a reading of 52.7 in February from 55.2 in January. 
The lack of significant improvement in the labor market is also despite nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December, which boosted consumer spending and positioned the economy for faster growth in the first quarter. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter have been raised to as high as a 10% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace. The upgrades also reflect President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan, under consideration by Congress. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
""Historically, employment lags GDP by a quarter or so,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Everything from that (GDP) front looks good, we are expecting substantial job growth in the not-too-distant future.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

Hopes for a pick-up in hiring last month were supported by a survey last week showing consumers' perceptions of the labor market improved in February after deteriorating in January and December. In addition, a measure of manufacturing employment hit a two-year high in February.
The retrenchment in services employment last month contributed to the ISM's broader non-manufacturing activity index declining to a nine-month low of 55.3 in February from 58.7 in January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Brutal winter storms lashed Texas and parts of the populous South region in mid-February. 
The lack of qualified workers at suppliers and manufacturers is creating bottlenecks in the supply chain, sticking businesses with higher production costs. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries jumped to 71.8, the highest since September 2008, from 64.2 in January. 
It mirrored findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey this week and a surge in consumers' near-term inflation expectations.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has played down these fears, citing three decades of lower and stable prices. There is also excess capacity in the labor market, with at least 19 million people on unemployment benefits. 
But Americans grounded at home by COVID-19 have accumulated excess savings, which can provide dry power for spending. Consumer spending on services remains about 3.3% lower than before the outbreak of the virus in the United States.

The contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular U.S. home loan, rose by 0.15 percentage point to 3.23% in the week ended Feb. 26, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
That was the largest weekly increase since last March and marks the fourth straight weekly rise in borrowing costs. With the increase, mortgage rates have risen 0.37 percentage point from their record low of 2.86% early this year.
The MBA said its weekly index of mortgage applications rose 0.5% to 794.5, its first increase in four weeks.
""The housing market is entering the busy spring buying season with strong demand,"" said Joel Kan, MBA's Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting. ""Purchase applications increased, with a rise in government applications – likely first-time buyers – pulling down the average loan size for the first time in six weeks.""
The housing market has been one of the persistent bright spots throughout the pandemic-induced recession, now a year old. But much of the strength has come from historically low interest rates, and economists had worried the rapid rise in Treasury yields in the last several weeks risked choking off that activity.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone economy is almost certainly in a double-dip recession as COVID-19 lockdowns continue to hammer the services industry, but hopes for a wider vaccine rollout has driven optimism to a three-year peak, a survey showed on Wednesday. 
IHS Markit's final February Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 48.8 from January's 47.8, above a flash reading of 48.1 but firmly below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
That increase was in large part due to near-record growth in manufacturing as factories in the 19-countries that use the euro have mostly remained open after restrictions were reimposed to curb high coronavirus cases. Governments have forced hospitality and entertainment venues to remain closed and encouraged citizens to stay at home. 
""The small upward revision to the euro zone's Composite PMI for February still leaves it consistent with another contraction in GDP in Q1,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.

They cited delays to the European Union's vaccine roll-out, concerns about new coronavirus variants supporting current lockdowns, stalled economic activity and rising unemployment as serious threats.
The services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, continued to suffer under an extended coronavirus lockdown while French business activity fell to a three-month low. The Spanish and Italian services sectors also saw activity shrinking again.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, economic output stabilised after a sharp fall in January before, its PMI showed, just hours before finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to set out his economic plans for the coming year.
SERVICES STRIFE
A PMI for the euro zone's dominant services industry, most affected by lockdowns, rose to 45.7 last month, ahead of January's 45.4 and the 44.7 flash estimate but still well below breakeven.
Demand fell for a seventh month, despite firms cutting their prices, yet services businesses did increase headcount - albeit marginally - for the first time since last February, just before Europe felt the first wave of the initial pandemic.
The services employment index rose to 50.2 from 49.8.
The EU's inoculation campaign has been marred by cuts in promised deliveries, rollout delays and some social resistance but there are expectations these will be ironed out and the composite future output index, which measures optimism, bounced to 67.0 from 64.2.

""The slow vaccine rollout and rising case numbers in France and Italy means that the lifting of restrictions is likely to be delayed, pushing much of the vaccine-related bounce in activity into Q3,"" Hinds said.

Last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a path for easing the lockdown in England as vaccinations roll out rapidly. Schools will reopen next week but full restrictions on hospitality venues will not go until late June at the earliest.
Sunak is expected to set out further spending plans in a budget statement around 1230 GMT after providing almost 300 billion pounds of support during the past year.

IHS Markit's PMI sub-index for the service sector fell to 45.6 from 47.3, better than an initial reading of 43.6.
With many business leaders fearing a new lockdown last month amid rising coronavirus cases, both indexes fell to the lowest level since November, when France was put under a second lockdown to contain the outbreak.
""February PMI data pointed to a continuation of the coronavirus-driven downturn seen throughout the winter months in the French private sector,"" IHS economist Eliot Kerr said. 
""Again, weakness was centred on services, where businesses are most hindered by restrictions related to the pandemic, with some firms remaining temporarily closed,"" Kerr added.

While France has so far been spared a third nationwide lockdown, the government is increasingly looking at targeted restrictions in regions where case numbers are rising particularly fast.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity grew, but at its slowest pace in ten months, in February, a private sector survey said on Wednesday. This was as companies dealt with low demand and higher costs, prompting them to cut jobs,
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, stood at 51.5 against January’s 52 figure. It follows the Caixin manufacturing PMI, released earlier in the week, which was 50.9 against the 51.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January’s 51.5 figure.
Data released earlier in the week by the National Bureau of Statistics said the manufacturing PMI released on Sunday was 50.6, below the 51.1 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and down from January’s 51.3 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was 51.4, also down from January’s 52.4.
The survey also said that a sub-index for employment, which stood at 47.9, slipped into contraction after six months of growth as companies laid off workers. New export business also dropped after three months of expansion.
The loss of momentum is attributable to a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country at the beginning of 2021. COVID-19 also continued to dent overseas demand.
“The momentum of post-epidemic services recovery further weakened … service providers cut staff to reduce costs as weakened market sentiment had a knock-on effect on the job market,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
The services sector, slower to recover initially from COVID-19 than the industrial sector, has also more vulnerable to the strict social distancing restrictions implemented to curb the outbreak. The Lunar New Year holidays in February, when many workers return to their hometowns from the cities, also saw limited travel thanks to COVID-19.
However, investors expect a strong rebound in full-year growth with China reporting no domestic COVID-19 cases since early February. Chinese services firms also remained optimistic about the year ahead, with business expectations over the next year rising from January."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.5, the lowest since April, from 52.0 in January but remained above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
A sub-index for employment stood at 47.9, slipping into contraction after six months of growth, as businesses laid off workers, the survey showed. New export business also shrank after expanding for three months.
The loss of momentum came as China faced coronavirus flare-ups at the start of the year, while overseas demand continued to be hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings were largely in line with an official survey released on Sunday.
""The momentum of post-epidemic services recovery further weakened,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
""Service providers cut staff to reduce costs as weakened market sentiment had a knock-on effect on the job market.""
The services sector, which had been slower to recover initially from the pandemic than the industrial sector, is more vulnerable to social distancing restrictions.
Domestic COVID-19 cases have however been stamped out in China since early February and analysts expect a strong rebound in full-year growth. 
February also saw the Lunar New Year holidays, when many workers return to their hometowns, although this year saw far fewer trips amid coronavirus fears.
Costs for services firms continued to grow quickly, although at a slower pace than the month before.
But Chinese services firms remained optimistic about the year ahead, with business expectations over the next 12 months rising from January.

The contraction hitting the services sector comes as a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures put in place in part to take pressure off the nation's medical system is set to end on Sunday.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at a seasonally adjusted 46.3, staying below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion for the 13th month.
The survey result, which compared to the prior month's 46.1 and a preliminary 45.8 reading, was largely the result of a faster decline in new business and a continuing contraction in export business.
That showed demand remained in a fragile condition as the impact of the pandemic dragged on, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nevertheless, short-term uncertainty appears to be easing as vaccine rollouts begin,"" Bhatti said.
""Firms looked to prepare for a boost in demand by expanding employment levels for the first time since last February.""
Optimism was also seen in the outlook component of the survey, which showed businesses grew the most positive about the 12 months ahead since January 2018.

The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, was 48.2 in February from the prior month's final reading of 47.1, also staying in contraction for a 13th month.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The monthly rate of producer price inflation in Brazil kicked off this year at its second highest since comparable records began more than six years ago, statistics agency IBGE said on Tuesday, with prices rising across all 24 activities surveyed.
Factory gate prices rose 3.36% in January from the month before, almost touching the 3.4% increase registered last October, the highest since the IBGE series began in 2014. 
The annual rate of producer price inflation in January was 23%, IBGE said. 
The jump in wholesale prices at the factory gate in January was led by a 10.7% surge in mining industry inflation, which accounted for 0.59 percentage points of the overall rise. 
Annual inflation in this segment was 52.9%, the highest of all 24 activities surveyed.
Gasoline and related prices rose 5.3% in the month, accounting for 0.45 percentage points of the overall rise and the second biggest single contributor, IBGE said.
The third most important driver was a 6.1% rise in metals industry inflation, accounting for 0.4 percentage points of the total rise. These prices rose almost 40% over the previous year.

A growing number of economists now think the central bank will raise as early as interest rates next month because consumer price inflation expectations are starting to drift above the bank's central year-end target of 3.75%.

MADRID (Reuters) - The number of jobless people in Spain rose above 4 million for the first time in five years in February, official data showed on Tuesday, as COVID-19 restrictions ravage the ailing economy.
Since the onset of the pandemic, Spain has lost more than 400,000 jobs, around two-thirds of them in the hospitality sector, which has struggled with limits on opening hours and capacity as well as an 80% slump in international tourism.
Jobless claims rose by 1.12% from a month earlier, or by 44,436 people to 4,008,789, Labour Ministry data showed, the fifth consecutive monthly increase in unemployment.
That number was 23.5% higher than in February 2020, the last month before the pandemic took hold in Spain. 
""The rise in unemployment, caused by the third wave, is bad news, reflecting the structural flaws of the labour market that are accentuated by the pandemic,"" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz tweeted.
Restrictions vary sharply from region to region in Spain, with some shutting down all hospitality businesses, though Madrid has taken a particularly relaxed approach and kept bars and restaurants open.
A total of 30,211 positions were lost over the month, seasonally adjusted data from the Social Security Ministry showed. It was the first month more positions were closed than created since Spain emerged from its strict first-wave lockdown in May. 
Still, the number of people supported by Spain's ERTE furlough scheme across Spain fell by nearly 29,000 to 899,383 in February.
""These figures have remained more or less stable since September, indicating that the second and third waves of the pandemic have had a much smaller effect than the first in this regard,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Hotels, bars and restaurants and air travel are the sectors with the highest proportion of furloughed workers, it added.
Tourism dependent regions like the Canary and Balearic Islands have been particularly hard hit, with the workforce contracting by more than 6% since last February in both archipelagos.

The last time the number of jobless in Spain hit 4 million was in April 2016.

The Labour Office said the number of people out of work rose by 9,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.752 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 13,000.
""Kurzarbeit (shortened working hours) continues to secure employment on a large scale and prevent unemployment,"" Labour Office chief Detlef Scheele said in a statement, adding: ""Individual sectors are feeling the effects of the lockdown.""
Germany has been in lockdown since November, and measures were tightened in mid-December, as it battles a second wave of the virus. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said new variants of COVID-19 risk a third wave of infections.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged compared with the previous month at 6.0%.
The labour agency said some 2.39 million employees were on shortened working hours in December under the government's Kurzarbeit scheme designed to avoid mass layoffs during downturns by offering companies subsidies to keep workers on the payroll.

After peaking at some 6 million last April, the number of people on Kurzarbeit fell before rising again in November as lockdown measures kicked in, the Office said.

House prices rose 6.9% in annual terms in February from 6.4% in January, Nationwide said, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a slowdown to 5.6%.
In February alone, prices rose 0.7%, more than reversing a 0.2% decline in January and bucking expectations for a 0.3% drop.
Nationwide said the outlook for the housing market was particularly uncertain right now, with the potential for it to be boosted further by Sunak when he presents his annual budget on Wednesday. 
But the market could slow because of a weakening labour market, the lender said.
Sunak looks set to extend a temporary cut to property purchase taxes until June and announce a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers, according to media reports.
Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said he doubted any new scheme would solve affordability problems faced by first-time buyers.

""Nonetheless, our forecast for house prices to drop by about 2% this year now looks too downbeat, though we’ll wait for details of the guarantee scheme to be released before providing new numbers,"" Tombs said.

The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales fell 4.5% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised decline of 9.1% in December. The January reading undershot a Reuters forecast for a decline of 0.3%.
""This decline can be explained by the ongoing coronavirus lockdown, which meant a closure of many retail stores since Dec. 16, 2020,"" the statistics office said.
The end of a temporary sales tax cut may also have contributed as many consumers made big ticket purchases before the end of 2020 to save money.
Fashion retail sales plunged 76.6% year-on-year, while sales of groceries were up 4.3% year-on-year as supermarkets and convenience stores remained open.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with sales up 31.7%.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers closed most shops and services in mid-December after a partial lockdown for bars, restaurants and entertainment venues failed to push down infections.

Merkel and state premiers are due to meet again on Wednesday to discuss a gradual easing of lockdown measures that are currently in place until at least March 7.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity increased to a three-year high in February amid a surge in new orders, but factories continued to face higher costs for raw materials and other inputs amid labor shortages at suppliers as the pandemic drags on.
The acceleration reported by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday was despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has hurt production at automobile plants. Other data showed construction spending surged to a record high in January, boosted by strong private and public outlays. 
The reports were the latest indications of strong economic performance early in the first quarter, thanks to nearly $900 billion in additional COVID-19 relief money from the government and a drop in new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations.
""We are looking at an economy that is picking up steam,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""But we are not talking high inflation, just levels that reflect a solidly growing economy.""
The ISM said its index of national factory activity rebounded to a reading of 60.8 last month from 58.7 in January. That was the highest level since February 2018. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to 58.8 in February.

Manufacturing is being driven by strong demand for goods like electronics and furniture, as 23.2% of the labor force works from home because of the virus. Demand could, however, shift back to services in the summer as more Americans get vaccinated, and slow manufacturing activity from current levels. 
But the year-long pandemic has gummed up the supply chain, boosting production costs for manufacturers. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to a reading of 86.0, the highest since July 2008, from 82.1 in January. 
This follows data last month showing a surge in consumers' near-term inflation expectations, and fits in with views that inflation will accelerate in the months ahead. Economists are, however, split on whether the anticipated spike in price pressures will be transitory or not.
U.S. Treasury yields have risen, with investors betting that extremely accommodative monetary and fiscal policy will boost inflation. The Federal Reserve is pumping cash into the economy through bond purchases, while Congress is considering President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue plan. 
There is also ample capacity in the labor market, with at least 19 million people on unemployment benefits. But Americans grounded at home by COVID-19 have accumulated excess savings, which can provide a powerful tailwind to spending.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending increased 1.7% to $1.521 trillion in January, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002, after rising 1.1% in December.
Graphic: Construction spending - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdpzegmbvw/constspend.png
Reports last month showed solid January consumer spending, manufacturing output, building permits and home sales. After Monday's data, the Atlanta Fed boosted its first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 10% annualized rate from an 8.8% pace. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
WIDE-SCALE SHORTAGES
The ISM reported that suppliers continued to ""struggle to deliver,"" because of transportation challenges and a shortage of labor. It said it did not expect these constraints to ease ""until employment levels and factory operations can return to normal across the entire supply chain."" The ISM's measure of supplier deliveries has increased every month since last August. 
Electrical equipment, appliances and components producers reported ""wide-scale"" shortages and described the situation as ""out of control."" Manufacturers of chemical products said supply chains were ""depleted,"" and expected the recent deep freeze in the Gulf Coast to worsen the shortages problem.
Food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers said they had ""experienced a higher rate of delinquent shipments from our ingredient suppliers in the last month."" They anticipated a surge in orders as restaurants reopen. 
Makers of wood products said ""prices are rising so rapidly that many are wondering if the situation is sustainable."" 
Sixteen industries including electrical equipment, appliances and components, primary metals and paper, as well as computer and electronic products reported growth last month. But printing and related support activities as well as petroleum and coal products industries contracted.
""Manufacturing is doing well but it will not be smooth sailing over the next few months because of supply-chain disruptions, slow delivery times and a global shortage of semiconductors,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 64.8 last month from 61.1 in January. Factories also received more export orders and order backlogs swelled. A measure of customer inventories fell to the lowest level since December 2009, while stocks at manufacturers remained lean, which bodes well for future production. 
As a result, factories stepped up hiring last month. The survey's manufacturing employment gauge rose to 54.4, the highest reading since March 2019, from 52.6 in January. 

That offers cautious optimism that employment growth picked up last month after nonfarm payrolls increased by only 49,000 jobs in January. The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The pace of expansion in Brazil's manufacturing sector picked up again in February after three months of deceleration, a survey of purchasing managers' activity showed on Monday, driven by strong increases in new orders and production.
Employment also picked up as firms looked to meet rising demand, while supply constraints pushed price pressures back up again, IHS Markit's latest monthly purchasing managers index (PMI) report showed.
IHS Markit's headline manufacturing PMI rose to 58.4 in February from 56.5 in January, marking the ninth consecutive month of growth.
A reading above 50.0 marks expansion, while a reading below signifies contraction. The series was launched in 2006.
""The manufacturing sector in Brazil has regained momentum after a stuttering start to 2021, but the speed of recovery remains slower than in the second half of last year,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
""Improving conditions were driven by a strong rise in new order volumes, especially from domestic clients. Goods producers sought to ramp up production schedules and staff numbers in response to greater demand, but supply constraints acted as a brake on growth,"" he said.
IHS Markit's new orders sub-index rose to 56.0 from 54.8 in January, the first rise in six months, while the employment index rose to 53.8 from 51.2.
The future output index rose, IHS Markit said, and the output prices index rose to a three-month high.
A growing number of economists say Brazil's economy will shrink in the first quarter, dragged down by a second wave of COVID-19 and the end of emergency cash transfers to millions of poor people on Dec. 31. 

Inflation remains sticky too, presenting a further headache for consumers, businesses and policymakers.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's economy grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter https://tmsnrt.rs/3dVombP and 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, annual data showed on Monday, emerging as one of only a few globally to avoid a contraction due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Propelled by a burst of credit in mid-2020, fourth-quarter GDP grew 1.7% from the previous quarter on a seasonally and calendar-adjusted basis, the Turkish Statistical Institute said.
A surge in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second half of the year that surpassed Turkey's potential rate was driven by a near doubling of lending by state banks to face down the initial wave of the virus.
While outperforming all emerging market (EM) and G20 peers except China, Turkey's growth came at a price: The cheap lending accelerated a record drop in the lira, drew down the country's foreign currency reserves and helped push inflation to 15%. Also, few jobs were created.
Graphic: Turkey grew in 2020 despite pandemic - https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/GDP-ANNUAL/oakperrkbvr/chart.png
The recovery was ""unbalanced and ultimately exacerbated some of the country's external vulnerabilities,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior EM economist at Capital Economics.
Financial sector activity surged more than 21% last year, driving overall growth, the data showed. Tourism and other services activity dropped by 4.3% and the construction sector, an engine of growth in years past, shrank 3.5%.
The lira firmed to 7.351 against the dollar after the GDP data and was 1% stronger on the day.
The volatile currency tumbled last week after a rally that began in early November when Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised a new market-friendly economic era. A new central bank chief has since hiked interest rates, cutting credit dramatically.
Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan, appointed in November, said on Twitter Monday that Turkey would prioritise price stability this year. Analysts say the economy should expand by roughly 5% in 2021 despite tight monetary policy.
In a Reuters poll, GDP was forecast to have expanded 7.1% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2020, despite new curfews and curbs on the service sector to address a second COVID-19 wave, and 2.3% for the whole year.

The major EM economy has cooled in recent years https://tmsnrt.rs/3r40BSx from an average 5% growth rate in the last two decades. The rate plunged by 10.3% annually in the second quarter as the pandemic bit, but rebounded sharply by 6.3% in the third.

Tuvey of Capital Economics said the shift in November to more orthodox policies helped Turkey avoid ""a full-blown balance of payments crisis"", and he predicted a sustained recovery may not come until the second half of this year.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, jumped to 60.7 from 57.1 in January.
It was the highest reading since January 2018 and came in slightly better than the initial ""flash"" figure of 60.6.
Factories have been humming along during the pandemic on higher foreign demand, helping the German economy avoid a contraction in the last quarter of 2020 and offsetting a drop in consumer spending amid a partial lockdown to contain COVID-19.
Many manufacturers reported higher demand from Asia, especially China, as well as the United States and European countries, with export sales posting their biggest increase since December 2017, the survey showed.
Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, said supply chain pressures intensified as more firms reported delays than ever before in nearly 25 years of data collection.
""There looks to be further upward pressure on inflation in the German economy from supply bottlenecks and a subsequent surge in manufacturing input costs,"" Smith noted.
The survey suggested that supply disruption is making it more difficult to replenish stocks, which could complicate production in the coming months, he cautioned.
""Nevertheless, the overriding sentiment for the longer-term outlook is optimism, with a record number of manufacturers expecting to see output rise over the next 12 months.""

Still, economists expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter of this year due to a stricter lockdown, which has shut most shops and services since mid-December, and freezing temperatures that slowed construction activity in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone factory activity raced along in February thanks to soaring demand, a survey showed on Monday, although the burst of business led to a shortage of raw materials and a spike in input costs.
Restrictions imposed across the continent to try to quell the spread of the coronavirus have shuttered vast swathes of the bloc's dominant services industry, meaning it has fallen to manufacturers to support the economy.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to a three-year high of 57.9 in February from January's 54.8, ahead of the initial 57.7 ""flash"" estimate and one of the highest readings in the survey's 20-year history.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed to 57.6 from 54.6, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""Manufacturing is appearing as an increasingly bright spot in the euro zone's economy so far this year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The solid manufacturing expansion is clearly helping to offset ongoing virus-related weakness in many consumer-facing sectors, alleviating the impact of recent lockdown measures in many countries and helping to limit the overall pace of economic contraction.""
A Reuters poll last month showed the bloc was in a double dip recession and that the economy would contract 0.8% this quarter after shrinking 6.9% in 2020 on an annual basis. [ECILT/EU]
Rocketing demand for manufactured goods pushed factories to increase staffing levels for the first time in nearly two years.
But lockdown measures disrupted supply chains and factories struggled to obtain raw materials, leading to a big increase in delivery times.
""The growth spurt has brought its own problems, however, with demand for inputs not yet being met by supply. Shipping delays and shortages of materials are being widely reported, and led to near-record supply chain delays,"" Williamson said.

Those shortages allowed suppliers to hike their prices at the fastest rate in almost a decade. The input prices PMI bounced to 73.9 from 68.3.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index for February rose to 56.1 points from 51.6 in January, beating the initial ""flash"" February reading of 55.0 points and far above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
France's manufacturing sector has in recent months outperformed the country's more dominant services sector industry.
While services businesses, which includes bars, hotels and restaurants, have been hit by restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, manufacturers have benefited from increased output and a rise in orders.

IHS Markit added that February saw the biggest increase in employment in France's manufacturing sector since November 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Solid demand for technology goods drove extended growth in Asia's factories in February, but a slowdown in China underscored the challenges facing the region as it seeks a sustainable recovery from the shattering COVID-19 pandemic blow.
The vaccine rollouts globally and pick-up in demand provided optimism for a vast number of businesses that had grappled for months with a cash-flow crunch and falling profits. 
In Japan, manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in over two years while South Korea's exports rose for a fourth straight month in February, suggesting the region's export-reliant economies were benefiting from robust global trade.
On the flip side, China's factory activity grew at the slowest pace in nine months in February, hit by a domestic flare-up of COVID-19 and soft demand from countries under renewed lock-down measures.
""In all, the softer pace of activity in today's (Chinese) manufacturing print is likely to be temporary, and we expect the growth momentum to pick back up on the back of a broadening out of the domestic demand recovery and a pickup in global demand,"" said Erin Xin, an economist at HSBC.
""However, household consumption, while recovering, has not yet fully reached pre-pandemic levels of growth due to continued labour market pressure.""
China was the first major economy to lead the recovery from the COVID-19 shock, so any signs of prolonged cooling in Asia's engine of growth will likely be a cause for concern.
With the global rebound still in early days, however, analysts say the outlook was brightening as companies increased output to restock inventory on hopes vaccine rollouts will normalise economic activity.
""The recovery in durable-goods demand is continuing, which is creating a positive cycle for manufacturers in Asia,"" said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics as Oxford Economics.
""As vaccine rollouts ease uncertainties over the outlook, capital expenditure will gradually pick up. That will benefit Japan, which is strong in exports of capital goods,"" he said.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.9 in February, the lowest level since last May but still above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
That was in line with official manufacturing PMI that showed factory activity in the world's second-largest economy expanded in February at the weakest pace since May last year.
Activity in other Asian giants remained brisk.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 51.4 in February from the prior month's 49.8 reading, marking the fastest expansion since December 2018, data showed on Monday.
In South Korea, a regional exports bellwether, shipments jumped 9.5% in February from a year earlier for its fourth straight month of increase on continued growth in memory chip and car sales.
India's factory activity expanded for the seventh straight month in February on strong demand and increased output, though a spike in input costs could weigh on corporate profits ahead.

The Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam also saw manufacturing activity expand in February, a sign the region was gradually recovering from the initial hit of the pandemic.

The slowdown in the manufacturing sector underscores the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery in China, although domestic COVID-19 cases have since been stamped out and analysts expect a strong rebound in full-year growth.
The results back an official survey released over the weekend showing China's factory activity expanded at the weakest pace since last May.
February also saw the Lunar New Year holidays, when many workers return to their hometowns, although this year saw far fewer trips amid coronavirus fears.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.9 last month, the lowest level since last May. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to remain unchanged from January's reading of 51.5. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
""Overseas demand continued to drag down overall demand...Surveyed manufacturers highlighted fallout from domestic flare-ups of Covid-19 in the winter as well as the overseas pandemic,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data.
A sub-index for production fell to 51.9, the slowest pace of expansion since April last year, while another sub-index for new orders fell to 51.0, the lowest since May.
Export orders shrank for the second month. Factories laid off workers for the third month, and at a faster pace, with Wang noting ""companies were not in a hurry to fill vacancies.""
An index of confidence in the year ahead rose however to 63.0, the highest since October. Input and output prices continued to rise albeit at a slower pace.
""Now the major challenge for policymakers will be maintaining the post-coronavirus recovery while paying close attention to inflation,"" Wang added.

Analysts from HSBC this week forecast that China's economy would grow 8.5% this year, leading the global recovery from the pandemic.

Investing.com – China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 hit another bump in the road in February, as factories were shut during the Lunar New Year holidays and restrictive measures to curb an outbreak of the virus disrupted what is normally the country’s busiest travel season.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Sunday showed that February’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 50.6, below the 51.1 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and down from January’s 52.8 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 51.4, also down from January’s 52.4.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI is due later in the day, and the Caixin services PMI will be released later in the week.
The manufacturing PMI fell to a nine-month low, while the non-manufacturing gauge dropped to its lowest level in around a year. However, all the indexes remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion, albeit at a slower pace.
The NBS accredited the manufacturing slump to holiday closures, although the retailing, catering and entertainment sectors remained relatively active.
The week-long Lunar New Year holiday usually distorts manufacturing activity, as factories and businesses close to allow workers to travel back to their hometowns in what is the largest movement of people seen during the year.
However, restrictions put into place due to the most recent COVID-19 outbreak caused many people to avoid travel, and instead spend at local shops, restaurants and cinemas.
“The larger-than-expected declines in China’s February purchasing managers’ indexes should not cause alarm. They reflect seasonal weakness and effects of the virus surge before the Lunar New Year. What they don’t fully capture, though, is the stabilization that started to take hold late in the month,” Bloomberg chief Asia economist Chang Shu said.
The data also showed that commodity prices continue to rise, pushing up input costs above the 60-mark for a fourth consecutive month in February. Employment for both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors also remained below the 50-mark, an indication that the economy is still bleeding jobs."

The AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 52.0 from 51.8 in January, above the 50.0 level that separates expansion from contraction but well down from December's 57.2.
Last month's reading was still far higher than the 36.0 recorded during the initial lockdown of the economy in April. The manufacturing sector has been allowed to operate during subsequent lockdowns.
Output and new orders fell for the second month running while supply chains remained under severe pressure, with Britain's exit from the European Union's trading orbit widely cited as the main cause of delays.
Rising administration and transport costs as a result of Brexit as well as upward pressure on raw materials prices are also generating more inflationary pressure, they added.
However, employment in the sector continued to rise and sentiment remained strong as firms looked beyond the crisis to a revival in demand later in 2021.
""Tight COVID lockdown restrictions, both here and elsewhere, are creating a challenging backdrop for businesses, with firms reporting weak demand and thus falling new orders in Ireland and from the UK,"" said AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan.

""On a more positive note, firms expect the rollout of COVID vaccines to bring an improvement in economic conditions as lockdown restrictions are lifted during the course of the year.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports expanded for a fourth straight month in February on continued growth in memory chip and car sales, underpinning the trade-led recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
Exports jumped 9.5% from a year earlier to $44.81 billion in February, government data showed on Monday, slower than 11.4% growth in January but matching the 9.5% increase forecast by 12 economists in a Reuters survey.
Average daily exports, however, surged 26.4% year-on-year, the sharpest in over three years, when eliminating the impact from a three-day drop in working days due to the nation's Lunar New Year holidays.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
Shipments of semiconductors, the country's top export, jumped 13.2% year-on-year and for an eighth consecutive month, while those of cars, petrochemicals and bio-health products surged 47%, 22.4% and 62.5%, respectively.
Of the nation's 15 major export items, shipments of 11 items increased last month.
By destination, those to China, the United States and the European Union soared 26.5%, 7.9% and 48.2% each.
Meanwhile, data also showed imports grew 13.9% to $42.11 billion, beating forecasts for a 12.3% jump.
The trade surplus shrank to $2.71 billion from $3.76 billion a month ago.

South Korea's financial markets are closed on Monday due to a public holiday and will resume trade on Tuesday.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed total job ads grew 7.2% in February from January, when they rose a revised 2.6%.
At 174,010, ads were at their highest level since October 2018. They were also 13.4% higher than in December 2019, a strong comeback given coronavirus lockdowns in April had tipped the domestic economy into its first recession in three decades. Job ads in April had stood at 64,828, down 61% on a year earlier.
""The ongoing strength in ANZ Job Ads gives us confidence that we’ll see solid net employment gains continue over February and March at least,"" said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch. ""The task of bringing down underutilisation is still sizeable.""
Official data showed there were 878,000 people unemployed in January, 162,000 more than in March last year, while 1.37 million remained on government support.

Australia's official unemployment rate is at 6.4%, far higher than the 4% or less that the country's central bank says is needed to boost wage growth and inflation.

The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to a seasonally adjusted 51.4 in February from the prior month's 49.8 reading.
The rise in the headline figure, which compared to a preliminary 50.6 reading, marked the fastest expansion since December 2018.
That meant manufacturing activity was well above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion thanks to strong improvements in output and orders.
Overall, new orders rose at the fastest pace since October 2018, while output grew for the first time since December 2018 after which the economy was hit by the U.S.-China trade war and the COVID-19 crisis.
The PMI survey was in line with January output and fourth-quarter gross domestic product data released last month that showed Japan's manufacturing sector has managed to weather emergency coronavirus measures at home, mainly thanks to robust overseas demand for tech components.
It also showed, however, that producers are facing a jump in input prices, which rose at their fastest pace since February 2019, pressuring their profit margins.
""Concern has been building throughout the Japanese manufacturing sector regarding ongoing supply chain disruption,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, adding that it caused raw materials prices to rise.
""Cost burdens faced by firms rose at the sharpest pace in two years, which has partially translated into higher charges for clients to cover margins,"" he added.

Future output, which shows firms' growth expectations for the year ahead, were at its highest since July 2017 as hopes of an end to the pandemic thanks to the rising distribution of vaccines boosted confidence.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices surged by the most since August 2003 in February as record low borrowing rates and government incentives lure more buyers into the market, raising fears of overheating.
Housing values rose across each of the capital cities and regional Australia, the first such synchronised growth in more than a decade, data from property consultant CoreLogic showed on Monday.
The stellar recovery in the housing market follows a COVID-19-led crunch early last year and provides a much-needed windfall to consumer wealth and confidence, with the country's housing stock already valued at A$7.2 trillion ($5.49 trillion) by September.
The CoreLogic data showed national home prices rose 2.1% in February, from January when they added 0.9%. Values were up 4.0% on the previous February.
Prices across the major capitals rose 2% in January from the previous month, to be up 2.6% on the year.
The regional market surged 2.1% in the month and 9.4% for the year as city dwellers, smarting from coronavirus lockdowns, sought more living space and houses with gardens.
Sydney and Melbourne were among the strongest markets last month, recording a 2.5% and 2.1% lift in home values, respectively, as Australia's two largest cities catch up from weaker performance throughout 2020.
Brisbane and Perth added 1.5% each and Hobart a steamy 2.5%. 
However, CoreLogic's head of research, Tim Lawless, questioned whether the rally had legs.
""Whether this new found growth in Sydney and Melbourne can be sustained is unclear,"" he said. 
""At this current rate of appreciation it won't be long before Australia's two most expensive capital city markets are moving through new record highs,"" Lawless added.

""With household incomes expected to remain subdued and stimulus winding down, it is likely affordability will once again become a challenge in these cities.""

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 from 51.3 in January, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
Analysts had expected it to decline to 51.1.
Chinese factory activity normally goes dormant during the Lunar New Year break as workers return to their home towns. This year, the government appealed to workers to remain local to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Generally, China's economic recovery has been gathering pace due to robust exports, pent-up demand and government stimulus.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders was 48.8 in February compared with 50.2 in January, slipping back into contraction after months boosted by overseas demand.
A sub-index for activity among small firms stood at 48.3 in February versus 49.4 a month earlier. Smaller firms were more affected by the seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year, said Zhao Qinghe, an official with the NBS in comments released with the data. 
A sub-index for employment in the official PMI stood at 48.1 in February, down from January's 48.4 as firms laid off more workers and at a faster pace.
Still, some manufacturing sector firms are seeing increasing pressure from rising labour costs and a shortage of workers, said Zhao.
China's factory gate prices rose on year in January for the first time in a year, as months of strong manufacturing growth pushed raw material costs higher.
China eked out 2.3% economic growth last year. This year, the government may avoid setting a growth target for fear of provincial economies feeling pressured to take on more debt, policy sources previously told Reuters.
China will reinforce policy support for foreign trade and ensure the smooth operation of supply chains, its new commerce minister said earlier this week.

In the services sector, activity expanded for the 11th consecutive month but at the slowest pace in a year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in seven months in January as the government doled out more pandemic relief money to low-income households and new COVID-19 infections dropped, positioning the economy for faster growth in the first quarter.
Despite the strong rebound in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Friday, price pressures were muted. Inflation is being closely watched amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 recovery package could cause the economy to overheat.
The plan, being considered by the U.S. Congress, would be on top of a rescue package worth nearly $900 billion approved by the government in late December. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has played down the inflation fears, citing three decades of lower and stable prices.
""Thanks to Washington, the economic outlook in the near future is sunny,"" said Sung Won Sohn, finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 2.4% last month. That was the biggest gain since last June and ended two-straight monthly declines. Personal income shot up 10%, the largest increase since last April when the government disbursed the first round of stimulus checks. Income rose 0.6% in December. 
Graphic: Personal consumption - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvoeeaqvd/perscons.png
The recent stimulus package included $600 checks to mostly low-income and some middle-income Americans. The package also extended a government-funded weekly unemployment subsidy as well as benefits for millions of people who do not qualify for state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility. These benefits expire in mid-March.
The consumer spending report added to upbeat data this month on manufacturing output, building permits and home sales. 
Consumers bought motor vehicles, recreation goods, food and beverages. They also boosted spending on services such as hotel accommodations and restaurants, as well as doctor visits. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rebounding 2.5% in January and income accelerating 9.5%.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 2% last month after decreasing 0.8% in December. But robust consumer spending is drawing in imports. 
In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 0.7% to $83.7 billion last month, with imports outpacing a rise in exports. The department also reported a 0.6% decrease in retail inventories, though stocks at wholesalers surged 1.3%.
The drag on economic growth from the widening goods trade deficit and slower pace of inventory accumulation will likely be blunted by the strong consumer spending. 
Following this month's slew of solid reports,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate to an 8.1% annualized rate from a 7.3% pace. Growth forecasts for the quarter were boosted last week from as low as a 2.3% pace. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
There are indications that the White House's massive stimulus package could be fully approved next month. It would send additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extend the government safety net for the unemployed. 
Further gains in consumer spending are likely, though winter storms, which wreaked havoc in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South this month, could slow momentum. Daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have dropped to levels last seen before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, while the pace of vaccination is picking up. 
While a third report from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index dipping this month from January, a survey from the Conference Board this week showed an improvement in confidence among households. 
Graphic: Consumer sentiment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwzzjmvw/umich.png
Inflation was benign last month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component rose 0.3% after a similar gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in December. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, a flexible average.

Powell this week told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank would keep interest rates low and continue to pump money into the economy through bond purchases ""at least at the current pace until we make substantial further progress towards our goals (maximum employment and inflation).""
There is ample slack in the labor market, with at least 19 million people on unemployment benefits. 
Income last month was boosted by a 52% surge in government transfers. It was also supported by a 0.7% rise in wages. Excluding the government largesse income at the disposal of households after inflation fell 0.5%. 
Some of the stimulus money sent to households was stashed away, hoisting the saving rate to 20.5% from 13.4% in December.

""We expect an additional stimulus package passed in March to raise the savings rate further, adding to a powerful tailwind of buying power that has been building among U.S. households, ready to be deployed as the economy is reopening,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy returned to growth in the three months to December and the recovery is expected to gather pace as consumers and investors shake off the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, economists said.
Fiscal and monetary policy could boost India's recovery prospects, they said, amid signs of a pick-up in consumer demand and government spending. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched plans for a massive vaccination drive, while outlining a slew of tax incentives to boost the manufacturing sector.
Gross domestic product grew 0.4% in October-December compared with the same period a year earlier, data released by the National Statistics Office on Friday showed. That compared with revised contractions of 7.3% in July-September and 24.4% in April-June.
Investment recorded its first growth since December 2019, growing at 2.6% compared to a revised 6.8% fall in the previous quarter, while weakness in consumer demand eased. 
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - dropped 2.4 % year-on-year in Oct-December compared to an 11.3% fall in the previous quarter, data showed.
The economy has returned to the ""pre-pandemic times of positive growth rates"", a finance ministry statement said after the release of the GDP data, which it said reflected a continued V-shaped recovery. 
""Significant recovery in manufacturing and construction augurs well for the support these sectors are expected to provide to growth in 2021/22,"" said the statement, which also cautioned that India is not yet beyond ""the danger of the pandemic"". 
Economists have raised their forecasts for the current fiscal year and 2021-22, expecting a pick-up in government spending, consumer demand and a resumption of most economic activities curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Annual growth of 3.9% in the farm sector and 1.6% in manufacturing during the three months to December raised hopes of an early recovery as the government rolls out plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to India's 1.4 billion people.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has slashed its repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since March 2020 to cushion the economic shock of the pandemic, has projected growth of 10.5% in the fiscal year that starts in April.
SHORT-TERM RISKS 
Some analysts warn, however, that a recent rise in crude oil prices and a surge of COVID-19 cases in parts of the country may pose risks to the nascent recovery.
""There are some risks that need to be watched, including rising commodity prices,""said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank, adding that the pace of recovery in the informal sector and contact-intensive services could be impacted by the resurgence of domestic virus cases.
India also revised annual GDP estimates for the fiscal year, predicting an 8.0% contraction, deeper than an earlier estimate of -7.7%. 
Sectors such as retail, airlines, hotels and hospitality are still reeling from the impact of the pandemic.

The central bank left the repo rate unchanged at 4% earlier this month, saying the growth outlook had improved and inflation was expected to remain within the RBI's targeted range over the next few quarters.

That was down from 14.1% in the three months to November, statistics agency IBGE said, in line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and slipping further from the record 14.6% in the three months to September.
Brazil's unemployment rate ended 2019 at 11.0%.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to dip marginally to 51.1 in February from 51.3 in January, according to the median forecast of 20 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
Chinese factories typically scale back operations or close for lengthy periods around the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in the middle of February this year. 
However, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the winter had prompted local governments and companies to dissuade workers from travelling back to their hometowns, giving a boost to the earlier-than-usual resumption of production at many factories, analysts say. 
""Although government COVID-19 prevention measures may constrain some manufacturing activities in the near-term, the fact that a majority of migrant workers stayed in their workplace cities for the holiday should facilitate an earlier resumption of business activity following the holiday this year,"" said analysts at Nomura in a note to client on Thursday.
Wang Zhishen, a migrant worker from Gansu, told Reuters that his factory, a manufacturer of logistics boxes in the manufacturing hub of Dongguan, only closed for three days during the holiday, thanks to overwhelming businesses. Lured by the 1,500-yuan cash subsidy his factory offered, he chose to work through the holiday.
The Chinese economy has largely shaken off the gloom from the COVID-19 health crisis, with consumers opening up their wallets after months of hesitation. Growth is now set to rebound sharply this quarter, also helped by the low base effect of a year ago.
The country has successfully curbed the domestic transmission of the COVID-19 virus in northern China, with the national health authority reporting zero new local cases for the 11th straight day. Cities that were on lockdown have since vowed to push for a work resumption at full speed.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Sunday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect the headline reading will dip slightly to 51.4 from 51.5 in January.

“Without a certain pace of expansion, the quality of the economy doesn’t have support,” Zhang Liqun, a researcher at the Development Research Center of China’s State Council, said in an interview with the state-run China Internet Information Center. “I think it is necessary to set a goal for economic growth this year, and the conditions are in place for it,” he said, referring to the nation’s strong recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak.
Zhang’s intervention in a debate about whether Beijing should abandon GDP growth targeting for a second year comes a week before the publication of the government’s annual work report, which is widely expected not to include any target. China’s government reports will be released next Friday and these will include the budget and plans for the economy in 2021, and those targets for fiscal revenue, bank credit growth, employment and income growth are all closely linked to how fast the economy expands, Zhang said.
“The market in general is not expecting a GDP target from the meetings,” Iris Pang, chief China economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong wrote in a report this week.
Zhang said the lack of a GDP target last year was mainly due to uncertainty due to the pandemic, but he expects China’s economy to grow around 8% this year as China has the coronavirus outbreak under control. That’s similar to the consensus view, which forecasts growth of 8.4% this year.
The Development Research Center is an think-tank affiliated with China’s top government body the State Council. In the past it has produced influential reports on China’s long-term economic development, partnering with institutions such as the World Bank.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose for the first time in three months in January thanks to a pickup in global demand, in a welcome sign for an economy still looking to shake off the drag of the coronavirus pandemic.
But retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, posted their second straight month of declines in January as emergency measures taken in response to the pandemic hit consumption.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output advanced 4.2% in January, boosted by sharp rises in production of electronic parts and general-purpose machinery, as well as a smaller increase in car output.
""Manufacturers will continue to increase output over the near term as long as there won't be any big shock,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
While economic growth will likely be negative in the first quarter, the strength in manufacturing would offset the negative impact of a state of emergency at home, which is mainly affecting the services sector, he said.
The rise in output, which followed a 1.0% fall the previous month, was largely in line with a 4.0% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expect output to grow 2.1% in February, followed by a 6.1% decline in March.
The government kept its assessment of industrial production unchanged, saying it was picking up.
Factory output fell in November and December as a rebound in car production ended on sagging global demand, but since then strong demand for tech-making equipment and electronic goods has helped turn the tide.
Still, some analysts worry that Japan's economic recovery will remain hobbled by weaker conditions at home and as lockdown measures taken around the world to contain the COVID-19 crisis, particularly in Europe, weigh.
The government also released data on Friday showing retail sales fell 2.4% in January compared with the same month a year earlier, in a sign households tightened their purse strings as the coronavirus staged a resurgence.
The fall, which was in line with a 2.6% drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll, was largely due to sharp contractions in general merchandise and fabrics apparel spending. It followed a 0.2% fall in December.
Compared to a month earlier, retail sales in January fell 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis for the third straight month of declines. But the pace of decline was slower than in the previous two months. 
""We think consumer spending will only fall around 1% quarter-on-quarter this quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.

""We expect it to rise fairly strongly over the coming quarters as the recovery resumes and is soon given a shot in the arm by vaccines,"" he added.
 
"
777,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 07:18PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- Japanese factories increased output in January for the first time in three months, signaling the country’s economic recovery is continuing despite a renewed state of emergency to contain the coronavirus.
Industrial production rose 4.2% from the previous month, the trade ministry reported Friday. Economists had projected a 3.8% gain amid rising exports, especially to China.
Separate figures showed retail sales fell 0.5% in January from a month earlier and continued falls in consumer prices in Tokyo.
While the drop in retail spending was smaller than during an wider-ranging emergency last year and economists’ forecasts, it still underscored a split in the recovery between domestic and export-driven sectors.

The current account surplus in Latin America's second-biggest economy was $26.6 billion last year, after a deficit of $4.2 billion during 2019, the bank said.
The surplus represented 2.4% of annual gross domestic product (GDP), and the largest since 1983, the bank said.
During the fourth quarter, the surplus was $17.4 billion, equivalent to 5.8% of GDP over the period.
Data published by the bank showed Mexico had posted an annual current account deficit every year since 2006, the latest one for which figures are available in its online data base.

Preliminary figures published last month by the national statistics office showed that Mexico's exports fell by 9.3% last year, while imports tumbled by 15.8%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week amid falling COVID-19 infections, but the near-term outlook for the labor market is unclear after winter storms wreaked havoc in the South region in the middle of this month.
Still, the decline in claims to a three-month low reported by the Labor Department on Thursday suggested the labor market was slowly regaining traction, catching up with the broader economy, after hitting a pothole in late 2020. Other data showed a solid increase in demand for U.S.-manufactured goods in January. 
The reports followed on the heels of news last week that retail sales increased by the most in seven months in January.
The brightening economic picture reflects nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December and the reopening of many services businesses as the winter coronavirus wave recedes. It was unlikely to derail President Joe Biden's massive $1.9 trillion recovery plan under consideration in the U.S. Congress.
""The data underscore the big boost to growth already evident from last December's stimulus,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Momentum on the next stimulus bill may be too powerful to stop ... some of the spending is needed despite the economy's strength.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 111,000 to a seasonally adjusted 730,000 for the week ended Feb. 20, the lowest level since November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 838,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims decreased 131,734 to 710,313 last week. There was a sharp decline in filings in Ohio, which had been plagued by fraudulent applications. Claims also fell in California.
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/oakverynepr/joblessclaims.png
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week. 
Though claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million last March when the pandemic hit the United States' shores, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, underscoring the damage caused by the virus. 
In the coming week, claims could be boosted by the stormy weather in the densely populated South, which left large parts of Texas in the dark and without water for days. Unadjusted claims for Texas fell last week, likely as power outages prevented the filing and processing of applications.
""We would not be surprised to see a rise in claims next week as a result of the weather-related backup, but expect claims to begin trending lower more definitively over the course of March,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM
The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic. Employment is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024. Millions of Americans are experiencing long spells of joblessness.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 101,000 to 4.419 million during the week ended Feb 13. But that was mainly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
At least 5.066 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended Feb. 6, an increase of 1.0 million from the prior period. These benefits, which are funded by the government, will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration's relief package. 
About 19.043 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs in early February. But there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the labor market. 
Daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have dropped to levels last seen before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, while the pace of vaccination is picking up. 
The improving public health situation helped to boost retail sales in January. Households perceptions of the labor market also improved in February, setting the wheels in motion for stronger economic growth this quarter. 
A separate report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% in January after surging 1.5% in December.
These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 8.3% year-on-year in January, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, accelerated 2.1% after increasing 1.0% in December.

""While there is still plenty we don't know about activity in the first quarter as a whole, we think that real growth in equipment spending will be strong,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Economists last week boosted their first-quarter GDP growth estimates to as high as a 6% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace following the blowout retail sales data and indications that the White House's massive stimulus package could be fully approved.

The economy grew at a 4.1% rate last quarter, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth on Thursday. That was a slight upward revision from the 4.0% pace reported in January and a sharp deceleration from a record 33.4% rate in the third quarter. 
 
"
780,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>","New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased for a ninth straight month in January, pointing to continued strength in business spending on equipment early in the first quarter, though the pace of growth is slowing.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 1.5% in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.7%.
Orders surged 8.3% year-on-year in January, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
With many Americans remaining at home, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted demand to household goods like electronics from services such as airline travel and hotel accommodation. But with more people expected to have access to the coronavirus vaccines by summer, demand for goods is seen slowing.
Still capital expenditure is seen supported by additional relief money from the government to aid the economy's recovery from the pandemic. Business investment on equipment scored double-digit growth in each of the last two quarters.
In January, core capital goods orders were supported by demand for primary and fabricated metal products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. But orders for machinery and computers and electronic products fell.
Shipments of core capital goods accelerated 2.1% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. They increased 1.0% in December.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, vaulted 3.4% in January after rising 1.2% in December. Durable goods orders were boosted by a 7.8% surge in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.1% gain in December.
Orders for civilian aircraft soared 389.9%. That was despite Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting on its website that it had received only four aircraft orders in January, down from 90 in December.
The government recently lifted a 20-month grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets that came after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia

Investing.com -- The new year wave of layoffs in the U.S. economy appeared to ease off last week, as the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell to its lowest in nearly three months. 
However, there was no clear improvement in the underlying trend, as the total number of people claiming various sorts of unemployment benefits rose by some 700,000 to 19.04 million. The rise was overwhelmingly due to one million more people claiming under the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation scheme.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 730,000 last week, while the previous week's figure was also revised down by 20,000 to 841,000. Analysts had expected a figure of 838,000 before the release.
The number of continuing claims for benefits, which are reported at a one-week lag to initial claims, fell by 101,000 from an upwardly-revised 4.52 million.
The numbers shed further light on Federal Reserve Jerome Powell's relatively downbeat assessment of the state of the labor market in two days of testimony before Congress this week. Powell had stressed that the U.S. still has 10 million fewer jobs than a year ago, just before the pandemic exploded in the U.S. He noted that the actual rate of unemployment is closer to 10% than the official rate of 6.3%, which takes no account of all those who have dropped out of the workforce over the last year.
""There's a lot of slack in the labor market and a long way to go until we get to full employment,"" Powell told the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. 
Such a high degree of slack in the labor market was seen by analysts as the chief reason for Powell's insistence that the Fed shouldn't tighten its monetary policy, either by raising interest rates or by reducing its monthly bond purchases, any time soon.
Powell's comments have set the tone for financial markets this week, causing the dollar to fall to its lowest in three months. Ten-Year U.S. Treasury yields, however, have risen to their highest in a year. They retraced slightly after the numbers to trade at 1.45%, down one basis point from before the release.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that the surge in demand for durable goods continued into 2021, with a 3.4% rise in January, their biggest jump in five months. 
At the same time, revised data for fourth-quarter economic growth were revised up by 0.1% to 4.1% from an initial estimate of 4.2%."
782,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer morale brightened more than expected heading into March as shoppers in Europe's largest economy became more upbeat that a lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic could be eased soon, a survey showed on Thursday.
The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, improved to -12.9 points from a revised -15.5 in February.
The reading marked the first monthly increase since October and beat a Reuters forecast for -14.3.
The infection rate in Germany fell steadily in the first weeks of the year but has stagnated in recent days, and worries over more transmissible variants of the virus persist, making it more difficult for leaders to ease restrictions.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are expected to meet on March 3 to discuss a gradual easing of lockdown measures that are currently in place until at least March 7.
Restaurants, bars and entertainment venues have been shut since early November. A stricter lockdown from mid-December forced non-essential shops, services and schools to close. Factories and offices have remained open.
GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said consumer morale had somewhat recovered from the shock suffered following the decision to tighten lockdown measures in mid-December.
""The recent dip in infection rates and the launch of the vaccination program are fuelling hopes of a speedy easing of measures,"" Buerkl added.
But a sustained recovery in consumer sentiment will only be on the cards if lockdown measures are really lifted, allowing shops, hotels and restaurants to open again, he said.
If the measures are extended beyond March 7, the chances of a rapid recovery will diminish, and difficult times will continue to lie ahead for consumers, Buerkl said. 
The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.

The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased more than expected in January, boosted by historically low mortgage rates and an acute shortage of previously owned houses on the market.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday suggested the housing market would continue to underpin the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession. Momentum could, however, ebb in the near term after winter storms wreaked havoc this month in Texas and large parts of the South region. 
Higher house prices because of the tight inventory resulting from lack of land and very expensive lumber could push homeownership out of the reach of many first-time buyers. 
""There is an insatiable demand for homes right now, and it can't be met by resales of existing homes, so people are signing contracts for new homes,"" said Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet. 
New home sales rose 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 923,000 units last month. December's sales pace was revised higher to 885,000 units from the previously reported 842,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 12.1% of U.S. home sales, climbing 2.1% to a rate of 855,000 units in January.
Graphic: New home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xegvbwbbdpq/nhs.png
The median new house price increased 5.3% from a year earlier to $346,400 in January. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. New home sales surged 19.3% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
Sales increased in the South, Midwest and West, but declined in the Northeast. They were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 6% of transactions last month. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index outperforming the broader market. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

SUPPLY TIGHT
The National Association of Realtors reported last week that the supply of previously owned homes available for sale plunged to a record low in January. That has pushed buyers toward the market for new homes. Demand for housing is being driven by Americans seeking more space for home offices and schooling as the year-long coronavirus pandemic drags on.
Though mortgage rates have risen in recent weeks in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields as investors anticipate stronger economic growth and higher inflation, the 30-year fixed rate remains well below 3%.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home decreased 12% last week from a week earlier. Mortgage loan applications were 7% higher compared to the same period last year. 
Economists believed the week-to-week decline in applications reflected disruptions caused by the snow storms, which left large swathes of Texas in the dark and without water supplies.
""We would expect a bounce-back over the next few weeks as activity resumes,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Housing sector activity should continue to be supportive of GDP growth at least through the first half of 2021.""
Housing and manufacturing have outperformed other sectors of the economy during the pandemic. The government reported last week that building permits soared in January to their highest level since May 2006. But expensive inputs and lack of land pose a threat to continued robust housing market gains. 
According to a survey of single-family homebuilders this month, record-high lumber prices were ""adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a new home and causing some builders to abruptly halt projects."" Softwood lumber prices jumped by historic 73% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
There were 307,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 299,000 in December. At January's sales pace it would take 4.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.1 months in December. About 72.4% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

""Strong demand, a shortage of supply and rapidly rising prices is the perfect combination of factors that should convince builders that now remains a really good time to get the shovels in the ground,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's record public debt pile rose further above 5 trillion reais in January, while rock-bottom interest rates continued to anchor the cost of servicing it near all-time lows, data showed on Wednesday.
Total federal debt rose 1% in January to 5.06 trillion reais ($932 billion), while the total domestic debt stock rose 1.2% to 4.82 trillion reais, Treasury said.
It said its liquidity cushion, essentially an emergency cash buffer, fell 8.6% in nominal terms from the previous month to 805.7 billion reais. 
""It should be noted that this indicator may change significantly over the coming months, especially those with high volumes of debt maturing,"" Treasury said.
According to Treasury figures, 605 billion reais of domestic federal debt comes due in the first four months of this year, with 283 billion needing to be rolled over in April alone, the most ever for a single month.
February has seen a recovery in global markets and improving risk sentiment toward emerging countries. But growing concerns about Brazil's fiscal trajectory and reform agenda continue to sour sentiment toward it and push up longer-term rates, it added.
The average rate of interest on the domestic federal debt stock fell to a new low of 7.15% from 7.3%, but the average rate on new domestic debt issued in the 12 months to January inched up to 4.65% from a record low of 4.44%.
Treasury said that the average maturity on the domestic debt stock in January edged up to 3.41 years from a record low 3.39 in December, and the average on the overall federal debt stock rose to 3.61 years from 3.59.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's current account deficit in the year to January as a share of the overall economy shrank to its smallest in 13 years, official figures showed on Wednesday, thanks mainly to a decline in the primary income and services deficits in the month.
The current account deficit of 0.65% of gross domestic product in the 12 months to January was down from 0.87% the previous month and the smallest since February, 2008, central bank figures showed. 
Graphic: Brazil current account % of GDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmwqxkvr/CADEF.png
A combination of an exchange rate depreciation of more than 30% in the year to January and a shrinking trade deficit driven largely by a steep fall in imports over the last year has helped deliver Brazil's more favorable balance of payments position.
Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Washington-based Institute for International Finance, says the real at current levels of around 5.40 per dollar is undervalued, and the ""modest"" current account deficit and ""solid"" capital inflows point to fair value around 4.50 per dollar.
Brazil's current account deficit in the month of January was $7.25 billion, the second deficit in a row and slightly less than the $7.75 billion shortfall forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
It was significantly smaller than the $10.3 billion deficit from the same month last year, as the trade deficit shrank to $1.9 billion from $2.5 billion. The services deficit shrank almost 60% to $1.0 billion, the smallest in 12 years.
Foreign direct investment in January totaled $1.8 billion, the central bank said, less than the $2.8 billion forecast in a Reuters poll.
Based on partial data so far for February, the central bank expects FDI to total $6.5 billion this month and a current account deficit of $2.3 billion this month.

Net portfolio investments into Brazil totaled $6.2 billion in January, the eighth consecutive month of inflows, the central bank said. Of that, $4.7 billion went into stocks, and $1.5 billion in debt securities.

A breakdown of the data published by the agency known as INEGI showed that fuels and certain fruits and vegetables helped to push up prices in early February.
The Mexican central bank, which targets a rate of 3%, earlier this month cut its benchmark lending rate for the first time since September, flagging uncertainty over the economic outlook and global efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil rose in February for the first time in five months, a survey indicated on Wednesday, lifted by the start of a nationwide vaccination program against COVID-19 and prospects of the government resuming emergency income transfers to the poor.
The rise was most pronounced among consumers in the lowest income bracket, although the overall level of confidence was still below that registered at the end of last year, the Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) findings showed.
""The start of the immunization campaign against COVID-19 and the possibility of extending emergency aid seem to have reduced consumer gloom in February,"" said FGV research manager Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
""Confidence levels, however, remain low and sustaining an upward trend will depend on factors such as the speed of vaccination, the evolution of the pandemic and, mainly, the recovery of the labor market,"" she said.
FGV's consumer confidence index rose 2.2 points to 78.0 points in February. That was still below December's 78.5.
Confidence among those in the lowest income bracket earning up to 2,100 reais ($385) a month, who will benefit from the renewed cash transfer program likely to be rolled out soon, rose 5.8 points to 75.3.

DIW said a surge in coronavirus cases was constraining economic growth but that the pandemic's impact was less severe than in last spring when production facilities came to a standstill.
""Above all, industry has come through the winter robustly so far,"" said DIW forecaster Claus Michelsen.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong exports and solid construction activity helped the German economy to grow by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, but stricter lockdown measures at home and abroad are clouding the outlook for Europe's largest economy.
The data, published by the Federal Statistics Office on Wednesday, marked an upward revision to its earlier estimate for a 0.1% expansion over the previous quarter.
The office also revised upward its 2020 full-year GDP figure to -4.9% from -5.0%.
Adjusted for calendar effects, the German economy shrank by 5.3% last year, a much smaller contraction than in many other European countries, helped by a strong fiscal response to the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A debt-financed fiscal splurge created an overall state budget deficit of 139.6 billion euros or 4.2% of gross domestic product in 2020, the office said. This was the first deficit since 2011 and the second-highest since German reunification.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the growth data sent a positive signal, adding: ""We will continue to do everything we can in the coming months to maintain the substance of our economy.""
Germany had registered record growth of 8.5% in the third quarter and an unprecedented plunge of 9.7% in the second, due to the effects of its first coronavirus lockdown.
The second lockdown, imposed at the beginning of November in hospitality venues and expanded in mid-December to include most shops and services, caused a plunge in household spending in the fourth quarter, the office said.
DEMAND FROM CHINA
Disposable income rose slightly, however, thanks to job protection schemes and state aid for parents. As the lockdown prevented many consumers from spending, the savings rate was an unusually high 15.7%.
Household spending fell 3.3% in the quarter and construction spending rose 1.8%. Exports grew 4.5%.
This meant net trade contributed 0.6 percentage points to the overall growth rate, whereas sluggish domestic activity subtracted 0.3 percentage points, the office said.
Thomas Gitzel from VP Bank said export-oriented manufacturers benefited from growing orders from China while low interest rates helped the construction industry.
But the outlook remains clouded as German authorities have extended the stricter lockdown until at least March 7, while restrictions in other countries are weakening demand from abroad.
""Going forward, we stick to our forecast of a 1.5% q/q decline in the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to the negative effects on overall economic activity from the extended and tightened lockdown,"" UniCredit said in a research note.
Carsten Brzeski from ING said that stricter lockdown measures since mid-December, weaker demand from other euro zone countries, harsh winter weather in February and a reversal of pre-Brexit hoarding in the UK had increased the downside risk for the first quarter of 2021.

""The growth drivers of the fourth quarter could easily become drags in the first,"" Brzeski cautioned.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence increased in February, with households slightly more upbeat about the labor market amid declining new COVID-19 infections and expectations for additional money from the government to help the economy's recovery from the pandemic. 
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers warming up to overseas vacations, though fewer intended to purchase homes, automobiles and other big-ticket items over the next six months. Consumers anticipated higher inflation as well. This fits in with economists' predictions that demand will swing back to services from goods by summer as more Americans get vaccinated, and boost price pressures.
There are concerns in some quarters that very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy will ignite inflation this year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has played down these fears, citing three decades of lower and stable inflation. 
On Tuesday, Powell told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank would keep interest rates low and continue to pump money into the economy through bond purchases ""at least at the current pace until we make substantial further progress towards our goals ... which we have not really been making.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 91.3 this month from 88.9 in January. Confidence remains well below its lofty reading of 132.6 last February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index nudging up to a reading of 90. The cut-off date for the survey was Feb. 11 and did not fully capture the winter storm, which knocked out electric power in Texas, or the easing of dining restrictions in New York city.
""With additional fiscal relief coming and better progress on the vaccination front, sentiment should rise further,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""As we approach herd immunity, pent-up demand will be released.""
COVID-19 cases in the United States have declined for the sixth consecutive week, with daily cases and hospitalizations falling to the lowest level since before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The pace of vaccination is also picking up.
Health experts have warned, however, that coronavirus variants initially discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil could unleash another wave that threatens to reverse the recent positive trends. The virus has claimed more than 500,000 lives in the U.S. just over a year since the pandemic hit the nation. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan from the pandemic is gaining traction in the U.S. Congress.

CAUTION LINGERS
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, rebounded to a reading of 92.0 after declining for three straight months, indicating a pick-up in economic growth was underway. Retail sales surged in January, prompting economists to boost their first-quarter growth estimates to as high as a 6% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace.
Still, consumers remain cautious. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions slipped to 90.8 from a reading of 91.2 in January.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rose to a reading of 0.7 this month from -2.5 in January. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and raised hopes for steady job growth this month.
The economy created only 49,000 jobs in January after shedding 227,000 jobs in December, the first decline in payrolls in eight months. About 12.3 million jobs of the 22.2 million lost during the pandemic have been recovered. 
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income dipped to 15.2% from 15.8% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop fell to 13.2% from 15.5% in January.
There was an uptick in the share of consumers planning to go on vacation over the next six months, but mostly overseas. Fewer consumers expected to purchase homes, motor vehicles and major household appliances. Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months shot up to 6.3% from 6% in January.
""We believe the change in expectations reflects a real sense that consumers are facing higher inflation rates than appear to be being captured in the CPI,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
The moderation in house-buying intentions likely points to a slowdown in sales, which have been powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. Higher prices amid tight supply could also slow home sales. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index soared 10.1% in December from a year ago, the largest gain since April 2014, after increasing 9.2% in November.

Robust house price inflation was confirmed by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index jumped 11.4% year-on-year in December after rising 11.1% in November. Prices accelerated 10.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, double the 5.4% logged in the same period in 2019.

The unemployment rate was 1.86% in the October-December quarter, representing 730,000 workers without jobs, agency data showed, down from 1.90% in the September quarter. The rate hit an 11-year high of 1.95% in the June quarter.
""Employment increased slightly, while the unemployment rate remained high and working hours were still lower than pre-crisis levels,"" Danucha Pichayanan, head of the National Economic and Social Development Council, told a briefing.
The number of workers in Thailand's economy rose to 38.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year from 37.9 million in the previous quarter and from 37.5 million in the final quarter of 2019.
The increase took place mainly in farming, which benefited from higher crop prices and government projects.
But the jobless rate jumped to 1.69% last year, the highest level in at least 16 years, from 0.98% in 2019, as Southeast Asia's second-largest economy suffered its worst contraction in over two decades in 2020 as tourism slumped.
After managing to get its first coronavirus outbreak under control within a few months last year, Thailand is now dealing with a second wave that has slowed economic activity.
The latest coronavirus wave would hit businesses that had not yet recovered from the first outbreak, risking job cuts, Danucha said.
""If the virus cannot be controlled, combined with delays in the distribution of vaccines, the impact on the labour market and employment will be severe in the long run,"" he said.

Thailand will start vaccinating priority groups, including health workers, against COVID-19 later this week, with the country's first coronavirus vaccines due to arrive on Wednesday.

792,"<span>Feb 23, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales fell in the year to February as stores cut jobs at a rapid rate, with only supermarkets reporting any growth during the latest COVID-19 lockdown, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of retail sales stood at -45, up only slightly from January's eight-month low of -50. The measure points to falling sales and is below the consensus forecast of -38 in a Reuters poll of economists.
Retailers' expectations for March - when non-essential shops will remain closed to the public as part of lockdown measures - fell to -62, the lowest since the series began in 1983.
In another sign of a changing consumer habits during lockdown, the survey's gauge of internet retail sales hit a new record high.
""With lockdown measures still in place, trading conditions remain extremely difficult for retailers,"" said Ben Jones, principal economist at the CBI.
""Record growth in internet shopping suggests that retailers' investments in on-line platforms and click-and-collect services may be paying off, but the re-opening of the sector can't come soon enough to protect jobs and breathe life back into the sector.""

Job losses among retailers accelerated according to a quarterly question in the survey. For the distribution sector as a whole, which includes wholesalers and car dealers, employment fell at a record rate, the CBI survey showed.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed earlier estimates that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% month-on-month for a 0.9% year-on-year increase, as expected by economists.
Volatile energy prices were 3.8% higher on the month but still 4.2% lower than a year earlier and unprocessed food was 1.2% more expensive on the month and 2.0% year-on-year.
Without these two volatile components, consumer prices fell 0.3% against December and were 1.4% higher than in January 2020.
An even narrower measure excluding also alcohol and tobacco prices, that often change because of excise tax changes, fell 0.5% month-on-month in January and rose 1.4% in annual terms.
Eurostat said services, which make up two thirds of the euro zone economy, added 0.65 percentage points to the final annual inflation result and non-energy industrial goods added another 0.37 point, offsetting a 0.41 point subtraction from cheap energy.
Food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.3 point, Eurostat said.

The January rebound brings inflation, which has been negative for months, a bit closer to the European Central Bank's target of below, but close to 2% over the medium term.

Statistics South Africa said the unemployment rate stood at 32.5% in the October-December quarter, meaning 7.2 million people were unemployed, up from 30.8% in the previous three months.
The figure was the highest since the survey began in 2008.
""We are seeing that the proportion of people of working age, versus the proportion of those that are employed, is widening, meaning the market is not creating sufficient jobs to absorb enough (people),"" Statistician General Risenga Maluleke told a news conference.
South Africa, which has the continent's highest rate of COVID-19 infections, was in recession before it recorded its first coronavirus infection in March and has long suffered from extremely high levels of unemployment.
According to an expanded definition of unemployment that includes those discouraged from seeking work, 42.6% of the labour force was without work in the fourth quarter, amounting to 11.1 million people, Stats SA data showed.

Compared to a year ago, total employment fell by 1.4 million people, while the number of people who were not economically active rose by 1.5 million, the agency said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the last three months of 2020, its highest in nearly five years but still lower than it would have been without a huge coronavirus jobs support scheme that finance minister Rishi Sunak looks set to extend next week.
Separate data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of employees on company payrolls in January rose by 83,000 from December, the second monthly increase and its biggest since January 2015.
The jobless rate - the highest since the first three months of 2016 - was in line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Unemployment has been suppressed by the government's Job Retention Scheme which is supporting about one in five employees. 
The programme is Britain's most expensive COVID economic support measure and will cost an estimated 70 billion pounds ($98 billion) by its scheduled expiry date of April 30.
But figures based on tax data show the number of employees on business payrolls has still fallen by 726,000 since February 2020 - equivalent to just over 2% of the workforce - with the majority of job losses suffered by workers aged under 25.
The Bank of England has said it thinks the unemployment rate will jump to almost 8% in mid-2021 after the furlough scheme ends.
Sunak is expected to announce an extension of his jobs support, at least for sectors hardest hit by the government's lockdowns, in a March 3 budget statement.
""At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we’ll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery,"" Sunak said after Tuesday's data.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his plan for easing England's lockdown on Monday that would keep some businesses shut until the summer but allow a gradual, earlier reopening for others.
""The outlook for the UK economy is getting clearer and with continued support from the Treasury, it is likely the Bank of England's peak unemployment forecast of 7.75% will prove too pessimistic,"" Jon Hudson (NYSE:HUD), a fund manager at Premier Miton, said.
Samuel Tombs, at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought the jobless rate would hit 6% in the summer.
The ONS said the number of job vacancies in the three months to January was 26% lower than a year ago, a less severe fall than last summer when vacancies were down by nearly 60%, although the pace of improvement slowed in the past few months.
Pay growth was the strongest since 2008. Total pay including bonuses rose by 4.7% in the October-December period compared with the same three months of 2019.
The pick-up in pay growth in part reflects how the brunt of job losses has fallen on people working in lower-paid jobs in areas such as hospitality, and the ONS said pay growth was likely to be below 3% if this effect is stripped out. 
Britain went into a new COVID lockdown on Jan. 5 due to a rapidly rising death toll that has passed 120,000, the highest in Europe.

796,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 11:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China grew at a faster pace in January, driven by red-hot demand in the country's mega cities despite several rounds of government cooling measures, raising the challenge for policymakers as they try to curb financial risks.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities increased 0.3% in January from a month earlier, the fastest growth since September, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. That compared with an uptick of 0.1% in December.
On a year-on-year basis, new home prices rose 3.9%, quickening from a 3.8% gain in December.
As China's economy rebounds from the COVID-19 shock, authorities have stepped up curbs on the property sector to safeguard against financial risks as concerns grow of a speculative bubble in some parts of the market.
The NBS data showed 53 cities reported monthly growth, with the number rising from 42 in December.
The relentless upward price pressure was again mainly driven by bigger cities. New home prices growth in tier-1 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, quickened 0.6% from the previous month, while second-hand home prices posted a sharper gain of 1.3%, with growth in both sectors outpacing lower-tier cities. 
The price uptick at the beginning of the year can be mainly attributed to the record volume of credit issued in January, said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with property agency Centaline.
""The flows of business loans, which enjoy a huge interest rate spread with the normal mortgages, into the property sector, have particularly fuelled the upward pressure in top-tier cities.""
Central bank data showed China's new bank loans leapt to new highs in January boosted by seasonal demand, with household loans, mostly mortgages, more than double the level seen in December.
China's property market recovered quickly from the COVID-19 crisis last year, mostly in bigger cities. But the rebound has raised concerns about financial risks and policymakers have since then tightened screws on the funnelling of funds into the sector.
Last month saw major cities including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing unveiling tighter regulations to close loopholes in home transactions and contain illegal flows of funds into the sector. These steps came on top of a slew of measures it took last year.
Mortgage rates have also climbed recently.

""We should stay alert to the resurgence of house price rises or market speculation, especially if the coronavirus epidemic is effectively controlled and the economy stages a solid rebound,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale rose far more than expected in February, bouncing back from a 6-month low in January thanks to a brighter industrial outlook and well-stocked order books, the Ifo economic institute said on Monday.
Ifo said its business climate index increased to 92.4 from an upwardly revised 90.3 in January, hitting its highest level since October and surpassing even the strongest forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""The German economy is looking towards recovery again,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
Germany, once a role model for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, has struggled with the second wave. A month ago this still weighed heavily on sentiment.
But Wohlrabe said companies have now revised up production plans significantly and export expectations for industry have also risen.
""The order books are well filled,"" he added.
An Ifo expectations index surged to 94.2 from 91.5 in January, surpassing all forecasts in the Reuters poll. A current conditions index edged up to 90.6 from 89.2.
""Companies are sniffing the spring air and starting to look beyond the pandemic,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer.
Kraemer expected a strong recovery from spring onwards, ""especially as consumers' corona(virus) savings amount to six percent of their annual disposable income at the end of 2020.""
The main risk to this scenario was a third wave of coronavirus infections and a blanket lockdown extension to end-April, to which he gave a 25% probability.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers have agreed to extend restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus until March 7. She told a party meeting that she wants a staggered plan to lift restrictions, according to two participants.
The number of new daily infections has stagnated over the past week with the seven-day incidence rate hovering at around 60 cases per 100,000. On Monday, Germany reported 4,369 new infections and 62 further deaths.
Other sentiment indicators have also been promising.
Investor morale in Germany surged in February on expectations consumption will take off in the coming months, the ZEW economic research institute said last Tuesday.
Earlier this month, industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) raised its full-year outlook for the first time in nearly four years, and CEO Martina Merz said ""we're noticing signs of an economic recovery"".

The government last month slashed its GDP growth forecast to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%. This means the economy probably will probably not reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.

That is the lowest since September, but is still high by historical standards. December was the highest level of confidence in over a decade.

But the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and two months since the end of the government's emergency cash transfer program during which millions of people have seen their incomes collapse, have put the economy under huge strain.
""The fall in industrial confidence is driven by the decrease in satisfaction with current conditions, but mainly due to the worsening of expectations regarding the next few months,"" FGV said in a press release.

The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said 56% of businesses planned to increase staff numbers in the coming months, up from 53% in late 2020 but below the 66% planning to hire staff a year ago before the pandemic.
The proportion of firms planning redundancies dropped sharply to 20% from 30% in the last quarter.
However the CIPD said unemployment was likely to rise sharply if finance minister Rishi Sunak does not extend jobs support for businesses at his March 3 budget.
""It is far too soon to rule out further significant private sector redundancies later in the year if the government does not extend the furlough scheme to the end of June or if the economy suffers any additional unexpected shocks,"" said Gerwyn Davies, a senior labour market advisor to the CIPD.
A costly furlough programme that is supporting around one in five private-sector employees during the current lockdown is due to end on April 30.
The British Chambers of Commerce warned last week that one in four of its members planned to make job cuts if the support ended while they were still feeling the impact of the pandemic.
The CIPD said hiring plans were strongest in healthcare, finance, education and IT, and weakest in the hospitality sector which is bearing the brunt of the current lockdown.

The survey, run jointly with recruiters  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN), covered 2,000 employers between Jan. 5 and Jan. 30.
